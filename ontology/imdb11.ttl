	schema:headline " An Innocent Tender Movie From The Mid '50s";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow this was stunning both in photography and in content. Here's a nice oldfashioned religious story you rarely see anymore. The English title goes under The Miracle Of Marcelino. It's a simple tale of a group of monks who discover a baby at their monastery doorstep one morning and then raise the boy. They try to find suitable parents for the infant but are unsuccessful. The infant scenes don't run too long because before you know it they have fastforwarded it to when the boy was six years of age....and that's where he stays until the end of the film.Pablito Calvo as the title character Marcelino is excellent. Kudos to cinematographer Heinrich Gartner for beautiful blackandwhite photography. The DVD transfer was outstanding too. The lighting particularly on faces is terrific.Other reviewers here at IMDb such as Albert Sanchez Moreno have described the story nicely. I will just add I found it oddly captivating the entire way and very touching and moving in the last 20 minutes or so after the boy discovers the big statue of Christ and begins communicating with Him. Yeah I'm sure it looks really farfetched to almost everyone especially nonBelievers but I enjoyed and marveled at the end of this film. I'm not quite sure what to make of the monks in here and why they would warn the young boy against going up in the attic where the statue is located unless they somehow supernaturally knew what was going to happen.....yet they still should have put their trust in Christ anyway. Their actions are puzzling at times. There is a real mystery to this story overall anyway. Not being Catholic maybe I missed something in the translation. This is a very Catholic film but a Christbelieving Protestant as I am can still fully appreciate this story too as much as anyone and I did.You'll never find this at a rental store but those you are curious you might want to add it to your queue if you belong to one of those mailin rental programs. This film was a collaboration of Spanish and Italian filmmakers I think. There was a color remake in the early '90s but I haven't seen it.It's a film of tender innocence like few I've ever seen which makes it very memorable.".

With understanding this film helps the viewer to grow a little in faith hope and love.... well that is all I really wanted to say but IMDb now requires ten lines of text for a review. I noticed the early reviews of Marcelino were extremely negative. If you have a lot of anger towards Christ or the Church you will not like this film since it shows different types of people turning their hearts towards Jesus to varying degrees. This is not sinister propaganda but the way the world really is. Christians are not the monsters you imagine them to be.

No matter how great a film may be there is almost always someone who will post inane comments about the movie that makes me shake my head in wonder This is a small masterpiece a little gem with a surprising outcome that I thought about for days after seeing the film. They remade the film in 1992 with an older too Hollywoodish child actor.. The child in the earlier version gives a one of a kind performance. A six year old actor playing a six year old kid how the director got such a moving performance from someone that young is a wonder. His voice was dubbed so I initially thought it was the actor doing the voiceover who was playing the part so well. Then I saw the film in Spanish  I speak the language the dubbing doesn't do justice to the original performance.You will not find the movie at Blockbuster so you have to buy the DVD. They issued two versions last year first a digitally remastered copy THAN a version that was not computer enhanced. I know it is confusing. I love this little movie I have already sent a copy to my granddaughter in Florida who was weaned on 70's films with Technicolor Dolby and all that stuff. I expect a call in the next few days asking how I found this great movie".

His voice was dubbed so I initially thought it was the actor doing the voiceover who was playing the part so well. Then I saw the film in Spanish  I speak the language the dubbing doesn't do justice to the original performance.You will not find the movie at Blockbuster so you have to buy the DVD. They issued two versions last year first a digitally remastered copy THAN a version that was not computer enhanced. I know it is confusing. I love this little movie I have already sent a copy to my granddaughter in Florida who was weaned on 70's films with Technicolor Dolby and all that stuff. I expect a call in the next few days asking how I found this great movie";

The movie was so popular that my grandfather who was a barber would give me and countless little Italian boys the Marcellino haircut..that is front comb and bangs. I've seen photos of me many times but only now remembered the reason for my hairstyle.

After all these years the crucifix of Jesus coming to life has been a memory I have never forgotten. The film was handled beautifully although the ending was a bit unexpected.

Back in 1958 my parents and I were living in Rome Italymy dad was stationed at the American Embassy. I was about 8 years old. My mother saw an ad in the American newspaper looking for Englishspeaking voices to dub in the dialog in Europeanmade movies slated for export. We went to the famous Cinecitta' studios I auditioned and got the job. Marcellino was the second or third movie I did. From what I recall it took a couple of days to do and I was only allowed to see the scenes that I actually had lines in and they weren't many when you come right down to it. I stood on a platform before a lectern in a very large studio facing a screen and microphone. I had to stand on a box to reach the microphone and read the script. I got a lot of coaching and we did dozens of takes. I don't know if they ever used the work I did but I was there and I got paidor my mother received the money. I only saw the movie once with the English dubbing just a few years agonever saw it in school and never really mentioned it to anybody because I thought no one would believe me or be interested. I just purchased the DVD but it's only Spanish with English subtitles. Does anyone know where I can get the English dubbed version?".

The internet was not much help either then last week lo and behold I found a DVD in Parklea Market Sydney Australia sort of organised flea market And it was selling for 5 Australian dollars perhaps 2.5 Euros.

I have to be honest here too. I found the movie rather rusty in the light of the ever growing technology in this field and I don't agree that the music is beautiful it's markedly aged and I don't think I'd like a sound system with this quality. But what a reunion I had almost given up any hope to see it again. I think My parents took me to watch it in Paris. They were non religious as I am now. They only love it for it's beauty and artistic value. I'm pretty sure if you're reading this you've read other entry and you already know the story so I won't go into it. I just hope you'll give it a chance in your lounge room I think the reward will be greatmm Feb. 2006. I had to come back to this movie and read more commentaries since I was here. I felt saddened by some expressing some kind of paranoia or just pure negativism. One entry asked us to take off our rosy glasses to watch this movie... For one I wish I could find my 'rosy' glasses again as the world I see today needs badly to be seen through such device or we'll soon run out of Prozac. Then people wear all kind of glasses with all kind of colours and so see things accordingly that is not to say that other should join in. I wander what colour of glasses Mother Theresa l'abbe Pierre or the like of them wore to achieve what they did. I see Marcelino Bread and Wine as a simpletouching and beautiful story despite not having entering a church for decades.

	schema:reviewBody "During a time of war in Spain an orphaned infant is left at the door of a monastery. The monks are charged with finding a permanent home for him but because they want to keep him they don't try very hard. Finally they reject the mayor's demand that he be given the boyeven when the mayor threatens to evict the monksand so they wind up raising him calling him Marcelino. He grows into a rambunctious but likable lad who wonders why he doesn't have a mother like his village buddy Manuel. Though he's been forbidden from wandering up to the monastery attic one day he does there he finds a lifesized damaged wooden crucifix. At first Marcelino is scared of it but soon he begins talking to Jesus going so far as to being bread and wine to the figure on the cross because he looks hungry. Suddenly we see from a vantage point behind the crucifix the wooden arm of Jesus become human taking the food and drink from the boy. The two share meals and chat and when Marcelino tells Jesus that his fondest wish is to be reunited with his mother Jesus makes it happen.SPOILER Most reviewers of this film especially ones of the Catholic persuasion like it and find it heartwarming. As a former Catholic I do have a soft spot for mystical religious fantasies like THE BISHOP'S WIFE and even the occasional nonmystical nonfantasies GOING MY WAY. But this one though wellmade comes off like a creepy Twilight Zone episode Marcelino gets his wish because he dies. Off the top of my head and aside from versions of LITTLE WOMEN in which the doomed child is more a supporting than starring role I can only think of one other classicera movie in which a central child character dies the 1939 fantasy ON BORROWED TIME. I have to say that killing off a child whom you assume will live is an effective way to stun a viewer and it works well in ON BORROWED TIME but here it just seems unsavory.

	onyx:emotionText "During a time of war in Spain an orphaned infant is left at the door of a monastery. The monks are charged with finding a permanent home for him but because they want to keep him they don't try very hard. Finally they reject the mayor's demand that he be given the boyeven when the mayor threatens to evict the monksand so they wind up raising him calling him Marcelino. He grows into a rambunctious but likable lad who wonders why he doesn't have a mother like his village buddy Manuel. Though he's been forbidden from wandering up to the monastery attic one day he does there he finds a lifesized damaged wooden crucifix. At first Marcelino is scared of it but soon he begins talking to Jesus going so far as to being bread and wine to the figure on the cross because he looks hungry. Suddenly we see from a vantage point behind the crucifix the wooden arm of Jesus become human taking the food and drink from the boy. The two share meals and chat and when Marcelino tells Jesus that his fondest wish is to be reunited with his mother Jesus makes it happen.SPOILER Most reviewers of this film especially ones of the Catholic persuasion like it and find it heartwarming. As a former Catholic I do have a soft spot for mystical religious fantasies like THE BISHOP'S WIFE and even the occasional nonmystical nonfantasies GOING MY WAY. But this one though wellmade comes off like a creepy Twilight Zone episode Marcelino gets his wish because he dies. Off the top of my head and aside from versions of LITTLE WOMEN in which the doomed child is more a supporting than starring role I can only think of one other classicera movie in which a central child character dies the 1939 fantasy ON BORROWED TIME. I have to say that killing off a child whom you assume will live is an effective way to stun a viewer and it works well in ON BORROWED TIME but here it just seems unsavory. The boy in BORROWED seems unhappy with his life on earth but Marcelino does notJesus couldn't think of a better way to handle this kid's wish? I didn't dislike this movieindeed I would commend it for being differentbut I think the people on IMDb who call it tenderhearted or inspiring or sensible either saw a different movie or need a dictionary.";

The first time I saw it I was 8 years old and with my dad watching on an old reel to reel it was his favorite movie also as he felt connected to it because he grew up in a boarding home for fatherless boys. The sound was terrible the dubbing was way off the footage was grainy to say the least and there were a number of cracks in the reel. Despite all those imperfections I loved every second of this film. For the longest time I could remember every detail about the movie but its name. I wanted to see it again but had very little information to research. One day I described the movie to a friend this is something I always have trouble doing because I get so choked up the friend jumped up and said thats my dads favorite movie he grew up an orphan We went to her dad and he knew the name of the movie right away from there it was just a question of finding it on media other then reel to reel. The first copy I picked up was on VHS picture quality much better then the reel to reel but still bad. I was going to burn a backup copy of my VHS version on DVD but for a movie this great I will just buy the DVD version maybe the DVD will be a little better then the VHS version at least I know I will have the DVD version for a lifetime. Regardless of the quality of the picture you must see this film".

	schema:reviewBody "Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man. Rabindranath Tagore We worry about what a child will become tomorrow yet we forget that he is someone today. Stacia TauscherI have selected two quotes which at first sight have little to do with the film. However when we look deeper at this Spanish classic the 1955 winner at Cannes and Berlin festivals we are led to draw a conclusion it's a movie about a CHILD a friend of God who by being fully himself did not have to become mature in order to address adults and enrapture them with awe and beauty. The thing that has touched me most in this religious classic is its simplicity. A religious theme depicted in movies may absorb different manifestations of spirituality. You can preach something and you make others hear powerful slogans. But conveying values without love has occurred barely useful. Instead you can address hearts and you make others feel it so intensely that no additional explanations or lectures are necessary. Simplicity is something that touches various people and meanwhile something paradoxical we own it as innate and yet we lose it somewhere forgetting that this simplicity of life can constantly renew us. Where can we find it more than in such an ingenious partly naive yet touching story about a child? THE MIRACLE OF MARCELINO 1955 written by Jose Maria Sanchez Silva and directed by Ladislao Vajda is a movie of such influence. The opening sequence is marked by crowds of people who head for a town located in the picturesque landscape of Spain. One monk Fernando Rey however chooses the opposite direction in his journey because he is going to visit an ill child. This is a festival of Marcelino his feast day which makes so many people celebrate. Do you know who Marcelino was? becomes a question addressed to the child in her bed and to viewers in their seats alike. He will be our little protagonist  an orphan boy with such a sweet sounding name who was abandoned as a baby at the gate of a monastery and looked after by twelve Franciscan monks. The flashback brings us to the 19th century Spain and its unique story. Is it a legend? an adventure? a fairy tale or a miracle? As people helped brethren rebuild the monastery God helps them tackle the dilemma of what future to 'invest' for a crying baby at the gate. Although there are some people who would adopt the boy including the mayor of the town brethren know what it means to be good note the scene at a blacksmith's. They decide to keep him at the monastery as the thirteenth one among them and baptize him Marcelino. From this day on a great adventure begins for all of them an adventure filled with the supernatural awesome experience...The film beautifully handles the core idea of a child that has a spiritual power to change people around him. Many religions stress the aspect that even little children may achieve the heights of spirituality. 5 year old Marcelino Pablito Calvo is such a sympathetic protagonist because he owns all childlike characteristics. When he learns he is curious when he prays he is joyful when he plays he forgets about the world. There is a lovely scene that presents his everyday activities through a song. At the crucial moment of the film he shows no fear  he knows who is talking to him. Yet how can he be afraid of a Friend? Let me highlight one psychological aspect.Although Marcelino seems to have much fun in his everyday life there is one dream that absorbs him MOTHER. The little boy is among twelve men but he has no mum. When encountering a woman Manuel's mother he is lifted up. His eyes sparkle at once and he imagines the bliss of being in Manuel's shoes bliss of having a mother mind you the meaningful name Manuel in the course of later events. He immediately creates a friend in his mind whom he never meets. He plays with him he talks to him...as long as it occurs that there is Someone who can fill this need for true friendship in his little heart. This aspect is important since there have been many critical views that religious films barely carry any psychological development. MARCELINO proves otherwise.Fantasy blends with reality mysteries with facts and a legend with a historical background. That is also what makes this film so captivating. The scene when he climbs the 'forbidden staircase' and discovers the attic is one of the best moments in the film. Each single detail plays a role in the inner experience explains a lot near the stairs we read the excerpt from Psalm 33 Humiles Spiritu Salvabit God will save the humble of spirit the closeup of Christ's hand though considerably influenced by the cinema style of the period supplies the moment with mystery and piety. HUMOR Brethren's behaviors and Marcelino's tricks draw our attention and amuse us. One of the most hilarious moments are the missing slices of bread. Moreover the town sequence offers some moments of laughter. At the same time the artistic pluses are executed in cinematography and music. But who deserves the credit for being the best Marcelino on screen is PABLITO CALVO. He gives a powerful performance skillfully avoiding the danger of shallow sweetness. His character moves us as a saint child but still a CHILD. Note the subtlety and mystery of the scenes when Marcelino talks to Jesus. We see the boy's face marked by various feelings from surprise and a little confusion to confidence and peaceful communion.MARCELINO PAN Y VINO is one of the most beautiful religious films ever made a religious classic that you may watch with heartfelt attitude. Glorious simplicity where 'the small' equal to 'the greatest' in humanity.".

I just stumbled upon it recently and am glad I did. It's a nice little morality taleone that you really need to stick with as the ending comes as a real surprise.The film begins with the founding of a monastery. Years later a foundling is left at the front gate. The monks try to find the mother or a surrogate family but without successplus it looks as if many of the monks were so taken with the baby that they didn't try especially hard! Plus the only person willing to take the child was the cruel mayorwho obviously wanted to use the kid as cheap labor! Years pass and the little boy has remained with the monks. While he is quite mischievous the monks adore him. He's not really badjust a 6 yearold who is full of energy and silliness. What happens next you'll just have to see for yourselfI really don't want to spoil the amazing direction the film takes near the end. I will say however that it really did come as a surprise and was very sweet.Technically speaking this is a lovely film. The actors were wonderful as the monkscoming off as very kind menthe sort you'd hope would become men of God. As for little Marcelino he was simply adorable and effective in the role of this precocious child. Casting couldn't have been much better. As for the writing the story is terrific but probably not a film an avowed Atheist would enjoyafter all it's a religious tale. The cinematography is in lovely black  white and the director's touch was gentle and worked well with the story. Frankly there isn't a whole lot you could do to make this a better story so I was surprised to learn from the DVD that there is a remake. It might be very good as well but can't imagine it being any better.This one might just put a tear in your eyesweet and memorable.".

Yet it's not a sad movie. I cry because it is so beautiful that Marcelino gets what he wants and therefore has to leave this world. I still do not believe in stuff like that but it would be great if it were all true.Why do I rate this one 10 out of 10? Because it is beautiful and it sticks. I know every single thing that happens in this movie even though it has been 10 years since I've last seen this movie. Unlike some of the violent graphic movies like Pulp Fiction and Boondock Saints which are great this one is great without being violent nor graphic. True classic. Amazing.

Yes this is NOT the Jacky Chan Drunken Master and yes director Liu Chia Liang appears in that film also. Whatever the issues that lead to Liang quitting the Chan production and starting this one in defiance really doesn't make a difference since the films are radically different.This film is a farcical take on the time of the democratic revolution of Sun Yat Sen. Apparently the return to power of the Manchu emperor hinges around the possession of a Jade Ring. The Manchu's are supported by the mystical White Lotus gang which is run by a white guy who looks all of twenty years old. Anyway a princess is kidnapped by the revolutionaries so that the jade ring doesn't return to the monarchists. She is sent to the countryside to keep her hidden from a Manchu general played by Liu Chia Hui Gordon Liu. She and the guy assigned to guard her end up in a wine making factory  unwed mother home ! run by a kung fu master played by director Liu Chia Liang.The story if the description isn't clear is all over the place. The whole production while excellently photographed has a very rushed feel to it. The martial arts which in a Liang production are usually of high quality are unfortunately not very sharp. Some scenes work very well but there's little to distinguish this from other martial art films of the same time. Regardless the film is well paced and easy to watch. The comedy is not very good but also not annoying. The whole film has a cheerful feel to it like everyone was enjoying themselves. The only major problem is the abrupt ending. It seems like they ran out of money and had to stop the final fight scene. There are some strange incongruous things in the film such as the evil cult leader who looks like he was found at a martial arts tournament in an American suburb. His haircut is really bizarre.If you are not looking for the Jacky Chan film and are familiar with the lowbudget comedy kung fu film of the early 1980's this might not be a bad way to spend 90 minutes.".

Well I found that statement to be a fallacy because there aren't multiple fight scenes relatively speaking that is. There are around 3 to note but the last one is monumental. That gave the movie a 7 for me otherwise I'd give it a 2 for the Drunken technique in the middle but that's it. However at the end there is a good 15 or so minutes of fighting that I thoroughly enjoyed. Many different ways of fighting and it was in such a great scene too. Andy Lau and Gordon Liu fight each other in 2 confession booths as well which was beyond the limits of regular wu shu and into a different but welcome realm. I also enjoyed the new Lau Kar Leung in this although I didn't like him as much as I did in DM2. And Jackie Chan isn't in this one. Actually Leung went off during the DM2 shooting due to directing arguments with Chan and he made this. It has a quack story so don't bother paying attention I think. Has to do with some cult and a princess and lame music too at times. But still a good rental or if you're into fights go ahead and make a purchase.".

That gave the movie a 7 for me otherwise I'd give it a 2 for the Drunken technique in the middle but that's it. However at the end there is a good 15 or so minutes of fighting that I thoroughly enjoyed. Many different ways of fighting and it was in such a great scene too. Andy Lau and Gordon Liu fight each other in 2 confession booths as well which was beyond the limits of regular wu shu and into a different but welcome realm. I also enjoyed the new Lau Kar Leung in this although I didn't like him as much as I did in DM2. And Jackie Chan isn't in this one. Actually Leung went off during the DM2 shooting due to directing arguments with Chan and he made this. It has a quack story so don't bother paying attention I think. Has to do with some cult and a princess and lame music too at times. But still a good rental or if you're into fights go ahead and make a purchase.";

	schema:headline " The best Ninja Turtles Action movie of all time my number 1 personal favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1990 is actually a cult classic Epic Action film and one of the best movies. It is one of my personal favorite comic book films and it is also one of my childhood favorites. It is my number 1 personal favorite Ninja Turtles movie! I love this movie to death it defines my childhood I grew up watching this movie! You haven't already rated the movie well please do so we can push the current 6.7 rating as high as it can go!! As a lifelong Turtles fan I can honestly say that everything about this movie works. From the casting to the fight scenes to the music there is nothing that I would have done any differently. There is just enough comedy each turtle is given their own unique identifiable and believable personality and the story is fast paced and gripping. Jim Henson's people did a stunning job on the Turtles themselves and the Shredder looks even better than he did in the Cartoons. The film really pays homage to the original comics by introducing Casey Jones dealing with Raphael's anger. Here they are Leonardo Raphael Donatello Michaelangelo are bad ass. Splinter Tatso Casey Jones they are all bad ass including Raphael. My favorite best movie. There is everything I love in this film. The acting Jim Henson's creature shop were awesome. Fighting scenes the foot clan children who steals for foot clan. All characters are awesome. The cast the plot everything is Terrific in this film. Why rebooting this film? Why? The original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1990 is the only film for me that I absolutely love to death! I grew up with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles I had an album of the animated series from 1987 I was collecting action figure from the third film that failed. I grew up watching this film and is always my favorite best action movie of the 90's I have ever seen. The fight stunts are awesome the Acton sequences are amazing. Everything is just great in this film.The film has some Drama in it the character development between the Turtles and Splinter was really touching and amazing. Another character development in this film that touches me is between Danny and Charles a father and son. That scene is so touching.Judith Hoag did an amazing awesome Terrific job as April O'Neil a reporter for Channel 3 News she acted her character very serious and convincing. For me April O'Neal will always and only be Judith Hoag. I don't get it why was she replaced in the sequels which that didn't just work. Elias Koteas did an amazing performance as Casey Jones a street wise vigilante who becomes an ally of the Turtles. He was the only Casey Jones for me he kicked ass! Seriously he did!!The fight scene on the end of the film is the best I have ever saw. Here the foot clans and Ninja Turtles are using weapons. Like foot clans use Axes in April's apartment to kill the Turtles but they failed. One of the foot clan Ninja's used a nunchaku weapons similar to Michelangelo weapons. The fight scene with Raphael on the roof was fantastic one of the best scenes in the film I love. This film is highly entertained it is fast paced not too over long or boring or lame it is a are real true Comic book Ninja Turtles film. It also has a heart bringing a family together like Danny and Charles father and son together when they were falling apart. The fight scene with Turtles and The Shredder was the best scene in the film the combat was awesome. Tough the Turtles were no match for him Leonardo was the only one that wounded him with his sword. The last fight scene when Splinter faces The Shredder is the best thing in a film that ever happened. Splinter come on the roof he confront Shredder and in final showdown he defeat Shredder. Shredder attacked him and Splinter throw's him with Michelangelo's nunchakus and says Death comes for us all Oroku Saki but when you Die it will be without.....honor. And Shredder try's to stab him and Splinter let's him fall in a dumpster! End and Death of Shredder in the original movie.The film opened at the box office in North America on March 30 1990 entering at 1 over the weekend and taking in more than 25 million.I love this film is my childhood film and Judith Hoag is the only April O'Neil for me. Elias Koteas will always be Casey Jones for me. I love this film to death! I love it. I love it to death!!! The best movie in the whole world. What else would you want in this film? There are a lot of martial arts in it. There were plenty used of weapons in the film Leonardo used twin NinjaTou steel swords of usually inferior make to samurai swords roughly sharpened and straight bladed Donatello wielded a bo a staff made of tapered hard wood Raphael wielded two sai both singular and plural daggershaped truncheons with two curved prongs and Michelangelo fought with twin nunchaku. Fight clan also used Axes. I love also the music score by John Du Prez and I love the song 9.95 Performed by Spunkadelic. 1010".

MC Hammer creates the best songs of his career. Shameless fun.All of the scenes are special in different ways to different fans of this cult classic from Casey Jones vs Raphael in the park to the Antique Store battle.Extremely underrated. One of the best comicbook adaptations ever made and one of the defining films in a LOT of people's childhoods.

	schema:reviewBody "On your first read of the title you may think Ah...the Ninja Turtles...kid's stuff.  That conclusion is partially understandable considering the fact that most people's minds drift towards the Saturday morning cartoon show which was made for little kids.  But if you are one of the handful of people who remembers the original TMNT comic book and how dark it was you will probably think more of the name.  This liveaction version of the Teenaged Turtles reaches back into its comic book origins and sacrifices the kiddie stuff in favor of a darker more brooding film.  This is the key to this movie's greatness.  It shows the Turtles how they were meant to be shown.  The movie is still fun though supplying the viewer with all the early 90's teenager slang and asskicking that you can squeeze onto celuloid.  The only problem is that the whole Ninja Turtles franchise has come with a love it or hate it tag attached to it often times giving it a bad rap that it really doesn't deserve.  The film is no Blade Runner or Spiderman by any means but it's still a great little piece of cinema that you can just sit down with a bowl of popcorn or maybe a pizza and enjoy without much thought.  Sadly this is as good as the series gets not that this movie could get much better.  The sequels TMNT 2 Secret of the Ooze and TMNT 3 aren't really that great.  TMNT 2 lacks the gritty edge that makes this movie good having Vanilla Ice on the soundtrack doesn't help much either and TMNT 3 is obviously aimed directly for the little ones. This is the great little movie.  COWABUNGA!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I dare anyone to hate this movie.  Come on.  I triple dog dare you.  Sit in front of the TV with a bunch of your friends and just try not to like it. You can't.  It's impossible.  I was a full fledged turtle fan back in the day I don't think the fad lasted long enough for us to earn Trekkertype names and of course at that point I thought it was the Gone With the Wind of our time.  That obviously it's not. But there is something just incredibly charming about a bunch of giant turtles acting like typical sitcom kids.  One even gets yelled out for sneaking out past curfew to see Critters 2.  If it comes on TV even my dad has to pause to watch at least one fight scene.  If someone in a college dorm pops it in legions of kids will exclaim Holy sht!  Is that Ninja Turtles? and then plop right down in front of the TV to watch.  You have to give a lot of credit to the guys who made this film.  It was released in the height of the craze so they could have thrown anything on the screen and it would have been a hit. See Ninja Turtles 2.  But instead they tried to make it the best film they could despite the subject matter.  They came up with an almost relevant after school special type plot.  The jokes and references range from Moonlighting to John Steinbeck and the fight scenes are done in the spirit of a Jackie Chan flick.  Add the fact that there are giant turtles doing the fighting and you get a funny imaginative and just plain likeable movie no matter what your age.  Sure it's about pizza loving ninja turtles.  But it is the best movie that could ever be made about pizza loving ninja turtles. That has to count for something.".

One even gets yelled out for sneaking out past curfew to see Critters 2.  If it comes on TV even my dad has to pause to watch at least one fight scene.  If someone in a college dorm pops it in legions of kids will exclaim Holy sht!  Is that Ninja Turtles? and then plop right down in front of the TV to watch.  You have to give a lot of credit to the guys who made this film.  It was released in the height of the craze so they could have thrown anything on the screen and it would have been a hit. See Ninja Turtles 2.  But instead they tried to make it the best film they could despite the subject matter.  They came up with an almost relevant after school special type plot.  The jokes and references range from Moonlighting to John Steinbeck and the fight scenes are done in the spirit of a Jackie Chan flick.  Add the fact that there are giant turtles doing the fighting and you get a funny imaginative and just plain likeable movie no matter what your age.  Sure it's about pizza loving ninja turtles.  But it is the best movie that could ever be made about pizza loving ninja turtles. That has to count for something.";

	schema:reviewBody "As a new generation turns 1820 this movie was vital for many growing up. It WAS their Saturday morning routine. A necessary part of growing up The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles instilled values for a generation. Both the movie and the TV show were key in this upcoming generation's development and coming of age. I recently watched this movie again for the first time in a decade and yes it was cheesy and tacky. However that doesn't make it bad in anyway. There are some complex issues going on beneath the surface here. First this movie was released close to the peak of crime wave that occurred across the country in the early 1990's. A city lost in crime is saved by a few of the next generation's heroes who are nothing more than teenagers on a quest for pizza. Second there is a definite connection between Splinter and Jesus when he is nailed up to a wall and talking to his sons. Many reading my comments may laugh because lets face it the idea of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is hilarious but the movie spoke to a specific generation at a specific time and as a period piece it can still be appreciated. This was more than just a movie it defined a generation. Even if the movie makes no sense go with it and watch it for the ridiculous 1990's dialogue...Its funny enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "I speak out on behalf of all fans of the TMNT!This is not a bad movie!You might say it has no storyline but I say it's kept simplistic for all the comic book fans. You don't want to confuse people with a massive complex tale. No one argues with 'Enter the Dragon' having a bad storyline!The characters in this movie are wonderfully set up. Right from the start we see that Raphael has issues. This anger forces him to distance himself and in the process we feel his fury. We immerse ourselves in the character and see how deep he can go. From woefully staring into New York from a rooftop or letting out a frenzy upon the gang that has literally knocked April to the ground we are getting to know the character inside and out. This is the hero of the movie. As for the comedic cheek of Casey Jones or the lighthearted double wisecracks of Michaelangelo and Donatello I'd love to see the reason behind this movie having no character study as some people might say.The action scenes are set up within the constraints of a normal fun movie with great camera angles just dying to be put on an advert or poster.The turtle effects by the Jim Henson creature shop don't disappoint even though Splinter looks like he walked straight off the set of 'Labyrinth'. The turtles are so good you shouldn't care anyway. The animatronics are fab and the voice characterisation is well chosen.As for the main blessing Steve Barron has chosen a dark tone for his movie. The original comic book would have been made proud by this attempt at making the movie more adult than people could believe. The crimefilled backdrops of New York make a great battleground and the whole mythological element that all crime is ruled by a master ninja adds to the drama. The soundtrack couldn't be better for the beginning. This is a fantastic movie and horribly underrated. With so many great elements this goes down as one of the all time great fantasy adventures. 10 out of 10 and a cowabunga to boot!".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently bought an old VHS copy of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie and I must say that this movie is still great even after 14 years. Now first let me that this is the only faithful film in the TMNT trilogy of movies released during the early '90s. This film released at the height of Turtlemania in the summer of 1990 raked in 133 million at the box office quickly making it the highest grossing independent film of all time. That's good considering it also faced heavy competition from another comic book adaptation that year Dick Tracy which was directed by Warren Beatty and was quite groundbreaking on its own terms of course.Though the film is more in touch with the toneddown animated series of the same title its roots are squarely in the original comics created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. This film is violent it DID push the limits of its PG rating in some spots especially with some intense moments many of which dealt with teenage crime and alienation and some particularly brutal fight sequences and is quite dark and actually kind of scary. This is by far the most mature moving and tense film in the series and we should thank director Steve Barron for making sure his vision of the Turtles did not stray off course unlike the sequels.I was a huge Turtle freak growing up and I still have many of my original action figures and other memorabilia. I only recently purchased Eastman and Laird's line of graphic novels from First and I must say that they're quite excellent and they take me back to the Turtles' roots. It is quite obvious that this line of graphic novels served as the main source of inspiration for the film. One particularly big difference between the comics and the film is that the literary source material is quite violent and not to mention very bloody in some spots.Many people may look at this film today in 2004 and they might say this film has not aged well. All I can say is that they did not have CGI taking control of every single action sequence to make up for lack of real stunt work. The performers inside the Turtle costumes acted quite excellently considering what they went through to become our four highkicking reptilian heroes.I remember reading a little while back that Hong Kong director John Woo had expressed interest in remaking the Turtles movie. I hope not for two reasons 1 If the Turtles were to be remade it would most likely be based off of the current running TMNT cartoon series which is crap and 2 The original 1990 film is fine the way it is and does not need to be touched by the greasy hands of today's Hollywood.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie is the best adaptation of the comics so far and I loved it. It is one of the best comictofilm adaptations of all time and should be preserved. TMNT forever!1010".

I miss writing like this because it seems like more movies that are made with superhero's for the kids nowadays are more cheesy. This was not made to insult anyone's intelligence I mean like I said before these are pizza eating vigilante fighting talking turtles yet we believed it. Not to mention that there is a talking rat I know it's kind of a weird little puppet they created but still he's like the Chinese Yoda that always makes a classic funny at just the right time. His last scene with Splinter was short sweet and effective. This is a movie I will show to my kids when I have a family one day and will still watch with a smile on my face.810".

This movie contains a kind of humor that the modern movies today cannot produce even up to this very day i can still watch and love every minute of this classic. I know the idea of a group of 4 turtles who are trained in the art of ninjitsu and who hang around in the sewers and eat pizza is well....cheesy but the atmosphere in this movie is dark and serious and is great fun for people of any age. In fact i could not understand most of the jokes when i was a young lad but as i got older and watched this movie again i realized that it was even funnier than i remembered. Everybody should take the time to watch this as it is a pure classic as well everyone should work hard to higher the IMDb score for this movie.".

What I've realised today is it's really a film for kids and adults alike offering enjoyable action scenes and hilarious humour while also providing a surprisingly dark narrative. The feelings of loss and the importance of family are ever present in this film and the Turtles play the part to perfection leaving you to empathize with their state while the villains are brutal and merciless offering no compassion or remorse. It's a classic tale of good verses evil and right verses wrong. The characters in this film are all extremely likable the creature effects are surprisingly good and with so many scenes playing out so well it's hard not to enjoy the whole package. Many critics disagree but this movie rocked when I was a kid and it still rocks today! Cowabunga dudes!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you haven't already rated the movie well please do so we can push the current 6.3 rating as high as it can go!! As a lifelong Turtles fan I can honestly say that everything about this movie works. From the casting to the fight scenes to the music there is nothing that I would have done any differently.There is just enough comedy each turtle is given their own unique identifiable and believable personality and the story is fast paced and gripping.Jim Henson's people did a stunning job on the Turtles themselves and the Shredder looks even better than he did in the Cartoons.Speaking of the cartoon almost all of the campy stuff has been eradicated from the film. The film really pays homage to the original comics by introducing Casey Jones dealing with Raphael's anger and resisting the urge to insert lame characters like Krang made famous by the cartoon.The whole movie is shot in a very brooding and gritty manor. In the end though its the little things are what make this film great. For example the characterizations.When Mikey and Donny are dancing to the Tequila song ninjitsu Raf doesn't want anything to do with it and Leo just kind of grooves along while still sitting down. This is exactly how I would expect all of them to act.Another nice little touch was the way they worked in the tortoise and the hare cartoon for Donny and Mikey to watch.Don't listen to people who tell you that this movie is not really kid friendly. It deals with issues that all kids need to learn about namely how joining a gang is not the answer because despite the allure that is not the kind of family that really looks after each other. Shredder's gang represents a choice that many kids have to make whether to go with the crowd who are doing wrong or to stand up for what is right and what they believe in.Shredder's gang with its crime and anarchy is the easy way out but in the end is not the answer. What the turtles represent as family who work through their differences and growing pains to act as a cohesive unit is a model that all kids should follow.As a lifetime scardycat ran out of theatre at the end of Who Framed Roger Rabbit I watched this movie when I was only about 7 or 8 from beginning to end without a touch of fear. Apppropriate for all ages.".

	schema:reviewBody "Too long have I seen this movie get bad ratings and reviews for the tiein it has with an 80's fad. Sure the Turtles are pretty much dead and buried but as this movie taught us Death comes for us all....Firstly I'd like to see everyone who badmouthed this movie make their own Ninja Turtles movie especially one in 1990 with no CGI. The suits are great the props even better but what really shines is the cinematography. This is a dark movie and it's perfectly dark. Dark moments in the film often precede or follow a sad or violent part of the movie. We see kids steal things for a local gang of thieves then immediately thereafter we see the kids running away from home in the darkness to a warehouse where the gang hides out. When Master Splinter is kidnapped we get one of the greatest moments in the film The camera rotates around Raphael as his emotions overtake him and he bursts into scream. The scream echos and the camera dissolves to a broken sewer grate and echos into the city.Good camera light and prop work what about the writing? Well for one thing this follows the comics so you know a TriadWarlike plot will follow. It's mainly an origin story and leads up to the Turtles saving the city 4 people saving New York was another fad for the eighties. The best part of this movie are its hybrid qualities it combines the dark storytelling of the comic but somehow the cartoon wit of Mikey got in there. Classic moment The enemy Ninjas attempt to hit Mikey on the floor with axes. Donny shouts I'm guessing these guys aren't lumberjacks! Mikey No joke! The only thing safe would be the trees!! Wit and humor with delivery it makes for a good run.Lastly the best part of the movie the music. Although it contains 90's rap it's ingeniously used to associate with the kids the runaways the thieves. And the rap song at the end is one of victory and holds many memories. The sad music in the turtles defeat the powerful music of their finding their 'Father' and the best of the movie the final battle music. It's all wonderfully done. I give it a 9.95.One thing I forgot to mention Shredder makes a truly great villain. His first entrance is great all we see is his shadow and he slowly comes into view. The mask distorts his voice in such a way it makes him more menacing and the helmet is a true symbol for fear and anger and power. He severely beats the turtles and mocks them playing with their emotions saying Splinter their surrogate father is dead. He does it in such an evil way it has to be seen to be felt.In my book it's one of the greatest movies ever. 1010 A  whichever rating system you use.".

Whenever somebody mentions films based on comics they always suggest Batman Superman SpiderMan or perhaps The Avengers. Nearly everybody will tell you that 'The Dark Knight' is the best film adapted from a comic book. I am very disappointed at how many people forget about this classic!I was a huge fan of the Ninja Turtles growing up. I remember watching the 1987 television series religiously. I always loved Michelangelo as a child because he always said and did the funniest things. I also remember my father buying me this film on VHS in the early 90's and it only influenced my love for the turtles. As I got older and started to understand the emotional aspects and storytelling of this film it blew me away. It is truly a hidden gem on a very long list of comic book films.This film is so atmospheric and dark that so much credit needs to be given to the cinematography department. When you're in the sewers you hear every drop of water and every foot step. When you're in the streets of New York you see the cars quickly passing by and people everywhere. The colours are so dark and work so well with the story.The character development of Raphael and the adaptive journey the turtles go through without their master really pushed this film to a limit I have yet to see from a movie that was previously based on a comic book. The message I received from this film is family and brotherhood. It is seen in every cornerstone of the story. As the turtles learn to fight and work as a family after their downfall the same is being said for The Foot Clan with their father Shredder. Mirroring images as one family grows together and the other built on lies and corruption. You see this first hand with the role of Danny Pennington. He is fed all the lies from The Foot Clan and helps them steal from and create fear within the city. But as he starts a long and meaningful conversation with the captive Splinter he begins to doubt everything that was said from his family. The storytelling in this film was so under appreciated in it's day. A real shame.If you're more interested in a comic book film with CGI and unrealistic fight scenes this film isn't for you. If you're interested in a film based on a comic with very deep story lines and characters that are very real and relatable you will be blown away. I believe it will shock some people at how real this film really is. Its no coincidence that in its day it was the highest grossing independent film of all time. TURTLE POWER!".

Even after 14 years I still like this movie not as one of my alltime favorites but enough to watch whenever since this film has a charm that is difficult to resist hey even Roger Ebert like it a little bit. The turtles in this film are presented pretty good and still hold up today as not only imaginative but entertaining as well thanks to the magic of Jim Henson. Besides that the story makes a lot of sense as a martial arts drama with a little comedy and a good theme for kids that all parents love their children. There are a few faults such as Shredder's death and the fact that some believed the violence was a little over the top for kids but today its pretty tame. Overall whether you are a turtle fan or not you will enjoy this film.".

This movie brought people that didn't watch the cartoons or read the comics to learn the story of our turtle friends. For an independent film done in 1990 it is done exceptionally well. I would recommend any fan to go back and watch this classic again just to drum up some great memories!! Casey Jones was always a favorite of mine and I loved the subtle changes they made to his character in the film. In 1990 I was just 6 years old.....well now I'm 21 years old and still in love with Donatello Raphael Michealangelo and Leonardo!!".

	schema:headline " A perfect piece of filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Even the most profound and wellmeaning of films often have a moment or two that seem excessive superfluous and plain unnecessary. But when a film comes along that is perfectly plotted scripted acted shot scored and directed with not a single moment flubbed or wasted then you know you have something very special. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is such a movie. Whether by accident or design the name Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles wordy though it is has a clean rhythmic structure there are exactly two syllables in every word and four words or two multiplied by two in total. Everything comes together perfectly in this film and fits together with a cohesiveness every bit as pleasing  but immensely more satisfying  than the words Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. If ever there was a film that exemplified the perfect translation of existing visual mediums comic bookcartoon to the big screen then this would be it.For starters Steve Barron's direction is sprawling and assured everything from kinetic fight sequences to tender character moments are executed with equal aplomb. John Fenner's photography is the perfect match from murky sewers to dingy streets to hazy warehouses to beautiful outdoor country his lens captures everything it needs to time and time again. Roy Forge Smith's production design in concert with Gary Wissner's art direction  and on a shoestring budget  is also everything anyone could ask for few films have the same consistently gritty verisimilitude to them. The use of bold green and white opening titles  with establishing shots of the sewers  shows enormous reverence for the source material and accentuates the notion that one is watching a comic book brought to life. And if you think those are real sewers think again! Even the Turtle suits are extremely impressive with fully articulated mouths subtle skin tones and bulging muscles. Visually this film is inspired.It's inspired in almost every other sense too. The casting is without exception pitch perfect. In particular it's hard to imagine anyone else voicing Donatello and Raphael other than Corey Feldman and Josh Pais. Judith Hoag is also perfectly cast as April. Only 21 at the time of filming Hoag projects the aura of a woman significantly older and wiser than her but every bit as youthful and vulnerable. Elias Koteas also impresses as Casey. A scene of him relaxing on a bench whilst chewing an apple is worth the entire endeavour. And there's one person often overlooked here Michael Turney brings in a very understated performance as confused teenager Danny. Why he hasn't had more work remains a mystery. None of the performances would mean much however without a solid story backing them up...Although essentially a good vs evil morality tale TMNT does not play a forceful hand. In the dayglow coloured cartoon the Turtles were crudely rebranded as Heroes TMNT restores the more appropriate Ninja wording and shows the Turtles as essentially heroic without trumpeting them as heroes they do good things but their driving force is the recovery of their master and not the saving of a populace from the clutches of evil. The antagonists are not overtly bad either the majority of them are in fact alienated kids. Only The Shredder seems unequivocally bad but his screen presence is so gripping that it hardly seems to matter. The script itself is an exciting and finely tuned blend of master philosophy rapidfire punchlines and real human drama. For a film about four walking talking turtles one might not expect much subtlety but one would be wrong. For example after being at each other's throats in previous scenes Casey and April enjoy a quiet moment together in the latter half of the film before the Turtles show up and interrupt them. In this blink and you'll miss it moment Casey relates to April that he played professionally until getting injured April in turn relates with genuine sincerity that she's sorry. It's such a short moment  and it's acted with such softly spoken dialogue  that it can be easily missed. But short as it is it speaks tomes about the unfolding love between April and Casey and April and Casey as individuals particularly Casey who is such a guarded character through most of the film.The allocated review space on IMDb is coming to an end... and there's so much more to say. Thankfully some very openminded and observant people have already said most of it for me. About the only crucial ingredient I've not yet touched upon and feel I should is the music. Like the direction and photography John Du Prez's score takes in a range of styles instrumental electronic synthesised and enriches the film with its presence. A noteworthy highlight is the film noirish string arrangement he uses when the Turtles return home to find it ransacked in tandem with the liberated camera which pans around Raphael it makes for a quality of artistic expression that cinema often aspires to but rarely achieves. The 1990's was one of the most exciting decades  if not THE most exciting decade  of film there has ever been. Even though critics will only gush about the other two in this sentence Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles along with Goodfellas and Dances With Wolves got the decade off to the best possible start.More than worth your time Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles deserves a place in your DVD collection if you claim to treasure the medium of film.".

The film starts in a long flashback narrated by Marcelino  he tells how an abandoned baby is picked up by monks residing in a monastery ruled by a humble Father Superior Fernando Fernan Gomez . Marcelino Nicolo Paolucci is a miserable orphan who grows up in the monastery . The little boy named Marcelino who lost his mother and became a pure and simple of heart kid devoted friend of Crucified Jesus . Meanwhile he gets into mischiefs  he plays and puts nicknames to monks  as Brother Door  Brother Cookie  Brother Bad  Fray Papilla Alfredo Landa and Brother Ding Dong . Marcelino wishes to see his mother . One day  a wealthy count  in search of a child to raise  decides to adopt Marcelino and to bring him up in his fortress . He dresses him in luxurious attire and gives him a strict education . But Marcelino feels sad there and escapes to convent . One day when he falls ill is carried a room full of old things  there he finds at the loft to Jesus and gives a piece of his bread to an old wooden Jesus figure  and indeed it takes the bread and eats it . Getting a wish granted for his donation . But in some touching scenes  Marcelino again gives him bread and wine  then happen an ecstasy at the ending .SpanishItalianFrench coproduction dealing with a sensitive story proceeded in simplicity and delicacy by Lugi Comencini as when a marvelous friendship between Jesus and Marcelino is born . This a sensible and feeling movie full of mirth  humor touches and enjoyable message based on a novel by Jose Maria Sanchez Silva . At the same time the film gives us an agreeable panorama about monastery life  its pity and goodness  furthermore  the oration  sacrifice  work  companionship and various situations happen in monastic existence . Its perfect developing resides on superb characters well played by all casting monks and the sympathy  simplicity of NicoloMarcelino  but inferior to unforgettable kid played by Pablito Calvo. Musical score by Florenzo Carpi responds appropriately to the ambient  originating a religious atmosphere  though extremely sweet . Precious and luminous cinematography who give us an accurate scenario of the times is developed . The motion picture is professionally directed by Luigi Comencini but is justly inferior to version filmed by Hungarian Ladislao Vadja  that was one of the best films to come out of Europe in the decade of the 50s and touched the hearts of numerous spectators around the world . This modern rendition resulted to be a flop and failed at box office .".

The little boy named Marcelino who lost his mother and became a pure and simple of heart kid devoted friend of Crucified Jesus . Meanwhile he gets into mischiefs  he plays and puts nicknames to monks  as Brother Door  Brother Cookie  Brother Bad  Fray Papilla Alfredo Landa and Brother Ding Dong . Marcelino wishes to see his mother . One day  a wealthy count  in search of a child to raise  decides to adopt Marcelino and to bring him up in his fortress . He dresses him in luxurious attire and gives him a strict education . But Marcelino feels sad there and escapes to convent . One day when he falls ill is carried a room full of old things  there he finds at the loft to Jesus and gives a piece of his bread to an old wooden Jesus figure  and indeed it takes the bread and eats it . Getting a wish granted for his donation . But in some touching scenes  Marcelino again gives him bread and wine  then happen an ecstasy at the ending .SpanishItalianFrench coproduction dealing with a sensitive story proceeded in simplicity and delicacy by Lugi Comencini as when a marvelous friendship between Jesus and Marcelino is born . This a sensible and feeling movie full of mirth  humor touches and enjoyable message based on a novel by Jose Maria Sanchez Silva . At the same time the film gives us an agreeable panorama about monastery life  its pity and goodness  furthermore  the oration  sacrifice  work  companionship and various situations happen in monastic existence . Its perfect developing resides on superb characters well played by all casting monks and the sympathy  simplicity of NicoloMarcelino  but inferior to unforgettable kid played by Pablito Calvo. Musical score by Florenzo Carpi responds appropriately to the ambient  originating a religious atmosphere  though extremely sweet . Precious and luminous cinematography who give us an accurate scenario of the times is developed . The motion picture is professionally directed by Luigi Comencini but is justly inferior to version filmed by Hungarian Ladislao Vadja  that was one of the best films to come out of Europe in the decade of the 50s and touched the hearts of numerous spectators around the world . This modern rendition resulted to be a flop and failed at box office .";

	schema:headline " Little Orphan Boy and His Dearest Friend";
	schema:reviewBody "In the mid 1950s a HungarianSpanish director Ladislao Vajda made a movie that still touches the hearts of many viewers around the world. The story of the little boy Marcellino who lost his mother and became a pure simple but devoted friend of Crucified Jesus appears to be unreal for many perhaps yet much in need for lots of people who cherish simplicity and spirituality in art that cinema is. However the black and white Spanish classic has occurred dated to be shown to kids and in the early 1990s the Italian director Luigi Comencini remade it. As comparison does not work due to two individual interpretations of the directors I do not aim at saying which version is better and why. In my comment I would like to concentrate on some strong points of this remake since the general impression of yours after seeing the film will surely be a decent drama.Firstly since this is the story of a little boy the film is accurately addressed to children and youngsters. The in media res beginning that shows us the group of young tourists who visit the monastery where Marcellino lived gives us a clue to universality of a short but beautiful life. These kids in a sense are struck by the simplicity of the events by the uniqueness of the place. The flowers placed by a little girl resemble gratitude. This clear address to youngsters is also proved by very fine scenes some of which I would like to highlight. Consider for instance the witty moments with disappearing slices of bread or Marcellino trying to make friend with a spoiled boy from count's palace. I also loved the scene when people see little baby Marcellino in the stable on Christmas night. Although the story is pretty sad these childlike moments make it a perfect movie for kids and young people.Secondly the whole movie gives us a nice insight into the monastic life its sacrifice its piety its prayer work and brotherly love. That is what we experience what we get to know with little Marcellino from the memorable moment of his baptism to the final moment of his parting. This piety and simplicity of the life it shows is intensely combined with the entire spirit of the movie. Music atmosphere some moments including the burning of the monastery lead us to a specific but profound world of humble brothers. At the same time it gives us an accurate interpretation of the times developed.Thirdly the film conveys the precious message I have mentioned in many of my other comments on various spiritual movies. It is a film we are in need in our times a film that despite its lack of fun gives us joy despite its lack of realism gives us faith despite its lack of great celebrities gives us authenticity. Like it was the case with the 1955 movie you watch this story of a little unnoticed Marcellino and you cry with him and laugh with him. So to say a viewer young or old feels like a pure unexperienced honest child.Here a profound reflection arises what really makes us feel young. People attempt at looking young but what happens inside is a different story. This film appears to give the answer...simplicity of heart similarly to Marcellino. The most touching scene in this movie for me was when Marcellino talks to Crucified Jesus and gives him bread. But before seeing it try to put aside all sense of spiritual gravity all sense of earthly logic. Try to see it with an unexperienced childish heart and you will see that this is a film about a boy and the dearest Friend anyone can ever have. See it show it to kids try to be overwhelmed by the miraculous spirit it promotes. No great performances no stunning cinematography just a movie just a story but...what a story!".

	schema:reviewBody "Akele Hum Akele Tum is a very entertaining and charming film. The film seems to have been inspired by two films Abhimaan and Kramer vs. Karmer. Abhimaan showed the rise of one spouse in the music industry to another's fall and Kramer vs. Kramer showed two separated parents fighting over their child's custody. The film has bits of both films though it's much more similar to the latter. There are actually several sequences which are copied framebyframe which is annoying but I did like the fact that it was like an expansion of the Kramer vs. Kramer plot. It's like showing the motives behind Meryl Streep's character's decision to leave her husband giving a larger view of what could probably have happened in the middle and ending it up with a more complete ending. That's why this is one remake which is easier to forgive.Mansoor Khan's direction is very good and it is aided by a very memorable soundtrack and great casting. Anu Malik's music is exceptional and every song stands out even though some of them like the film itself are unoriginal. Raja Ko Rani Se is very melodious and romantic Aisa Zakham Diya is youthful and catchy Akele Hum Akele Tum is a great song showing the loving relationship of a father and his son and the fact that it's actually sung by Udit Narayan and his reallife son Aditya makes it even more convincing Dil Mera Churaya Kyon is beautifully melancholic and Dil Kehta Hai is another amazingly exciting and romantic gem. All the songs are extremely well pictured in the film. Aamir Khan and Manisha Koirala have a fantastic chemistry I also loved their collaboration in the 1999 film Mann. This is one of Khan's best performances  very mature very natural at times restrained and at times temperamental. Koirala is both beautiful and convincing. She is first a young dreamy girl who wants to become a singer then a married woman then an angry motherhomemaker whose inferiority complex and dissatisfaction from her life and marriage cause her to try to find a new life then a reigning singer then a suffering mother whose determination to get her son back looks almost selfish. She is credible in every shade her character goes through. Tanvi Azmi also gives a very fine performance.Overall Akele Hum Akele Tum is a very enjoyable family drama. It has bits of everything and is generally well made although it does tend to be melodramatic at several sequences. It did bother that some scenes were copied framebyframe but as a whole it is a decently Indianised film and as already said it updates and expands the Kramer vs. Kramer plot quite effectively. I'm not saying it's a great film but it is one of those films which show the magic of Bollywood's 1990s which may not have had the great technical advances of today but were much more simple naive and alluring thanks to their very profound Hindi film style extremely melodious songs and great human and family values.".

Aamir Khan plays the struggling father who has to look after his son and work at the same time after his wife suddenly decides to leave the house. Aamir Khan delivers a Powerful and Brilliant performance. Manisha Koraila is the women you will hate in a average role. You hate her because her character is so selfish that she walks out on her kid. Akele Hum Akele Tum is longer then Kramer Vs Kramer with more added story lines. Some great scenes between the father son relationship. One great scene is when the kid request's a present a little expensive. Aamir tries ever so hard to get the money but ends up arrested. His son waits hours and hours till Aamir comes home to tell his son he failed. The kid understands and Aamir starts crying. Great direction from Hit Director Mansoor Khan of Qayamat se Qayamat Tak Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar and Josh. A must see".

	schema:reviewBody "I must confess this is one of the best Indian films I seen in a long while I saw it yesterday and thought I should comment on it. I've not seen Kramer vs Kramer so I cant really compare it's however similar to Double platinum where a womanDiana Ross left her daughterBrandy Norwood and husband to follow her singing career because the husband wouldn't support her although in this case the husband was not a singer. My view of the movie is however different from that of most commentators here. I don't see Kiran as selfish at all. I think she did the best for herself at that time or else she could turn nuts. On the other hand I however see the man as selfish what brought two of them together in the first place was their singing and Rohit himself said they could climb the ladder of fame together but after marriage? He became concerned with himself alone and even refused the chance to give her demo to a music director. It shows that all he said before marriage was just a plot to get her. The woman loving and believing in him married him even against her parents' wish she even stayed in the marriage for 7years believing one day he would change. The way I see it I feel Rohit should have repented of his selfishness too even though they tried to show this when he was talking to his son about why his mother left Acknowledged his own selfishness but later scenes showed he didn't change when Kiran got him a job as a music directorshowing that all this while she never stopped thinking about him he clearly told her that he wanted his success to be his own alone without the help of the woman and refused the offer that's an outstanding show of selfishness and it is clear that that was what he wanted all along remember before they were married it was we could do this and that and after marriage it became I want to achieve this and that the movie never showed that he repented for this and I believe he should. The only consolation was the fact that he had to sell those songs and he never became the man of his dreams fine that's what should become of a selfish man but he didn't regret it. One outstanding thing however was that unlike the movie Double Platinum he made sure the son always loved his mother. I give him kudos for that. The court scenes were absolutely wonderful and despite been a man I was moved to tears myself but what I would like to say here is that even though Rohit's lawyer was only doing his job and has to use every weapon in his arsenal it must be clear that both of them failed in the relationship. A husband should support his wife's dream too but he became engulfed in only his own. Another thing is that saying Kiran has failed in all her major relationship was very unfair of Rohit's lawyer putting in mind that she left her parents to marry him showing how selfless she really is. Even though at the end of the day she came to realize that it is the relationship that really matters. I do too but one thing should be clear she would have remained a very unhappy woman and probably driven to suicide if she had stayed. Rohit must also come to understand the right of every woman to a career too and also learn to think about others along with himself too.. On the whole the movie is an excellent one and a must watch for every couple.".

At 6'6 that's two inches taller than JOHN WAYNE trivia fans! with flowing blond hair and blue eyes the 30year old Swedish actor combined a Herculean physique if Marvel Comics' The Mighty Thor is ever filmed he would be perfect as the Thunder God with a knack for weapons that would earn him the future title of 'King' of 'B' action flicks. True his English was so poor at the time of filming that his dialog was kept to a minimum but who watches this kind of film for dialog anyway?Supporting Lundgren's HeMan is crusty veteran soldier Duncan ManatArms played by character actor Jon Cypher who makes up for HeMan's taciturn nature by reminiscing constantly about a life in the military with observations EVERY soldier has made through history and his daughter Teela pretty Chelsea Field one of the busiest actresses of the decade serving as a Xena Lite for the proceedings.Opposing the Forces of Good with the irreplaceable Langella is one of my favorite actresses Meg Foster as the sublimely wicked EvilLyn using her piercing green eyes and barely suppressed sexuality to great advantage.

	schema:headline " Awesome fantasy adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "Just as some movies that should be great turn out to be awful some movies that should be awful turn out to be great  Masters of the Universe. Unfortunately for a film that's based on a cartoon that today's 20somethings used to watch in the 1980's none of the said 20somethings are going to admit to liking it now. Few will give it a chance and realize the direction is good the acting is good the music is good that it's exciting funny scary suitably epic and absolutely actionpacked and that it looks fantastic. But Superhero Cinema does. HeMan and the Masters of the Universe was a hugely successful mid80's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The success of each fed the other as well as a popular comicbook and loads of other merchandise. Finally in 1987 came the big one the motion picture.What looks like suicide at first glance  converting a cartoon based on action figures into a fulllength feature  gets more appealing when you look at thes ource material closer. The cartoon is a epic hybrid of fantasy and scifi with ancient castles and sorcerers mixing with laser guns and cyborgs. It also has a very mythic feel mixing Ancient Greeceera monsters and challenges with fairy tale locations.There are also hordes of exotic characters  warriors mutants monsters magicians of every description so the film makers could pick the coolest ones to bring to the screen. The ones they've chosen are HeMan and his arch enemy Skeletor obviously amazontype female warrior Teela and her dad ManAt Arms the Sorceress of Grayskull Skeletor's second in command Evil Lyn which is always pronounced 'EvilIn' and Beastman. Added to these are four characters that were created for the film  Gwildor a dwarflike inventor Karg a cross between Captain Hook and a bat snakelike Sauron and Blade a sword and knifeobsessed slaphead. So that's eleven fantasy characters running about which is a pretty good total.Masters of the Universe succeeds because it takes the cartoon and adapts not it's superficial qualities but it's essence into a movie turning it into a mature scififantasy adventure. This is where so many comic and cartoon based movies fail. They don't adapt their source material properly to make a successful feature film. You need to make the movie a natural progression from what it's based on altering the look enough so it looks acceptable in real action altering the characters into real people choosing actors who can give real performances. It's not simply dressing superstars up as characters from a comic or cartoon it's reimagining the ideas as a movie. MotU does this perfectly. You can fault it as a film itself of course but you can't fault it as an adaption.The production design is superb with some superbly realized sets and costumes. Everything has been adapted to look more realistic on the big screen. The cast give uniformly decent performances. Nobody lets the side down  these are all 3D characters not cartoons. Dolph Lungren proves he's one of the European bodybuilder brigade who can act. Frank Langella gives an outstanding performance as Skeletor his powerful presence almost bursting out of the TV and into your living room. Langella gives a shining example to all actors portraying comicbook and cartoon characters in live action. There is a pervading sense of dread whenever he appears especially during Castle Grayskull sequences and the script gives him some awesome lines which he delivers with pure evil dripping from his voice.The monsters are pretty bloody scary especially for a family film especially the Beastman who's had a 'the' added to his name. The sequence where they invade a school gym and chase Julie around it is excellent far more exciting and scary than similar chases in many horror films including some of those Courtney Cox has been in. It's also like the rest of the film surprisingly violent as the bad guys attack Julie with swords claws laser guns and high velocity darts. That she manages to escape is not unbelievable at all because of the way the chase is staged  it's just a relief she gets out of there the goal of any such chase scene. The sheer ammount of bad guys that the small band of heroes has to face adds greatly to the drama.Setting half of the movie on Earth has it's advantages and disadvantages. It does give the film a human component and two ordinary teenagers to be pulled into the adventure with. It also makes the monsters scarier  rather than being in a distant galaxy they are in the neighbourhood viciously attacking people and destroying whatever they come across. On the other hand it would have been cool to see some more of the war torn Eternia and the planet's weird inhabitants and locations but MotU had a relatively small budget so that sort of stuff was off limit anyway. A little too much time is spent on the almost soapopera angle of Julie and Kevin but it helps flesh out their characters to make them believable.MotU is also packed with action and we do mean packed. There is an outbreak of violence every 15 minutes or so usually even less and there is variety and imagination among the content unlike many action films which consist of repetetive shoot outs and nothing more. It could possibly be said that it's quantity over quality as some of it particularly the shootouts are badly filmed and none of the action ever reaches adrenalin pumping. However it's good enough inyerface and quite exciting to watch with HeMan taking out hordes of bad guys with his sword laser beams everywhere mass destruction and some good old rough and tumble. And all the action grows organically from the story  none of it seems put in simply because the movie needed an action scene at a certain point.One of MotU's greatet assets is it's atmosphere. The sense of an intergalactic civil war is tangible as is the sheer menace of the villains the desperation of the good guys the growing sense of doom as Skeletor captures the Cosmic Key. There is a cowerbehindthesofa scariness similar to that of TV's Doctor Who.If Masters of the Universe was rereleased at cinemas this summer people would realize how good it is compared to the blockbuster summer fare we get these days. And all for 17m which was hardly anything even in 1987.".

Especially for those who would rush home after school to watch our favorite strongman face off against the forces of evil that threaten the safety and security of his homeworld.  For my money it was never better than when HeMan faced off against Skeletor for the struggle for Eternia.I also remember the fantasies that I and my friends would have of traveling away to that world of magic and fantasy to fight alongside HeMan as he defends Grayskull.  It truly was a series that was out of this world.And now it's on Earth.When I first heard about a live action movie mind you I was twelve at the time I was overly excited about it.  But I didn't get to see it until my late teens.  And I must say that it was very well done especially in its presentation.  In fact it brought back those far away childhood memories of those late afternoons in front of the tv or outside with the toys a makeshift Eternia setting with my friends.I'll grant a few things that were wrong with the movie though.  There were times that I think the script was either badly edited or just too rushed at certain points.  I'm also not thrilled about them being on earth but understanding budget constraints and the idea to make these characters more real than fantasy help feed into that decision so I let that one go.  I would have also liked to see more of the characters from the toys in the movie but have no complaints that they made up a few cool characters like Blade.The casting choices I felt were really good.  Dolph Lundgren worked as HeMan even though he can't act.  He looked the part and even pulled off the role.  I could tell that he wasn't walking through the part as many actor will do with character roles right Mr. Clooney?.  And Frank Langella the PERFECT choice for Skeletor.  Langella managed to bring that character to life in a way that gave me chills.  Skeletor is perhaps one of the greatest villains ever imagined but the cartoon made him a cackling villain who was more a buffoon than anything therefore he didn't seem threatening.  But seeing Langella make Skeletor more dark and evil put my faith back into the conviction as a great villain.You don't have to be a die hard fan of the series to enjoy the movie.  It's great fun imaginative and it captures a moment in time.  Don't scrutinize the movie because it's different from the cartoon.  Look at it for what it is and don't focus on its faults.  It had the power to recapture my imagination so its not all that bad.".

Langella managed to bring that character to life in a way that gave me chills.  Skeletor is perhaps one of the greatest villains ever imagined but the cartoon made him a cackling villain who was more a buffoon than anything therefore he didn't seem threatening.  But seeing Langella make Skeletor more dark and evil put my faith back into the conviction as a great villain.You don't have to be a die hard fan of the series to enjoy the movie.  It's great fun imaginative and it captures a moment in time.  Don't scrutinize the movie because it's different from the cartoon.  Look at it for what it is and don't focus on its faults.  It had the power to recapture my imagination so its not all that bad.";

	schema:headline " It is much better that regarded";
	schema:reviewBody "I have read a number of reviews on this movie and they are accurate and good for the most part. My credit is to Gary Goddard for all he endured and still getting a credible and succinct movie made.The fight scenes are real and actual so they seem methodical but they're great. The hair clothing makeup special effects and down the list we go is so caked in '80s gunk it would be hard to fight for this as a classic. It is the only HeMan movie out there and although a sequel beckons eighteen years have passed without a stir.If a sequel were to made Langella would have to be Skeletor. I mean the best acting from both he and Lundgren comes when HeMan is being led by the Centaurian. Langella saying I give you a choice return to Eternia with me as my slave and save their despicable lives or perish with them here on this tasteless and primitive planet. It's cold and dark and it's authentic. It's chilling and you get chills. Langella overacts sometimes but mostly is great. He took Skeletor from a whiny irritating and downright pathetic worm of a guy to a believable earthy credible and despicable evildoer. We get a taste of the importance of Heman and all that he does here in this scene too.Goddard did something brilliant here he made the movie personable. He puts these people on Earth interacting with Earthlings and putting a grasp on how out there these aliens are. But it is also probably why this movie is so widely disregarded because it doesn't have great and illustrative fight scenes. Instead they are sensible and plotted. To see this movie remade could be a real treat.Gwildar is essentially Orco. He was easy sensible irritating but not nearly as annoying and unfairly Billy Barty was nominated for a Razzie. The story interlocks with this missing key as created by Gwildar. This cosmos idea of Godlike power through the manifestation of a fourth dimension is highly advanced. This is why the movie is good. Portals are doors and HeMan is definitely a science fiction adventurer. This puts an Earthy spin on an idea wiling out.Teela works and ManinArms Duncan is good as a faithful sidekick to HeMan. That's what he is. He can hold his own but mostly is fighting for duty of right and he follows HeMan for he is the epitome of it. Teela's gritty and pitched voice with her desperate actions are very formidable. Duncan is best when inspiring Kevin. Kevin is a sensitive guy with a talent. What these Eternians do is showcase pessimism on Earth for their planet is dying at their own hands. They are their own good and evil and it is hard to differentiate so why care? By the end of the movie Courtney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeill Julie and Kevin see that. So does Lubic. The Eternians have no planet and yet they continue to hold hope and forge ahead HeMan. Tolkan is not so much a distraction as he is pretentious. McNeill yelling to Tolkan Lubic this is for real as he dodges a Centaurian blast doesn't hold much weight or reality. It is about unity division and strength. Both literal and figurative.Meg Foster is great as EvilLyn because she improves the movie rather than take time from Skeletor. Goddard lets most of the acting chops fall to the incomparable Frank Langella. HeMan is the ambassador of good. He is to talk slow be levelheaded and search for justice. Lundgren does all of these things. He mission isn't to be malicious and blood seeking. When he runs into Julie and a great fight sequence ensues it is Duncan and Teela doing some leg work. HeMan is a protector. He'll abate killing Skeletor to keep any and all safe. In all honesty how many lines can you give someone? Someone suggested Brad Pitt as HeMan for a remake. I don't mind Pitt but he would ham up the screen like some feel Skeletor did. Skeletor's was good HeMan's would not be. Lundgren in all honesty is great. He has a mullet but looks the part and contrary to popular belief acts it. He wields the Sword of Grayskull gracefully yet with force and some clumsiness. It's heavy but he's wellskilled and versed in the sword. These oppositions are found in the Soceress. She would normally seem bad to us however she is the greatest power of good. Christina Pickles gives great lines of philosophy allowing for good banter and humor with Skeletor. And her love for HeMan is very evident and clear with solid acting.The cartoon is hardly to be found here aside from the characters and Eternia. Battle cat and all other characters good and bad could cloud a remake. But it would be great to see history revealed for HeMan like the new Batman series has done. People forget we like to see depth in our characters. And the character Charlie is filler not unimportant but certainly not integral. He's written well. All in all watch this movie because it's really quite engrossing.".

It follows the mythos of the original HeMan mini comics the ones that came with the toys more than the plot of the animated series as such HeMan is not secretly Prince Adam. My fellow post teenage virgins as well as losers in general will probably understand what I'm talking about. Anyway Langela proves the perfect Skeletor.  Unlike the cartoon character he proves to be convincingly pure evil.  I must say that he honestly did succeed in being one of the most terrifying villains in movie history. Hat's off to director Gary Goddard and the cast for taking the story entirely seriously and not just dismissing it as a campy hour and a half long toy add.  It's that kind of conviction that distinguishes between art and commercial shlock. This movie also taught me some valuable life lessons.  For instance if a guy with a skull head gets massive godlike power the only real change he will make to his life is giving himself golden armour.  Both Skeletor and the Red Skull have done this.  I also learned that when some one gets godlike power to defeat them all you need to do is push them into a muddy ditch. Having the characters travel to late 1980's earth made this movie all the better specially since they got to meet Courteney Cox what a babe. Grrrowwlll.  Why doesn't anybody ever ask her about this movie when she's on talk shows? Oh wait it's cause there's no reason they should care. Anyway if you don't have anything better to do give it a rent... and wait till the end of the credits for the secret surprise.  You can probably find it at your local Blockbuster Video!

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not going to lie to you!  This is not a very good movie but I still loved it.  I love this movie cause it reminds me of all the heman figures that I used to play with when I was a child.  The story of this film is loosely based on the story from the cartoon series.  I say loosely because other than the names of some of the people HeMan ManAtArms Teela Skeletor Beast Man and the names of some of the places Castle Grayskull Snake Mountain Eternia the two stories don't seem to have a whole lot in common.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing although it was sad that some of the keyfavorite characters from the cartoon series didn't make it into the film.  It would have been cool to see BattleCat in the film although very hard to execute.  I think a lot of people would have liked to see Orco too...but I never liked him much anyway so that was just fine with me to cut him out.  As for the cast I thought they were actually pretty good.  It seems most people disliked Dolph Lundgren playing HeMan but I thought he was great! No he's not the best actor in the world but I thought he did a fine job. I really enjoyed seeing Courteney Cox in her early work and at such a young age she was quite the looker back then too.  As for Frank Langella Skeletor I thought he did a great job with the role!  And I thought his makeup was incredible!  Very good job!  I thought the rest of the cast did a great job too.  People that deserve a special mention is Bill Barty Gwildor James Tolkan Det. Lubic and Chelsea Field Teela.  The only major complaint about the movie that I have is why did they have to kill off Sarod and not Karg?  Saurod was cool looking and Karg was just plain stupid.  He talked stupid he looked stupid his clothes were stupid...all around stupid!  Saurod was cool!  Anyway in a strictly movie sense this movie isn't really very good and if you don't know anything about HeMan then are almost sure to dislike it. But in a nostalgic sort of way the movie is pretty cool.  Also you have to keep in mind that this IS a kid's movie so it's not really intended to be anything really mindblowing.  Nonetheless I loved the movie!  I hope you like the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading.Chris".

I love this movie cause it reminds me of all the heman figures that I used to play with when I was a child.  The story of this film is loosely based on the story from the cartoon series.  I say loosely because other than the names of some of the people HeMan ManAtArms Teela Skeletor Beast Man and the names of some of the places Castle Grayskull Snake Mountain Eternia the two stories don't seem to have a whole lot in common.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing although it was sad that some of the keyfavorite characters from the cartoon series didn't make it into the film.  It would have been cool to see BattleCat in the film although very hard to execute.

The annoying midget took the place of  Orko was the icing on the cake!  The problem with this film is basically that it was released 2 years  too late. HeMan was hot in 1985. His popularity was on the wane.  They also changed far too much. I know they probably relocated the  story to Earth for budgetary reasons a scrap yard is a cheaper place  to have a battle than a 'mystical swamp' but they could have at least  kept skeletors old henchmen. Only Beastman survived and he was pretty  lame. And don't get me started on the others.  Aside from its cheapness and derivative nature there are so many  things wrong with this film. It is so unambitious. HeMan had the  potential to weave a believable universe. It had established characters  and conventions it had mysticism and technology and a super hero lead.  When you change that much you please no one. Fans of the original are  disappointed and non fans have no interest. The only decent change they  made was to include Mr Strickland from back to the future. That guy  kicks ass!  At least in the SheRa movie they kept things the same. Now that was a  tie in note Irony.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you were a kid in the '80s you were all about HeMan and I was no exception.  I had the toys the books the lunch box the underwearpretty much everything I owned in fact bore the likeness of my alltime favorite cartoon character.  So when I found out there was going to be a movie I thought my life was complete.I really couldn't have been more disappointed if they'd put HeMan in a tux and top hat.  This movie sucked.  First off BattleCat Orko and pretty much all the villains from the original cartoon were replaced by new characters that everyone hated.  Skeletor's mask didn't even come close to looking skeletal and all his troops since when did Skeletor have troops? were direct ripoffs of a handful of costumes from Star Wars.Then we have HeMan who wears a cape ? and never becomes Prince Adam. Plus Lundgren has problems hiding his accent and can't really act anyway. The annoying dwarf Gwildor would've been forgivable if they'd only changedhis name to Orko!  Come on we all knew this was the movie's answer to Orko...just a few minor changes to the script and one big gripe could've been avoided.  And who could forget those two teenagers?  Man I wish I could...But these complaints come mostly from a fan of the cartoon series.  On its own as well the movie has a whole host of problems.  For one the script is awful.  Even for a scififantasy adventure there's nothing about the story that's even minutely believable why do Eternians speak English?. There's no reason for Skeletor to be so fixated on finding this cosmic key since he's already got one.  They try to cover it up by adding the line I must possess all or I possess nothing! but it doesn't work.Then on Earth when HeMan and company lose the key they just so happen to run across the two kids who found it.With the exception of Frank Langella none of the actors did a halfway decent job though it's hard to tell based on what they were given to work with.  And the resolution at the end is so predictable and cheesy I even stood up in the theater as a sixyearold kid and yelled Bulls!I could keep listing the its flaws but my hands are cramping in protest to thinking about this movie.  It gets 3 out of 10 from me.".

But despite our professionalism when it comes to rating films there's always a special place in our hearts for those really cheesy childhood movies that made on hell of a difference to our upbringing one way or another. Masters of the Universe is one of those films. Frank Langella Skeletor plays the part of HeMan's nemesis better than anyone else i could dream of. Dolph was perfect for the part of Heman. Sure there were some good old fashioned bad guys missing. And where was battlecat? I'll tell you where at the bottom of the budget. At least we had Air Centurions and a damn sexy Evil Lynn. But above all we had some bad ass lines in there. I think they done well with what they had. Even the tune is good thanks for Rocky too Bill. If you don't like this movie it's cause you've got no soul. Masters of the Universe is a masterpiece in every way shape and form. There hasn't been a bad guy like Skeletor with the exclusion of Darth Vader who was able to do the role justice. You probably grew up on a steady diet of westerns that didn't include Clint Eastwood and therefor have no imagination. If you don't like Masters of the universe then there's a good chance you don't like other classics like Big Trouble in Little China and other such masterpieces. In which case go back to watching so called classics and pick out another sweater from bland wardrobe and rot.Look for more down to earth reviews coming soon big Trouble in Little china Rocky Predator etc".

A great hero and great sidekicks with a bit of depth.The villains in my opinion are by far the most amazing villains ever to grace my television screen.

Dolph Lundgren makes for a solid hero and he's great for the role's physicality. But it's clearly Frank Langella who steals this thing buried under makeup but still owning his scenes.It's interesting to see what came out of Cannon in 1987. Superman IV was a disaster and yet Masters of the Universe somehow works. Chock full of swords lasers ships otherworldly heroes and still grounded in a contemporary setting.

	schema:reviewBody "When Robert Benton wrote and directed Places in the Heart he created his own Citizen Kane. Like Orson Welles he will spend the rest of his life trying to better it and won't succeed.Places in the Heart takes place in Waxahachie Texas in 1935 and our director was born there in 1932. The film is a personal vision of his childhood in that small Texas town. It bears a whole lot of resemblance to To Kill a Mockingbird except that the adult protagonist is not a widower lawyer but the widowed wife of a sheriff left to fend for herself after her husband is killed.Benton creates his characters with a loving hand but that does not mean he doesn't see the flaws in the people there the racism the sexism the hypocrisy and the pettiness. Field's husband Ray Baker is killed by a drunken black man accidentally. Killing a law enforcement official probably would have gotten him legally executed in any event but the town administers its own brand of justice to the perpetrator.That being said it still doesn't solve the problem of a woman who has no education or training to support herself and her family. Sally gets the idea to grow cotton on the few acres her husband left her and gets a pair of strange allies in John Malkovich and Danny Glover to help her.Glover is an itinerant hobo who is the one who if he knows anything knows cotton from his sharecropping background.

There's a subplot in the film involving her and her philandering husband Ed Harris.Robert Benton won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Best Director and Sally Field won her second Oscar for Places in the Heart. Her character isn't as feisty as her first Oscar winner Norma Rae but Edna Spalding certainly has the same grit.Period country and gospel music make up the soundtrack for Places in the Heart. Old line Protestant hymns Blessed Assurance begins the film and In The Garden is the theme for the surreal ending.I can't describe the ending except that it is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. It's a vision of what promise we have either in heaven or a utopia we make on earth where the things that divide humankind are washed away and we are in fellowship with each other and our Maker.You have to have a heart of diamond if you are not moved by Places in the Heart.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Robert Benton wrote and directed Places in the Heart he created his own Citizen Kane. Like Orson Welles he will spend the rest of his life trying to better it and won't succeed.Places in the Heart takes place in Waxahachie Texas in 1935 and our director was born there in 1932. The film is a personal vision of his childhood in that small Texas town. It bears a whole lot of resemblance to To Kill a Mockingbird except that the adult protagonist is not a widower lawyer but the widowed wife of a sheriff left to fend for herself after her husband is killed.Benton creates his characters with a loving hand but that does not mean he doesn't see the flaws in the people there the racism the sexism the hypocrisy and the pettiness. Field's husband Ray Baker is killed by a drunken black man accidentally. Killing a law enforcement official probably would have gotten him legally executed in any event but the town administers its own brand of justice to the perpetrator.That being said it still doesn't solve the problem of a woman who has no education or training to support herself and her family.

	schema:headline " Memorable Depression era tale of a rural Southern widow";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a wonderful film which unfortunately I haven't seen for some years so forget many of the subtleties. Sally Field is superb in the role of the Depression era Texas widow Emma Spalding and deserved her second Oscar which showed that yes we really do like her. I always love this actress who is especially compelling in the dramatic Norma Rae and charming in the romantic comedy Murphy's Romance.The film tells the tale of a good kind loving and strong woman the widow Emma who has been left with with two children to raise on her own and the pair of disparate characters who help her to literally 'save the farm'...the black drifter Moze who plants her cotton and the intriguing blind border Mr. Will that she is forced to take on to appease the nasty banker. Because of mortgage difficulties Emma's farm and in fact her life are always in the hands of the local bank manager. The unlikely bond between the trio Emma Moze and Mr. Will and their shared struggle is always the very heart of the film. There are however other local small town characters portrayed here including a subplot revolving around a pair of married folk engaged in an adulterous affair.It's all so much more meaningful than yet another film about a widow's romance. I don't know that the local couple's affair contributes much to the movie unless Hollywood style there just had to be some sexual implications of some sort or other somewhere. Many others seem to agree that this subplot is superfluous.The other major roles are well cast with Danny Glover and John Malkovich sympathetically portraying respectively Moze and Mr. Wills. As for the man involved in the affair Ed Harris whom I actually kinda like always does a brilliant job portraying any sort of somewhat sleazy character!Memorable moments...One moving scene has lingered in my mind all these years when the newly widowed Emma helps prepare the body of her sheriff husband Royce for burial. This is of course so alien to us today when compared with our modern detached funeral parlors. There is an amazing tornado scene wonderfully photographed that brilliantly conveys the terror of the characters seeking shelter. Plenty of high drama there! The movie also has antiracism themes with a dramatic scenario involving some local Ku Klux Klan members or equivalent in which Mr. Will plays a pivotal role. And a fabulous touching scene where Emma dances at a community shindig with her young son Frank. I recalled it vividly a few years later during a 'first dance' with my own son.Certainly not an action flick but a thoughtful touching heartwarming story with very sympathetic characters that will engage you and earn a place in YOUR heart. The movie has a quietly dramatic ending some have questioned but I personally found it perfect. As another reviewer cleverly noted it 'seals' the film.".

The photography and music is perfect especially the totally appropriate church songs.  Set in a small central Texas town during the Depression this film shows what a complete lie is perpetuated by Gone With the Wind and its depiction of the happy cottonpicking slaves prior to the Civil War.  Edna Spaulding Field who has led a relatively sheltered life until tragedy suddenly strikes and uproots her entire family life as she has known it must endure what the happy slaves once endured for years.  And the final scene  well there is no way to say anything about it to keep from ruining it other than It comes totally unexpected.  Roger Ebert didn't like it because it didn't fit with the rest of the movie.  I couldn't disagree more.  Roger often misses the point of a movie's ending.  This is one scene that I could watch over and over and it makes me tear up every time.  At its core is a deeply held spiritual belief that transcends all other concerns.  This is a must see movie!

Within it is a major if not the major theme of the film. I think you should include it among your memorable quotesBetween what matters and what seems to matter how will the world we know choose wisely? Most of the film involves characters making choices many of them difficult some of them lifethreatening. These choices are put into startling relief by the ending sequence of the movie. Although it would be a disservice to summarize Benton's story as just a parable for our times his comment about choices is extremely thoughtprovoking.It is a challenging question for all of us.Rick".

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILER This film is extraordinary simply because it is outstandingly written directed and acted. During the closing scene which perplexes some I literally gasped out loud the first time that I saw it in a theater. At the time I was writing reviews for an artmusic magazine and the experience was totally unexpected. I went five consecutive nights and took a different friend parent or family member each night. We discussed those closing images for months.Every actor excels in accomplishment even the minor ones such as Lane Smith as the banker Jay Patterson as Sheriff Royce Spaulding and especially Ray Baker as W.E. Simmons the everrighteous and arrogant Klan member. These people are as memorable as those we meet and get to know in our own lives and they stay with us through our lifetimes just like Charles Foster kane Elwood P. Dowd and Scarlett O'Hara and so many many important others from the celluloid world. If they handed out Academy Awards for minor roles why don't they they give everyone else one? all three of these actors would have won. Lindsay Crouse was nominated for Best Supporting actress Sally Fields won Best Actress and Robert Benton took the prize for Best Screenplay. It was also nominated for Best Costume Design Best Director and the Best Picture of the Year.The scene of Edna Spaulding negotiating a price for her cotton with W.E. Simmons the Klansman who thinks he will bulldoze the poor widow for some extra profit is a treasure all in and of itself.The affair also perplexing and out of place for many commentators is essential it truly cements in the viewers eye and before the eye of the storm crashes inhow the pressure of small town life is closing in around the throat of Amy Madigan's character Viola Kelsey a pressure mostly created by her own choices. Her lover Wayne Lomax Ed Harris husband to Edna Spaulding's Sally Fields sister Lindsay Crouse is just as frustrated but far more selfdestructing and willing to risk it all for what amounts to nothing even as he dreams about it being more. The film shows the shedding of values and commitments for a little hankypanky that is just as destructive realistically as the tornado or the Klan. Maybe more so which I think was the point of Benton's adding it as a subplot. Viola may blame the storm for her obsessive desire to get out of town but the male characters and the audience know better.Each character such as John Malkovich's obsession with his precious records has a special something they prize and hold onto but eventually find valueless in the process of surviving with those around them. Danny Glover's Moze though is forced by the Klan to give up the most richly given gift in the movie friendship and the comfort of a home that he loves because he has been spiritually loved there.The lethal tornado outside of themselves and their decisions is the only real monster in the lives of these good and hardworking Americans. The Depression is just a condition they live with. The bank and the banker Lane Smith make life tough while meaning to be helpful but Edna Spaulding's determination is stronger than a vault of steel. Mother Nature provides the tornado and the Klan provides the bad guy. Willy the boy who shoots the sheriff is actually his friend or as much of one that a young black person could have been to a white sheriff in 1935 Texas. When he reappears in the communion scene that ends the film so much is implied by his presence and that of the deceased husband that the true value of our lives and the things we share becomes explicit without a single word being said about it. My initial gasp was genuine audible and shocking to myself. This film is an artistic achievement rarely matched and is on a personal list of the top 20 American films ever made. As stated like any great film the characters remain with you just like real people you have actually known. There isn't a weak moment of writing or acting in the entire film.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS INCLUDEDOthers have done an excellent job of describing both the plot and the fine lead performances. I think this is a film that speaks strongest to those who have either tried to make a living off the land or havehad grandparents or great grandparents who fought to survive on a hardscrabble farm during the Depression. Spending some time in Texas and getting to know the lay of the land probably ups the enjoyment factor too.Many people have rightly pointed out the superb performances of the leads but the more I watch this film the more impressed I am with the performance of Terry O'Quinn who played Buddy Viola's husband. I'm so used to seeing him play either psychopaths or hardcharging soldiers or ruthless businessmen that it was a real treat to see him play such a normal character. In his short screen time he conveyed warmth tenderness and concern and made you wish that the secondary story of the affair between Wayne and Viola had been fleshed out so you could understand how two people who had apparently loving spouses could decide to cheat on themand by extension their best friends. His performance really sticks with me.I know some people are dismissive of the trio of people who band together as just a handful of cliches but ask yourself How could it have been written any differently? A drifter HAD to be the one to suggest that Mrs. Spaulding grow cotton. As concerned as friends and loved ones were about her they not only lacked money to help her but had seen her as the physically delicate genteel sheriff's wife for so long that it never would have  occurred to them to suggest she take up farming. A stranger had to point that solution out. If the drifter had been white the underlying messages about racism and prejudice would have been lostand the film would have been poorer for itand some audience members would have been disappointed that the drifter and the widow didn't get together. Because the racial divides of this time and place have already been graphically illustrated the audience doesn't expect a typical Hollywood foray into a romantic subplot. As for the blind character he was there because he had nowhere else to go and the way he became a boarder pointed out how under the thumb of anyone who had money andor power people like Edna were. She didn't want to take in a sightless boarder she was pressured into it. If he could have seen he would have been living by himself and the vignette that very powerfully delineated how the bank held Edna's life in its hands would have been lost.I like this film so much I watch it oftenand there's the rub. The more I see it the more I wish the adultery subplot had been developed the more I wish minor characters like the dance band leader or the flashylooking beauty shop customer had been fleshed out. I start to wonder why the sisters laugh when one mentions who made the funeral cake. Was she a notoriously bad cook or a good one that bragged constantly about her baking prowess? The most startling thing I noticed on a recent viewing was how quickly the crux of the filmwill backbreaking labor save the farm?really played out. When we see characters out in the hot sun literally crawling on the groundto get the crop in I felt like these poor souls had spent months like this. I suddenly realized that it had to be about a week or two. I'm NOT belittling the effort it takes to plant chop and pick cotton. I was just a little shocked to figure out how compressed all that exhausting harvesting time was. See what I mean about watching a film too much?I love this film. I'm glad I saw it the first time. I hope to enjoy it as much the tenth or twentieth time I see it. It's a great antidote for those days when I just want to give up because I'm broke andor have too much to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Places in the Heart was one of three Hard Times Down On The Farm films released in 19841985.  The other two were Country with Jessica Lange and The River with Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek.  Places is the one that sticks solidly in most viewer's minds if for no other reason than the fact that Sally Field won her second oscar for her role as Edna Spalding.  Having recently posted my comments regarding The River I dusted off the old vhs copy of Places that I have in my collection and gave it another viewing. It had been years since I had seen it and remembered little about it except for ending which as others have noted sticks in your mind but more about that later.All three of these films revolve around the same theme which is trying not to lose the farm with one problem after another cropping up like an acre of cotton.  On top of that in Places we scenes of racial hatred and adultery just to be sure there is enough misery for everyone to conquer in the film's almost two hour running time.  Not to worry though as it moves along from scene to scene at a fast clip thanks to some good performances not only by Fields but everyone involved.In the beginning of the film Edna's husband Royce Ray Baker who is also the town sheriff is called out to take care of a black kid named Wiley De'vooreaux White who is drunk and shooting off a pistol aimlessly. Frank is accidentally killed by Wylie and his body is carried home to the now widowed Edna and their two children Frank and Possum.  In those days not having any money you just took care of the body yourself so in a difficult to watch scene Edna and her sister Margaret prepare Royce's body for a funeral burial.  Wylie is tied to the back of a truck dragged along the road till he dies then dragged up to the front of the Spaulding home. Then his body is taken out and is given back to Wylie's family and friends by hanging it from a tree for them to cut down.  And that's just in the first fifteen minutes or so of Places In The Heart.Later Edna meets Moze Danny Glover who offers to help her around the farm in exchange for a place to sleep and some food.  She refuses at first but after Moses steals some silverware from her and is apprehended and brought back she lies about the stolen silverware to not only save him but so that he can help her with a cotton crop in order to save the farm. Shortly thereafter this Edna is forced to take in a blind man named Mr. WillJohn Malkovich as a border in order to show good faith to the bank that she will meet her house payment.The majority of the time in the film is spent dealing with Edna along with her two children Moze's and Mr. Will developing a bond of friendship along with Edna's and Moze's attempt to get their cotton crop planted and harvested.  As in all films of this genre there are many obstacles that they have to overcome before we get to a final resolution.As I mentioned earlier the problem with Places in the Heart is not the acting.  Everyone involved is terrific with Fields Glover and Malkovich exceptional as always.  What's wrong with this film is that at times it loses it's focus. It seems to want to be a character study of people triumphing over tragedy then suddenly it wanders off into a story about racial hatred and just for good measure it throws in an adultery story with Wayne Ed Harris dividing his time between his wife Margret and his already married mistress Viola Amy Madigan.  It is this subplot that writerdirector Robert Benton could easily have left on the cutting room floor.  It's an unnecessary distraction and seems totally out of place with the rest of the film doing nothing more than increase the running time. It's as if Benton wanted to be sure everyone got their moneys worth or at the very least have time to finish their popcorn and soda.Some of the comments posted here have mentioned the ending which they consider somehow to be intensely moving.  I found it to be quite heavy handed myself and hurts the film more than helps it as you are left staring at the screen saying HUH?Despite it's faults Places in the Heart is still worth watching just to watch the lead actors at the top of their craft.  It is beautifully photographed but not close to the sumptuous cinematography of The River nicely paced so it doesn't bog down has well written characters that we can believe existed in Texas during the depression and does capture a nice feel for that era. Robert Benton pulls no punches in telling us this story of the American Spirit but reminds us in the process that there was also an ugly part of American History that should never be commended let alone forgotten.  For not pulling any punches in that regard I admire him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Places in the Heart is a very strong extremely well made drama that takes place during the Depression in the mid30s. Sally Field gives a powerful Oscarwinning performance as Edna Spaulding a wife and mother of two kids who becomes widowed after a drunk accidentally shoots her husband. To make matters worse she's on the verge of losing her home because of a lack of money to pay off the mortgage. So she decides to make some money by planting cotton. She takes in a very friendly black man wonderfully played by Danny Glover in one of his early film roles who helps her get and plant the cotton and a smart blind man played by John Malkovich in an Oscarnominated performance who's a paying boarder. These three adults and the two children form a little family together and this is the part of Places in the Heart that works best. There are other characters that add to the story. Lindsey Crouse was also Oscarnominated for her portrayl of Field's sister who comes to help out after tragedy strikes early on. Ed Harris plays Crouse's husband who's having an affair with a woman Amy Madigan or the reallife Mrs. Ed Harris who's a close friend of Crouse's. This affair subplot is rather unnecessary and it slows down the momentum a bit. But it's only a minor setback to an otherwise strong film. All the performances are topnotch. Field has never been better. She's the one you can't take your eyes off in this movie. Glover Malkovich Crouse Harris and Madigan offer great support. Places in the Heart comes from Robert Benton the same man who made the outstanding 1979 Oscarwinning Best Picture Kramer Vs. Kramer. This movie is based on some of the experiences that Benton went through in reallife during the Depression and he captures the look of the mid1930s beautifully. He was honored with the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Places in the Heart and deservedly so he was also nominated for Best Director but lost that award. This is a terrific film with strong powerful performances. If only that affair subplot had been taken out this movie would have been perfect.12 out of four".

	schema:reviewBody "When the news broke that MGM had the audacity to remake the hallowed 1935 classic Mutiny on the Bounty' starring Clark Gable and Charles Laughton the critics were aghast.  As the news leaked out about trouble in production they whipped themselves into a selfrighteous frenzy.  Brando was a lightening rod for criticism because he was renowned as arrogant hothead.  Compared with Gable who was universally loved and adored Brando was a boor.  It was almost sacrilegious to put Brando in any part Gable had played.  When the film opened it never had a chance.  It was ripped to shreds.  Brando was ridiculed as a lower class character actor who couldn't step up to the part and derided for his dreadful attempt at an English accent.  The film was a box office loser and critics smugly declared they told us so.The film was beset by problems throughout production.  The fullscale replica of the Bounty arrived on location two months after the film was scheduled to begin shooting.  There were three deaths among the film's personnel and the film ran well over budget.  The biggest problems were the result of Brando's constant temper tantrums as he tried to rewrite the entire film from the set.  At least six writers came and went.  After countless confrontations director Carol Reed gave up and quit to be replaced by Lewis Milestone All Quiet on the Western Front'.  Milestone was an utterly intractable director that Brando couldn't bully.  The result was a battle between the immovable object and the irresistible force with daily emotional pyrotechnics that further delayed the film.  Although Milestone usually prevailed in the fracases this film turned out to be his last in a 37year career.Over the years the critics have continued to pillory the film but the public generally receives it more favorably as time passes.  Though I often disagree with the masses in this case I concur.  Having seen both the 1935 and 1962 versions I prefer the latter.  Gable is clearly more charming and dashing in the role but Brando gives the more complete performance. Gable's Christian seems far less ruffled by the events that transpire on the Bounty whereas Brando accomplishes a believable transition from the cavalier rogue to an honorable hero who endures selftorment over the treasonous act.  Though Brando's English accent is oft ridiculed I have heard far worse.  Part of the problem probably stemmed from the fact that the accent he attempted to imitate was very upper crust and he delivered it with a certain sneering tone that made it seem like he was mocking the English.  Just hearing that accent from the same lips that gave us I coulda been a contenda' was a kind of ironic comedy unto itself.Between the Bligh portrayed by Charles Laughton and that depicted by Trevor Howard in the remake Howard wins hands down for pure detestability.  Most of the production values such as music set design and costumes were superior in the remake.  Moreover the remake was more historically accurate than the original.The film features a youthful Richard Harris in the role of Mills who gives an excellent performance of the petulant sailor.  Also noteworthy is the lovely Tarita a native Tahitian who plays Christian's love interest Maimiti and does a scorching belly dance.  This was Tarita's only film but to anyone who has seen the film she will not be soon forgotten.This is an excellent film.  It was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture but it was shut out trampled by Lawrence of Arabia'.  It is highly entertaining with wonderful costumes props and sets fabulous locations and photography and some terrific performances.  Though many will disagree I rated it a 1010.  If one can step back from the controversy that swirled around this film when it debuted it is an easy film to enjoy.".

Trevor Howard's Bligh is one of the most underrated performances in the world.

Brando gave a solid performance.Trevor Howard was convincing as the sadistic Captain Bligh and Tarita was fair as the love interest Maimiti.

There are some beautiful shots in here beginning with those Tahiti sunsets.

This highbudgeted rendition contains the mightiest excitement that ever swept across the sea or the screen . The Bounty leaves Portsmouth in 1787 . It is commanded by captain Bligh  he was chosen for the mission to Tahiti because he was considered one of the most skilled navigators in the world  having been personally selected by Captain James Cook as Master  title now would be Navigator  on his third voyage around the world . Its objective  to sail to Tahiti and load breadfruit . The Bounty's original reason for going to Tahiti was to transport breadfruit seedlings to Jamaica where they would be cultivated to provide inexpensive food for the slaves working on English plantations . Captain Bligh Trevor Howard he was initially reluctant to play  because he felt he was far too old for the part the real life Lieutenant William Bligh was 33 when the Bounty set sail will do anything to get there as fast as possible  utilizing any means to keep up a rigid discipline . When they arrive at Tahiti  it is like a paradise for the crew Richard Harris  Richard Haydn  Hugh Griffith  Percy Herbert  Gordon Jackson  among others and officers  something totally different than the living hell aboard the boat . On the way back to England 1st Lt. Fletcher Christian Marlon Brando becomes the chief of a rebellion . This is the second adaptation of the vintage story of mutiny during the turbulent voyage based on one of history's greatest true life sea adventure . It's the colorful classic version very well played and with marvelous scenarios . Interesting screenplay tough there are some gaps and flaws  as many writers did uncredited rewrites on the script including Eric Ambler William L. Driscoll Borden Chase John Gay and Ben Hecht . Big budget adaptation as the film cost an estimated 19 million in 1962 which was a huge expenditure at the time . The ship cost 750000 to reconstruct  for almost four decades the ship used in this film has been a popular tourist attraction in St. Petersburg Florida. Visitors get to tour the ship itself and learn more about both the historical H.M.S. Bounty and MGM's two screen versions of the Nordhoff and Hall book . She was reused in Caribbean pirates and was also used in Treasure island  and sank during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. This account of the mutiny led by Fletcher Christian against captain Bligh is highlighted thanks to glamorous cinematography by Robert Surtees  as the last Ultra Panavision film to be shown in the extremely wide screen. Emotive as well as haunting musical score by Bronislau Kaper . Extremely memorable acting by Marlon Brando who brings his own powerful individualism to contrasting role of Trevor Howard with opposing attitude whose inevitable clash receives greatest importance . Interesting portrayal of Fletcher Christian's Marlon Brando and Bligh's Trevor Howard who bears little relation to Mel GibsonAnthony Hopkins version . Furthermore  a sensual and romantic relationship between Marlon Brando and Tarita the Tahitian beauty actress who played Maimiti they met during filming and later married. Secondary cast is frankly excellent  such as Percy Herbert as Seaman Matthew  Duncan Lamont as John Williams  Gordon Jackson as Seaman Edward Noel Purcell a Seaman William  Eddie Byrne as John  Frank Silvera as Minarii and Hugh Griffith was fired during filming when his alcoholism became unmanageable  that is why his character disappears for large portions of the film . Compelling direction by Lewis Milestone who captures the feel of sea and harshness of the times . After the firing of Carol Reed Marlon Brando began to usurp the power of replacement director Lewis Milestone  a wellrespected veteran with two directing Oscars to his credit  in fact  it was last movie directed by Lewis Milestone  he only did two TV episodes after this . Other renditions based on these historical events are the followings  Old and black and white take on titled 'Mutiny on the Bounty 1935' by Frank LLoyd with Clark Gable  Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone and revisionist storytelling titled Bounty by Roger Donalson with Mel Gibson  Anthony Hopkins  Bernard Fox and Liam Neeson .The real deeds are the following  In 1787 Captain Bligh was chose to command HMS Bounty on a voyage to Tahiti where he was to collect breadfruit trees with the object of introducing them to the Caribbean . Ironically the breadfruit seedlings which Bligh brought to Jamaica as an inexpensive food for the slaves working on English plantations were an utter failure  as the slaves took one bite and refused to eat any more . Captain Bligh is determined to reach Tahiti and return with a hold full of breadfruit trees. When the ship sailed after a sixmonth stay on the island Bligh's men mutinied  casting him and a handful of loyal crew members adrift with scant provisions and no chart. Bligh's incredible seamanship brought them safely to Timor after a voyage of 4000 miles. Fletcher Christian and the other mutineers sailed on to the island of Pitcairn. The mutineers' fate remained in mystery for 18 years until their island was discovered by an American whaling ship  they found one man  John Adams with nine women and 23 children. What happened Fletcher Christian remains uncertain some say he was murdered on Pitcairn island but then there were reports that he returned safely to England . However the descendants live on Pitcairn island to this day.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fabulous movie. Sumptuous production good screenplay excellent performances beautiful cinematography and a majestic musical score.Story follows the crew of British Naval vessel 'The Bounty' on its mission to transport 'bread fruit' plants from Tahiti to Jamaica as food for the slaves there. Unrest is almost immediate with the Captain Howard and his first officer Brando disagreeing over the appropriate punishment for a sailor's minor infraction. Things only get worse during the voyage as the harsh Captain responds severely to anything that opposes his ambition to please the admiralty with a speedy voyage. The crew's time spent in the paradise of Tahiti particularly with regard to the naked and willing women fills them with such pleasure that the prospect of a return voyage under such cruelty is unbearable. Events finally reach a summit on the way to Jamaica when a mutiny takes place and the Captain is set adrift with most of those in disagreement with the first officer. However this is far from an absolution for both sides...For many the film is measured by the performance of Marlon Brando in the lead role and it is easy to see why. His first officer Fletcher Christian is unlike anything from him in memory however taken as it is an effeminate fairminded character forced into an extreme dilemma the result is a complicated man extremely well played. Indeed as the film progresses Christian's predicament is increasingly sympathetic and it is to Brando's credit that he remains engaging throughout. His unexpected plea to his fellow mutineers at the end is an extraordinarily conceived and delivered moment in the film.Trevor Howard plays Captain Bligh with poise and relish. The character is completely arrogant and utterly loathsome but never less than believable. This villain is all the more frightening because his cruel methods never stray outside the 'official' Naval regulations as he is keen to point out. Of the supporting players Richard Harris' roguish Mills and Richard Haydn as the Royal botanist and film's narrator make the strongest impressions. Overall acting is very good.Vivid use is made of the exotic island locations on which a considerable time is spent and the vast isolating ocean vistas.Overall impression is of grand scale and spectacle but illustrated with the intelligence and humanity of the scenario. Nearperfect filmmaking in glorious oldfashioned style!".

	schema:headline " Brando deserved an Oscar nomination for his Fletcher Christian...";
	schema:reviewBody "While the initial critical reception given MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY was not as favorable as that given the original 1935 film seen nowadays it is a very impressive telling of the Bounty story with some fine performances and a stirring musical score by Bronislau Kaper that fully captures the mood with some haunting and truly striking themes that give the film added dimension. The pictorial splendor of the technicolor photography at sea and in Tahiti is never less than eyefilling. A thrilling high point is the storm at sea with Kaper's music rising to powerful intensity.Furthermore there are two fascinating performances by Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard. Howard is not quite as showy in the role as the scenerychewing Laughton but his characterization is a bit more complex. Brando does an excellent job as Christian posturing in the manner of a gentleman and speaking with an upper crust British accent that is entirely credible. Indeed when he reaches the mutinous moment in a rage of uncontrolled anger he is at the top of his acting form. Even so some of his most effective moments are quietly underplayed. His performance deserved an Oscar nominationbut with so much bad publicity surrounding the film and the hardships and strains involved in the making Hollywood apparently gave him the cold shoulder. Years later they did the same to Russell Crowe for his bad boy behavior.Technically of course the film is far superior to the BW 1935 GableLaughton film. Gorgeous sunsets are backdrops to the ship at sea and the island scenes in Tahiti are gorgeous to behold. A missing element from the earlier film is the absence of the character played by Franchot Tone. Indeed Tone was nominated for a Best Actor award along with Gable. There are numerous other differences but this take on the story is a good one every bit as valid as the 1935 film.With all of the bad publicity surrounding the film relegated to the past we can look at this film with a fresh viewpoint today and enjoy it for the entertaining blockbuster that it is. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as I can recall 1962's Mutiny on the Bounty was one of the many matineefilms shown for many years during Christmas that I used to watch lazily as a kid while doing other things at the same time. I do not think I ever watched the whole thing from beginning to end. Consequently I never found it too fascinating.When I many years later decided to buy it on VHS and watch it concentratedly I fell in love with it immediately. I have always been a fan of largescale films like Ben Hur Doctor Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia and Mutiny is definitely a largescale film. Not only boasting a wide variety of colourful locations from breathtaking sundrenched sea vistas to exotic beachscapes on Tahiti it also includes some great actors such as Marlon Brando Richard Harris and Trevor Howard as the despicable captain Bligh. Contributing to the largescale feel is Bronislau Kaper's lush and magic music score featuring haunting chorus statements of the main theme interestingly entitled Follow me. The music was so lovely that I had to try out the theme on the piano once I finished watching the film.I suppose most readers of this post are already familiar with the basic plotline so I will not have to go through that.I find that the film contains quite a lot of nice dialogue that sticks in your memory. But it is above all the growing conflict aboard the ship that is the major interesting theme of the film. Just to see how the conflict between Bligh and Christian builds step by step from more or less nothing to mutiny. Even though it is unpleasant it is a delight to follow. In any case it had me glued to the screen.I cannot say whether the events are portrayed authentically as they happened historically or not but to me that is of minor interest. The film comes out magnificent all the same and appear to me to be quite realistic.Another thing about the film that appealed to me is that it is so beautiful. Not only are the locations beautiful but a lot of the actors their contemporary clothing not to mention the Tahitian beauties are simply eyecatching. The Bounty the ship itself is also quite something else. A lot of the film's beauty I believe also has to do with good photography thoughout. The film lends itself incredibly well to widescreenviewing.I would heartily recommend this film to any fan of cinema. It is a film filled to the brim with colour and spectacle with marvelous actors and a catching and disturbing story of power abuse and the British Empire in its heyday. The only disturbing thing at the moment of writing is that it still has not been released on DVD. But when it is I sincerely hope it comes in a deservedly magnificent picture and soundtransfer including a mountain of extras. I simply cannot wait.".

	schema:headline " A highly entertaining and unrated sea classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1962 remake of 'Mutiny On The Bounty' has received many scathing attacks from some of the most prolific film critics throughout the years. It has been regarded as an overlong overblown epic which boasted an outrageous performance from Marlon Brando as the heroic captain's mate Fletcher Christian. I believe that these initial reviews have been nothing short of harsh.The 1935 version boasted a superb cast and was then regarded as a epitome of the classic story filmmaking. It is now regarded as a slackly told adventure yet highly entertaining. So when the remake was in production in 1960 the critics' began to relish the possibility of another turkey. The 1935 version was still clear in the memory. The rumours of discontent on the set and other production follies only assisted in tarnishing the reputation of the movie long before it was even released.This movie is in fact a highly entertaining sea story. It is sweeping and visually beautiful with a haunting musical score from Bronislau Kaper. It is in my opinion that Brando's performance was a brave if unsuccessful attempt to show a different side of Fletcher Christian. Brando's performance expresses a hero who suffers personal turmoil with the problems he experiences on the HMS Bounty. It is also unfair that many English critics have leapt upon Brando's accent. I am Irish and I have to listen to a multitude of strange Irish accents from many classic movies. It is in my view that Brando's accent seems to be a genuine foppish English accent which may not have been too far removed from the truth. The real Fletcher Christian was only 22 years of age when the Bounty sailed and he was a renowned ladies man.Trevor Howard's performance of the rogue Captain William Bligh is masterful even if he was another overaged star to take on the role The real Bligh was only 33 years old. The other performances are excellent especially from Richard Harris Tarita and Hugh Griffith.This movie is no worse than the 1935 version. It does have faults but it is a genuinely beautiful movie to watch. The 1962 version of 'Mutiny On The Bounty' is not a testament on the problems of remaking of a classic adventure movie but of the real fact that critics really do get their facts wrong.".

	schema:headline " A quality production and one of the great epic movies of the 1960s.";
	schema:reviewBody "MGM's 1962 remake of their own 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty makes the older film look hokey at best and like an outright joke at worst.  The newer version takes a far more realistic and honest look at every facet of the legendary mutiny.  The movie potrays the two key characters in the story Captain Bligh Trevor Howard and Fletcher Christian Marlon Brando as real men and not like the cardboard cutouts as was the case in the 1935 version.Howard's Bligh is brilliant and not at all like the prancing cartoonish Charles Laughton version in '35.  And when it comes to Christian the protaganist of the mutiny Brando makes an admirable effort to capture the essence of the the fopish and aristocratic character as portrayed in the Nordhoff and Hall book upon which both MGM Bountys are based.  Brando becomes Christian in the 1935 movie Clark Gable as Christian is just Gable as Gable and that's that.  Richard Harris as crew member Mills is another solid portrayal in the 1962 movie.Don't get me wrong the 1935 movie's fun but the 1962 movie is infinitely more impressive in all respects especially its use of a real ship made just for the film the awesome shots of life at see in the late 1700s and of course the spectacular location filming in Tahiti.1935's Mutiny on the Bounty was a fine film in its day but it doesn't stand the test of time 1962's film stands that test.  Is it a great movie probably not but it is a very good one.  Considering that MGM did not deliver the ship on time for filming before the bad weather set in in Tahiti MGM's firing of legendary director Carol Reed and other miscalculations mainly attributable to producer Aaron Rosenberg the film is a remarkable achievement.The studio used an offform  Lewis Milestone as a replacement for director Reed.  Once they decided that Reed wasn't their cup of tea they just tried to slide by with Milestone instead of securing the services of one of the many still vital directing greats working in the early 1960s.  A movie of epic proportions like 1962's Mutiny on the Bounty cried out for a William Wyler a David Lean or a Fred Zinneman to take over the helm once Reed was canned.When the movie didn't hit like gangbusters MGM's publicity machine moved quickly to sandbag their star and the lemmings of the early 60s entertainment press corps swallowed the studio's propaganda whole.  It was openseason on Brando and it was shameful but anybody who has seen the movie and also read the book knows that Brando's Christian is a very solid performance.  I'm sure Brando was peevish and nettlesome at times during production Trevor Howard says as much in his biography but to blame Brando for the film's bloated final cost and its lack of epic earnings is ludicrous.I love 1962's Mutiny on the Bounty it should have been better but its still one beautiful movie. It is an underappreciated and highly underrated movie.  I strongly recommend it to me calling Brando and Howard's Mutiny on the Bounty of 1962 a minor film as one IMDb movie fan recently did is blasphemous.  The truth is MGM just fumbled the ball on Mutiny on the Bounty in 1962 despite all of their ineptitude during production they still had what should have been a major hit.  But they opened it as a roadshow movie in just a few theatres nation wide instead of in as many theatres as possible like the studios do with all major movies today. Despite MGM's poor efforts 41years ago movie fans today can scoop up the old lion's fumble and enjoy this exciting high seas adventurelove story.It took a better book Richard Hough's Mr. Bligh and Mr. Christian to produce a better movie rendition of the true life Mutiny on the Bounty. That book was the basis for the magnificent The Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins as Bligh and Mel Gibson as Christian.  Also adding lustre to that movie were Liam Neeson and Daniel DayLewis.".

	onyx:emotionText "MGM's 1962 remake of their own 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty makes the older film look hokey at best and like an outright joke at worst.  The newer version takes a far more realistic and honest look at every facet of the legendary mutiny.  The movie potrays the two key characters in the story Captain Bligh Trevor Howard and Fletcher Christian Marlon Brando as real men and not like the cardboard cutouts as was the case in the 1935 version.Howard's Bligh is brilliant and not at all like the prancing cartoonish Charles Laughton version in '35.  And when it comes to Christian the protaganist of the mutiny Brando makes an admirable effort to capture the essence of the the fopish and aristocratic character as portrayed in the Nordhoff and Hall book upon which both MGM Bountys are based.  Brando becomes Christian in the 1935 movie Clark Gable as Christian is just Gable as Gable and that's that.  Richard Harris as crew member Mills is another solid portrayal in the 1962 movie.Don't get me wrong the 1935 movie's fun but the 1962 movie is infinitely more impressive in all respects especially its use of a real ship made just for the film the awesome shots of life at see in the late 1700s and of course the spectacular location filming in Tahiti.1935's Mutiny on the Bounty was a fine film in its day but it doesn't stand the test of time 1962's film stands that test.  Is it a great movie probably not but it is a very good one.  Considering that MGM did not deliver the ship on time for filming before the bad weather set in in Tahiti MGM's firing of legendary director Carol Reed and other miscalculations mainly attributable to producer Aaron Rosenberg the film is a remarkable achievement.The studio used an offform  Lewis Milestone as a replacement for director Reed.  Once they decided that Reed wasn't their cup of tea they just tried to slide by with Milestone instead of securing the services of one of the many still vital directing greats working in the early 1960s.  A movie of epic proportions like 1962's Mutiny on the Bounty cried out for a William Wyler a David Lean or a Fred Zinneman to take over the helm once Reed was canned.When the movie didn't hit like gangbusters MGM's publicity machine moved quickly to sandbag their star and the lemmings of the early 60s entertainment press corps swallowed the studio's propaganda whole.  It was openseason on Brando and it was shameful but anybody who has seen the movie and also read the book knows that Brando's Christian is a very solid performance.  I'm sure Brando was peevish and nettlesome at times during production Trevor Howard says as much in his biography but to blame Brando for the film's bloated final cost and its lack of epic earnings is ludicrous.I love 1962's Mutiny on the Bounty it should have been better but its still one beautiful movie.

	schema:reviewBody "When the legend becomes fact film the legend to adapt the famous quotation from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The story is the wellknown one of how a British naval crew while on a voyage to transport breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indies revolt against their brutal and sadistic captain under the leadership of the humane first mate and sail off to make a new life for themselves with their Tahitian sweethearts on the remote Pacific island of Pitcairn. Historical evidence in fact suggests that Captain William Bligh was not particularly brutal or sadistic but this film like its 1935 predecessor is a film based upon legend rather than upon strict historical fact.The late 18th century is often described as the Age of Revolution and as the Bounty mutiny took place in 1787 midway between the American and French Revolutions there would have been an obvious temptation to play Bligh as a decadent aristocrat and Fletcher Christian the leader of the rebels as a man of the people standing up for the Rights of the Common Man. The temptation to portray Christian as a protoJacobin is however firmly resisted. In this film it is Christian who is the aristocrat and Bligh ever insecure about his social status who is from a humbler background.This is sometimes regarded as the film which started the decline in Brando's reputation. In his previous film One Eyed Jacks which he had also directed he had gained a reputation as an obsessive perfectionist but artistically the result was a very fine film with an excellent performance from Brando himself. In Mutiny on the Bounty however Brando proved to be equally obsessive but the resulting film is not quite in the same class. Moreover Brando's performance is one of his weaker ones. Much of the criticism on this side of the Atlantic at least has centred upon his British accent. In terms of phonetic soundvalues in fact Brando's effort is quite a reasonable attempt at an upperclass drawl the real Fletcher Christian the son of a Cumberland farmer would probably have spoken with a strong northern accent but it always sounds strained and unnatural. This sort of linguistic accuracy is probably unnecessary in period dramas anyway. We do not know exactly how people spoke in the 18th century but the available evidence suggests that the difference between British and American accents was much less marked than it is today. I was struck by the contrast with another big American star playing a British naval officer Gregory Peck in Captain Horatio Hornblower. Although Peck's accent still sounds American it also sounds more natural and is less distracting to the viewer.The main problem however is not Brando's accent but rather the way in which his character is played. Christian is played not only as an aristocrat but also as a languid foppish dandy. Bligh accuses him of hating both effort and ambition and there appears to be some justice in the accusation. For too long Christian remains a passive emotionless character so the clash of temperaments between him and Bligh remains a muted one. Only during the mutiny itself does he come alive. The idea was presumably to show that Bligh was such a tyrant that even a passionless fop could be roused to anger by his behaviour but this conception seems to me to waste much of the dramatic potential inherent in the story.Brando apart however I found this a reasonably good film. Trevor Howard's portrayal of Bligh as a tyrannical martinet may have been historically inaccurate but it was certainly convincing. Even so I still think that the best of the three actors to play the part was Anthony Hopkins in the 1984 version which portrayed Bligh in a less onedimensional way. Clark Gable remains the best Christian. The film is attractively shot especially the Tahitian scenes and Lewis Milestone handles the direction in such a way as to ensure that the story does not drag as it easily could have done in a film of this length. The film takes three hours to tell a story that the 1935 and 1984 versions told in just over two. Although it is not quite as good as the 1935 version it is still a very watchable epic of the sea. 710".

Bligh was only 34 years old only a few years older than Christian. Nor was he by any accounts considered a cruel captain. The punishment he gave to the deserters on Tahiti were far milder than the usual execution prescribed by law. Nor was there any case of him denying water to a dying sailor.

	schema:reviewBody "I first heard of this movie in the spring of 1996.  It surprised me to learn that there was a remake to the 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty which I had recently watched for the 10th time.  I hardly figured that the likes of a slurring Marlon Brando as Fletcher Christian and a cast of personally unfamiliar characterswho was Trevor HowardI asked myself could top the swashbuckling Clark Gable as Christian and the ripping story that the cast of the 1935 gem pulled off.  How wrong I was to doubt the 1962 Mutiny on the Bounty. I loved it! I do not think that it is better than the 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty but it stands as a different take.  While the older Mutiny told a by the numbers highseas adventure with sword fights and glitzy hollywood melodrama the 1962 version turns out to as less of an action movie and more of a drama.  It chooses to downplay the story more to better concentrate on the surprisly complex characters.  How complex? Take the tormented Mr. Fryer Captain Bligh's 3rd in command.  He sees the wrongful treatment that his captain is giving the crew but he does not want to go against the navy. On the other hand there is McCoy the old 30 year veteransomeone who seemly would have experienced cruelty similar to Bligh'swho mutinied along with the younger members.  Then there is Brown who ever the gentleman tries to be loyal to Blighbut in the end he must obey his gentle ways and go against the captain's harsh methods. Although Mills plays a key role in the film his character does not hold much mystery the captain overreacts too much and he does not think it right. He does something about it.  All of these different characters and more play off one another beautifully.  When the mutiny does happen watching them work togetheror against each other is truly beautiful. The production values stir the soul.  The gigantic bounty the breathtaking location footage of Tahiti the vast panaramic shots of the Atlantic Ocean and the loudproud moody score accented with Tahitian percussion.  The dialogue is quick clever and too the point.All of these elements help to elevate the core story in Mutiny on the Bounty Bligh and Christian. As Bligh Trevor Howard changes the character immortalized by Charles Laughten in the 1935 version.  Instead of inhuman demonic tyrant Howard portrays Bligh simply as an excruciatingly stern captain focuseda little overzealously on doing the best job that he can. If his mean do not pursue his goals with the same fervor. He gets impatient then frustrated then angry and then violent all in quick succession.  He makes for a very realistically workaholic without a life and he wants everyone else to be a workaholic too. I thought Clark Gable's Fletcher Christian could not be topped...until I saw Marlon Brando undergo a sheer transformation playing the role. After seeing Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT and the equally American THE GODFATHER I could not imagine him playing 18th Century British officer...but he did. Brando perfects the haughty posturing walk.  He perfects the clipped accented speech.  He perfects the foppish effeminate walk of a true English gentlemen of highborn connections.  Brando does it so remarkably well that one cannot imagine such sissified character leading a mutiny against a tyrannical man like Bligh. Brando's transformation of Christian from sissy to mutiny leader baffles. Unlike Gable he doesn't gloss over the decision to be a mutineer. Gable made it look easy and as the right thing to do.  Realistically is it the right thing to do? To throw away your career that you worked hard for? To throw away your life? All for the sake of a feeling a moral belief? It may sound hard but when faced with a such a delimma it can be agonizing...which is exactly what Brando captures to a tee right down to the last frame.Mutiny on the Boutny 1962 truly needs to be seen.  Please don't listen to critics.  This movie is fantastic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been dealing with the mutiny on the Bounty for a long time. So I know what I am talking about. Now I have seen this movie and I am more than just disappointed. The film is so false in nearly every aspect. First of all here Christian and Bligh are immortal enemies from the beginning on but that is completely wrong. Bligh even wanted Christian to sail with him because the two of them were very good friends and trusted each other. Also Bligh was a very good Captain and was against corporal punishment at least on the way to Tahiti. On the way to Tahiti only one man was punished but he was not whipped! and this happened on order of Fryer and not Bligh. Also Christian wasn't arrogant at all no he was not even very selfconfident. Christian hadn't got greasy hair and he hadn't a firm look his eyes were fearsome and he was very kind and Bligh wasn't tall! Also he wasn't first Officer from the beginning at first this was mister Fryer. But then Fryer and Bligh quarrelled a lot and so he made Christian his first Officer after Cape Horn. And Bligh only became more of a tyrant when he noticed that his men didn't want to leave Tahiti. The crew members never wore weapons on Tahiti and they had Tattoos made and merged totally with the Tahitians. Also the deserters were gone for three weeks and it was not Christian who captured them it was Fryer. The personalities of Bligh Christian Fryer and the others are untrue and distorted. And Bligh even if he harassed his crew on the way away from Tahiti he never let his crew starving or dying of thirst or anything like that and no one killed himself! Indeed only two man died till the mutiny Seaman Valentine who was seriously wounded at Cape Horn and the Surgeon who died because of his alcoholism. During the mutiny no one died. And nobody died because of Bligh no one! That is just fiction! During the whole voyage only four man were whipped the three deserters and the one who had let them go. Also Christian didn't want to start a mutiny he wanted to steal a boat and sail back to Tahiti on his own but when the others pressed him he agreed to lead the mutiny because he was so desperate because he was so much in love with Maimiti. And the mutineers started the mutiny at night and surprised the sleeping Bligh in his bed. No one was even wounded! Also the mutiny was a confused mess and Christian wasn't strong like in the movie only desperated and deeply wounded in his soul it is also a fact that he threatened Bligh who reminded him of their friendship to kill him and than himself if he wouldn't shut up. Christian himself and most of the others not like in this film didn't mutinied because of Bligh's madness he mutinied because he wanted back to his wife. And he wanted her to come with him as much as she wanted to come with him the two of them loved each other very much! It was all about love. And Bligh wasn't punished at all for his actions on the Bounty! Also Christian not just found Pitcairn per accident he searched for it! And they destroyed the Bounty immediately after they arrived on Pitcairn and though some felt sorry for it all of them agreed to destroy the ship. Christian did not die by trying to rescue the ship soon after they arrived! No! All of them lived a peaceful life on Pitcairn for at least three years. Then a few of the white and all the Tahitians were killed but then they lived in peace for many decades. No one knows for sure what happened to Christian but fact is he lived in peace on Pitcairn for at least three years.         Only to list a few of the main mistakes of this movie but there are more many more mistakes.If you want to see an authentic picture of the mutiny than I suggest The Bounty with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins not only that it is very close to the facts also the persons who did what and how they were are truthful and the actors fit exactly to the descriptions we have from each person of the crew. So you really get to understand both Christian and Bligh. And you learn what really happened! That movie is fascinating.So if you see this Brandomovie please don't believe that you know what the mutiny was all about. This film is completely wrong! And if you know just a little about the mutiny you know that it is. Bligh wasn't a senseless tyrant and Christian wasn't an arrogant hero. They were both victims of the circumstances.Think of this if you watch that wrong film.".

Also the deserters were gone for three weeks and it was not Christian who captured them it was Fryer. The personalities of Bligh Christian Fryer and the others are untrue and distorted. And Bligh even if he harassed his crew on the way away from Tahiti he never let his crew starving or dying of thirst or anything like that and no one killed himself! Indeed only two man died till the mutiny Seaman Valentine who was seriously wounded at Cape Horn and the Surgeon who died because of his alcoholism. During the mutiny no one died. And nobody died because of Bligh no one! That is just fiction! During the whole voyage only four man were whipped the three deserters and the one who had let them go. Also Christian didn't want to start a mutiny he wanted to steal a boat and sail back to Tahiti on his own but when the others pressed him he agreed to lead the mutiny because he was so desperate because he was so much in love with Maimiti. And the mutineers started the mutiny at night and surprised the sleeping Bligh in his bed. No one was even wounded! Also the mutiny was a confused mess and Christian wasn't strong like in the movie only desperated and deeply wounded in his soul it is also a fact that he threatened Bligh who reminded him of their friendship to kill him and than himself if he wouldn't shut up. Christian himself and most of the others not like in this film didn't mutinied because of Bligh's madness he mutinied because he wanted back to his wife. And he wanted her to come with him as much as she wanted to come with him the two of them loved each other very much! It was all about love. And Bligh wasn't punished at all for his actions on the Bounty! Also Christian not just found Pitcairn per accident he searched for it! And they destroyed the Bounty immediately after they arrived on Pitcairn and though some felt sorry for it all of them agreed to destroy the ship. Christian did not die by trying to rescue the ship soon after they arrived! No! All of them lived a peaceful life on Pitcairn for at least three years. Then a few of the white and all the Tahitians were killed but then they lived in peace for many decades. No one knows for sure what happened to Christian but fact is he lived in peace on Pitcairn for at least three years.         Only to list a few of the main mistakes of this movie but there are more many more mistakes.If you want to see an authentic picture of the mutiny than I suggest The Bounty with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins not only that it is very close to the facts also the persons who did what and how they were are truthful and the actors fit exactly to the descriptions we have from each person of the crew. So you really get to understand both Christian and Bligh. And you learn what really happened! That movie is fascinating.So if you see this Brandomovie please don't believe that you know what the mutiny was all about. This film is completely wrong! And if you know just a little about the mutiny you know that it is. Bligh wasn't a senseless tyrant and Christian wasn't an arrogant hero. They were both victims of the circumstances.Think of this if you watch that wrong film.";

The film is blessed with a larger than life cinematography in some of the most beautiful locations on earth. Brando has never looked better and here you could see why this man was considered a legend. Also look for a young Richard Harris as one of the sailors. The film also features some exotic looking women from Tahiti  most notable of course is the pretty Tarita who became Brando's wife and had two children with him. It's a reminder of a time when they really made a big and I mean BIG films who had a long lasting impact on you. Another thing should be pointed out for those of you who shy away from a long running time at almost 3 hours this film is gripping from the first minute to the last. A true classic that is highly recommended 1010.".

Even though I was probably way too young at the time to fully comprehend the story I still loved this movie.  When I was about 9 the tapes mysteriously disappeared from my house. I didn't see this film for years.  About 8 years ago I was in a tape store and saw a copy.  There it was my favorite movie from childhood.  I picked up a copy and went home to watch it.  I was now going to watch it as an adult for the first time since I was about nine.  I still loved this film. Marlon Brando's portrayal as Fletcher Christian is still my favorite Brando role.  Not since The Third Man has Trevor Howard been a character that you want to hate but cannot for some charming reason.  Some people attack this movie because the original is untouchable and must only be praised.  I have seen the original several times and I dare say that even though it is truer to the books it is dreadfully boring.  I have read all three of the books from the Bounty trilogy.  I know that this film doesn't even come close to tell the real tale.  I don't really care though.  This movie is not a nonfiction movie or a documentary it is an epic adventure of fiction with a true story as the basis.  This movie is very entertaining.  It is also very Hollywood but then again so are more than 90 of the movies out there.  If you want to trash this movie for being untrue to the real story than so be it.  If you want to be entertained for 3 hours by an exciting adventure than this is a movie for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the life of me I have never been able to understand why the 1962 version of the Bounty tale is so maligned.  It is a magnificent movie stunningly photographed.  It is not a perfect film but it is undeniably entertaining.  I actually dare I say it? enjoy it more than the original 1935 version that is so revered.I can understand that some viewers balk at Marlon Brando's affected foppishness.  IMO however the actor is taking a calculated risk in attempting to illustrate the profound transformation that Fletcher Christian undergoes as the story progresses.  It does not always ring true but taken as a whole it works very well.  Some moments are brilliant.  By the time we reach the actual mutiny his growing rage which has been suppressed almost imperceptibly up to this point explodes in a massive rush and instantly we see a side of Christian that we weren't quite sure existed.  His selfserving has finally given way to inevitable sympathy for the muchabused crew and even a sort of newfound idealism.However it is Trevor Howard's performance as Lt. Bligh which is the backbone of this movie.  This man IS Bligh.  At first he seems approachable and even affable but each succeeding scene reveals some new brush stroke of character that illustrates the singleminded ruthless soul of stone contained within.  Howard also has this playfully mischievous smile that every now and then leads you to believe that there may be some glimmer of warmth inside the man.  This hope of course is dashed to pieces every time.Mutiny on the Bounty is also a strong example of how a soundtrack can make a film.  This music always gives me goosebumps.  From the overture through intermission to closing it sets the tone of the picture brilliantly as a seafaring dramaadventure.  It sounds like the ocean.  It sounds the way the cinematography looks.  Vast panoramas of blue ocean endless skies lush green tropical islands and most of all the ship itself which was built specifically for this film.  And the icing on the cake is the song Follow Me one of the most hauntingly beautiful melodies ever written for the screen.  To me here I go again it sounds like Tahiti.Watch Mutiny on the Bounty in letterbox and full stereophonic sound and THEN see if you don't like it.".

I have screened that movie many times and each time I screen it emotion and beauty are rising. Not only because of him  all the movie in all its aspects is reaching dramatic and aesthetic perfection.

Rarely such part has been incarnated with such a talent and he overpasses the already memorable Gable's performance. Such a part was more difficult to play  according to me  than many of his acclaimed and rightly acclaimed of courseother previous and next performances.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a flawed but terribly underrated probably much unseen film. The performances are all very good notably Brando's Fletcher Christian and Howard's Bligh. People who like Brando who doesn't? need to watch this for although it is not as famous a film as say On The Waterfront or The Godfather for which he received Oscars he still gives a magnificent complex performance. I've watched the film several times and as is often the case with Brando or any great actor the performance grows on you each time. The greatest actor ever? Perhaps. What is certain is that no actor could ever claim he becomes the person he plays more than Marlon Brando could. As another commenter put it Gable was just being Gable in the 1935 version. It's strange and a shame that this film is not yet available on DVD. I've been watching it on widescreen VHS and it's impressive enough with the great scenery sets and location shooting. Don't miss this one.".

People who like Brando who doesn't? need to watch this for although it is not as famous a film as say On The Waterfront or The Godfather for which he received Oscars he still gives a magnificent complex performance.

Kirk Douglas stars as Jack a hasbeen alcoholic actor who fresh from the asylum is summoned to Rome by his guru the director Maurice Kruger Edward G. Robinson. Also in Rome is the wife that drove Jack into an alcoholic stupor the seductive Carlotta Cyd Charisse. Initially all Jack is to do is direct the dubbing of Kruger's film so he can finish on time and satisfy the Italian producer  but things become more involved.I can't agree with one comment that this is the veiled story of Tyrone Power Linda Christian and Darryl F. Zanuck with circumstances changed to protect the guilty. Certainly the promiscuity aspects are similar Ty took up with Anita Ekberg magazine editor Mary Roblee etc. and Linda wellknown for her exploits like the Cyd Charisse character had an affair with Edmund Purdom. And Power was certainly tied to Zanuck. However the story is pretty Hollywood generic one could probably make the case for other actors' marriages and connection to directors andor producers.Two Weeks is also way over the top which is what Minnelli intended old Roman gluttony. It's a feast of scenery big acting and a wild dramatic story which peaks with Douglas and Charisse in a fast car careening through Rome.Kirk Douglas is great as an actor returning to his past only to find there's nothing there of use. Robinson turns in a excellent performance as a tough yet insecure director who cheats on his emotionally abusive and abused wife yet depends on her like a child its mother. Trevor as the wife is appropriately hurt angry and downright vicious. George Hamilton plays an up and coming actor  as one comment noted this is a stretch he doesn't really register. Charisse gets costar billing but doesn't have much to do but laugh evilly wear glamorous clothes and look seductive. She succeeds.Two Weeks in Another Town is certainly worth a look though it was hard for this viewer to connect with any of the characters. I think it stands alone as neither a prequel or sequel to The Bad and the Beautiful as a story of what it's like to make films in another time  and in another town.".

This time though MGM sprung for color and a location shooting in Rome the other town the title is referring to.If Tyrone Power were alive he might have sued MGM because I believe Kirk Douglas's character of Jack Andrus is based on him and the relationship he had with producer Darryl Zanuck and second wife Linda Christian. In her days Linda was quite the party animal as much as Cyd Charisse portrays here. The Zanuck character is a director named Maurice Krueger played by Edward G. Robinson. Changing him from a producer to a director probably saved a whole lot of legal fees.Very simply the plot is that washed up film actor Douglas who is in a high priced alcoholic asylum as the film opens receives an offer from his former director Robinson to come to Rome to help him with a film that threatens to run behind schedule. Douglas comes to Rome and becomes quite indispensible to Robinson especially after Robinson suffers a heart attack and Douglas has to finish the film.His hedonistic exwife Charisse is also in Rome among many other temptations. It all works out for Douglas but not quite in the way he would have thought.Best performance in the film in my opinion is that of Claire Trevor who is Robinson's shrewish wife based very much on Darryl Zanuck's wife Virginia. According to the Films of Kirk Douglas both Minnelli and Douglas were disappointed in how the film turned out. It certainly doesn't measure up to The Bad and the Beautiful. Douglas blamed it on a botched editing job. That maybe so but my own opinion is that the Code was still in place in 1962 and maybe had this been done ten years later certain things could have been made far more explicit to the audiences.Two Weeks in Another Town is still quite a curiosity catch it if you can.".

Robinson George Hamilton doing an earnest impression of a Method actor none too good I'll agree and Leslie Uggams crooning a siren song whilst reclining amidst the ladies of the evening in a deluxe Roman brothel...well! It just HAS to be seen to be disbelieved! Luvved it!";

	schema:reviewBody "What could be considered the sequel to the classic The Bad and the Beautiful 1952 Two Weeks in Another Town 1962 can be dismissed as trashy and overwrought but this movie has more than enough gusto imagination and directorial brilliance than its poor rating on IMDb suggests. First is the excellent performance by Kirk Douglas. His portrayal of a once famous star reduced to alcoholism and madness is very well observed. His physical frailty and stiffness of movement counteract his past reputation as an overbearing egotistical bully. He cannot be violent any more because his body will not allow it.Another performance of note is by Edward G. Robinson. Showing what a remarkable actor he could be the moment where he lies in bed complaining of the pain being like a harpoon is utterly convincing. Claire Trevor is superb as the annoying bitchy emotional crippled and paranoid wife. Trevor as always is nothing short of brilliant!!Vincente Minnelli is one of the greatest directors to ever work in Hollywood. With Two Weeks in Another Town his mark is made early with the use of a powerful musical score that on its own may be nothing remarkable but playing with the extraordinary images really brings the excitement and intensity of the movie to the foreground. An example of the use of music and image to perfectly compliment each other is during the final climax where Kirk Douglas mad with jealously and drink drives his car on a suicidal rampage. This sequence is pure cinema. The car is clearly shot in a studio with the camera moving around it like the eye of an insane god. The back projection of moving walls roads and trees are used in expressionistic style and often the back projection is simply omitted altogether for smoke and blackness. The dramatic music and wild screams add to the insanity of the sequence. This is Vincente Minnelli effortlessly proving his command of the medium.Another bravura moment of direction is when Douglas walks into a hotel lift only to have his nemesis the beautiful and hedonistic Carlotta played with Cyd Charisse walk in after him. Any other director would have inserted a reaction shot of Kirk Douglas but Vincente Minnelli waits depriving the audience of the shot they expect to see until she arrives at her floor and walks out of the lift. Brilliant.Vincente Minnelli even tries to bend the fourth wall by having Kirk Douglas bemoan the acting profession and berate the audience that sits in the dark watching moving pictures. Technically Minnelli does not break the forth wall but the effect is that suddenly the audience has become a character in the story and for a moment is forced to think of themselves outside the context of the movie. Brilliant yet I assume the studio hated such radicalism.Yes there are some faults in this movie and it is easy to dismiss this work as flashy and trashy but that is missing the point because there is more than enough pure filmmaking in this movie to satisfy any real movie fan.".

He and the others really hit the wall by making this awful film.";

Kirk Douglas as the former Hollywood star in decline and his former collaborator Edward G.

Seems like everyone was going wrong here as Jack's fling with Veronica What's the Difference Dahlia Lavi offered a measure of solace for the brief amount of time he put in finishing Kruger's picture.Considering the principals involved and I haven't even considered them all here this had the makings of a stellar flick and it wasn't all that bad really but it will just leave you stunned especially after Jack's thrill ride with exwife Carlotta Cyd Charisse.

The picture though often brilliantly filmed in lavish color is cynical and dark with twisted and duplicitous characters and doesn't leave you feeling all that cheerful even with the manufactured happy ending.That scene when director Maurice Kruger Edward G.

There is a statue of Hachiko that stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. Now the statue is the most popular place for Tokyoites to meet their friends before going out shopping or dining in Shibuya.Unlike other Japanese remakes this movie actually gives credit to the original story so that you don't get the sense that Hollywood wants to call it its own. All actorsactresses in the movie do a superb job in making you feel as if you were a part of the community embracing the dog. Compared to the original story people were more accepting of Hachi rather than considering him a nuisance. Of course this is going to be released in the U.S. as a holiday movie so the goal is to make it uplifting.Just a warning do take many tissues. I am a grown man and can honestly say that I have never really cried during a movie. I think the score of the movie plus the dog being so adorable made me lose myself. When I looked around the theater though every single person was crying and I saw a lot of red eyes as I left the Men's restroom. Any movie that can make me do that deserves a 1010.".

I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red !!The main characters never take flight but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one but profoundly touching So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko the Akita dog has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A mustwatch film especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages.".

Not a sad one but profoundly touching So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko the Akita dog has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A mustwatch film especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched some touching and moving movies in my lifetime and about 2 movies have made me cry However i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this Hachiko movie. I was crying for a good 10 15 minutes even after this movie ended. I have browsed through the comments and reviews on this IMDb board and on other online forums and have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried. I really think NO OTHER MOVIE has made so many people cry. Whenever i saw Hachiko go to the station and sit there waiting oblivious to the fact his owner died my heart died a little each time.Knowing that this movie was actually based on a real life story set in the 1920s1930s in Tokyo whereby an Akitabreed dog waited in front of the Shibuya train station day by day around the same time at the same spot for NINE WHOLE YEARS for his beloved university professor Professor Ueno to come back from work really breaks my heart.No animal or human would ever sit in front of the station to wait for someone they love for THIS LONG 9 FREAKING YEARS. This dog Hachiko must have had such ENORMOUS love for his owner that he would throw his life away 9 years is like 7 decades in dog years waiting in front of the station at the RIGHT TIME each day.How clever are dogs? Reallife Hachiko somehow knew how to read the time in order to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years. Waiting for 9 years wow! I never knew that the extent of an animal's LOVE and DEDICATION and PERSISTENCE could reach those heights.In real life Hachiko's was given away after his master's death but he routinely escaped showing up again and again at his old home. This showed that Hachiko loved his original owners Ueno and his wife and kids too much to let go of his master Ueno or his memory of him and wanted to return to his remaining living owners. Eventually Hachiko's apparently realized that his Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. How smart and clever is that of a dog? The other original owners of Hachiko had moved to a different location and Hachiko could not find his other living original owners since he is a dog and so he decided to wait in front of the railway station like he always used to do for his master to turn up and be reunited with him This real life story of Hachiko clearly demonstrated UNDYING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR ANOTHER since both the PHYSICAL ABSENCE of his owner Professor Ueno and the PASSING OF TIME would not diminish Hachiko's love and UNFLINCHING LOYALTY for his original master Ueno. This real life story also reminds us about HOW LOVE CAN MAKE ANYONE INCLUDING ANIMALS AND DOGS do CRAZY THINGS for someone they love.Somehow I just wished that in reallife the wife and family of Professor Ueno should have just placed lifeless body of Professor Ueno on the floor for a while for Hachiko to sniff and inspect the body. This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead. I am quite sure that Hachiko being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE then he would not have to wait for 9 years. You can read up on the real life story of Hachiko in this Wikipedia page which also lists all the Japanese films made about Hachiko. httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHachiko Or you can just Yahoo! Or Google Hachiko's real life story for more information.".

I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 19231935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.Just finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head. A feeling of sadness has engulfed me after watching this. I am at a loss for words to describe this movie as no other movie has ever touched me so deeply. I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over it brought me down to my knees.Richard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.I had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are. Love your dogs and always remember that he will always be there for you even in your darkest loneliest hours.".

If the words love and loyalty mean anything to you this is a nice story see unfold.The only major mistake made in this movie is that it should have been done as a 1920s period piece. I say that because throughout the story the dog runs free around the towncity which is impossible today with leash laws everywhere.Whatever the story is still very good very memorable and very touching in spots near the end. The only spoiler I'll use is a good one if you fear watching an animal film with a badsad ending you're safe the dog survives....that's all I'll say on that.Kudos to Richard Gere for a nice performance. This is definitely not he kind of film he usually does but he explains in a bonus feature I read the script cried and couldn't say no. The story was too good for him to pass up. That's my recommendation to you go rent the DVD sit back and enjoy a nice memorable tale of man's best friend.".

I still keep thinking about the story and every time when I think about it I felt sad and so sorry for both the Prof and the dog I am sure this is a film I won't forget ... the soundtrack is another praise.. definitely a classic for Richard Gere.. Although the movie centered on the bondlove between Hachi and his human parent this is also a story about love between spouse love between friends fatherdaughter love and most of all a close knit community of people with a big heart...My favourite scene is where Mrs Wilson come back to town after 10 years and found Hachi still waiting so touching I can't control my tears... the closing scene is just devastating Hachi died still dreaming of his master coming out of the train station.....This is a must see movie for every dog lovers. For human dogs may just be a part of our life but for the dogs we are everything they got. Again Richard Gere is just superb and natural so did Joan Allen. And lastly the dogs are so cute and adorable.A truly remarkable wait  10 years... words failed to describe the amount of love devotion and loyalty Hachi had for Parker...".

Some people love their cats but I'm amongst the many who just really care for their pet dogs. Now I won't spoil the story for you except to say that after a bit of a slow start this film draws you in. As another poster said...it will teach you much about the quality of love and loyalty.I can only warn you to have plenty of tissues on hand because if you are a human being with functioning emotions you are going to cry...a lot! I am a fifty yearold grumpy old man but I bawled like a baby for nearly half an hour after watching this film. I also let my Staffordshire Terrier come up onto my lap and she is VERY heavy and I hugged her for an age! I will never look at a dog the same way again after seeing this film and I will treasure it for as long as God allows me to live.".

He finds that the dog is an Akita and names it Hachiko however nobody claims the dog and his family decides to keep Hachi. Along the years the popular Hachi waits for Wilson in the square in front of the station. When Wilson dies at school Hachi keeps waiting for his owner along the years until the day the meet each other. I was quite anxious waiting for the release of Hachiko A Dog's Story on DVD. I had read in the newspaper the story of the Japanese dog that had waited for nine years for his deceased owner in the 20's in Japan and I expected a good adaptation of this story of loyalty and love by Lasse Hallstrm. This melodramatic movie has a great cast with Richard Gere Joan Allen and the dogs that should be nominated to the Oscar with their expressions and acting better than many actors and actresses that we frequently see on the screen. Be ready for tears and bring handkerchiefs and tissues together with the popcorn to the sofa and watch a really beautiful movie with your family. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Sempre ao Seu Lado Always at Your Side".

How on earth does someone decides to put this as a short shelf life and not consider this movie to come out during the Xmas holiday. You have two superb actors Richard Gere and Joan Allen. Can you get better than that. Shame on the film industry. I couldn't get my own brothers to watch this film for a second time. They were so heart wrenched in watching it the first time around. The music the dog and the acting made this film possible. I saw it six times and every time I saw it I cried. It's based on a true story and everyone I know that has seen it can't have enough tissues handy. You chose Marley  Me to come out during the holidays and while I liked it and read the book there is no comparison. This was a beautiful movie in every which way.This is an amazing story about loyalty and unconditional love. I saw the Japanese version of it and while it was very good I stilled loved the US version of it. I don't know what possessed the film industry to ignore putting this film on the silver screen because it was so beautifully well written and the music was amazing. I believe this movie came out when Marley and Me did and while I enjoyed Marley and Me there were more lessons to be learned by this movie and not by a precocious dog but one who was truly loyal. I guess because it was based on a true story it makes it all the more heart wrenching that something like this actually happened. If you're a dog lover you will love this film because you could associate yourself with the character that Richard Gere played. He was actually very good but the accolades go to the dog that played Hachi. I was so mesmerized by this movie the cast. the music and the dog that I ordered it from Amazon.com in Blue Ray.Modify review below".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who enjoy dark comedy it's hard to see how anything could be funnier than Arsenic and Old Lace.  With Cary Grant's talent for madcap comedy with hilariously sinister performances by Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre with two adorable old ladies who have a very dark secret plus halfadozen other eccentric characters all involved in a complicated and unpredictable plot this is a comic masterpiece.  Director Frank Capra keeps everything moving and adds his own touch keeping some dark material entirely lighthearted.This is the kind of movie for which mere analysis cannot do justice to how well everything fits together.  The characters cast and writing are all perfect and the crazy story gives every character some great moments. There is plenty of witty dialogue lots of funny slapstick and physical humor and quite a few wild plot developments.  None of it is meant to be plausible but it is all hugely entertaining and done with such skill that it is easy to suspend disbelief.  If you happen not to have seen this before stick with it for the first few minutes until you arrive at the home of Cary Grant's two aunts and then things will take off quickly.If you enjoy morbid humor Arsenic and Old Lace is an absolute mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "With many silly comedies of recent years comedy has become the most underrated art form.  People take comedy for granted.  As if there's nothing to it.  True there are some people will just laugh at anything.  In some cases it doesn't take much to raise a chuckle out of a certain someone. But this is the kind of film that will make you fall on the floor laughing. Why?  Because it makes use of every comic device you can think of.  The timing the delivery the choreography.  Absolutely perfect!That's right no cheap shots here.  There are some absolutely brilliant scenes in this film that made me laugh out loud while at the same time scream out Capra's a genius!  If you wanna see what comedy is truly all about watch the scene where Cary Grant noted drama critic is describing the story of a bad play he had just seen to Peter Lorre.  As he's doing so everything that happened in the story is going on right behind his back. Doesn't sound like much on paper but you have to see it to believe it. There are also many great lines including Pull up a tombstone. The acting is topnotch.  I can't believe Grant felt this was the worst movie he's ever done check the Trivia section.  I actually liked the fact that this was a different role for him as opposed to the suave quiet laidback romantic heman he usually plays.  In this movie we really get to see his knack for slapstickand he's great at it!  Every facial expression every bulge of the eyeshe did it with such perfect timing.  There's also a great scene where they all start fighting and Grant sits on the stairs and smokes a cigarette while all this bedlam ensues.  His deadpan expression during that scene is classic.  I also have to give it up for everyone else in the castthough Grant deserves the most acclaim.  There are lulls here and there and the film runs a little long though that wouldn't surprise me being that it was adapted from a stage play but there are so many beautifully crafted hilarious moments that I can't rate this movie as anything less than a mustsee!  I would go on and on about which scenes I found memorable but I don't wanna spoil it for anyone.  Just see it for yourself!  Trust me you'll die laughing!My score  9 out of 10".

The story is a fine example of black comedy where a socially unacceptable idea is shown in a very entertaining manner.The story is set up brilliantly right from the getgo where a 'certifiable' publiclyacclaimed bachelor is secretly getting married. The personality of the cast is excellent. I know that Cary Grant reckoned this was his worst movie saying it was more of a Jimmy Stewarttype part but his spoton comic timing and professional style hamming plays the role to perfection. Also costarring in the movie is a brilliant Peter Lorre as a maniac doctor and Raymond Massey as the psychotic brother. Most critics have attacked this film by saying the script refers to the psycho being a Boris Karloff lookalike highlighting the fact that Boris played the role is the original stage play. However Massey plays the role to deadpan perfection and the humor of the scenario still works.My favorite scene is the selfreferential one where Mortimer a theater criticis describing bad plays and movies. If you watch the background action and pay attention to the dialog the ironic situation is brilliantly realized. This film also has my personal favorite quote said by Cary Grant as Peter Lorre frantically tries to warn him of impending doom Stop underplaying  I can't hear you!".

	schema:reviewBody "In Frank Capra's autobiography he explains that the reason he wanted to do Arsenic and Old Lace was that he was planning to go into the service in preparation for the war he was sure coming. He wanted a surefire moneymaking hit that could be done on the cheap.Arsenic and Old Lace was running on Broadway at the time and authors Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse had sold the film rights to Warner Brothers. Capra negotiated a deal with Jack Warner for a percentage and told him how he would do the film on the cheap but not cut production values. Years of experience at Columbia had taught him how. The property was perfect since 90 of it is on one set the Brewster living room. So the shooting was for four weeks and a big percentage of the budget was spent on getting a name star for guaranteed box office that of course being Cary Grant. Of course this being 1941 the shooting was interrupted briefly by the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. But the film wrapped up quickly and was not released to the public until 1944 after the show on Broadway closed. It was however shown to troops overseas as were several other Hollywood films before they reached the domestic market. Of course with a Capra selected cast the film was a great triumph. Only Jean Adair and Josephine Hull as the Brewster sisters and John Alexander as Theodore Roosevelt Brewster repeated their Broadway roles. Capra had insisted on that.I don't think Cary Grant was ever more frantic in his film career than in Arsenic and Old Lace. He's one bundle of perpetual motion as Mortimer Brewster theater critic and member of a family where insanity doesn't just run it gallops. He's got two daffy old spinster aunts who poison lonely old men to cure their loneliness a brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt and another brother who is a homicidal maniac. Quite a family tree. Grant's performance is so good you can see the fevered workings of his mind in his facial expressions as he frantically tries to get his whole family committed before the aunt's deeds are discovered.Of the supporting cast I think that Raymond Massey as the homicidal brother Peter Lorre as his sidekick and Jack Carson as the dense police officer truly stand out. They and the others play parts that seem tailor made for them.Over fifty years later Arsenic and Old Lace will still fracture the funny bone in you.And I wouldn't bet we've still not seen the last Roosevelt in the White House.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arsenic and Old Lace one of the best stage comedies that were seen on Broadway gets the royal treatment via Frank Capra a man that was born to direct the movie version if ever there was a man to do so. The play written by Joseph Kisserling was given an excellent screen play treatment by the Julius and Philip Epstein team two great movie adapters of all time.This is a combination of a madcap and a screwball comedy. The first best thing in the film are the star turn performances by two of the original actresses that created the roles of Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha Josephine Hull and Jean Adair respectively. Just to see the Brewster sisters in action is worth the price of admission. These two women had the roles of a career by bringing life into the two kinds souls living in Brooklyn and doing good as well as helping lonely old men to find happiness.The second best reason for watching the film is Cary Grant. This is without a doubt one of the actor's best achievements in his long career in the movies! Mr. Grant plays Mortimer Brewster a man that hates the idea of getting married and losing his freedom. That is until the beautiful Elaine comes along. Mr. Grant is a joy to watch in the film no matter what he is doing at any given moment. His expressions as well as his timing is impeccable something one expects of all of Mr. Capra's movies.The Brewster household is the center of the action but for a stage play it never seems confining or theatrical even though it's basically shot in one single set. This appears to be the Brooklyn area near the Heights where one can see the majestic bridge in the distant. Maybe around Old Fulton Street or that area where the River Cafe is located now.Mr. Capra was able to assemble such a wonderful group of the best actors working in movies. Lovely Priscilla Lane is the woman that conquered Mortimer's heart. Raymond Massey is Jonathan the Draculalike sinister figure that is Mortimer's brother. Also John Alexander is seen as Uncle Teddy the man with a Teddy Roosevelt's complex. Peter Lorre makes a good contribution as Dr. Einstein. Jack Carson and John Ridgley are seen as the police working the area where the Brewster live. The supporting players are amazing Edward Everett Horton Garry Owen Grant Mitchell James Gleason and although seen briefly the great Charles Lane who is one of the photographers pursuing Mortimer and Elaine when they are getting the marriage license. Mr. Lane appeared in hundred of films and is still alive 100 years young! In a way it's ironic Mr. Lane survived almost all the people in the film!An excellent film by that American master Frank Capra!".

	schema:reviewBody "On Halloween day the writer and drama critic Mortimer Brewster Cary Grant secretly marries his next door neighbor Elaine Harper Priscilla Lane and they decide to travel to Niagara Falls in honeymoon. Mortimer has written many books criticizing the institution of marriage and his weeding would be a scoop for the reporters and paparazzos.Mortimer and Elaine take a taxi to Brooklyn to bring their luggage and Mortimer visits his adorable elderly aunts Abby Josephine Hull and Martha Brewster Jean Adair who raised him and are considered Good Samaritans in the neighborhood renting rooms and giving meals to the poor. His aunts live with his insane brother Teddy John Alexander who believes that is Theodore Roosevelt and is digging locks for the Panama Canal in the basement of the house. When Mortimer is ready to go he finds a dead body hidden in the window seat and his aunts explains that they have murdered the poor men for charity to stop their suffering serving wine spiked with arsenic and other poisons. Then Teddy buries the corpses in the locks believing that they had yellow fever. Mortimer decides to send Teddy to the Happy Dale Sanatorium but things get worse when his other insane and cruel brother Jonathan Brewster Raymond Massey who had disappeared twenty years ago and has the face of Boris Karloff unexpectedly appears in the house with his alcoholic partner the plastic surgeon Dr. Einstein Peter Lorre expecting to find a place to dispose the corpse of his victim. The place transforms in a nuthouse.Arsenic and Old Lace is a hilarious screwball comedy by Frank Capra based on a theater play. The plot and the characters are very funny with Josephine Hull and Jean Adair performing two innocent serialkillers believing that the death of their victims is charity. Cary Grant exaggerates in his reaction and he seems to be crazier than his insane relatives but the result is wonderful. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Este Mundo  um Hospcio This World is a Sanatorium".

	schema:headline " Brilliant comedy like they could only make it in the old days";
	schema:reviewBody "Arsenic and Old Lace is the most important contender for the funniest movie ever made !! Every single aspect and element in this movie is just perfect. And I'm NOT exaggerating... If I have to rate all the different elements of cinema separately I would rate them all 10 out of 10. Acting directing plot location dialogues sense of humor...all brilliant and in the right proportions. Frank Capra was responsible for several milestones and masterpieces in the history of cinema but  in my opinion  Arsenic and Old Lace beats them all. Yes I DO think it's even better than 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' !!! Arsenic and Old Lace is just everything you could possibly wish for in a motion picture. A must see that comes with the highest possible recommendation. Explaining the plot a bit would almost be impossible to do. The story goes about so many things. Don't be alarmed it's not at all hard to follow or something. As a viewer you're just being overwhelmed by a series of hilarious plot twists and intelligent sidecharacters and their backgrounds. So much that it is almost impossible to mention it all. And besides it's better that you start watching it without knowing too much about the story anyway. Just sit back and enjoy being pleasantly surprised. I can't imagine that there are people out there who didn't fully enjoy this movie !! It comes really close to perfection and the intelligence and originality of it will never again find an equal. Nowadays comedies are all lowbrainers  or even nobrainers  that handle about dumb teenagers or dick and fart jokes. Arsenic and Old Lace is a comedy that is mainly storydriven and brought to an even higher level thanks the flawless acting performances.Yes...let's talk about the cast a bit !! Cary Grant plays the role of his life in my opinion. Sure he played many other brilliant roles but his character Mortimer Brewster is just the most memorable of them all. Grant's comedy talent was never stressed better than in this film. His facial expressions are hilarious and his the amazingly funny lines sound brilliant coming out of his mouth. The girl who played his wife Elaine  forgot her name  is very beautiful and a great match for him. And I was very enthusiast to see Peter Lorre in this film. He's in my top 5 list of greatest actors who ever lived and anyone who saw this movie will agree with me on that. He's just perfect as Dr. Einstein. I can keep on rambling about the cast but I think you get the whole picture... FLAWLESS !!!Black comedy is one of the hardest subgenres of cinema to make a good movie out. Not many directors and scriptwriters have enough talent to take a subject like murder death or insanity and make a masterpiece out of it. Stanley Kubrick did it with 'Dr. Strangelove' and Frank Capra did it with this one ... I think these men are the exception. Only these guys can make you laugh hysterically with subjects like this. Finally one more note  This is also a perfect movie to watch if you're a fan of classic horror movies and thrillers. First of all because of the tribute role by Peter Lorre of course but also because of the constant morbid atmosphere hanging around the movie...And naturally because of the character of Jonathan Brewster which clearly is a direct tribute to Boris Karloff...They even say so most of the times.What the hell are you waiting for ?? Go watch it right now !".

As always Lorre manages to give a stunning performance in a supporting role.

As always Lorre manages to give a stunning performance in a supporting role.

Cary Grant is a bit over the top and his accent doesn't fit with the people he was supposedly brought up with but he's otherwise a good choice.  Boris Karloff played Jonathan on the stage a man who looks like Karloff  though the joke is ruined by Raymond Massey taking the role Massey is incredibly intense and creepy  and occasionally funny.  He's a much overlooked actor these days.  Also the ending isn't changed.  I don't mind the son of a sea cook line  in fact I think it's funnier than the original.  However the last line on the stage gives the play a hilarious twist while the last line in the movie is anticlimactic.  After you've seen this movie which I recommend you do procure a copy of the play.  One more note  with all the fine scenestealing actors in this movie Grant Massey Lorre Horton Carson Josephine Hull leaves the most indelible image and her performance does not dull with repeated viewings but remains as funny as the first time you saw her.  However much the other actors try to put their stamp on this it's Hull's movie and we're fortunate to have her performance on celluloid.".

Our sane young drama critic soon learns that insanity runs in the family.Five years ago the American Film Institute selected America's 100 funniest movies. Arsenic And Old Lace 1944 came in at Number 30. And that's not surprising. A lot of people enjoy this dark screwball comedy with its slapstick its fast pace its sharp dialogue and its engaging characters. A lot of viewers like it simply because of Cary Grant.The film's underlying premise is really great. And I must confess that Aunt Abby Josephine Hull and Aunt Martha Jean Adair are cute and entertaining. Interestingly the film portrays them as usually together and almost always in agreement with each other. It's like they function as a single entity. And the other denizen of the house Uncle Teddy John Alexander is also a hoot.But I'm not a big fan of Cary Grant. His performance here is exaggerated. His hyper and jerky behavior is distracting and grating. The plot gets ever sillier as it moves along and downright tedious toward the end. Lastly I have never cared much for films that are so top heavy with dialogue.The best part of the film is the cinematography. Most of the scenes take place in a big living room at times with lights out. The BW lighting is very stark with high contrast which renders a suitably sinister atmosphere.Arsenic ... is not my cup of tea. But for viewers who like talky stage plays with an accent on macabre humor this film is a fine choice. Could I interest you in a glass of elderberry wine perhaps?".

Exacerbating the problem is that the script and the original play is overwritten without having sufficient plot once the conflict in introduced. There isn't a second of this movie that's subtle. Every sequence is louder and more headache inducing than the previous. Each has a painful setup and the facile expected resolution. I would argue that the suckier screwball comedies include a de rigeur sequence in which the volume and tempo build to a degree that is simply annoying to a modern audience. This screwball comedy is more shrill than all the others. Grant felt that this he was not any good in this and he's not. But no one is blame the script!It's really surprising that it came out during the war and that it predates almost all the big serial murder cases on the 20th century.

Frank Capra was master when it come to make comedies. Arsenic and Old Lace is one of the most entertaining movie in his credit. The movie is about drama critic who goes against his convictions about matrimony and marries the girl he loves and on the way to his honeymoon he finds out that his two adorable aunts are insane murders who likes to kill old pathetic loner and bury them in their cellar. Though the start is bit a slow but after some while the movie takes a roller coaster ride. Often movies revolves around one or two characters but in this movie every character is unique and has its own domain whether it's mentally delusional Teddy Roosevelt John Alexander who in my opinion was the brightest and most funniest impersonation ever done on cinema or whether its Jonathan Brewster Raymond Massey maniacal murderer who with the help of his friend Dr. Einstein played superbly by Peter Lorre gets a new face resembling Boris Karloff every one was hilarious in the movie.

	schema:headline " Dancin' Kid Can you play? Johnny Guitar Can you Dance?";
	schema:reviewBody "Surely this allegorical western influenced Clint Eastwood when he directed his Pale Rider and High Plains Drifter though I've never read where he has mentioned it. There are certainly similarities especially with High Plains Drifter. The brilliant director Nicholas Ray who threw so much of himself and his search for artistic expression on film into his works at times carries the allegory too far. Good allegory such as Moby Dick and Huckleberry Finn must never become too obvious. It then descends into mere cleverness and creative arrogance. The posse from Hell dressed in black led by a perverted Joan of Arc doesn't leave much to the viewer's imagination. Except for a few such parts most of the movie purports itself well and tells an effective story that can be interpreted on several different levels.Mercedes McCambridge playing the demonic sexually repressed Emma Small again the name makes it too easy for the viewer stands tall amongst a cast of giants. That her voice would be used for the devil's own in The Exorcist is understandable for it crackles with fire and brimstone. Jealousy and rejection guide in her determination nay obsession to destroy both her sexual rival Vienna and her unrequited love the Dancin' Kid. Sterling Hayden plays the lead character Johnny Logan aka Guitar to perfection. Hayden was not only underappreciated by the Hollywood moguls but even by himself. In interviews he always trashed his acting talents in much the same way Robert Mitchum tended to do his own. He maintained he was just doing a job that he didn't like very much. In reality Hayden was one of the best performers of his generation as was also true of Mitchum. Joan Crawford who was often miscast finds her niche in Johnny Guitar. As her roulette spinner says to the cameraShe's more of a man than a woman. She is in control at all times even when there's a rope around her neck. She tells Johnny Guitar when to play his instrument and The Dancin' Kid when to dance. She even holds the posse from Hell at bay until Emma Small steps in. Emma is also a woman in control but only of external forces. Inside her emotions fears and frustrations dominate.Ernest Borgnine was still playing bullies which he did so well at this point in his career. Royal Dano the consumptive gang member always true to The Dancin' Kid gives his usual fine performance. Veteran actor John Carradine appears in somewhat of a different type role than usual as the loyal caretaker for Vienna. One part hearkens back to his best screen portrayal as Preacher Casy in The Grapes of Wrath when he tells Vienna that he'll hide young Turkey out in the cottonwoods so the posse can't find him. Nicolas Ray aided young aspiring actors with ability by showcasing their talents in his films. He introduced Dennis Hopper who has an uncredited bit part in Johnny Guitar. Later Hopper would appear in Ray's Rebel Without a Cause with James Dean Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo. Look for two other faces that were mainstays of the cinema Sheb Wooley High Noonhe also wrote and recorded The Purple People Eaterand Denver Pyle Bonnie and Clyde The Dukes of Hazzard. There's also the inimitable Ward Bond who could always be counted on to give a good performance.Any show that starts out with a mountain being blown to pieces a sand storm of Herculean proportions and a stage coach holdup can be counted on to deliver the goods. The story about a railroad coming through to change the community takes second place to all the other storms and whirlwinds involving jealousy greed and murder. Emma and the posse from Hell are not just on a private vendetta. They are also trying to stop progress that threatens their very way of life. Railroads bring new people new ideas and new ways of making a living. Those who benefit from change like it. Those who are hurt by change fight against it with all their might. These forces mix with personal ones to make Johnny Guitar one of the best westerns ever. It's not to be missed.The music for Johnny Guitar is a definite plus. Peggy Lee sings the title song which she helped compose with Victor Young at the end of the movie as no one else could. She had a sultry blues voice with great feeling and emotion. Oft times she is dismissed as a mere pop singer from the 40's and 50's. Peggy Lee was much more. She was one of the great voices for her era. I couldn't find information about who actually played guitar for Sterling Hayden. The picking is flawless. The closest I've come is the name Howard Roberts who was the jazz guitarist that backed Peggy Lee on her later hit Fever. I've read that he could play anything on any type guitar. The dance song picked by Johnny Guitar that inspired The Dancin' Kid to dance with Emma was Ol' Joe Clark a folk ditty usually played on the fiddle that was popular during the time period thus adding authenticity to the show.".

	schema:headline " Great unusual western";
	schema:reviewBody "Great cast and stunning direction makes this an offbeat classic.  Funny interpretation of gender roles in America  Crawford as the emasculated nihilistic prostitutebusinesswoman and Hayden in PERFECT casting as a slightly prettyboy gunslinger a role in which he is as passive to Crawford as a typical film heroine to her hero.  All bit parts are memorable particularly the venomous McCambridge one of her best characterizations  it makes my skin crawl every time I see her face light up as they burn the casino and John Carradine's memorably pathetic death scene.A lot of people have said a lot of things about this movie.  I was glad to see from glancing through the postings on IMDB that there is also some healthy discussion of the movie on here  how much it means how little it means.  I don't think it was designed to save the world from its madness nor do I think it's a lesbian love story although there is some strange element in McCambridge's obsessive hatred of Crawford but I do think there's something going on beneath the surface of this film that's hard to explain.  Somehow it ended up being much much better than it should have been.  One thing is I think Nick Ray and Phil Yordan decided the story was so ridiculous that they would just concentrate on the emotional elements also bringing out the pure fantasy going behind the waterfall to find a hidden fortress the heroine running from the fire in her white satin dress etc. that is the best element of all great film.  But it's really hard to pin down any one element that makes it great so I'll have to stand pat and just say it's a combination of elements that are operating on conscious and subconscious levels to bring about a fantastic movie experience  to those who are able to surrender to it.One other element worthy of comment  the wonderful opening sequence where Hayden rides through a hillside covered in explosions.  I really think that the quality of a good movie and especially a western can be seen most of the time in how well the director handles an opening sequence.  Heshe should capitalize on the viewer's total lack of knowledge about the film's situation to create moments of suspense or drama that couldn't possibly occur once the story is set in motion.  He should also use this suspense to create tension that will carry the movie forward.  Nicholas Ray has done an excellent job of this here we see Hayden riding through the explosions and wonder what's going on and then we see through his eyes the bank holdup which he is doing nothing to stop.  We don't know if he's a part of the robbery we can't really see who's doing the robbing etc. etc.  it just brings up a lot of questions that keep the audience wanting to see more.An excellent production one of Republic's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "This deservedly legendary western has to be seen to be believed. Directed by Nicholas Ray in blazing color courtesy of Harry Stradling Jr. it's western featuring the rivalry between two women Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge as they quarrel over two men Sterling Hayden and Scott Brady and shake things up in the Old West Hollywood style 1954. The film is for all practical purposes experimental. Ray is indulging himself in color composition and space nudging the viewer toward laughter at every twist and turn of its convoluted plot. As a purely visual exercise the film is a rousing success. Although Victor Young's music is nice and the late Peggy Lee does a good job with the title tune this one's better with the sound off. It is a movie to see to experience and very hard to discuss. Lord knows I've tried. If you can make sense out of it I'll buy you dinner. My best guess is that Ray was taking all the aspects of film that are traditionally ancillary and incidental and putting them ahead of everything else. What I like most about Johnny Guitar is the way Joan Crawford's saloon is designed the undergound cave the waterfall the cabin on top of the hill the moments of intimacy and emotion as they occur in these places and how the viewer is encouraged to suspend his disbelief of what the story is about and give into his emotions as the characters give into theirs' and let the devil take the hindmost. Ray succeeded marvelously here as there's nothing else quite like this one and the movies in general as far as I'm concerned are still lagging behind it by several decades.".

The great score by Victor Young which I never could forget is probably the most romantic and sentimental music ever composed for the screen with the Johnny Guitar theme with the voice of Peggy Lee bringing us the fascination of the legend they called Johnny Guitar. Also the fantastic colourful images with those reddish tones of fire and passion and the backgrounds the landmarks the characters and the sutile and perfect dialogues make this film a total masterpiece or modern cinema. A western without savages cavalry rodeos and the usual John Ford stuff. A different western ahead of its time and very misunderstood by the public then but fortunately reborn from the limbo and forgiveness rediscovered by new generations and still alive fresh as in its first day and always inmortal. Joan Crawford was never so great and the exchange of poisoned words with McCambridge at the saloon You haven't got the nerve  and If I don't kill you first on reply to I'll kill you by Emma makes me to smile as both characters show they wear the trousers rather than the men do. In short there never was a film like Johnny Guitar and there never will. Now on its 50th aniversary it is time to enjoy it once more and to wish that we could have been at Vienna's being part of that group of characters with no equal in cinema iconography.".

Joan Crawford was never so great and the exchange of poisoned words with McCambridge at the saloon You haven't got the nerve  and If I don't kill you first on reply to I'll kill you by Emma makes me to smile as both characters show they wear the trousers rather than the men do. In short there never was a film like Johnny Guitar and there never will. Now on its 50th aniversary it is time to enjoy it once more and to wish that we could have been at Vienna's being part of that group of characters with no equal in cinema iconography.";

	schema:reviewBody "Just outside of town is a small saloon where the owner Vienna plans to develop a new town once the railroad comes through.  However her associations with criminals namely the Dancin' Kid and his gang bring the disapproving Emma Small and the authorities to the saloon.  Aided by the arrival of a man from her past Vienna stands against them but only succeeds in putting off the inevitable confrontation in a situation made worse by love and deception.I came to this film simply because it was the username of another person on the imdb boards and I was intrigued as to what it was about.  The film starts as a western but it simply doesn't conform to that genre instead it is a weirdly matriarchal piece where the traditional roles are almost roundly reversed and the whole film has an otherworldly feel to it.  The plot summary doesn't really do justice to a story that essentially comes down to being a battle between Emma and Vienna as well as throwing up all manner of issues regarding the relationships between the characters.  The western clichs become secondary to these relationships and the director seems to prefer these to any lynching or shoot out.The full colour of the film gives it a gaudy otherworldly appeal that is very enjoyable.  Fires range in terrible hellish reds while shadows divide scenes of emotional complexity.  Heck it even goes down to the basic level of having the innocent Vienna dressed in perfect white before doing a blood red shirt to become a fugitive.  Not all of this works of course and several times I wished it would settle down into a film that I could recognise rather than being so different from what I am used to but it was more interesting as a result aside from being less accessible.The cast are roundly good but the fireworks belong to the two lead actresses.  Despite being the title character Hayden is rather underplayed but I think that was the point  he is not the typical Western man's man. Crawford is very good as Vienna but she is outhammed and outvamped by McCambridge who is excellent.  In any other film her performance would be woefully OTT but against the background of a saloon burning with a hellish fire her facial expression work very well and her whole performance fits well too.Overall this film is no classic western  mainly because it is not a western but rather a complex story in western clothes.  The gaudy colours and cleverly framed shots only serve to enhance a plot that is difficult to fully appreciate but is engaging none the less.".

How else to explain Crawford's Park Avenue getup or her desert island casino or McCambridge's manly fierceness or a bookish bankrobber or a showdown for toughest woman of Lesbos. Now scholars can play around with symbolism all they want. But first the subject has to be interesting enough to play with. Seems to me there are worthier movie subjects than this one for analysis. Sure I've read how the story's really a colorcoded allegory of McCarthyism with the blackclad posse as HUAC and the bank robbers as commies. After all the Dancin' Kid is lefthanded and the gang does stick together and they do rob banks. Probably this is as good a subtext reading as any that is if you're looking for some such. Me I just take it as a slice of Hollywood weirdness with Crawford playing dressup and in charge with the estimable Nick Ray trailing somewhere behind.".

She has a great enemy the evil Emma Small Mercedes McCambridge who wants to expel Vienna from that place. The reason for the dispute is the love for Dancin' Kid Scott Brady a handsome man.

The locals are not aware that Johnny was the former lover of Vienna and a famous gunman. When Dancin' Kid and his partners rob the local bank Emma finds a motive to accuse and chase Vienna. This movie is an excellent and very feminist western. The story is different from most of other movies of this genre and based on the rivalry of the two lead actresses. I do not recall any other western movie having such powerful roles for women. The DVD released by the Brazilian distributor Verstil is wonderful being totally restored and remastered highlighting the marvelous colors of the costumes of Joan Crawford. Mercedes McCambridge has an outstanding performance in the role of a very mean and powerful woman. My vote is nine.Title Brazil 'Johnny Guitar'".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what it was  maybe the conspiracy theorists were right and the Commies were poisoning our water with flouride in the 1950's.  But something sure drove Hollywood to come up with some bizarro movies and this one has to rank toward the top.  I won't spend too much time on plot and character.  Other reviews cover that in detail.  What struck me the most about this movie was its use of Hollywood cliches in ways that you expect and in ways you don't.The stupid machismo is there in abundance.  When Johnny first sashays into the bar he essentially challenges every single man there or rather scoffs at the implied threat that every newcomer has to earn his place.  It's John Wayne stuff magnified to the extreme.  You can't help but laugh.  And then there's his Hayden's delivery of his lines.  Got a light friend? Sometimes a man just wants a smoke...and a cuppacoffee.  You have to hear to believe it...he draws out the word smoke and then slurs cuppacoffee together.  It's cartoonish  it's stupid  boy is it delightful.There's another character in the movie who's another 1950's Hollywood mainstay the adult man 35 or 40? who just isn't a man somehow.  Kind of like a character from Scooby Doo.  Goofy and pushed and shoved around by all the other guys and constantly berating himself even more enthusiastically than everyone else.  There's a scene where he's standing outside watching Hayden ride away and he says Like the man says...sometimes you just want a smoke and a cuppacoffe.  Then there's a musical cue that says Goofball alert and the guy does a doubletake as if he just realized he was imitating a real man and if any real men had seen him being so presumptuous they would have beaten the tar out of him just on principle.  Is this 1950's Hollywood code for a gay man?  I don't know.  I guess they just used the generic term pansy back then.Throw in Ernest Borgnine as a grinning crazy macho cowboy.  A character who's the perfect blond youngblood who dies in Crawford's arms with a beseeching look.  The uberwitch played by McCambridge.  And plenty of other stock cliched and yet somehow entertaining characters.And then some of the scenes themselves are a riot.  At one point Crawford and Hayden are riding in a buggy with an obviously fake background just a screen showing what they're supposed to be riding by.  If you go by the screen they must be travelling at 100 mph going around hairpin turns that would have simply rolled the buggy over.  But the buggy just continues bouncing gently while the two of them talk in ultraserious tones. Hysterical.There's another scene where they're hashing things out about past love standing by a fence during a phony Hollywood sunset and Crawford invokes the boiling rage that was clearly always inside of her to produce one of the best cheesy performances I've ever seen.  Nothing in Gone with the Wind ever went any further of the top in hambone acting than this fine performance.Finally as others have mentioned this...creation...isn't a Western at all. It defies characterization.  I guess I'd call it a soap opera more than anything  but that's true of anything Crawford was in.  Yet that doesn't really cover it either.  It's also a hokey paean to women's rights.  A psychological analysis of the sexuallyfrustrated woman.  A vendetta story. And at least part Western.If you like seeing Hollywood oddities see this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't know what it was  maybe the conspiracy theorists were right and the Commies were poisoning our water with flouride in the 1950's.  But something sure drove Hollywood to come up with some bizarro movies and this one has to rank toward the top.  I won't spend too much time on plot and character.  Other reviews cover that in detail.  What struck me the most about this movie was its use of Hollywood cliches in ways that you expect and in ways you don't.The stupid machismo is there in abundance.  When Johnny first sashays into the bar he essentially challenges every single man there or rather scoffs at the implied threat that every newcomer has to earn his place.  It's John Wayne stuff magnified to the extreme.  You can't help but laugh.  And then there's his Hayden's delivery of his lines.  Got a light friend? Sometimes a man just wants a smoke...and a cuppacoffee.  You have to hear to believe it...he draws out the word smoke and then slurs cuppacoffee together.  It's cartoonish  it's stupid  boy is it delightful.There's another character in the movie who's another 1950's Hollywood mainstay the adult man 35 or 40? who just isn't a man somehow.  Kind of like a character from Scooby Doo.  Goofy and pushed and shoved around by all the other guys and constantly berating himself even more enthusiastically than everyone else.  There's a scene where he's standing outside watching Hayden ride away and he says Like the man says...sometimes you just want a smoke and a cuppacoffe.  Then there's a musical cue that says Goofball alert and the guy does a doubletake as if he just realized he was imitating a real man and if any real men had seen him being so presumptuous they would have beaten the tar out of him just on principle.  Is this 1950's Hollywood code for a gay man?  I don't know.  I guess they just used the generic term pansy back then.Throw in Ernest Borgnine as a grinning crazy macho cowboy.  A character who's the perfect blond youngblood who dies in Crawford's arms with a beseeching look.  The uberwitch played by McCambridge.  And plenty of other stock cliched and yet somehow entertaining characters.And then some of the scenes themselves are a riot.  At one point Crawford and Hayden are riding in a buggy with an obviously fake background just a screen showing what they're supposed to be riding by.  If you go by the screen they must be travelling at 100 mph going around hairpin turns that would have simply rolled the buggy over.  But the buggy just continues bouncing gently while the two of them talk in ultraserious tones. Hysterical.There's another scene where they're hashing things out about past love standing by a fence during a phony Hollywood sunset and Crawford invokes the boiling rage that was clearly always inside of her to produce one of the best cheesy performances I've ever seen.

So I was ready and willing to watch Johnny Guitar.But then I saw Joan. Never seen make up like that anywhere. Nice crop of eyebrows you got coming up this year Farmer Joan. Not to mention the four alarm lipstick which she seem to carry regardless of the venue dancehall hanging whatever. Tears of a clown. Wow. Especially since she ran around with her eyes bugging out of her head for the entire movie this must have been the movie Faye Dunaway watched the most. And the name Vienna. That trips off the tongue. Most unfortunate product placement.And how about that Mercedes. She kept herself spun up for the entire film schedule. Suitably bitter and dogmatic with a little Mrs. Danvers thrown in. I'm not clear how one woman could whip a bunch of men into such a frenzy and keep them following her although at times witless I've noticed men are capable of independent thought and dislike abuse especially since she was often wrong and they never threw that in her face. That's true to life suuuure and when her personal jealousy was so...subtle.And the Dancing Kid. Wasn't there one of those in a Roy Rodgers short? Dear me. I can tell by the story we were supposed to take him seriously but who named him that? The only name sillier would be the Kissy Face Kid but that's about as far as you can go.Speaking of silly so are the lines. If they're not silly they're delivered so histrionically they have a huge potential for staff meeting quotes. Every single line from Joan was delivered with enormous quivering feeling eyes wide open huge drama. There were no nuances no subtle delivery no delicate relationships  it was all over the top. And Mercedes just hated so no subtle acting there her lines were shrieked and thrown at us. Ernest Bornine was guilty of the same single dimensional acting. The rest of the men  even Sterling Hayden and Ward Bond  with their carefully crafted characters fade into the background.I'm sure the book was groundbreaking and I'm AOK with the women in typically male roles shooting away emasculating most of the men in town irrationally hating each other and getting caught up in real estate issues. I just couldn't take the onedimensional characters seriously or the over the top acting. This is a guilty pleasure cult flick offering great lines for future amusement. An acting tour de force it's not. But it's fun. But the title song presented ably by Peggy Lee as usual is a tour de force. It's well worth watching the credits go by. Beautiful.".

The absolute venom that was spat out between Vienna  Emma was so outrageously overthetop at times that before long this story began to play out like something of a very twisted parody.Allinall  Johnny Guitar definitely wasn't the best movie of its genre ever made but in the long run it sure did pack one helluva meanspirited wallop with its honesttogoodness stab at attempting to reverse the gender roles of your average 1950's Cowboy Bmovie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vienna runs a casino in a remote western outpost but her prospects are looking up when the railroad plans to build in the area. However she is not popular with the local cattle barons who intend to run her off her land ...Johnny Guitar is a much beloved and iconic little western and a lot of fun to watch mostly due to its snappy dialogue and sensational cast of wacko character actors. The script by Philip Yordan from Roy Chanslor's book is in some ways a laughably stodgy set of clichs  the small town railroad scam the ostracised scarlet hussy the good time gang with a den hidden in the hills the mysterious stranger from the past the gunhappy lynch mob  and it sometimes degenerates into awkward melodrama. In another sense however it's an extremely original revelatory story about two powerful and indomitable women who defer to nobody and will stop at nothing to protect their interests. The idea of a western where ubertoughguys like Hayden and Bond kowtow to the ladies and which culminates in an allfemale gunslinger shootout must have been incredibly daring in 1954 and doesn't disappoint. Everyone is great with Crawford and Brady never better Hayden a classic hardballchewing enigmatic dude and Borgnine and Carradine both as excellent as ever. Best of all however is an incredible McCambridge as the zealous repressed cracking pintsized bundle of fury that is Emma Small. If you're not familiar with McCambridge check her out in Giant Touch Of Evil or her legendary vocal performance in The Exorcist. She was an amazing actress who lead a fairly wild life and threw herself into her art and she is just amazingly intense in this picture. There's also a great lurching score by the prolific Victor Young featuring a memorable song coda by Peggy Lee and the movie was shot on location in the rugged red sandstone mountain scenery of Sedona Arizona. This is one of many great examples of an intelligent original Bpicture it was one of the last hurrahs for Republic Pictures which has long outlasted its more expensive contemporaries purely through the talent and tenacity of its makers.".

I had the chance to see it on the big screen at a revival screening some months ago mostly among Joan Crawford fans on a double bill with Sam Fuller's Forty Guns. Crawford McCambridge and definitely Sterling Hayden one of my alltime favorite 'guy' actors brought a lot to the entertainment factor of the film. The story goes like this and if you've seen Sergio Leone's Once Upom a Time in the West you'll notice obvious similarities as his was a slight homage of this film Crawford owns a barparlor on the edge of town. The townspeople want her out to make way for a railroad most vocally of this is McCambridge in maybe the best performance of the film really the most theatrical. The title character is played with usual panache by Hayden who at first is a little enigmatic then reveals himself to have a past with Crawford. The story then unravels from there in a way that actually went against my expectations much to my delight. This is the kind of genre picture that knows what it is but with a director clever enough to take chances. For example there is the contrast of color between Crawford and the angry townspeople near the beginning of the film. She's playing the piano on one side of the room in a white dress while the others the supposedly 'good' people of the town are all in black. Is Ray messing with the convention of good guys white bad guys black or do we have to keep attentive all the way through to know how it plays out? I think you'd have to  this is one of those westerns that has enough excitement humor mostly dark or unintentional and a climax that goes with some of the best of them. At the least it should hold up for those expecting something very dated it's not quite as towering as the Leone films but on its own terms Ray has a contender against all those oldschool FordWayne westerns.".

	schema:headline " Mildred Pierce with a handgun. Lame lame lame.";
	schema:reviewBody "I previously reviewed this movie and gave it a bad rating. I wish to apologize... I rated it TOO highly even then. This movie is awful. It has several noteworthy actors and actresses the cinematography isn't bad but that's the most I can say in its favor. So what could be that wrong with this movie? Let me count off some things1. There is nobody in this movie about whom you could really care. Sterling Hayden as Johnny Guitar speaks with a low slow drawl that makes him sound like a jerk. Crawford seems to refer to herself on a couple of occasions as a gunfighter. Sure. Mercedes McCambridge is a wildeyed nincompoop. The whole thing just doesn't work. You have to like some of the characters or else there's no point in watching a movie and nobody in this movie is likable.2. This movie has some of the worst dialog I've heard this side of an Ed Wood movie. Take this example between the Dancin' Kid Scott Brady and Johnny Guitar Sterling Hayden DK What's your name? JG slow drawl Johnny Guitar. DK That's no name!No name...? This coming from someone who calls himself 'The Dancin' Kid'...? LOL. But let us carry on with the sceneJG And you're the Dancin' Kid.DK That's my name friend. Care to change it?JG slow drawl No... I kinda like it.Oh my gosh it's just so bad....3. Another poor example of dialog comes when Bart Lonergan Ernest Borgnine tries to get Johnny Guitar to have a third drink. Guitar doesn't want it and spills it instead of drinking it.

Then there's this deadly serious but hilarious exchange between Johnny Guitar Sterling Hayden and The Dancing Kid ROFL played by Scott BradyJohnny Guitar holding his guitar So you're The Dancing Kid...long pause Can you dance? Dancing Kid almost like are you kidding?!... Can you play?THEN Johnny Guitar starts strumming away on his guitar  you can see he's not really playing it of course  and The Dancing Kid grabs Emma and twirls around with her for a minute. I didn't see anything so remarkable about his dancing that anyone would have bothered giving him a nickname about it and his nickname would have been a HUGE embarrassment for ANY man  then or today. And finally The Dancin' Kid hasn't been a kid for 20 years.5. The main story here is very thin  Emma and her friends don't want the railroad to come to the area bringing new settlers and dirt farmers! and such I guess Vienna and her saloon are seen as an attraction to bring thousands of people to the area? The subplots are of little real interest or inherent value  Johnny Guitar was once in love with Vienna and has returned to her from somewhere Dancin' Kid and his gang are allegedly connected with Vienna but she only has a bit of a soft spot for them. What is with the guy in the Kid's gang who seems to have TB he coughs a lot? This is an assembly of unimportant stories foisted on the same small group of characters. There is nothing at all compelling.6. There appear to be about a dozen people  total  in the town and nearly half of them get together to rob the bank. That makes so little sense in so many ways it's just plain dumb.7. In one scene after the bank is robbed Joan Crawford Vienna and Sterling Hayden Johnny Guitar are riding in a small buggy drawn by a single horse. While the horse sounds like it is just trotting along the scenery flying past their buggy suggests they are moving about 50mph. Very funny to see.One travesty of this movie is the use of John Carradine  who played such excellent characters such as Casy in The Grapes of Wrath  as a nitwit minor character who echoes the inane statement of Johnny Guitar that 'When you come down to it all a man wants is a smoke and a good cup of coffee'. I gather this is supposed to be profound as it's mentioned twice. It's not quite profound it's rather stupid.Really I have to question whether the writers of this atrocity ever even saw a Western other than that the characters carried guns and wore cowboy hats. There are so many really GOOD Westerns and there are many GOOD Crawford films Crawford played a TERRIFIC Mildred Pierce but her role in this movie was a disgrace. This movie is really awful.I'm sure many will find this review to be 'not useful'. I found the 90 minutes or so spent watching it to be of even less use.".

	onyx:emotionText "I previously reviewed this movie and gave it a bad rating. I wish to apologize... I rated it TOO highly even then. This movie is awful. It has several noteworthy actors and actresses the cinematography isn't bad but that's the most I can say in its favor. So what could be that wrong with this movie? Let me count off some things1. There is nobody in this movie about whom you could really care. Sterling Hayden as Johnny Guitar speaks with a low slow drawl that makes him sound like a jerk. Crawford seems to refer to herself on a couple of occasions as a gunfighter. Sure. Mercedes McCambridge is a wildeyed nincompoop. The whole thing just doesn't work. You have to like some of the characters or else there's no point in watching a movie and nobody in this movie is likable.2. This movie has some of the worst dialog I've heard this side of an Ed Wood movie. Take this example between the Dancin' Kid Scott Brady and Johnny Guitar Sterling Hayden DK What's your name? JG slow drawl Johnny Guitar. DK That's no name!No name...? This coming from someone who calls himself 'The Dancin' Kid'...? LOL. But let us carry on with the sceneJG And you're the Dancin' Kid.DK That's my name friend. Care to change it?JG slow drawl No... I kinda like it.Oh my gosh it's just so bad....3. Another poor example of dialog comes when Bart Lonergan Ernest Borgnine tries to get Johnny Guitar to have a third drink. Guitar doesn't want it and spills it instead of drinking it. Lonergan says When a man can't hold a glass he ought to be fed from a bottle like a baby...Come here Guitar Man I'll feed you. I think Borgnine went home from that day's shoot and drank himself into a stupor to try and forget that idiotic scene.4.

Where the primary plot interest isn't with the male characters but with two antagonistic women played by Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge? And whose bright idea was it to bring Peggy Lee in to do the theme song? Were the story's parallels to McCarthyism enough to get this film made? Was Nicholas Ray a respected enough director that the studio approved this project of his? I don't know but I certainly would like to.Of course nowadays Johnny Guitar enjoys a reputation as a camp classic that makes subversive statements about things like feminism and homosexuality. Traditional gender roles get reversed Johnny Sterling Hayden is a relatively passive hero while his love interest saloonowner Vienna Crawford is described as being almost more man than woman. And there are many campy laughable moments the sight of Johnny holding a teacup Vienna's poufy dress catching on fire and most of McCambridge's intense performance as the vindictive Emma Small.In some sense though the movie doesn't go as far as it could. We hear about Vienna's supposed masculinity more than see it Crawford's voice and mannerisms are much too refined to suggest any kind of manliness. Maybe this is part of Johnny Guitar's camp appeal but otherwise I'd simply call it a bad performance. In another example of telling not showing the characters' convoluted psychology gets spelled out within the first fifteen minutes e.g. Emma loves the Dancin' Kid but is so afraid of her own sexuality that she thinks she wants him dead. But wouldn't Johnny Guitar be even stronger and more subversive if Vienna were truly masculine? Or if the characters' twisted motivations were allowed to unfold naturally rather than told to us from the start?Watching Johnny Guitar you get the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make a big thematic statement of a kind not usually found in Westerns. But the exact nature of that statement is never clear that's probably why this film is so tantalizing to modern scholars who want to decode its secrets. The result is a very bizarre rather campy completely unforgettable movie that hints at something more substantial but never reveals what it is.

The men dramatically defer to the powerful determination and identities of these two women. Sterling Hayden as the eponymous hero is something less of a hero on account of Crawford's compulsion. The fact that he plays a guitar and travels without a gun gives a hint to the devalorizing of the Western hero boilerplate inferred by the title. He's a subordinate character given to hesitation.

The Dancin' Kid makes several crucial choices including the robbing of a bank based on whether or not Vienna will go on reciprocating his sentiments rather than leaving him for Johnny. Johnny and the Kid are both atypically tender cowboys in contrast with the icons of the time together with the basis that each has a creative craft that's part of his name and that both in most cases allow the female characters to make the choices and are inclined to comply with them.Scorsese has talked about the great themesmugglers of the studio era who snuck subversive elements past the scrutiny of the censors. This is definitely true and admirable but sometimes I'm baffled at what must've been functional retardation on the part of Hayes' puritan committee. This 1954 Freudian Western is one of the record outoftheblue phenomenons of the studio system a film so insubordinate it's a miracle it ever got made. But despite its genre this is a gentle thinskinned film Ray's tenderest avowal of his outsider theme.As with Ray's In a Lonely Place On Dangerous Ground and Bitter Victory characters come across truths that they don't want to admit to themselves or others and sometimes this information is obvious to those around them first. He uses innuendo as a way to deal with plot developments that can't be externalized or those that haven't come to pass yet. The characters are rounded out through teasing accusation high emotion.Ray known for his dramatic use of architecture was keen on the meanings of the horizontal line which serves a western particularly well. The first and second halves of the film have different visual styles. But both sections feature extensive panning. The second half features brilliant landscape photography as Ray's camera pans over snowcovered mountain roads and trails. These sections are unusual in that they don't feature wilderness areas. Instead these scenes always have human habitations in them roads farmhouses paths and other human constructions. They can be described as rural or as tourist areas the sort of remote but inhabited location one might go to on vacation. Such locales rarely pop up in movies. Westerns which feature vast landscapes tend to have wilderness areas without modern buildings. And contemporary films rarely go to such poverty stricken tourist spots preferring resort and wilderness areas with more glamour.However no matter what intellectual appreciation movie buffs and film scholars and critics have for it it's impossible to deny its utterly hamfisted acting and soapy plot strands all approaching outandout kitsch. I've seen a good deal of westerns with more understated saltoftheearth acting that brought me closer to the grit inherent to its environment. This is the diametric opposite of being one of them. Did any of them have whiplash after a certain amount of takes? Why such intense aboutfaces and comicbook demeanor? Was Douglas Sirk on set? After awhile I gave up on the performances. Their imaginations don't seem engaged. They pretend selfconsciously. They're stiff tightly wound. They never let go. And though Crawford is never uninteresting or by any means bad in any film in which I see her I feel she should've been told as much as necessary that acting is not a competition that everything must be done for the good of the film or everybody else is put at risk. But she's not the only one who showboats here everybody does. Despite a cast of performers that tend to intrigue me the two females Hayden Ernest Borgnine I could only rely on Ray's building of tension through montage and his marshaling of the plot to keep me engaged. Nevertheless Johnny Guitar is a certain kind of film that has upheld its rank by repositioning itself every decade since its release.".

	schema:headline " THE WESTERN THAT IS A MYSTERY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE . . .";
	schema:reviewBody "The single most remarkable thing about the 1954 Republic Pictures Western Johnny Guitar' is the peculiar power it has to elicit unpredictable emotional reactions both from critics and from the moviegoing public in general.The movie's basic storyline is comparatively straightforward.  In late 19th century Arizona an exdance hall girl Joan Crawford is set to make a fortune when a new railroad comes to the town where she has shrewdly built a casino.  This offends the moral sensibility and otherwise of one of the local townspeople Mercedes McCambridge who becomes more than a little obsessed with running Crawford out of town or worse.The quality of the screenplay is uneven  truly memorable Casablancastyle dialogue on the one hand is offset by vagueness and inconsistency in story development on the other. The film's music by Oscarwinning composer Victor Young is generally agreed to be firstrate. The film's editing on the other hand has rightly come in for a lot of criticism.

	onyx:emotionText "The single most remarkable thing about the 1954 Republic Pictures Western Johnny Guitar' is the peculiar power it has to elicit unpredictable emotional reactions both from critics and from the moviegoing public in general.The movie's basic storyline is comparatively straightforward.  In late 19th century Arizona an exdance hall girl Joan Crawford is set to make a fortune when a new railroad comes to the town where she has shrewdly built a casino.  This offends the moral sensibility and otherwise of one of the local townspeople Mercedes McCambridge who becomes more than a little obsessed with running Crawford out of town or worse.The quality of the screenplay is uneven  truly memorable Casablancastyle dialogue on the one hand is offset by vagueness and inconsistency in story development on the other. The film's music by Oscarwinning composer Victor Young is generally agreed to be firstrate. The film's editing on the other hand has rightly come in for a lot of criticism.  Three Academyaward winning actors Crawford McCambridge and Ernest Borgnine are among the cast.On this evidence one would expect Johnny Guitar' to fall somewhere in that vast middle ground of moreorless average motion pictures to which we can apply the truism that to some extent people will like them and to some extent they will not in varying proportions.

	schema:reviewBody " SPOILERS AHEAD I watched this fim with a friend who has never read the book. I on the other hand read it years ago but wasn't interested enough to continue with the series. However I was willing to judge it as a film on its own merits not as a book adaptation. By the end of the movie we were left disappointed. It was rushed choppy unevenly paced and made no effort to define the world it was set in. All the characters could have died and we would have felt nothing because the film did little to make us care them.FLAWS IN THE FILMThe script was so atrocious that we began predicting what characters would say next during the cheesiest scenes. 95 of the time we were right  word for word. When Jace said to Clary I told you I'd never met an angel I said Please for the love of god don't say 'now I have'. He did. We died a little. There was zero character development. Clary had no personality. When we tried to describe her we could not come up with a single adjective as we knew nothing about this girl. Actually that's a lie. When she pulled the mortal cup out of the card in front of the witch who was obviously a demon and then again in front of Hodge my friend yelled How are you so STUPID?. Clary was presented as the protagonist even though we were given no reason to root for her or care about her. We. Knew. Zilch. About. Her. Beyond being prone to dumb and reckless behavior. It didn't help that Lily Collins while pretty has no onscreen charisma. She was just a bland attractive girl. The other characters suffered equally. We could tell that Simon was nerdy Isabelle liked slutty clothes and fighting Valentine was evil Hodge was sketchy Luke was some kind of family friend why who knows? and Jace was the standard romantic lead with a penchant for sappy lines and rescuing Clary. Beyond that nothing. Words like 'the Clave' 'the accord' and others were thrown in without explanation. We were expected to believe that the mortal cup was some kind of holy grail even though the movie hardly explained how it functioned beyond a couple of statements about its necessity for making more shadow hunters. After all the build up with no clarification my friend began to expect that the cup's powers would be demonstrated at the climax making things clearer. Of course this did not happen and she was left unsatisfied. We cared about the mortal cup as much as we cared about the characters  which is to say not at all.The Silent Brothers were never explained. They were just creepy dudes living under a graveyard.The weapons were illdefined. They just did whatever the characters needed them to do at any given time  be it tattooing runes slaying demons or drilling magical peepholes through bookcases. They might as well have been Harry Potter wands.Clary inexplicably accuses Alec of being in love with Jace even though we saw no indication that he was even gay. The Clary and Jace romance felt forced. There was no build up. We were never shown why he would be attracted to her or why she returned those feelings. When they finally kissed in the garden it was uncomfortably awkward.In a seemingly random act Valentine wanted Clary to drink his blood from the cup and no one knew why. Said my friend at this point Is he Jesus?Loose ends. Simon is bitten by a vampire. At no point in the film does anybody bother to tell him this. Even when he storms out of the institute Clary doesn't think to say By the way a vampire bit you. We waited for the effects of the bite to manifest  to find out if he was a vampire or not. But in the end we were forced to conclude that in the world of The Mortal Instruments being bitten by vampires only improves your eyesight. The werewolves only existed to serve as expendable extras in fight scenes.Speaking of fight scenes many went on for far too long. Time could have been better spent on character development so that we actually cared if anyone died in a fight. In the ultimate deus ex machina Clary draws a rune that freezes all the demons. No one else has ever seen this rune. No one figures out how Clary knows how to draw it. It was like the screenwriters realized that their heroine had been useless and needed her to do something powerful to prove why she's the protagonist since her talents thus far largely involved leading others into mortal peril.Why were they using fire to battle demons that looked as if they were made essentially out of fire? Do we spray water to stop a flood?The portal in the wall was supposed to take someone to the place they focused on or keep them in limbo. How did Valentine reach out of the portal to grab Clary after he gets shoved in?Clary draws a cleaning rune at the end of the movie and magically tidies her apartment. At that point it just became ridiculous. Are there runes to trim cat toenails and enable WIFI as well?I thought the whole Twilight franchise was awful but despite the dreadfulness of those movies the plot was never unclear to even those with IQ deficiencies. I can't say the same about The Mortal Instruments.".

I don't just mean the events were slightly moderated to save time I mean they changed the entire plot. Jace wasn't terrible could've been cockier Clary was horribly overdramatic Magnus was expressionless and they managed to ruin my favorite character Valentine.

The movie had changes in it that ruptured the foundation of the book and a lot of what it stands for ruining the ingenuity of the plot and the world that Clare built which had me so enraptured from the beginning. It's a shame because they had such potential with this movie. I still can't understand how they could take such a great story line and decide that it was only acceptable to warp it to a point beyond recognition....".

Sorry for the harsh review  in fact its my first and most likely my last.But after watching this movie i was heartbroken and i needed to share my frustration with anyone willing to read this My grammar  spelling are very poor i realize this  so take it as it is and if you go and see this movie go in knowing its not what your wanting to see.

They can kill off the werewolves with more demons. There are so many little things like that that just made the movie stupid for anyone who's older than 15.Oh and the incest theme come on. Put two and two together people and get a frigging DNA test. Also when someone from the inside has let the demons in think about it by a process of elimination there's 5 of you 4 of whom were together. Just a thought it'd be the one who wasn't with you. Tadah! I really wanted to like this movie the premise is fantastic. The actors did a very good job with such a silly script and the special effects are cool. It would help if the characters talked about the same thing instead of randomly jumping topics within a conversation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just got done watching a midnight showing of City of Bones. First off I will say that I am a fan of the series and I will try to make this review as middle ground as possible.I have spent the last few days reading over threads on the discussion board and once the critics reviews came out I read most of those too. Yes I know a lot were negative and abrasive and sometimes even childish in their mockery of the young adult genre. I went into this movie as openminded as possible knowing that there were some changes made to the film.Firstly several reviews both good and bad had issues with the pacing. The time line is very condensed at the start of the film so things do seem to be happening in a whirlwind. This is because they condensed a few of the events from the novel into a shorter time span to enable the movie not to drawl on and be way too long. I didn't mind how they chose to change things up a bit and thought they tied things together fairly well. I just could see it being a bit hard to follow for the non fans that don't know what was cut out.I was worried about the romance being played up too much since some reviews were so caught up in the triangle. It was a small part of the bigger story much like in the book. Parts of it did come off a bit cheesy but overall it did not overpower the movie like I thought it was.I really enjoyed the action sequences. They weren't too short or too long and I felt they were well coordinated. There's definitely enough action for the guys that will be dragged to this with their girlfriends.Some of the changes will probably be unsettling to the fans or upsetting because more of the film was different than I was warned or expected. Many reviewers were adamant that it kept to the book most of the time but I would say it was a pretty even mix.Like most fans I had a certain idea how some scenes or characters would be and I felt a little let down because characters weren't how I imagined or expected them. Magnus falls flat and lacks the charisma and attitude of his book counterpart. I also felt the way Valentine was playedportrayed did not fall in line with how he was in the book. But everyone who reads has there own interpretations and he wasn't close to he Valentine I had envisioned.Lastly I feel this is a pretty solid movie for the fans and non readers. I wouldn't say it's perfect few movies have ever come close to achieving that status. There are a lot of good elements going on here and a lot of decent acting from people I least expected it given the time they had to actually develop the characters. If you have any interest in watching the movie don't let all the negativity sway you. Go in with an open mind and make your own judgement. I won't say I loved this movie but I did really enjoy it and would definitely see it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all you need to know this review is coming from a 39 year old Male who has never read the books. Having heard the hype that this was the next twilight series which I dutifully but barely endured as a good husband... this movie is NOTHING LIKE TWILIGHT AT ALL. Heres whyThis is a movie made for more then just teenage girls and soccer mom's. It's has real action solid acting good cinematography and dwells more on the storyline then romance.Having never read the Mortal Instruments books I was a little leery of seeing the movie and being totally lost. My fears were unfounded as the first hour of the show does a solid job of laying out the storyline. The first hour did seem a little long for me but was well worth it and necessary as it made the last hour understandable and fly by with its nonstop action. This is nothing like what I was expecting after having to endure the twilight films with their horrible acting and cheesy cinematography. As well as multiple onehit wonders of werewolfvampiredemon shows that have come out since. This show had legitimate effects great action scenes and some really good acting performances. Here's my breakdownEffects From the beginning this film proves it's a step above with cinematography and effects. The demons were gruesome scary and awesome! When supposed humans turn to demons this is done very well. One questionable effect towards the beginning of the show was easily forgotten due to the many excellent effects during the whole show.Action Having seen Jamie Campbell Bower on the red carpets just moments before seeing the show I had serious worries about him being able to pull off a believable action figure due to his skinny frame. Oddly it was the action scenes where I enjoyed his acting the best and believed he was the main man. On the whole the fight scenes were very engaging particularly the ending sequences. There were two times though I wished they had made the fight scenes a little longer to show more of a struggle to overcome.Acting This is where I was most pleasantly surprised. Lily Collins and Robert Sheehan stole the show in terms of solid believable performances. Jamie did a convincing job and exceeded my expectations but did fall a little short at subtle times as his skinny frame could not be overcome in the shot. His attempt to be seen as tough when his stature said otherwise caught me at times. I felt like all the performers were engaging though with the exception of the role of Magnus. I'm not sure if it was his acting or the role they put him in but it just didn't seem to fit the character he couldshould have been. Readers may feel differently here I was just confused if he was intended to be a tough guy or a joke.Storyline Understandably they had to lay the foundation of the storyline which for the first hour they did. There was a lot of information to take in the first hour and honestly I began to doubt how they were going to take this load of info and tie it all together by the end. I was amazed at how well they did it! The last hour flew by as they did an excellent job of tying in each element and doing it with very compelling drama.Overall I'd give the movie a B. Solid acting and action stood out and will make a very satisfying experience for any nonreader who watches the show.".

They just pop out with no explanation they harm then help with no explanation they do things without any explanation and the movie ends that way. Terrible.

	schema:headline " Horrible experience I read the books";
	schema:reviewBody "This was terrible.Honestly. Terrible. I've seen Jonah Hex and Catwoman at the cinema yes I paid real money to see both movies so trust me to recognise a bad movie when I see it. This was worse than Percy Jackson. Go see that instead. I've read the books for this the entire Book 1 and 2 and I've skimmed the key parts of 3. It does not help. People are saying that it might have been better if you read the books? NO.This is a horrible adaptation. It's in the vicinity of Eragon bad.I am not lying. If you're asking yourself should I watch this movie? the answer is NO. There's nothing to gain. If you generally like bad movies then feel free sometimes you just get the urge for a stinker this is fact but otherwise  avoid. The writing is atrocious. The direction is atrocious. Some of the lines will crawl your blood even if you're the youngest most movienaive teenage girl in existence. There are scenes that'll make you feel embarrassed for the actors. I'm serious. There is this one scene that is so cheesy... I can't even describe it but it's like all the cheese and all the corny from all five twilight movies condensed into 3045 seconds.This makes the Twilight Saga look worthy of an Academy Award. Every single joke falls flat. Every single one. Jace is supposed to be the witty one and he's supposed to have this banterprone persona  he doesn't. This Jace is almost shy. The dialogue is horrendous. The clichs hit you so hard you start thinking it's a parody halfway through it isn't. Geezus. The Tudors king guy is in it but he can't save it. I think his appearance was the proverbial nail in fact. The end is almost incomprehensible as you just lose yourself in a storm of clichs. The movie's plot contradicts all logic and all pathways of common sense and I'm not exaggerating here.Now I grant that the source material wouldn't win any awards either. There won't be any Team Jace or Team Simon T shirts on sale. Not sure how many Clary fans there are in the world but I'd guess not much because the original book characters are not the best characters ever. The book's plot isn't the most original thing ever. The books themselves are crap being honest but they're tolerable crap. This movie takes that crap and makes crap soup with it. They bring the crap to a boil. They season it... All the better to bring out that smoky crap flavour. Movie adaptations seldom ever are better than the book and I count LOTR as the only exception but when the bar was set this low you have to ask How did they F''' this up? They had a decent cast. Decent acting too... It's just the writing! It's like the first draft of a screenplay that gets hammered out in a dark latrine while the writer is suffering from food poisoning. Who approves this stuff? Really. Who signed off on this as a good idea. Somewhere along the way while this movie was being made someone should have said NO. I feel like this movie should have some controversy to it. Someone should have stormed off the set. I feel like drugs were involved? Maybe? Mindblowingly bad. The opposite of epic. Painful and embarrassing to watch. Hands down the worst movie of the year.And there's going to be a sequel? NO. Say NO people. Just say NO.".

The dialogue is horrendous. The clichs hit you so hard you start thinking it's a parody halfway through it isn't. Geezus. The Tudors king guy is in it but he can't save it. I think his appearance was the proverbial nail in fact. The end is almost incomprehensible as you just lose yourself in a storm of clichs. The movie's plot contradicts all logic and all pathways of common sense and I'm not exaggerating here.Now I grant that the source material wouldn't win any awards either. There won't be any Team Jace or Team Simon T shirts on sale. Not sure how many Clary fans there are in the world but I'd guess not much because the original book characters are not the best characters ever. The book's plot isn't the most original thing ever. The books themselves are crap being honest but they're tolerable crap. This movie takes that crap and makes crap soup with it. They bring the crap to a boil. They season it... All the better to bring out that smoky crap flavour. Movie adaptations seldom ever are better than the book and I count LOTR as the only exception but when the bar was set this low you have to ask How did they F''' this up? They had a decent cast. Decent acting too... It's just the writing! It's like the first draft of a screenplay that gets hammered out in a dark latrine while the writer is suffering from food poisoning. Who approves this stuff? Really. Who signed off on this as a good idea. Somewhere along the way while this movie was being made someone should have said NO. I feel like this movie should have some controversy to it. Someone should have stormed off the set. I feel like drugs were involved? Maybe? Mindblowingly bad. The opposite of epic. Painful and embarrassing to watch. Hands down the worst movie of the year.And there's going to be a sequel? NO. Say NO people. Just say NO.";

Filled with some of the most clich asinine juvenile dialog and personalities I've seen in years. Makes Twilight look like a topnotch literary classic by comparison. Hard to believe I know. Gives Eragon a run for its money in terms of facepalmy unwatchability. Let's examine some specific examples of the many how the hell is every character in this movie so STUPID moments. The protagonista's friend Simon is captured by vampires taken back to their lair and trussed up in chains. They rescue him nearly getting themselves killed in the process only surviving because some werewolves conveniently show up and also conveniently it's almost dawn. No effort is apparently expended figuring out why he was captured by the vampires. Nobody among the team of teenagers  whose sole purpose in life is supposedly to deal with demons werewolves vampires and other supernatural things  finds it particularly odd that Simon no longer needs his thick nerd glasses afterward they rescue him. Seriously? Any sixyearold at this point in the movie should be able to correctly answer the question Do you think Simon has been bitten by a vampire?The protagonista's mother apparently trying to protect her daughter completely fails to give her any kind of information or training that might help her stay alive or get help in the event something nasty happens. Quite predictably something nasty happens. The protagonista's new boyfriend spends five minutes of the movie telling her about how a certain set of piano notes written by Bach can reveal the presence of a demon possessing someone. He then plays the music on a piano while locked in an apartment with someone who we can already tell is acting a bit oddly yet both he and the protagonista remain completely oblivious to the amazingly obvious negative reaction of the now clearly possessed individual to the music he's insisting on playing. We think he's insisting on playing this music because he already suspects the person may be possessed but no apparently he just feels like playing some music. Despite all the buildup they are quite surprised when the demon finally reveals itself grabs the magic cup kicks everyone's ass and leaves. The audience clearly sees that the person is possessed even before the music starts. What exactly was the point having the guy play the music? So we could see just how stupidly oblivious the characters are? At the exact same time the other members of the team use some kind of demonfinding substance in the room DIRECTLY UPSTAIRS. They watch the substance slide around on the floor of the clearly empty upstairs apartment clearly showing the presence of a demon IN THE ROOM BELOW. They are apparently too stupid to figure this out and just stare at the substance dumbfounded as it moves back and forth on the upstairs apartment floor until FINALLY they hear a scream from downstairs and figure out that they should go back downstairs and help out. Whereupon they are stymied by get this a standard household security chain on the downstairs apartment door. Aren't these guys supposed to be stronger than the mere mortals they are tasked with protecting? I could pick the whole movie apart like this. It's just unbelievable stupidity piled on top of unbelievable stupidity with a topping of horribly clichd dialog predictability overly dramatic music and overly long fight scenes. I've watched and enjoyed some pretty godawful scifi and fantasy over the years simply because I love the genres so much but so far I've only gotten two thirds of the way through this and I've already had to pause it and go do something else a couple dozen times. Maybe if I watch the rest of it on mute...".

	schema:reviewBody "Since the success of films like Harry Potter and Twilight film studios have been looking for the next young adult book series to adapt. With five books already out and a sixth on the way The Mortal Instruments is latest series to diving into a cinematic adaptation being more fantasy than supernatural romance.Clary Fray Lily Collins is a seemingly normal New York teenager who lives with her artistic single mother Jocelyn Lena Headey. Her best friend Simon Richard Sheehan has a crush for the young woman but she sees him more as a brother. Clary leads a normal life but starts to draw a strange symbol that leads to changes in her life. She begins to see it everywhere leading her and Simon to a nightclub where she sees people no one else can. Soon Clary's mother is kidnapped and her only ally is Jace Jamie Campbell Bower a Shadowhunter a halfangel half human creature who hunts demons. Clary is thrust into a strange world of demons vampires witches warlocks and werewolves and has to open up her own suppressed memories as an evil Shadowhunter. Valentine Jonathan Rhys Meyers is looking for the lost Mortal Cup that can create more Shadowhunters.To get the Twilight comparisons out of the way yes there is a love triangle and a teenage girl has a romance with a supernatural creature. But The Mortal Instruments City of Bones borrows much more from the Harry Potter having a world within world many mystical creatures having a term to describe humans and focuses on a young character who could be more powerful then she realises and discovers her real past. The character of Alec Kevin Zegers is the Rosalie of the film having animosity to our major character.Continuing with Twilight comparisons Clary is dependence on the other characters but that is more due to the fact she is in a strange world and the Shadowhunters are much more experience. But Clary is still resourceful asks the right questions and is a gogetter who wants to get stuck in with the adventure.The Mortal Instruments City of Bones is a standard fantasy adventure that as already mentioned borrows highly from Harry Potter. This is a film that has many predictable plot points that we've seen many times before. This is a film that does follow The Hero With A Thousand Faces formula but also makes you dive head first into its world and mythology where other series would be much more gradual when bringing you into their worlds.Harald Zwart of Agent Cody Banks and The Karate Kid 2010 fame took on the directing duties and he makes a darker film to his previous efforts. Zwart brings in Gothic visuals throughout the film from the use of a catacomb that is run by creatures with sewed up mouths and the Shadowhunter's being like a church but Institute's interior looks very much like Hogwarts. There are some gruesome moments even for the PG13 rating involving the demon dog and the extra limbs demons can grow. But despite all this death is kept to a minimum.While The Mortal Instruments City of Bones does have JudoChristian iconography with its use of angel statutes and paintings this is a film that actually sidesteps being be a Christian saying all religions are valid and avoids any mention of God or the afterlife.The acting for the most part is decent enough though the dialogue is predictable and a little clichd at times. We do get to see Clary transform from a regular teenager to a Shadowhunter wearing a short dresses a leather jacket and thigh high boots. While Campbell Bower brings a sardonic wit to Jace and there is strange aspect that all the Shadowhunters speak with English accents whilst the werewolves are Irish. Actors like Headey and Jared Harris do offer a little gravitas to proceedings but there are really extended cameos with the young actors being front and centre.Zwart did show his action credentials when he directed The Karate Kid but he seem to regress for his follow up film. The action sequences are for the most part fairly bland typical fare. But Jemima West's Isabelle has some moments with a whip and looking really badass when she has a flamethrower. Hell give her a film.The special effects are nothing to write home about. There are not bad but due to the limited budget the digital looked obvious at times particularly the werewolves. Yet the demons near the end of the film does have a cool glowing effort and have a similar look to Kronos' minions in Wrath of the Titans.The Mortal Instruments City of Bones has been have a torrid time with mainstream critics but in all honesty it is a perfectly serviceable fantasy adventure that is better to the Twilight series it has been compared to and will please fans of the novels.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com".

I get that the whole book would have been too long but I believe that that part of the book was worth the extra few minutes he would have turned back into Simon after the fight if there wasn't enough time to show him in the institute. Second of all Valentine is suppose to have white hair I don't really care about this detail it's more about how he was played He is suppose to be a sophisticated well spoken SMART villain. You are suppose to think How is HE the villain?!? He's suppose to be really charming but have a darkness to him. Instead he looks like a biker who wondered on the set and was told Oh you're the villain.Clary is NOT suppose to be drawing runes until the next installment but I guess i see why it was necessary for her to be able to draw runes in that scene. But it was just another confusing aspect to this movie.Jace is suppose to be a really rude character. He's NOT suppose to be love struck over Clary every ten seconds. It's not suppose to be really obvious yeah you get a few little indications here and there but it's not the main focus in his mind. There was a lot more focus on Clary and Jace than Alec and Jace. They definitely should have explained that a lot more. Even though I had read the book even I said Wait what? when Clary said that Alec loved Jace because we didn't have any indication before that other than the little tiny mumble Alec said to Clary which was Stay away from Jace. There were two more indications after that which was Alec talking to Jace and also Alec pushing Clary against a wall and threatening to kill her if she doesn't leave. Maybe that scene with Isabelle should have happened later on in the movie. We didn't have any indication as to Luke being the leader of the pack it was just a call to other werewolves who were working in a store to be honest. Luke was really confusing in the movie if you didn't read the books he's a father figure to Clary. He's basically like her stepdad. ALSO! What was with Hodge telling Valentine to tell Clary and Jace they were related?! That was a waste of time and it gets you wondering Are they related? Are they not? It's suppose to make you gasp and say Oh no! They are related! They should have just shown Valentine telling Jace and Clary Hodge was completely unnecessary in that part of the film.The end scene was a bit weird and clich. Them riding off in a motorcycle that 1. Was not mentioned as to why he had one. Or 2. How he got it Which was on the roof of Dumort Hotel which would have been a nice bit to add into the movie. I guess somethings need to be cut out of the book but I think these things were a bit necessary in order for people to love the movie as much as the book.The only things I loved about this film were the creatures They were really well done and creepy! Jocelyn she was really well cast and well acted and very true to the books and the sets. They were just as I had imagined if not better! All in all a good film. This is just what annoyed me as I have spent the time to read the books and I love all the characters and the sets. For people who haven't read the books. It's not too confusing although some parts in the movie you go What just happened? I recommend seeing this with someone who has read the books to explain those bits. Please go see this movie if you have read the book it was extremely exciting to see what and who I have imagined on a massive screen. If you haven't go see with someone who has read the books if you want to really understand the series without reading the books.".

Apparently she used to do HP fan fiction shocking.Okay so we clarified poor man's HP  but to top it off then she makes this weird incest thing between two of the main characters. Ermm Guess she's also a fan of star wars? Honestly the whole movie was just what it should be coming from this type of writer  a bunch of idea's taken from different movies and TV shows thrown into one movie. I didn't see one original idea in the whole thing but we all know that's a common theme now a days. The difference between this movie and other moviesshows that recycle old ideas is  this movie did it so bad it became uncomfortable to watch.Save your money save your time. Watch SOME of the better done moviesTV shows this was ripped off from. Harry Potter Star Wars Supernatural.".

Apparently she used to do HP fan fiction shocking.Okay so we clarified poor man's HP  but to top it off then she makes this weird incest thing between two of the main characters. Ermm Guess she's also a fan of star wars? Honestly the whole movie was just what it should be coming from this type of writer  a bunch of idea's taken from different movies and TV shows thrown into one movie. I didn't see one original idea in the whole thing but we all know that's a common theme now a days. The difference between this movie and other moviesshows that recycle old ideas is  this movie did it so bad it became uncomfortable to watch.Save your money save your time. Watch SOME of the better done moviesTV shows this was ripped off from. Harry Potter Star Wars Supernatural.";

Though this seems like a trend with YA movies beside Harry Potter I tend to see critics rip and tear apart teen movies like birds feasting on a dead carcass...I swear they all get together and decide to do it as a group. just saying Anyhow I wouldn't say TMI was perfect but it was the first in the series and I hope they get a chance to fix their minor mistakes and release City of Ashes. I enjoyed that book and would love to see it brought to life.The actors I did not see anything wrong with any of them save the actor who played Magnus Bane he wasn't terrible but definitely lacked the personality that he had in the books. His character always made me laugh and I guess Godfrey Gao kind of fell a little flat and almost mechanic on screen. I thought everyone else fit well and acted well I don't see the issues that many others seem to see. I'm no film critic but I am a fan and a lover of movies.The Plot Although most of the movie seemed to stick with the book they surprisingly changed a lot at the end. For example Hodge telling Valentine to lie to Clary and Jace about being sister and brother versus Hodge actually believing that they were brother and sister after Valentine tells him this. I guess I can understand why they did it but it to me did not have that gut wrenching oh crap! moment I felt when reading the books even though as a reader I hoped and kind of figured it wasn't true especially when the character of Sebastian shows up it all starts to piece together from there. Though I cannot understand why they did it...the incest reason? In case they never made another movie? Fear of confusing people? I don't know I wasn't a fan but the changes like this one definitely did not ruin the movie for me.I enjoyed the action sequences and even thought the cheesey romance scene in the garden was kind of cute I thought the kiss between Jace and Clary was pretty passionate and personally felt as though Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower had good chemistry. I have to admit I liked Jamie already from his role on Camelot Well this is just my opinion and two cents I just really hope that the movie itself does well with the fans and that a second film is made because I for one will be devastated to see such an amazing series from such an incredible author be shut down after only one movie.

But I was determined not  to judge a book by it's movie ha! and went to see City of Bones last  night.  It's a Twilight clone. And a terrible one at that.  Listen it's clear that this type of movie has an audience and I am by  no means a typical member of that audience. On top of that I am not  familiar at all with the books. But none of that should matter  a  movie should have enough merit to be watchable by anyone even outside  of the usual demographic. And this was nearly UNWATCHABLE.  Let's try to do pros and cons. This should be fun...  Pros    Lily Collins the main character and poor man's Kristen Stewart was  also in Priest...one of the lowestscored movies in BDBOS history.  So...she's consistent.    You know those people who ALWAYS say The book was waaay better than  the movie? Again never read them myself but I can't imagine the  books being ANY WORSE THAN THIS so at least that will be an easy  argument to win.    Lena Headey aka 300's Queen of the Spartans still gets to kick a  little bit of ass.   Cons    I've read that a considerable amount of the book was cut from the  movie simply because it was impossible to fit everything into a 2hour  film. I feel like whatever was cut from the book would have made a  better 2 hours of movie. So many plot holes so many needlessly  unanswered questions so many things that DON'T MAKE A GODDAMN BIT OF  SENSE.    Twilight did this already. If you're a Twilight person you've seen  this movie already. Awkward ordinary teenaged girl thrust into a  secret world where supernatural beings battle each other and gaining  multiple OneDirectionlooking love interests along the way. If you  told me that this movie was really called Twilight The Other New  Moon's Eclipse At Dawn I'd believe you without argument.   In God's name WHY IS THERE AN IMAX VERSION OF THIS??? STOP IT  Hollywood. It's hard enough to justify watching 2 dimensions of this  crap.    This movie might actually be cheezier than Twilight. Terrible one  liners public shows of affection at awkward times and a plot twist  that will make you feel REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE about things you saw  previously in the film.   When the audience which was practically empty in my theater by the  way starts laughing at parts of the movie that aren't supposed to be  funny...you have a problem.    It's over 2 hours long...and you'll feel EVERY LAST MINUTE of it.  City Of Bones scores a 1 out of 5 on the BDBOS and should not be  watched by human eyes. Vampires and werewolves should probably stay  away too.".

As a fan of the books I came into this knowing they were going to change things and being okay with it. I was very happy with the small changes and rearrangements. I loved this movie. It has to be one of my favorite book to movies. It's different but the changes all fit well with were the movie went and flowed. Despite what critics have said I think this is nothing at all like Twilight or Harry Potter. It's nothing we ever have seen before being a fan of a lot of YA novels and movies and have repeatedly read and watched them so I know whats what. This moviebook is not at all like Twilight especially. For one the female lead can actually kick ass and stand up for herself. The acting was much much better than I expected. Robert Sheehan was fantastic as Simon Lilly Collins a great lead truly pulling off Clary and Jamie Campbell Bower was everything I ever imagined for Jace. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was absolutely creepy as the villain Valentine Kevin Zegers played Alec perfect and new comer Jemina West was the best Isabelle I could picture. WHO WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE I was with my mom who has not read the books at all and she loved it. She's a fan of fantasy like I am so she was able to keep up with everything and understand. Unlike some critics who stated they couldn't keep up with all the new terms. So I recommend this movie to ANYONE who likes fantasy films that have action good acting love and a little bit of scary. Who SHOULDN'T watch this movie People who expect this to be Twilight and just another teen show. People who can't accept changes to the book at all. COMPLETELY WORTH SEEING IN THEATER! I plan on going again! Possibly even two more times to see it before the movie is out to DVD.".

I expect a loose end or two when it's done in sort of a cliff hanger where you expect more of the story to be told but in this movie they did what has to be the poorest job of wrapping things up I have seen in quite some time.If you read the book then your good cause you have those answers but me? I left with so many questions that I felt as if someone spliced out scenes in the film.These are my gripes. Spoiler Alert Hodge who turns out to have betrayed the shadowhunters is last seen closing up the opening that allowed the demons entry. There is no resolution as far as is he cast out for his betrayal? Did he die closing the opening? Did the others ever find out of his betrayal? Then you have Alec who is in love with Jace and is last seen being healed and expected to survive but do they ever go back to show him? No. It sure would be nice to know if that near death experience had any effect on his desire to profess his love for Jace. Oh well.Then you have Jocelyn believe to be possibly dead turns out she is in a comatose for most of the film and the film ends how? Her still in a comatose state. Why? Is she in some alternate dimension? Is she in Odin sleep Is there a bigger part she still has to play? Would of been nice to see something that maybe suggests that. Oh and what was it she drank? Jace had the bottle. Couldn't he give the bottle to the Warlock so he can maybe create an antidote? But wait there's more. Then you have lifelong friend Simon. He is the only mundane of the bunch. Well at least he starts out as one but it seems Clary notices after rescuing him from Vampires that he has bite marks and Simon doesn't seem to need his glasses anymore. Does Simon ever find out why that is so? Does Clary ever tell him Hey dude I think you might want to get stronger sunblock? Nope. Seems like Simon and movie goers would want to know if he is indeed a vampire or not.Then the big reveal. Clary I am your father. Oh and by the way Jace is your brother. Can someone please tell me how do you not have closure if this is indeed true or not? Jace suggesting that in his heart he doesn't believe it? I mean really? What is there no such thing as a paternity test in this universe? No Rune that can tell if they are indeed from the same blood? Sorry I just was left with way too many unresolved story lines with not even the hint of say Hey wait till the next film and all this will be answered.If you read the books and all my points are resolved then great but at least tell anyone that has never read the books that they need to read them to understand these unresolved issues.".

No. It sure would be nice to know if that near death experience had any effect on his desire to profess his love for Jace. Oh well.Then you have Jocelyn believe to be possibly dead turns out she is in a comatose for most of the film and the film ends how? Her still in a comatose state. Why? Is she in some alternate dimension? Is she in Odin sleep Is there a bigger part she still has to play? Would of been nice to see something that maybe suggests that. Oh and what was it she drank? Jace had the bottle. Couldn't he give the bottle to the Warlock so he can maybe create an antidote? But wait there's more. Then you have lifelong friend Simon. He is the only mundane of the bunch. Well at least he starts out as one but it seems Clary notices after rescuing him from Vampires that he has bite marks and Simon doesn't seem to need his glasses anymore. Does Simon ever find out why that is so? Does Clary ever tell him Hey dude I think you might want to get stronger sunblock? Nope. Seems like Simon and movie goers would want to know if he is indeed a vampire or not.Then the big reveal. Clary I am your father. Oh and by the way Jace is your brother. Can someone please tell me how do you not have closure if this is indeed true or not? Jace suggesting that in his heart he doesn't believe it? I mean really? What is there no such thing as a paternity test in this universe? No Rune that can tell if they are indeed from the same blood? Sorry I just was left with way too many unresolved story lines with not even the hint of say Hey wait till the next film and all this will be answered.If you read the books and all my points are resolved then great but at least tell anyone that has never read the books that they need to read them to understand these unresolved issues.";

Now while reading other user reviews I found out about it and suddenly it becomes clear why this movies is SO BAD!I really can't understand all those people praising the performance the action etc. Have you people been watching a different movie? Or did you read the book which I guess was pretty good and forgot that you must judge the MOVIE not the book?There are so many bad things in this movie I don't know where to start. It's the very first movie that I literally wanted to stop watching after an hour or so. I proposed my girlfriend to leave the cinema earlier but she wanted to see the end.What I noticed about other movies that I'd rate as average they had plenty of action but where lacking character development. This movie however was a complete mess in what regarded action. In the second half of the movie the scenes were simply coming out of nowhere and with no connections in between. Many things remained unexplained and hereandthere we find out some magic tricks that just don't connect with the story.One major problem is the mixing of so many clichs I was literally saying Oh... this too... every time a plot twist or a character background detail was revealed. This movie was an UNHAPPY MIX of TwilightThe vampire diaries with some modern fantasy movies like that one with Nicholas Cage being a wizard I don't know the name now. In the end it jumped into Star Wars fathersonsister clichs You are my daughter I am your father would have really been TOO MUCH He is your brother Come with me son brothers kiss before the revelation interestingly enough they continue to feel attracted to each other even after they found out fatherson duel the good father turning bad etc etc. We see the classical vampirewerewolf rivalry although vampires seem to be very very weak creatures in this movies. Nearly 100 vampires seem to have no chance facing a handful of humans. In the final battle scenes I was literally confused as to who was fighting why and where. I was praying for someone to die and bring the movie to an end.I'm not gonna say anything about character development. It's a long lost art in moviemaking and I didn't expect this movie to deliver any sample either.I wasn't expecting however to see such poorly done screenplay. Absolutely no realism whatsoever in character reaction. Like for example in the beginning the black witch tells the girl Your mother was a Shadow Hunter! and she says No she's a paintress... I mean come on!! Is that really what you say when someone tells you your mom is some demon hunter??That was just an example among dozens of bad details. The only explanation for the good reviews and such a high grade 6.6 at the moment must lie in the book's fans...In conclusion I did have low expectations heading into the movie but I thought it would be at least decent. It wasn't. Fans of the book will blame me but I don't know about the book. I haven't read it. I only watched a movie. And it was VERY BAD.".

What I cannot stand are things that are changed for no other reason than to be changed. Example every single thing about Valentine from his hair color to his personality. And why did they change the scene in the club? The way it was written in the book made a lot more sense and it would not have taken any longer to portray it that way in the movie... One more unnecessary change her comment to Jace about him tearing off his shirt to bind her wounds that was said at the city of bones after the silent brothers tried to remove the block from her memory why would they move that piece of dialog to the beginning of the movie when they had only just met. Way too early for that easy banter between Clary and Jace. No reason just a change for the heck of it.I disagree with a lot of the reviews that say the casting was awful and the acting was even worse. I think the actors did fine with what they had to work with the dialog on the other hand was pretty bad.My main gripe however was the lack of important details. I may have missed it but I never once heard anyone mention the significance of angels. The swords were never named nor did they glow. The stele was shown but again not one word of what it was. If I had sneezed I would have literally missed the fact that they used ruins at all. And what the heck... Clary just up and drew a mark on her hand that froze demons. I guess it just came to her after all she had met the shadow hunters a few hours before plenty of time to figure out their entire system that was not ever explained to her she's just that good.There were many more changes that made absolutely no sense... but you get the idea. After the movie I spent about 45 minutes explaining to my husband what should have been made clear in the movie. I have read all of the books so I knew what was going on but that should not be a prerequisite for going to a movie adaptation.The trailers for this movie were awesome I just wish the movie had lived up to its potential. Overall I was a sad panda and a little angry we spent 20 on a movie that could have been really good but wasn't.".

	schema:headline " Didn't think this one was too bad.";
	schema:reviewBody "Endangered Species starts as a city lives in fear a city in fear of a serial killer who has claimed dozens of victims already. Lieutenant Mike 'Sully' Sullivan Eric Roberts  Lieutenant Wyznowski John RhysDavies are on the case but the only connecting factor is that all the killings have thus far took place in health or fitness clubs. The elusive killer has potentially made a mistake though as he left a witness alive at his last massacre while visiting her in hospital Sully spots a mysterious guy Arnold Vosloo talking to her who runs away when challenged. Positive that the guy is involved with the killings Sully chases  catches him but he isn't prepared for what he will eventually discover. The guy is an alien space warden assigned to look after the human race from intergalactic poachers like the one killing people in the city  taking their skins to turn into alien clothes. Sully  the alien guy team up to stop the alien hunter...Written  directed by Kevin Tenney one has to say that this low budget ripoff of The Hidden 1987  Dark Angel 1990 turned out a lot better than I was expecting it ain't no masterpiece but provides some cheap  sometimes amusing scifi horror action entertainment. Endangered Species isn't that original  falls into the human cop vs alien killer type sub genre  as I say it's not too bad for it's type. The character's are OK the alien guy's are rather underdeveloped but the mismatched double team of cops  regular BMovie stars Eric Roberts  John RhysDavies play off each other quite nicely  there are one or two amusing moments between them. The story about an alien killing human beings for the skin to make jumpers out of could have been rather fun but the film tends to take itself a little bit too seriously  that plot comes across as too simplistic as the skinning  making jumpers  coats angle is largely ignored  a much more standard  forgettable serial killer on the loose approach is taken. The pace isn't too bad  there's a surprising amount of action  setpieces from car chases explosions fights shootouts  a couple of massacres while none of it's particularly big budget or spectacular it kept me entertained  I reckon there's fun to be had here if your in the right mood which I evidently was.I was a little disappointed in the gore levels here apart from some gunshot wounds  a few dead bodies there isn't any. The action is pretty good with the highlight being an impressive car chase as Sully  the alien guy chase an invisible van through the traffic in a sequence with a fair amount of stunts  exploding cars. There is also a sequence in which the near invincible alien hunter enters a police station systematically going through it shooting all the cops in a scene which plays like a homage or ripoff whichever way you look at it to the similar scene in The Terminator 1984. There's some gratuitous nudity too if that's your thing the opening sequence in particular features a blonde with big breast's taking a shower. For a few minutes.Although set in the US this was shot on location in Vilnius in Lithuania the film does have a slightly cheap madefortelly look about it but not as cheap a some low budget horror films I have seen recently that look like they were shot on a camcorder. There's a good BMovie cast here including the prolific Eric Roberts Arnold Vosloo who went from The Mummy Returns 2001 to this  of course John RhysDavies who provides the comic relief.Endangered Species is a half decent little scifi action horror thriller that does at least provide sporadic moments of fun  entertainment throughout  overall passes the time harmlessly enough if your in the right mood.".

The story about an alien killing human beings for the skin to make jumpers out of could have been rather fun but the film tends to take itself a little bit too seriously  that plot comes across as too simplistic as the skinning  making jumpers  coats angle is largely ignored  a much more standard  forgettable serial killer on the loose approach is taken. The pace isn't too bad  there's a surprising amount of action  setpieces from car chases explosions fights shootouts  a couple of massacres while none of it's particularly big budget or spectacular it kept me entertained  I reckon there's fun to be had here if your in the right mood which I evidently was.I was a little disappointed in the gore levels here apart from some gunshot wounds  a few dead bodies there isn't any. The action is pretty good with the highlight being an impressive car chase as Sully  the alien guy chase an invisible van through the traffic in a sequence with a fair amount of stunts  exploding cars. There is also a sequence in which the near invincible alien hunter enters a police station systematically going through it shooting all the cops in a scene which plays like a homage or ripoff whichever way you look at it to the similar scene in The Terminator 1984. There's some gratuitous nudity too if that's your thing the opening sequence in particular features a blonde with big breast's taking a shower. For a few minutes.Although set in the US this was shot on location in Vilnius in Lithuania the film does have a slightly cheap madefortelly look about it but not as cheap a some low budget horror films I have seen recently that look like they were shot on a camcorder. There's a good BMovie cast here including the prolific Eric Roberts Arnold Vosloo who went from The Mummy Returns 2001 to this  of course John RhysDavies who provides the comic relief.Endangered Species is a half decent little scifi action horror thriller that does at least provide sporadic moments of fun  entertainment throughout  overall passes the time harmlessly enough if your in the right mood.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had certain expectations when reading the title of this movie. No I didn't think it would be a porn movie but I hoped it would be a lightfooted comedy about relations and sex. But big was my surprise when I actually saw it. It hasn't much to do with comedy or relationships. It's about Jeanne a female film director who has a lot of troubles with her two main actors. They both hate each other but are asked to play a difficult sex scene together. She has written and created the scene and knows exactly what she wants but she isn't able to make them do it right...If you ask yourself why this movie has such a confusing title then I'll explain to you what might have happened. Even though this is a French movie with French dialogs the title is in English. However I guess they have translated the title too literally. In French it would be something like Sex c'est jouer la comdie which could be translated as Sex is faking it. That would make a lot more sense because the actors have to pretend they like each other and that they like to have sex together while in reality they can't stand each other and don't want to do it.The main problem that I had with this movie was that much didn't happen. It was all talking talking and even more talking. I'm not saying that I wanted a big sex scene or a huge car chase but this movie just seemed to drag on eternally without offering something special. Normally I like European movies but this one really didn't do it for me. Somehow I couldn't really care for the different characters even though they didn't do a bad job. I give this movie a 610.".

They both hate each other but are asked to play a difficult sex scene together. She has written and created the scene and knows exactly what she wants but she isn't able to make them do it right...If you ask yourself why this movie has such a confusing title then I'll explain to you what might have happened.

I do confess that I have a penchant for meta but I found this film to be very accessible and entertaining and not even in a labored selfconsciously clever way which is certainly a bit of what you expect in a film about filmmaking. It is very French in that there are a great deal of outlandish yet occasionally compelling theories about how filmmaking and even sexuality works but since the director doesn't quite play herself using an avatar instead we're left with a lot of choices since I'm pretty sure she's constantly contradicting herself. Apparently Catherine Breillat specializes in hardtowatch films but I'd definitely say this one doesn't qualify. I really enjoyed the dialog the balance between the cinematic and the natural the relationships between the director character and her assistant and actor and so on. Highly recommended.".

In this film a director Anne Parillaud is having trouble filming a sex scene because her actor Gregoire Colin and actress Roxane Mesquida can't stand one another. That's pretty much the entire story but the film is so much more than that because it really gives us a behind the scenes look at what goes on during filming such a scene. As with the director's next film Anatomy of Hell this one here didn't get very good reviews but I was totally captivated by it. I'm not sure what it is but Breillat can make just about anything seem real and interesting. It's clear that this sex scene being shot is her personal experience from the filming of Fat Girl. The sex scene here is the same one from that film and the actress here is also the same one used in that film. The performances by the three leads are all very good but the movie belongs to Parillaud as the director being tortured by her actors. Parillaud really nails the role as the frustrated director willing to do anything to get the scene in the can. I think the film works best if you've seen Fat Girl because you can watch the filming here and know what eventually came from it. It's rather interesting watching this film and seeing what all went into making Fat Girl and more clearly what it took to pull off the sex scene in question which is one of the most haunting yet beautiful ones that I've seen. This film certainly isn't about sex and there's no comedy to be found but it is about a director trying to get both out of her actors.".

French cinema usually sticks to the ultimately arty films and leaves the shootemups and star vehicles to Hollywood. That is probably a good business strategy as no other nation's film industry will likely have the resources to compete on those sorts of projects. Films about filmmaking are often a bore as it has little resonance for people not in the business. But this one held my interest much more than I thought it would. In spite of the title oddly in English it really isn't much of a comedy in spite of a few droll moments. I've only seen a few of Anne Parillaud's films but she shows a generous amount of talent and range from the actionpsychological drama of La Femme Nikita to the wry comedy of Innocent Blood. This film also extends her range as she plays a more or less ordinary woman yet is still compelling on the screen. Kudos also to Roxane Mesquida with whom I was unfamiliar. She plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film whose talent is drawn out at the end. If you don't HAVE to have car chases and explosions to be entertained check this one out.".

I enjoy movies about making movies and I think this is definitely worth seeing if you like that genre. But it's not a movie to see if you're in the mood for a comedy or if you think it's going to be sensuous or sexy as I found it neither. The director harangues and insults the Actor and coddles the beautiful but talentless Actress and flirts with her assistant and often stands around looking troubled trying to capture her vision of a young girl losing her virginity on film. Spoiler Alert Apparently her vision is very close to rape IMO and I found it extremely offputting after waiting an hour and half to finally get to it. It's not an especially satisfying film though I might have enjoyed it more if I'd had the right expectations.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw the US premier at the American Museum of Moving Image last night 102005. Cantet and co. interweave three short stories by Haitian writer Dany Laferriere not yet translated into English from French as of 102105. Though the scope and themes of the stories differ considerably Vers Le Sud is as shattering and masterful as Cantet's previous feature Time Out and should similarly be talked about for years to come.Cantet and cinematographer Pierre Milon have shot many incredibly complex emotional exchanges without relying on any obvious dialogue. Their confidence that it would cut together and 'play' so well on screen must be partially due to Cantet's having a cowriter who is also the editor Robin Campillo. The story is told through subtle reactions gestures and intonations ala Time Out but Vers's dialogue seems both more plentiful and more emotionally transparent.Vers also contains more characters incidents and a more complex thematic scope than Time Out. Where Time explored a single character's relation to work pride and masculinity Vers explores 3 middleaged white women's sexual and romantic desire for a teenage Haitian black male prostitute. Cantet explores the central situation's inherent political racial sexual emotional and agerelated issues often in the same scene. In doing so Cantet  LaFerriere necessarily broach a number of taboo subjects middle age women being openly sexual on screen and being sexual with teenagers women paying male prostitutes white women with black men women as one discarded ignored caste hooking up with another discarded ignored caste 3rd world men of color women giving sexual desire the same primacy in their lives as men traditionally have the world's richest bedding the world's poorest the willful blindness of the rich towards the suffering of the poor or foreign American economic imperialism the predatory nature of consumerist tourism. In exploring these issues Vers provokes a sense of moralpolitical outrage on par with the very angry very moving The Constant Gardener. The tourist women of Vers turn a willfully blind eye to the dire political  economic situation that drives vulnerable young men into their beds. To watch these women do this is infuriating their desire becomes repellent exploitative.But at the same moment we are also made to feel how touchingly human these women's needs are for love Brenda sex Ellen and affection Sue. We experience their loneliness as achingly poignant even tragic. During the QA one middleaged woman in the audience referred to the film as profeminist in its emotional honesty and I agree. The women's relations with their gigolos appear to be emotional twoway streets albeit with a much wider lane for the Northerners. The women and young men do share affection and it isn't hard to understand how the women could fool themselves into believing in the possibility of real love blossoming in these tropical permissive environs. But when disagreement or insecurity arises with the gigolos the women's economic superiority gives them the final word. That the same characters in the same scene can simultaneously evoke nausea and tenderness is a testament to the skills of all involved. The film feels very French in its tasteful restraint  the sex is never shown  and in the way it explores its politically charged themes largely through malefemale relationships. The film therefore plays entirely as human drama and never feels sensationalistic didactic or titillating.I had a few minor quibbles with this great film. The performances of actors playing Ellen Albert and Legba were pitchperfect. But there were moments in Brenda and Sue's scenes when I felt them 'Acting' whether this is attributable to lapses in writing acting directing or editing is impossible to know. I enjoyed the monologues delivered into the camera but I thought they would have felt less artificial if another character had been written into the rooms with them for the character to address. I also felt it lasted 1 or 2 scenes longer than necessary in the end. Some have argued that the film should included more of Legba's perspective but I disagree. Given the sensitivity of the film as a whole the nationality of the original short story writer Haitian and in conveying Legba's emotions in particular I'm sure that the storytellers made a conscious decision not to include more of Legba's perspective and the film's structure is the stronger for it.In fact the film could only have been created by a group of artists working at the top of their form. Like Time Out there will not be a more complex film than Vers Le Sud this year and I include my other arthouse favorites 2046 HeadOn Last Days Broken Flowers Brown Bunny The New World and yes Kung Fu Hustle. Here's hoping Vers gets a proper distribution.".

A Haitian woman with the greatest sweetness and dignity implores a man she's never met a resort hotel employee to take away her teenage daughter with him so that the girl will be safe. The lady explains that her husband had a respectable position but suddenly was disappeared by the Papa Doc regime now she is penniless. The man refuses to take the girl. Instead he meets a sadfaced sallow white woman named Brenda Karen Young and takes her to the hotel.Soon Brenda is on the beach where young blacks  the favorite Legba Mnothy Cesar lithe and sweet the older Neptune Wilfred Paul little Eddy Jackenson Pierre Olmo Diaz and others  accompany women in their forties and fifties of whom we observe Sue Louise Portal a French Canadian and Ellen Charlotte Rampling  who almost seems to be in charge.There is something voyeuristic about the first third of this movie. The way the boys fawn on the women  and the women lap it up  is more mutually exploitive racist political more starkly richpoor youngold  even more starkly hedonistic than we're accustomed to seeing on the screen  so overtly shocking that even before the film has gone into release American critics have taken offense at it. Perhaps most shocking of all we know this is the poorest and scariest country in the hemisphere at one of the worst times the Seventies yet these people are having immense fun living an idyll.Cantet is as concerned with the whole situation as he is with the few events that unfold as concerned with the whole phenomenon of heading south as with Brenda's hopeless perhaps embarrassing infatuation with Legba or Ellen's subsequent collapse the trouble that befalls Legba  these dispersals and dispositions of the action. But the situation is such that something must happen. It's a situation that's satisfying to the participants but fraught with danger.Human ResourceResources humaines 1999 Cantet's second film and the first one shown in the US shows a small factory where a young man who's just come in as part of management joins a strike to support his worker father  even though his father rejects the strike and resents this stand. The film sees labor conflicts in a very personal way and identification labormanagement socialistcommunist as flexible. Time OutL'Emploi du temps 2001 the director's third outing is also about work identity and masks. A man loses his job but out of shame invents a nonexistent one and for months pretends to his family that he's traveling with important new responsibilities international in nature when in fact he's just driving around vast stretches of country. Has he lost his job his identity or his sanity? A bit of each because they're intertwined.Heading South is also about work and masks and ambiguous roles. The white women's Haitian lovers aren't simply sex workers or gigolos. At least one the older Neptune works as a fisherman. Free lancers they aren't paid in any organized way just slipped some money or given presents. In return the Haitians satisfy the women in ways that can hardly be quantified. Three years ago Brenda seduced Legba at fifteen after her late husband had been feeding him meals and she had her first orgasm with the boy at the age of 45. She Ellen and Sue address the camera directly to describe their situation. Legba who says it's sexier to talk little and preserve his mystery never does. The film's based on three short stories by Haitian writer Dany Lafferire and the action feels like an updated Somerset Maugham this is colonialism and it's people who take foolish risks and get burned.I don't think the white women are unaware of the awful regime they just look the other way. Several times when the camera's alone with Legba that is away from the white women we see signs of the corruption power and danger close at hand and we realize these can crush Legba  even for almost no reason. When he's taken for a ride in a limo with dark windows we know he's in mortal danger.There's a seeming contrast between the heartonhersleeve vulnerable Brenda from the American South and cool sophisticated Ellen a Brit from Boston who's fluent in French. Ellen cynically says the women all want the same thing  a good time  but in the end it's Brenda who goes on pursuing pleasure and Ellen who returns to the North her heart and spirit broken. Brenda replaces Ellen and little Eddy who already wants to pair off with white women in time will replace Legba.Heading South isn't as clearly schematic as Human Resources or as intriguingly strange as Time Out but brings up a wider and more troubling range of issues. Its upfront look at sexual tourism and the presence of the reborn and quietly magnificent Charlotte Rampling will insure that this third of Laurent Cantet's movies to be distributed in the US will lead to more recognition by the American audience.Local reactions show Cantet has unintentionally touched American nerves. He's simply cooler about race class and gender he's not unaware of anything but he lets us draw our own conclusions and he enjoys provocations and ambiguities. He continues to be an interesting filmmaker who has a special skill at showing how public and private issues intersect and Vers le sud looks as if it will win him both more friends and more enemies. By heading South he's put himself more on the map.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at TIFF last night in the North American premiere. I gather it had been in competition at Venice the week before. Confess I had not heard of the film prior nor the director and attended as I got two free tickets....The film takes place in Haiti in the late 70's and is about three older single women visiting a beach resort to take advantage of the sun sea sand and young Haitian men. Essentially sex tourism.The film explores the relationship of these three women with the younger men and uses these relationships to explore their relationships with each other and themselves. Each women is looking for something different from their visit though not all is at appears on the surface.Charlotte Rampling is radiant as Ellen the oldest of the three who has a relaxed attitude to the sex and the almost unspoken transaction with the men. To paraphrase she always realized that no man would be interested as she aged and always assumed she would pay young men for sex when she got older believe this is a reference to Simone de Beauvoir. Ellen's focus is on the elegant and charming Legba as played by newcomer Menothy Cesar who picked up an award for this performance at Venice last week.Brenda as played by Karen Young is returning to the island for the first time in three years her life having recently fallen apart . She too has a relationship with Legba from three years prior and is determined if not obsessed with renewing it. Ms. Young is given the difficult task of portraying a women at the threshold of middleage who is both naive and unwilling to admit to her base desire. She doesn't always pull it off but it is the most difficult role in a film full of challenging performances.Sue as played by Louse Pitre a fine French Canadian Actress is from Montreal and her attitude towards the situation is far more down to earth than her two friends. She understands that things are different down here and understands that she would not be treated so well under normal circumstances. No matter she is determined to enjoy the situation for what it is without complications. In the end she is more of an observer of the conflict that arises between Ellen and Brenda and is meant I think to provide a contrast to what is going on behind their masks. She is also the only one who is happy.The linchpin to the movie is Legba the young Haitian who is the obsession of both Ellen and Brenda. They believe he is a simple man with simple values and yet in extended scenes away from the resort his personal life is revealed to be a nightmare typical of the oppressed poor under Duvalier further complicated by his relationship with the mistress of a Colonel in Duvalier's army. Cesar is terrific in this role and beautiful to watch.There is minimal plot in the film withe focus clearly being on character development and exploring the masks people wear to both protect and fool themselves. Slowly over the course of the film Ellen Brenda and Legba are all revealed to be much different from our initial impressions of them and more interestingly their impressions of themselves. The question is whether this is interesting for the the viewer to watch as the film does drag at times. Indeed I walked out of the film more concerned with where I had parked my car than what I had just watched.Darn it all however when I woke up this morning this movie was the first thing I thought of and it has haunted me all day. The sad revelations at the end of the film say a lot about human nature and in the end will keep the film in my mind for many weeks to come.".

That's a story a new film Heading South Vers le sud is telling.Three midaged North American women two Americans and one Canadian went to Haiti for summer vacation in the 70s soaking in the sun and their desire for beautiful young Haitian boys. They have what those boys don't have money and social status. The boys have what the ladies don't have their youth and bodies. When two of the three ladies want the same handsome 18 years old Legba the vacation is over.This is an excellent film. I love this film for its brutal honesty its originality its thought provoking subject and its terrific performance. Money liberates these ladies' sexuality but can money buy love that they really desire for? Isn't it interesting that these ladies wouldn't lay their eyes on a black guy back home but they are lusting after these young men in the poorest country? What made the connection between them here in Haiti?".

It doesn't involve men looking for kinky sex or men looking for women instead it is mainly older women who like to spend some time with the young men they met at the beaches of the different resorts they patronize. The sex is an adventure as well as something they could well afford. After all the young men these women seek are flattered by the white women that love to have a little time with them while on vacation.Helen a repeat visitor has claimed for her stay the services of the handsome slim and charming Legba. Helen a college professor back in the States figures in Boston she could only aspire to have sex with older men who are cheating their wives. Here at the resort she has picked the cream of the crop for her amusement during her summer vacation. Little prepares her to see someone else take claim of Legba who she regards as her personal property.Brenda a woman from Savannah arrives at the resort as the story unfolds. Having been there before with her husband she had met Legba they had sex and the young man has made her come for more not knowing she is stepping on someone's territory. Helen in spite of her welcoming gesture realizes she is competing with Brenda for the same young man.Legba and his friends are ubiquitous in other parts of the Caribbean resorts where they tend to go in search of adventure and a bit of money so they can have nice clothes that most of the time are given to them by the tourists. Legba or his friends are never accepted to eat at the restaurant as it's made clear to Brenda by Albert the hotel manager who considers them a plague he rather do away with.Haiti was ruled at the time by Francois Duvalier or Papa Doc one of the bloodiest dictators in the Caribbean. His men roamed the country killing left and right. One of the higher ups in the government takes a young mistress who happened to be in love with Legba. When she sees him on the street one day she invites him for a ride but she is marking him as a condemned man as far as the loyal driver is concerned. Legba will have no chance to keep on living after that encounter.Laurent Cantet the huge talent behind the camera keeps surprising his audience. He cowrote the screen play with Robin Campillo resulting in an impressive film in the way it's been set up and the rich texture Mr. Cantet gave to the production.Charlotte Rampling is seen as Helen. This actress is enjoying a second career in France. Ms. Rampling is one of the best things in the film. One can see in her face the emotions this woman of a certain age is going through after she feels betrayed by Legba. Karen Young as Brenda is also quite good. Evidently she never knew love in her marriage and she awakens with Legba in the kind of sex she has never experienced. Louise Portal plays Sue the Canadian woman who is attracted to the sexual atmosphere and the attention from all the poor youths that look for tourists in order to make ends meet. Menathy Cesar appears as Legba. Mr. Cesar shows why the women love him. He is charismatic and knows how to move. Lys Ambroise plays Albert the proud man of a good family now reduced to manage this resort.Laurent Cantet clearly shows why he is one of the most interesting directors working in films today. He has no fear tackling themes other more established men would shun to deal with. His honesty permeates everything he does. This is a film recommended for mature audiences.".

	schema:headline " Brilliantly acted richly layered story of sex tourism in 1970s Haiti";
	schema:reviewBody "French writerdirector Laurent Cantet creates films in which an intimate drama of well etched characters plays out within a broader subtext a backdrop that focuses on some larger social issue. Heading South is about unattached white women of sufficient means to enjoy Caribbean vacations and indulge their sexual appetites with local men. This story is set against the misery of an impoverished underclass in early 1970s PortauPrince Haiti.Charlotte Rampling plays Ellen a college English teacher in Boston who's been coming to a particular beachfront hotel for years. She spends all summer. Unsentimental lusty and outspoken she pays for the attentions of Legba Mnothy Csar a lovely young lad of 18 who can make Ellen come when she merely thinks about him. She has no illusions about this arrangement or so it seems for a while. She knows that Legba services many tourists like her makes his living this way probably supports his family as well. She's the ringleader of a circle of women each with a favorite local gigolo in tow.Upsetting this idyllic arrangement Brenda Karen Young arrives on the scene. She's the antithesis of Ellen a mopey sad sack of a woman 10 years Ellen's junior but with none of the older woman's appeal. Brenda's a terminal romantic and entirely selfcentered. She had in fact seduced Legba three years earlier when he was 15 has thought of him daily since then and following a divorce is now returning to find and take up with him again. She's in love.Brenda boldly lays claim to Legba who tries to service her on the side while still maintaining his connection to Ellen. No way. Initially amused by Brenda's earnestness Ellen gradually reveals that she is not as tough as she would have people believe. She is deeply hurt and angry in fact when Legba rejects her to spend more time exclusively with Brenda.Legba is playing his own game. He's not in love with Brenda. But she is giving him plenty of gifts. If anything he toys with her sober infatuation perhaps finds it a refreshing change of pace from Ellen's frankness and mock insults. But Brenda isn't playing by the rules. This throws everybody off and ratchets up tensions.We begin to see into Legba's his town life where the picture is far from rosy. A destitute mother. An old girlfriend who has become the mistress of a wealthy gangster but begs for Legba's company. We see him interrupt a street soccer match to rescue his young sidekick Eddy from possible arrest or worse by a cop who drinks a pop from the boy's sidewalk stand without paying and kicks over the stand when Eddy protests.Ellen learns that Legba is in trouble hunted by a gunman who works for the gangster. She begs him to let her help to protect him even to go to Boston with her to live but he won't hear of it. We can see that she cares for his welfare in a genuine sense. But the gulf between them which Ellen had lulled herself into ignoring is ever present to Legma.We receive a fuller more insightful picture of Haitian sensibilities toward whites from Albert Lys Ambroise the chief factotum of management at the hotel. We get Albert's take through a long aside a soliloquy spoken into the camera directly to us. Ellen Brenda and Sue take their turns giving us information on their backgrounds and sentiments in using the same dramatic device. Always a perilous film tactic it works well here. Albert's contempt for the white overclass runs deep a passion that had been passed down from his grandparents.He speaks of the power of American money over the poor local population. Where the French stole their independence and the Duvaliers stole their worldly goods the Americans are stealing their dignity and right under Albert's nose. As he sees it the young native men hustling tourist women trading sex for money and baubles are degrading themselves but feel forced to do so to make a living.For his part Legba is also deeply sensitive to these circumstances. He has little trouble recognizing Brenda as his original seducer and is enraged when he sees her dirty dancing with young Eddy on the beach. It isn't at all clear that any of the women not Brenda not even Ellen can fathom the broader context and harsher ironies underlying their connections with their boyfriends. Ellen says she has no interest in going into town that it's a bore. We can surmise that Legba would much prefer to live his life among his own people and no longer prostitute himself. Ellen's notion of how best to help him is for all her seeming savvy naive.We can hope that the screenplay is authentic for it is based on three short stories by the native Haitian novelist Dany Laferrire who was born in 1953 in PortauPrince. He was a late teenager himself in the years when this script is set. He abruptly left Haiti in 1976 fearing for his life and has lived in Montreal since spending some time in Miami as well.Cantet never insults the viewer's intelligence by dispensing sociologic wisdom or overreaching with his chosen conceits. The characters play out their lives on vividly realistic terms. By the end some people have died and the principal women have exchanged psychological places. Ellen now bereft and vulnerable goes home to Boston and presumably a life of embitterment. In the final scene we see a refreshed Brenda journeying off to tour more islands bound for new adventures now acting the sexual predator but dragging her wrecking ball behind her.

She had in fact seduced Legba three years earlier when he was 15 has thought of him daily since then and following a divorce is now returning to find and take up with him again. She's in love.Brenda boldly lays claim to Legba who tries to service her on the side while still maintaining his connection to Ellen. No way. Initially amused by Brenda's earnestness Ellen gradually reveals that she is not as tough as she would have people believe. She is deeply hurt and angry in fact when Legba rejects her to spend more time exclusively with Brenda.Legba is playing his own game. He's not in love with Brenda. But she is giving him plenty of gifts. If anything he toys with her sober infatuation perhaps finds it a refreshing change of pace from Ellen's frankness and mock insults. But Brenda isn't playing by the rules. This throws everybody off and ratchets up tensions.We begin to see into Legba's his town life where the picture is far from rosy. A destitute mother. An old girlfriend who has become the mistress of a wealthy gangster but begs for Legba's company. We see him interrupt a street soccer match to rescue his young sidekick Eddy from possible arrest or worse by a cop who drinks a pop from the boy's sidewalk stand without paying and kicks over the stand when Eddy protests.Ellen learns that Legba is in trouble hunted by a gunman who works for the gangster. She begs him to let her help to protect him even to go to Boston with her to live but he won't hear of it. We can see that she cares for his welfare in a genuine sense. But the gulf between them which Ellen had lulled herself into ignoring is ever present to Legma.We receive a fuller more insightful picture of Haitian sensibilities toward whites from Albert Lys Ambroise the chief factotum of management at the hotel. We get Albert's take through a long aside a soliloquy spoken into the camera directly to us. Ellen Brenda and Sue take their turns giving us information on their backgrounds and sentiments in using the same dramatic device. Always a perilous film tactic it works well here. Albert's contempt for the white overclass runs deep a passion that had been passed down from his grandparents.He speaks of the power of American money over the poor local population. Where the French stole their independence and the Duvaliers stole their worldly goods the Americans are stealing their dignity and right under Albert's nose. As he sees it the young native men hustling tourist women trading sex for money and baubles are degrading themselves but feel forced to do so to make a living.For his part Legba is also deeply sensitive to these circumstances. He has little trouble recognizing Brenda as his original seducer and is enraged when he sees her dirty dancing with young Eddy on the beach. It isn't at all clear that any of the women not Brenda not even Ellen can fathom the broader context and harsher ironies underlying their connections with their boyfriends. Ellen says she has no interest in going into town that it's a bore. We can surmise that Legba would much prefer to live his life among his own people and no longer prostitute himself. Ellen's notion of how best to help him is for all her seeming savvy naive.We can hope that the screenplay is authentic for it is based on three short stories by the native Haitian novelist Dany Laferrire who was born in 1953 in PortauPrince. He was a late teenager himself in the years when this script is set. He abruptly left Haiti in 1976 fearing for his life and has lived in Montreal since spending some time in Miami as well.Cantet never insults the viewer's intelligence by dispensing sociologic wisdom or overreaching with his chosen conceits. The characters play out their lives on vividly realistic terms. By the end some people have died and the principal women have exchanged psychological places. Ellen now bereft and vulnerable goes home to Boston and presumably a life of embitterment. In the final scene we see a refreshed Brenda journeying off to tour more islands bound for new adventures now acting the sexual predator but dragging her wrecking ball behind her.

For the confused capitalist white men Cantet substitutes middleaged randy white women soaking up the sun and Tequila Sunrises outside PortauPrince. Thankfully there is very little political theory being spouted by the main characters although Ellen cannot resist some harsh comments directed at Brenda late in the film.Charlotte Rampling as Ellen has relatively few scenes but leaves a great impression as a college professor whose value in the sexual marketplace shoots up when she leaves Boston for the tropics. She doesn't seem very bitter about this just accepts it as part of the aging process. Karen Young is new to me most of her work has been done for TV. Her part is different more spiritual less grounded in the realities of here and now. She has less inner resources to cope with the chaos and violence of Haiti. Louise Portal is one of my favorite Quebec actresses known to foreign viewers through Denis Arcand's very funny Decline of The American Empire. Here she plays a woman who is simpler than Ellen or Brenda happier and less conflicted about growing old.Cantet's direction of actors and description of the poverty and desperation as well as the beauty of the Haitian locales is very effective. I wondered what he was going to do after Time Out that wintry cry of despair from the French Alps and he hasn't disappointed me.".

	schema:headline " The Darker Side Of Female Sexuality And The Aging Woman";
	schema:reviewBody "Taking us places we've never been before is one of the excellent ways cinema tells artistic stories. HEADING SOUTH deserves much credit for this aspect.Rarely if ever do we see the darker side of female sexuality and this is explored in minute detail in the film. But the message doesn't stop there. We also see the up and ultimate downside of Western culture on a society struggling with its own identity in this case Haiti.Haiti is the poorest nation in this hemisphere not to mention riddled with an AIDS epidemic and a militaristic government. This comes into stark contrast as we watch Brenda Karen Young exit a plane in Port au Prince and walk between the desperate homeless and the guntoting military. She is quickly whisked away from this ugliness and into an idyllic beach resort by its owner Frank Guiteau Nestant. Here she meets up with two other civilized women vacationers Ellen Charlotte Rampling and Sue Louise Portal who has only the slightest role in the flick. They strike up an interesting if antagonistic relationship especially whenever they're around the lithe and beautiful Legba Menothy Cesar a male prostitute of sorts who services the ladies of the resort. Yet much more is going on and has gone on.Brenda a white woman from the States first met Legba years before and experienced her first orgasm with him ...when she was 45 and he was only fifteen. Because we're in Haiti though pedofilia doesn't apply. The laws tend to be lax in that aspect. Brenda explains her first sexual encounter with Legba in brutally interesting terms using words such as threw myself and animal. We also witness Ellen's attraction to Legba which also goes deep no pun intended. Brenda is 55 years old and knows she's on the downside of her sexual identity with men her own age so seeks out a distant yet physically fulfilling relationship with Legba too. Trouble is though is that both Ellen and Brenda find themselves more than just physically attracted to Legba. Brenda has no qualms about her feelings and all but plants herself in his lap whenever she can. But Ellen tries to be more aloof feigning disinterest in anything beyond physical desire aka lying to herself. Brenda can see that Ellen wants Legba just as badly as she and so bitter sparks fly amongst them.But in the midst of these two battling and somewhat selfish women is Legba himself. Born into poverty he finds himself trapped between the old Haiti and the possibility of a new life with one of the women from the resort note Legba is black in case you didn't realize that. But relationship ties with his mother and an old flame flicker in his mind holding him back and threatening his very existence at important crossroads in the story. He's also more outspoken than most of his other male counterparts at the resort and tells the women exactly what he thinks You look old like that. This endears him even more to the summer visitors.Life in Haiti is often vicious and fleeting and this is brought home to the viewer when we watch Legba being chased through Port au Prince by a gunwielding madman after someone sees him escorting a white woman around the city Brenda. Nothing good can come from a relationship with these infrequent guests unless he can get off the island. But can he? Is he willing to let go of his homeland and his family in order to just survive in a distant world? Director Laurent Cantet gives us a very good character study while enveloping it in the political strife surrounding Haiti. But the film's pacing is exceptionally slow and male viewers may very well be turned off by the subject matter. Although female pedofilia does exist it isn't nearly as rampant as the male version. And men may have a better sense of the separation between sex and love this is a broad distinction though and may only hold true in a Mars Versus Venus sense.Still the story is interesting enough thanks to some great acting on the part of oldtime sex symbol Charlotte Rampling FAREWLL MY LOVELY 1975 and the firsttime role of Menothy Cesar as the unforgettable Legba.".

Ellen introduces the frustrated Canadian Sue Louise Portal that works in Montreal in the storage department of a factory to Brenda and disputes with the new acquaintance the sexual favors of Legba.

Despite the theme the director does not dare and makes a conventional movie with no eroticism or sexual tension among the characters that are shallow and uninteresting. Charlotte Rampling is still a beautiful woman but the scene where she mentions that she is fiftyfive years old is absolutely unnecessary since she was almost sixty in 2005. My vote is three.Title Brazil Em Direo ao Sul In the Direction of South".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult for audience members to watch movies like this without subjecting the film to a standard for film not art. They watch dumbly unable to appreciate comparing and analyzing why they don't see relevance to their lives and ultimately not connecting. This film I find to be extremely good telling a very real story although there are numerous anachronisms to the late 70'searly 80's time period and when such films pursue such detailed reality within the construct of of a storytelling medium the results are dazzling. The setting is Haiti with its poverty and glorious island paradise there are political tensions there are racial problems. There are the older women paying young Haitian men for sex they have histories. There are many circumstances. The beauty of it is you can envision the entire history of Ellen Charlotte Rampling's character in an entirely different movie with as much depth as you may find anywhere credit due to her acting and the writer. You can see so many other stories being untold and told at once if you let go of your cinematic prejudices. Legba's past is never disclosed but it's at once known without knowing and even the 'reality' monologues questionably interspersed they're revealing as much as they are saying by what they're not saying. Audience members have difficulty allowing their imaginations to read between the lines and fully engross themselves. The specificity of this film makes its themes universal and undeniably relevant to anyone including me a 30 year old white American artist. There are questionable cinematic devices to a cynical viewer but ultimately the film stands on its own two feet and proclaims certain hidden truths. Shall I name them? No. I recommend this film highly to humble intellectual minds who appreciate humanity. I especially appreciated what I viewed as the fundamental difference between two people from different backgrounds who shared the same passion. Ellen and Brenda both love Legba. Ellen the English woman understands the circumstances and resigns herself to them without hope while Brenda the awkward and passionate American lets her heart bleed all over the place with hope. Hope and faith and belief in miracles a truly innate and indigenous American characteristic while cynicism resolution calculated and methodical stereotypes the Brits. Each has their downfall but the love remains from the heart. I liked this film very much.".

They watch dumbly unable to appreciate comparing and analyzing why they don't see relevance to their lives and ultimately not connecting. This film I find to be extremely good telling a very real story although there are numerous anachronisms to the late 70'searly 80's time period and when such films pursue such detailed reality within the construct of of a storytelling medium the results are dazzling. The setting is Haiti with its poverty and glorious island paradise there are political tensions there are racial problems. There are the older women paying young Haitian men for sex they have histories. There are many circumstances.

	schema:reviewBody "spoilersWe are at a small Haitian beach resort in the 1970s which is frequented by North American middleaged single women looking for readily available Haitian boytoys cheap and attentive to enliven their vacation. Two women from the U.S. Ellen and Brenda meet and become casual friends in the bonne homme of a small resort but their friendship is soon strained to mere politeness as they find themselves competing for the attention of the same beautiful young man Legba with whom they are both infatuated. There are scenes of genuine eroticism and sensuality between the young man and the two women but what seems lost on both women as they allow their competition to escalate their attachment is that neither is of significant interest to Legba. He is a seasonal worker like roofers and house painters back home his trade happens to be gigolo during the tourist season. When the season is over he has his normal life with a mother struggling to make ends meet a girlfriend and the pervasive strongarm government corruption that haunts the lives of the island country. As the women increasing fling themselves money and other enticements at Legba's feet it does not occur to them that he is not in love nor in danger of falling in love with them which makes their passion all the more poignant and pathetic.An interesting point is made as the 3 leading women are having a frank after dinner discussion about the fun of having boytoys at the disposal summed up with the statement  the difference is that the white men our age back home aren't really horny. This was met with knowing grins and chuckles. The ironic point is that you can be sure at tables of other sextourism locations men are having after dinner conversations agreeing that the difference is that the white women our age back home aren't really horny. I find this film difficult to peg as it doesn't fit the usual genres drama romance or sexcomedy. 2 days reflection later I added thisHeading South may be a problem for some viewers it was for me of the type not seeing the forest for the trees because I forgot what frames all. The film opens to an earnest middleaged Haitian woman offering her teenage daughter to a stranger she thinks is leaving the country because she believes it is only a matter of time before the girl will be kidnapped raped and murdered by one of the bands of thugs which the Haitian government used to help rule the country by terror. This mother figures her daughter has a better chance surviving with a nice looking stranger in another country than staying with her own mother in violent and corrupt Haiti. Then near the end of the film we see the bodies of two Haitian dumped on the beach at night because they had offended some government sponsored thug of one of the death squads. When focused through these two horrific lens the middleaged middle class ennui of three vacationing white women so absorbing to them becomes pathetically selfindulgent as they use their petty cash unthinking to add yet another exploitation on the poor 3rd world people who work at the resort.".

Karen Young who plays a Brenda brimming with Valium offers a performance strong enough to sustain interest but at times too small for the big screen. And of course who can deny that the views of Menothy Cesar's body are anything less than delicious?";

That seemed a bit odd to me...then I read a French report on Islamic extremistsmost were surprisingly women converts! Then I began thinking about cults...the Manson Family...mostly women...Branch Davidians....mostly women....and so on. Then there is the phenomenon of the kidnapped girls some of whom had the freedom to run away but refused to do so Elizabeth Smart et al.. While watching Beatles Eight Days a Week which is mainly about the concerts the Beatles gave it struck me that virtually the entire audience was young girls all hysterical. Why???? Then when thinking one day about Obama's mother married a Kenyan student when she was very young then married an Indonesian I stumbled across this subculture of women who search out exotic locales for sex tourism. It's not a new phenomenon but I'm not sure when it began Heading South is supposedly set in 1979. Maybe the sexual revolution of the 1960s unleashed something???This is a good movie in the sense that it at least tries to take a stab at explaining the women's motivations. A second movie Dutch 2016 is Benzess as Usual where the son of one of these vacation idylls returns to meet his father. In this case it's Tunisia. But exactly the same thing is going onolder women using younger poor men for sex. And as hinted at in Headed South in this case the beach boy is taken to the Netherlands and then Switzerland by different women!. He marries both but of course it ends badly. A third movie in this genre is Paradise Love. In this case it's German women on the beaches of Mombasa. The location changes the story is the same. There are also numerous youtube videos on this theme. And then of course there are books like The White Masai about a young ! Swiss woman who marries a Masaiand not an educated Westernized one but a native from a village living in a mud hut. It's beyond bizarre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Tony Bui left Vietnam to live in California when he was only two years old then returned to take a look at postwar Vietnam in 1994. The result was his 1999 film Three Seasons that walked away with a prize for Lisa Rinzler's cinematography as well as the Best Dramatic Picture Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Performed in Vietnamese with Vietnamese actors Three Seasons is a series of interweaving stories about loss and redemption in the lives of four characters living in Ho Chi Minh City though the residents apparently still call it Saigon. Its strength lies not in its plot or characters but in the stunning images and dreamlike quality that transports the viewer into a world of sensuous music and soft colors where village women sing while they work harvesting flowers on a lotus lake.The main and most effective story is about a cyclo driver Hai Don Duong who falls in love with a prostitute named Lan Zoe Bui He wants to redeem her innocence and dutifully waits for her each day as she leaves her hotel. When they go to a hotel together he pays 50 from the money he won in a cyclo race merely to watch her sleep a gesture that allows her to experience the feeling of being loved for the first time. The second story is about a young lotus picker Kien An a female orphan Ngoc Hiep Nguyen who befriends her employer Teacher Dao Manh Cuong Tran and lovingly copies his poems that he cannot record himself because of leprosy. This gesture allows both to touch the poetic quality of life the teacher for perhaps the last time. The other stories involve a fiveyear old street urchin named Woody Huu Duoc Nguen who braves monsoonlike weather to sell trinkets to tourists in order to survive. When the box containing his wares is stolen he sets out to find it. This brings him in contact with an American James Hager Harvey Keitel in Vietnam to search for the daughter he left behind when the war was over. This last episode is the least developed of the four and Keitel's performance seems listless in spite of the fact that he is Executive Producer of the film. All four stories come together at the end in a way that ties up all loose ends.Though I am grateful for any look into Vietnam Three Seasons left me wanting more. It is almost as if Bui was being overly cautious afraid to say anything about what he saw because of the censors following him around. As a result his film does not convey a strong sense of time and place and the neon street signs and glamorous hotels patronized by the rich could be anywhere in the world. Perhaps it is true that the city's culture is being overrun by rampant commercialism but the director observes this without comment and seems content to offer only a highly romanticized tone poem. Even the city's textures squalid areas and chaotic energy are so muted by the use of camera filters that it robs them of their steamy authenticity. Three Seasons is visually striking but left me feeling like a distant observer. I found the characters to be neither fresh nor engaging and the film overly composed lacking in the poetic vision that turns an average film experience into a great one.".

Dao was a handsome poet who is dying of leprosy. He lost his fingers and Kien offers herself to write his poetries for him. Hai Don Duong is a tricycletaxi driver who falls in love for the expensive hooker Lan Diep Bui. Woody is a homeless little child working as street peddler of watches cigarette lighters and other minor goods who has his wallet stolen. He believes that the thief is James Hager Harvey Keitel a former marine who is looking for his daughter with a Vietnamese woman during the war. These three parallel bitter and beautiful stories present in a metaphoric view the transition of the political and economical system of Vietnam. Professor Dao represents the traditional system the communism rotten and dying. Lan is a metaphoric view of the transition to the capitalism corrupted aimed and unattainable for most of the poor population. Woody and the little girl represent the next generations of excluded of the new wild system fighting for the survival and having no perspective in life. James Hager would be the return of the American interests in Vietnam. I am intrigued with the title of this film Three Seasons. The lotus means the spring the hard rain means the winter the fallen leaves the autumn. Where is the summer and why is it missing? Three Seasons is a highly recommended movie open to the most different interpretations by the viewers. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Trs Estaes Three Seasons".

	schema:headline " The Unobtrusive Tony Bui";
	schema:reviewBody "Tony Bui's Three Seasons takes place in the teeming nightlife and the majestic hotels and the open marketplace and  squalor of modern day Saigon. It is symbolically a film about traveling the historical past and present put together in four uneven vignettes and how the lives of five people crisscross each other.  Bui is not obtrusive and so his film is gentle and sweet and he lets his actors play out their roles with naturalness and grace.   The gentleness of this film can be both its strength and weakness because you leave thinking about discrete images beautifully photographed but you don't really have a sense of what Bui was trying to say.  The image of sweat running down the face of cyclo drivers and the red abrasions on naked skin across the woman's back caused by a spoon are just two examples. Also unlike Western soap opera he isn't here to manipulate.  Take the old man Master Dao and his terribly scarred up face and amputations.  Dao could have been afflicted by the after effects of napalm or a land mine explosion but no he has an oldfashioned affliction leprosy.  There is no postVietnam hate in Bui. The spirited cycle race through the streets of Saigon descends upon us without much buildup nor dramatics.  We don't realize the significance of Hai winning this race till we see what he does with his winnings.  Perhaps the few times Bui decides he needs to make an explicit statement he does so with subtlety  the plastic lotus flowers which outsell the naturally grown ones the opulent newer hotels rising in Saigon turning the society into truly haves and have nots what Bui calls the people of shadows and the hardworking cyclo driver straining to move his vehicle as his Western couple occupants chatter oblivious to his struggles.   The other weakness of Three Seasons is that the four vignettes are so interesting that each could have occupied the entire film. Instead we get incomplete servings from all four and a hunger to know more. Bui spends more time with the cyclo drive and the prostitute and the water lily girl and her poetic master.  The story about the street smart little boy who is forever in the rainy streets looking for his missing case of trinkets to sell and finding both the case and a tender companion in the end could have stood by itself.  Similarly the Vietnam vet who comes back to find his lost daughter because he has to 'right a wrong' is a beautiful piece that needed more detail than what the film provided.  The final scene of Three Seasons summarizes this film neatly  the falling crimson pedals from trees lining a boulevard.  It is picturesque in its beauty but the meaning of it is more effervescent than lasting.".

The image of sweat running down the face of cyclo drivers and the red abrasions on naked skin across the woman's back caused by a spoon are just two examples. Also unlike Western soap opera he isn't here to manipulate.  Take the old man Master Dao and his terribly scarred up face and amputations.  Dao could have been afflicted by the after effects of napalm or a land mine explosion but no he has an oldfashioned affliction leprosy.  There is no postVietnam hate in Bui. The spirited cycle race through the streets of Saigon descends upon us without much buildup nor dramatics.  We don't realize the significance of Hai winning this race till we see what he does with his winnings.  Perhaps the few times Bui decides he needs to make an explicit statement he does so with subtlety  the plastic lotus flowers which outsell the naturally grown ones the opulent newer hotels rising in Saigon turning the society into truly haves and have nots what Bui calls the people of shadows and the hardworking cyclo driver straining to move his vehicle as his Western couple occupants chatter oblivious to his struggles.   The other weakness of Three Seasons is that the four vignettes are so interesting that each could have occupied the entire film. Instead we get incomplete servings from all four and a hunger to know more. Bui spends more time with the cyclo drive and the prostitute and the water lily girl and her poetic master.  The story about the street smart little boy who is forever in the rainy streets looking for his missing case of trinkets to sell and finding both the case and a tender companion in the end could have stood by itself.  Similarly the Vietnam vet who comes back to find his lost daughter because he has to 'right a wrong' is a beautiful piece that needed more detail than what the film provided.  The final scene of Three Seasons summarizes this film neatly  the falling crimson pedals from trees lining a boulevard.  It is picturesque in its beauty but the meaning of it is more effervescent than lasting.";

The obviously gorgeous and varied visual feast for one's  eyes combined with small subtlteties such as the nipple of the whore's breast showing through the pink nightgown that the cyclo driver gave her.. just a second.. but a revealing moment since all the clothes she dressed in as a whore never revealed her as much. Another example was in the story of the lotus flower girl and the leper.. the more she wrote his poetry the more his face appeared out of the shadows and became lit. The marriage of the visual and lighting movement reflecting the feelings of the characters is rare to see and something to be studied again in this film. And a moving performance by Keitel clearly searching for his humanity. And a perfect bit of casting with the woman who played his grown daughter. The director's sense of timing not rushed letting each story unfold carrying one on the precarious wave of the confused mix of the country's old and the new the thought provoking issues of the various different kinds of love portrayed..parental loveromantic love poetic love the love of beaty where it realy lies....all rare in film making today. Profoundly disturbing scenes of the street children. Nothing like this from a young American film makers that I've seen. And as a worldwide distributor of film TV and video who tries to support new filmmakers I've seen a fair amount. I would like to know where the poetry came from and how to find it for myself to read and savor it even more.Bravo Tony Bui. Bravo Timothy Bui.".

Some better and more interesting than others. Three Seasons tells the story of an American looking for his daughter  this was the least interesting of the stories. It also tells the story of Woody a street urchin who thinks the American stole his case of tourist trinkets. While this story is better than the searching for the daughter story it just seemed a bit too shallow. Three Seaons is also the story of Hai a cycle driver who gives a ride to Lan a hotel callgirl whom he ends up falling in love with. This was a good story albeit quite generic but this story was really welltold on the screen. And finally it is also the story of Kien An a young woman hired to harvest lotus flowers who end up bringing a glimmer of life back to a reclusive man stricken with leprosy. This was the most touching and beautiful of all the stories told in Three Seasons.Three Seasons does have some really good acting performances by the Vietnamese cast. Ngoc Hiep Nguyen playing Kien An stole the screen with her performance. But Duong Don playing Hai and Diep Bui playing Lan were also putting on very memorable performances.This is a story and character driven movie so it might come off as a slow and dull movie to some.

In the rain. The photography and composition are masterful the pacing is languid the script is minimal and what's on screen looks absolutely authentic. It looks as if it were filmed completely on location in Saigon without sets. Each of the four stories The American Woody Lan and Teacher Dao is resolved in a way that it would be resolved only in Vietnam and the strongest story in my humble the story of the dying teacher and the flowerseller could have taken place centuries ago. I think the film does a great job of showing the viewer layers of Vietnamese culture of which The American's story although just as gutwrenching as the others is only the latest.".

	schema:headline " OK but weaknesses in the script and tooobvious plotting undermines an interesting film";
	schema:reviewBody "Kien An takes a job harvesting white lotuses in the fields belonging to a reclusive man and then selling them in the streets of Ho Chi Minh City. After her song catches the ear of Teacher Dao he invites her to his home where she engages him and starts to write the poetry he has within him. At the same time a cyclo driver collects Lan as a standard fare and despite her being a working girl decides to wait for her quickly becoming practically her own private cyclo driver however his interest in her quickly becomes love and he tries to break though her tough exterior to find her heart. Meanwhile on the streets of the city Woody is a street kid selling cigarettes out of briefcase in all weather. It is here where he meets James Hager an American looking for a daughter he believes he fathered during the war. After meeting James Woody loses his case and believing James robbed him sets out to find him. These three stories barely touch but are delivered as all part of the same one in this film.The only thing I knew about this film prior to watching it was that it was the first American film to be made in Vietnam once the embargo was lifted and that inspectors for the Vietnamese government observed the entire process. With this acting as a hook for me I decided to give this film a stab and in a way I am glad that I did. The film does the wellknown technique of mixing together several stories with a vague connection in this case seemingly flowers or some general meetings between the characters and this succeeds in making it interesting while at the same time preventing it from really becoming as engaging as it should have been. The stories all have enough going for them to get an audience interesting in the various characters but sadly none of the three stories are original or emotionally involving enough on their own or in combination to make this a particularly impressive film. The three tales all pretty much go where you expect them to even if some of them are pretty unlikely and unconvincing it's a shame of course as this could have had a place in history and been really good but instead it is just OK.The thing that will stick in my mind is how good the film looked and most of this is down to the cinematography and the direction of Tony Bui. For all his weaknesses in his plot and script Bui makes the city look appealing without simplifying or sweetening it  the use of colour is nice but for me it was more enjoyable to see the energy bustle and depravity of the city itself. For the western audience Harvey Keitel is naturally going to be the biggest draw but he actually does very little other than be his own reliable self in a minor character. Duong is slightly more impressive and he plays a hackneyed character well enough to make it better than it should have been. However he like the others are hampered by the material to some extent. Ngoc Hiep Nguyen is sweet and pretty good Huu Duoc Nguyen is probably the best thing in the film as he is convincing and never slips into 'cute kid' mode. Bui is alright as Lan but her character is far too simple to really allow her to have the tools to work with.Overall this is an interesting film that is good enough to be worth seeing however it is hard to really ignore how basic the plots all turn out to be and it isn't as emotionally impacting as it could have been. The direction is good and the performances are as good as the material allows them to be but without a better script the film cannot really be more than OK.".

After winning a plethora of awards at the Park City film fest Three Seasons is the first of the class of 1999 to make it to release.  A delicate portrayal of a people trying to survive in modern Vietnam first time director Tony Bui has fashioned the slowest film of the 90's.  I don't mean cool David Lynch slowness or even watchingpaintdry fun.  It's a film about mostly uninteresting actors doing uninteresting things set in a uninteresting place.

While undoubtedly a beautiful and thriving city Bui chooses to shoot the film in the dark some sequence are almost pitch black.  For all I can tell this could have been shot in Montreal.  Bui drops the ball big time in his choice of lighting.  This feels like a brighter film with a ton to show off.  Instead the audience has to fight to catch a glimpse of the action. Actor Don Duong and Ngoc Hiep Nguyen give wonderful performances in what ends up being the film's most satisfying story.  The rest of the actors are left to stare into the camera and try to muster meaning.  It doesn't work.  The lone American Harvey Keitel is given the most underwritten role.  He strives to make the character's emotional complexity resonate with the crowd but we are never really sure of his motives  as simple as they might seem. In other movies subplots like the hooker with a heart of gold or wandering kids would be critically smooshed.  But when this film uses the same clichs they bestow awards.  Maybe I missed something.  In the year of Blair Witch Project and other Sundance breakthroughs Three Seasons feels like a bad representation of what the prestigious film festival has to offer.  4".

	schema:reviewBody "Before giving my review How can any idiot give a 1010 for this st. I too am a fan of Allu Arjun  because of that I feel it is my duty to properly critique the movie so that the mistake isn't repeated in future. Don't give exaggerated ratings to your favourite actors. Similarily you give 110 to a movie if the movie was so bad that you either want to murder the makers or you want to commit suicide. If neither is the case don't give 110 to any movie.Fine. Where should I start?Gunasekhar came across an interesting plot point  What if during an arranged marriage the bride  the groom decide to not see each other until the last moment of tying the knot. He doesn't know what to do next with this point. So he goes in every direction north south east  west searching for all the available movie clichs. He puts all those into a movie assuming that audience are going to watch anyway since your hero is a top star  finally what will you get. Presto! you have the worst movie of Allu Arjun's career Varudu.In a recent interview Allu Arjun said Gunasekhar narrated me the story in 2 minutes and I liked 4 scenes narrated in that 2minute narration. After watching Varudu I was left wondering what those 4 amazing brilliant wonderful scenes were.See httpamarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com for more reviews.I generally hate when people go late to a movie. But you can safely skip the first 30 minutes of Varudu as nothing happens there. The usual 'friends of hero' elevating him to 'god among humans' status hero intro scene where he has gravity defying powers a hero solo song to highlight his dance. All the routine fare.There is absolutely no comedy in Varudu. You may find some comedy settings but all are forced situations  I would be surprised if anyone has more than a couple of laughs. I smiled only twice in the whole movie. Watching Brahmi my nickname for Brahmanandam never felt so tiresome for me.The movie is written by Gunasekhar  Thota Prasad. While writing don't they even think for a second about who speaks such bunkum dialogue in real life. Perhaps the friends  family of the writers. Too melodramatic for even reel life.I could see a few people banging their heads during that whole scene after heroine's kidnap. I mean just imagine you are the bridegroom  your bride is kidnapped  you are sitting at the mandap and the relatives are advising you to marry another girl. Add to this an amazing lecture from an old man about relation between science  wedding rituals.I had to specially google to see who is the editor for this movie. It is Mr.Anthony  he has done editing for some very good movies which include Kaaka Kaaka  Ghajini. The editing in Varudu is rubbish with so many abrupt cuts tampering the flow. Suddenly lorry chases the hero from nowhere  after a while hero chases lorry only to be crashed by another lorry. From where does this scene come  where does this go. I can't believe that an experienced editor would have made such rough cuts. I some how suspect that Gunasekhar definitely interfered with him.It would be a sin not to mention the graphics. What is the purpose of graphics? My understanding is that it is to show some difficult action or scene as really as possible. If this purpose isn't achieved why use graphics  make the whole scene ridiculously fake?The climax fight inspired from XMen Origins Wolverine is one of the worst I've seen. Unless you loan your brain to somebody the fight is a torture.The actors include Allu Arjun newcomer Bhanu Mehra as the heroine Tamil hero Arya as the villain Suhasini Ashish Vidyarthi Sayaji Shinde Nassar Naresh Brahmi Ahuti Prasad etc. The performances are average with nothing special to boast. In fact some of them are over the top by a mile. I dearly wished for the heroine's mother to have a heart attack in her first scene. Would have saved some agony. Allu Arjun gives a good performance but the almighty dialogue doesn't suit him. Heroine's intro is very unique  novel. She does her job  suits the role. Arya as villain is good but again the dubbing lip sync should have been better.The music is average at best. We've seen better from Mani Sharma. Devi Sri has given good music for Allu Arjun in the past. Why am I sensing an interference here from Gunasekhar? Nothing super special in dance department too. Arjun being one of the most gifted dancers in Tollywood delivers what is expected of him.Taking a break from bashing the only delightful sequence in the movie is the 2nd song Bahusha Vo Chanchalaa. It is beautifully shot with some great looking art work. After that song my next delight was when I saw 'Subham' at the end.After Arjun Sainikudu  this somebody should really beat Gunasekhar with a hammer.There are only two sets of people who might watch this in a theatre. The first set are Allu Arjun diehards. The second set are miserable people like me whose mother tongue is Telugu but live in foreign places I live in Mumbai with no Telugu neighbours  a Telugu movie is the only way to hear nonstop Telugu for 2 12 hours and I suppose this is enough Telugu for a sentence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bet somebody 20 that you wouldn't find that stash tonight. I guess I lost. Dave Faris  Emma Evigan have found the perfect house in a great neighborhood with great neighbors. While on their first night there they discover a hidden closet filled with heroin. Thinking the best option is to leave and call the cops they walk outside and their neighbor tells them that that is a bad idea. Running back into the house they have no option but to toss out the stash to the people waiting for them but that is not all they were looking for. So going into this I had low expectations because of the fact that this is a Lundgren movie. In my opinion he peaked in Rocky. This is another mindless action movie that is good enough to keep you watching but still a movie you forget as you are watching. If you are a fan of Lundgren you will like this movie. If you aren't I have to say I have seen worse from him. Overall everything that a typical Lundgren usually has. Lame plot acting and a movie that you forget as you watch. I give it a C.".

I like how he plays his roles as honest as possible. He doesn't fake it to try to be something he is not. He is not a great actor but a good and honest actor he always give 100 of himself. That being said I can not rate the movie on that and him alone. if you have seem some of his other films and enjoyed them well this one is pretty much the same. The cosmetic view point in this one is even better than normal for his style of films. The story was much better too and the rest of the actors played there part pretty good although I though Dolph was the best. Please don't expect a grand master piece when watching this remember what type of movie you are going to watch and then sit down and enjoy. Too many people sit down to a Dolph Movie or Stallone or JeanClaude Vandamme and expect a award winning movie. Why ? When has that ever occurred. Then they say it was a waste of time. .... well sure if that is what they were expecting  they're right but it wasn't the movie's fault. I sat through this and just relaxed and enjoyed like ones supposed to do.".

The whole idea is kinda similar to the film 'Panic Room' accept the panic room in this is the whole house.The plot is simple yet not entirely well thought out either. A young couple buy a large house which seems completely out of their league frankly and are just about to move in. After some snooping they find a huge quantity of heroine stashed away oh STASH house I get it hehehehehe almost immediately the criminals that own the drugs turn up and start to terrorise them.The thing is I still am not entirely sure what they are really trying to achieve. It turns out they don't want the drugs but are in fact after something else. Obviously I can't say but even when we do discover what they are after there is no real reason for it. There is naturally big dealings behind all this with big mob boss fat cats pulling the strings but the plot to me felt very shallow almost as if its just an excuse to have some cool thriller action sequences inside a cool housemansion.Dolph turns in a good performance I must admit he certainly has grown from his straight to DVD crapola he used to churn out. This film is a much better vehicle clearly with good production values and some care behind its creation. All the scenes look quite slick and moody with great lighting the action gets pretty intense and bloody and the other lesser known cast do a good job even though the female lead is really annoying when she cries.Its not grade A stuff of course there are issues here and there the ending is particularly daft...tonnes of police at the scene yet no one is noticing what's going on by the ambulance? and where is the crew? Better than the fluff you might be expecting that's for sure but end of the day the whole plot makes no sense really. Why on earth didn't the criminals just do what they wanted to do before the house was sold?! it just seems like they give themselves a lot of hard work.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with most contemporary movies is the question of credibility. Most action epics constitute theme park thrill rides with outlandish stunts that cost mega bucks not only to stage but also to enhance with CGI effects. Hollywood always tries to scale down their budgets but rarely their believability when it comes to action pictures. Venezuelaborn director Eduardo Rodriguez and freshman scenarist Gary Spinelli strive for credibility in Stash House with Dolph Lundgren and Briana Evigan. This wellmade but often nondescript melodrama weds three genres the surveillance saga the house pictures and the crime thriller. Lots of movies are now depicting their narratives from the perspective of surveillance cameras like the Paranormal Activity flicks. We've also had a rash of movies about haunted housed. Usually these movies concern houses that are either inhabited by supernatural adversaries as well as the setting for evil things. Since Don Siegel's 1958 melodrama The Line Up Hollywood has used the plot about the innocent people who learn than drug dealers have hidden their illicit narcotics in their belongings since as the Audrey Hepburn movie Wait Until Dark. A young married couple lands the real estate deal of a lifetime until they realize to their horror that their sumptuous house is a hiding place for concealing heroin supplies and a prison for a California drug enforcement czar. No sooner do our cute couple discover hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of heroin than they encounter two ruthless adversaries that lay siege to their house. One of the cartel gunmen is Dolph Lungren and he isn't happy about the circumstances. Stash House isn't bad and the husband and wife twosome are appropriately sympathetic while Dolph plays a murderous villain who occasionally comes to their aid. Pretty Briana Evigan of Step Up 2 the Streets plays a veterinarian. Despite the apparent claustrophobic setting Stash House emerges as rather nimble particularly the ending when the villainous Dolph masquerades as our heroine's father. Clearly Stash House couldn't have cost too much after they paid off Dolph and Briana. The action takes place in two settings an animal clinic and the house were the drugs are stashed. The villain thinks of a cool way to bluff himself out of the house swarming with police for a finale that is provocative. Dolph gives a good account of himself. Neither as visually flamboyant or nor as freewheeling as Rodriguez's later shoot'em up El Gringo Stash House is better than average and doesn't wear out its welcome.".

	schema:reviewBody "The action and thriller genres probably produce just as much if not more films than the horror genre going to straight to home video and are just as hit and miss. Dolph Lundgren has probably become one of the more main stay action stars who has really made a name for himself in this market have a wellreceived string of hits on the big screen. Over the last few years he has delivered countless movies that good or bad deliver something special thanks to his unique delivery. His latest Stash House is part of the new After Dark Action brand and looks to be something a bit different for him but will it work? Stash House follows a young couple who have just bought their dream house through a foreclosure price that was a steal. When they discover illegal drugs packed into the walls and realize things are not what they seem and they are in a fight for survival as they must face off against two gun toting ruthless killers who will stop at nothing to get what's theirs. This movie isn't anything all that new basically being a similar story to both films titled Trespass 1992's starring Ice Cube and IceT as well as the recent title starring Nicolas Cage. This is a story that has been done numerous times but not always effectively. Here they have a decent setup with tons of dramatic and action packed buildup but never really finds its legs to deliver what it could have been. Lundgren delivers his usual menacing performance and is great here but is also given a couple of moments to try and show remorse but somehow still comes off scary. His partner in crime literally played by Jon Huertas of ABC's Castle does a good job playing up the normal and crazy moments of his character. The rest of the cast deliver decent performances and help bring the overall film together but the big issue is just in the story. There just isn't enough here to really step this film out of the realm of average but enough to still make it entertaining.If you are a Lundgren fan then you will want to check this film out. He is a bit more tame here than usual but still has that dominating screen presence he always delivers. There isn't near as much action here as you would think but plays more as a thriller to keep you wondering what will happen next. In a world flooded with action films on the store shelve Stash House plays way more like a bigger budget good film than most of the lame choices out there.".

And how does this tie into the opening scene where a Colombian scatters his gray matter all over the inside of a confessional? Dolph Lundgren and Jon Huertas play the bad guys.Most of the film is a cat and mouse game being played between the two sides with David being the punching bag for any stray bullet. The dialouge was boring and having Dolph recite lines that are already the pits doesn't raise the thriller level. At one point David learning over a dead body shouts at Dolph C'mon man!

The directing and performances are mediocre as well.With its duration of around 15 hours it is still watchable but that's it. Panic Room for instance is much better and thus more recommended.

The acting from Daniel Auteuil and Stuart Townsend is top draw and the story is strong enough to have you interested throughout the film. The only flaws in the film are that it is hard to believe that the man we see at the start of the film  who lacked confidance  could go on to become an escort and there is also a scene where we see him at a posh party and a drunk toff starts talking and the acting in that scene is appalling from the socialite. Dont let that put you what is a very good film. 8 out of 10.".

I still don't know but it felt good.Michel Blanc is more used to making funny movies either as an actor or as a director and is very good at that. But here that's a totally different kind of movie. Here he goes deeper into human relationships by trying to understand what happens when a human being freaks out.The story of Pierre leaving his whole life behind to flee to London escaping something but what really ? is just what could happen to the guy next door or even to you. And therefore you see the movie with a totally different perspective getting in the stead of this guy seeing and understanding what happens to him and saying to yourself gosh this could be me.Pierre's freaking out and all that happens thereafter is so very understandable that it makes the movie reach you to your deepest core. You take the character in sympathy feel like he's someone you know. And when he trips you trip along with him.In the end I spent a very good time watching this movie though I just didn't really know what to expect my girlfriend took me to seeing it. This movie leaves you with a sensation inside but what kind of sensation I'm unable to describe... But it was NOT the sensation of having lost my time.".

	schema:headline " An Interesting if a bit dark Drama but Worth a look";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film for the second time recently having seen it a couple of years ago. It is interesting if a bit dark and depressing at times. It is the story of Pierre Daniel Autiel a middle aged man who feels that after 20 years of marriage his life does not amount to much and he wants more excitement and a change. He decides to stay in London and start writing a book one evening he is conned and assaulted and by chance meets Tom Stuart Townsend an Irish guy who works in a caf by day and as a Male escort by night. He helps out Pierre and introduces him to his world which at first seems exciting he gets a new apartment in the Docklands a girlfriend who although she starts out in a similar line of work wants to change for Pierre. At this point his life takes a downward spiral as he tries to get more and more work to pay for his more expensive life and gets into drugs to help him keep going for his clients and girlfriend. Pierre eventually becomes as his friend puts it a real arsehole and falls out with his friend Tom he then resorts to promising a client that he loves her but she should still pay as he is in need. In reality he has no feelings for her and just wants the money which later leads to an encounter with her Husband. He is later informed that his Father is ill and has to rush back to France while there he discovers that estranged wife now knows of his new line of work. After some serious thought He decides to write a book and many months later drops by his old friend Tom's caf to show him the book.This is a very well made film and quite realistically done. Personally after seeing it twice I would not watch it again but this is just my taste in films. I feel that you should give this film a chance and watch it as it is a worthy drama and has a message if you look closely.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is I think meant to be a cold film  its summing up moment for me is when we have an extended closeup of Gaelle's ring on the ground in the snow the white gradually darkening with the stain of Bruno's dark red blood. The camera simply watches the beauty of the movement enjoys its aesthetic simplicity and refuses to pan back to Bruno and let us witness his emotion and what is going on with him as he slowly bleeds. This is a deconstructed road movie Bruno goes on a mission to deliver a message  a message whose sense we never learn and whose effects ultimately seem irrelevant or minimal. Each trip in the car sees Bruno get involved with increasingly desperate sexual couplings but there is no sense that these will progress anywhere. Indeed it is noticeable that this film emphasises the way in which Bruno is in fact rejected at places that connote not travel as such but the unromanticised stasis that travel also necessitates  in getting lost at the airport at the car park. Not so much on the road then as off the road  our lives here are not so much the American myth of untrammeled spaces more full of constraint difficulty and so on. The question repeated throughout the film in reference to Bruno's putative Communism but what about the wall becomes symbolic for me of the film's whole point. Neither sexual desire nor 'love' nor ideology can overcome the blocking 'wall' the stasis that haunts us. The cuts to Bruno's hand are perhaps the least disturbing thing in this beautiful cold bleak film.".

Each trip in the car sees Bruno get involved with increasingly desperate sexual couplings but there is no sense that these will progress anywhere. Indeed it is noticeable that this film emphasises the way in which Bruno is in fact rejected at places that connote not travel as such but the unromanticised stasis that travel also necessitates  in getting lost at the airport at the car park. Not so much on the road then as off the road  our lives here are not so much the American myth of untrammeled spaces more full of constraint difficulty and so on. The question repeated throughout the film in reference to Bruno's putative Communism but what about the wall becomes symbolic for me of the film's whole point. Neither sexual desire nor 'love' nor ideology can overcome the blocking 'wall' the stasis that haunts us. The cuts to Bruno's hand are perhaps the least disturbing thing in this beautiful cold bleak film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Most people watch movies in order to enjoy them. Every so often a film comes around that is hard to enjoy but is undeniably artistic. And I'm not saying the movie isn't good  I'm saying you're not supposed to leave the movie with feeling satisfied happy or particularly having enjoyed it.I found the relationship between the sisters to be superbly crafted. Despite their differences and constant bickering they love each other. This is clear. The sisters meet Fernando who proceeds to seduce 15 year old Elena with every clichd you have to have sex with me to prove you love me technique imaginable. However mindbogglingly obvious his impure intentions are Elena falls for it hook line and sinker. Though it sounds rather formulaic I found it intriguing because it really does happen this way so often.It is interesting how the younger Anais recognizes Fernando's intentions yet allows her sister to make her own mistakes. Inevitably it becomes apparent to all that Fernando betrayed Elena in the worst way. The mother responds in what is a rather cold and unsympathetic manner but in reality this is exactly how any parent would react in the situation.This is a spoilerfilled review so I will now tackle the ending without holding back details. I'm sure many people are reading this in order to find out the opinions of others over the shocking and violent final scenes. Most of the parallels that this form explains have already been mentioned in other comments here. Is virginity sacred? Anais and Elena would answer that differently. Nonetheless the end result is the same for both  their first mates betray them. Elena believed her virginity was sacred but was easily seduced and lost it. Even though Anais has a different take on virginity she is also betrayed this time by a rapist. You can also ponder the moral quandary of whether or not Elena was raped by her Italian lover. She may as well have been. In fact it seems that having her heart torn out was more emotionally traumatic than when Anais's virginity was forcibly torn away.Of course the responsibility for the tragic ending lies solely on the maniac who commits the acts. Yet situationally speaking every single character both sisters both of their parents Fernando Fernando's mother is somehow responsible for putting them in that place at that time.If you're looking for a deeper meaning in the ending I believe there is a notable parallel between the narrative and the ending. So many people have said the director ran out of ideas or it's a gimmick or it's just shock value or just think it doesn't fit the narrative. Many have expressed feelings of cinematic betrayal in the end of the film  this betrayal mirrors the betrayal of both sisters. The director is like Fernando seducing us for the entire film screwing us then abandoning us. It is so sudden shocking and unbecoming that we feel raped... much like the Fat Girl.The cinematic and artistic values hold true in the ending. You just have to look for it. It is up to personal taste whether this makes for a good movie or not.".

	onyx:emotionText "Most people watch movies in order to enjoy them. Every so often a film comes around that is hard to enjoy but is undeniably artistic. And I'm not saying the movie isn't good  I'm saying you're not supposed to leave the movie with feeling satisfied happy or particularly having enjoyed it.I found the relationship between the sisters to be superbly crafted. Despite their differences and constant bickering they love each other. This is clear. The sisters meet Fernando who proceeds to seduce 15 year old Elena with every clichd you have to have sex with me to prove you love me technique imaginable. However mindbogglingly obvious his impure intentions are Elena falls for it hook line and sinker. Though it sounds rather formulaic I found it intriguing because it really does happen this way so often.It is interesting how the younger Anais recognizes Fernando's intentions yet allows her sister to make her own mistakes. Inevitably it becomes apparent to all that Fernando betrayed Elena in the worst way. The mother responds in what is a rather cold and unsympathetic manner but in reality this is exactly how any parent would react in the situation.This is a spoilerfilled review so I will now tackle the ending without holding back details.

A pure lethal injection of dramatic suffering which is beautifully rendered but left me feeling devastated by its intensity. Breillat is a director who has already made shockwaves with her last film Romance. In her latest piece of disturbing cinematic violence she takes us inside the life of a 13 year old overweight girl inside an average upper middleclass family. On a holiday away with this family we experience her exposed difference as her 15 year old sister begins to experiment with sex often with her young sister a passive spectator. The parents are indifferent creatures affected mainly by social pressures and appearances. Unaware  or possibly simply disinterested  in their daughters lives they miss the painful undersides of the two girls forced closeness. Breillat offers more explicit sex erections and some extremely gruelling violence. I recommend this film but its intelligence and emotional truth is necessary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Breillat is back and as she did with Romance pushing the bounds of censorship in an intellectually challenging fashion. The story follows the sexual development of two sisters in their early teens. Their middle class family embody the usual social mores and protective attitudes. Moreover the story makes us aware of the legal dilemma of under age sex undertaken as a matter of conscious choice and with proper protection by the 15year old older sister with a boyfriend only a few years her senior ie the relationship would be legal in Netherlands but not in many countries including France. These are two fairly normal sisters although the younger one is excessively overweight and only fantasizes about getting a boyfriend. There is some possible interpretation that the 15year old's psychological development would progress more soundly were she not initially fettered by taboos over her own virginity. In one scene a TV in the background has a Breillattype character being interviewed and giving her philosophy about the intrinsic nature of sex how it is something common to us all and that can be understood by anyone and that we are all alike inasmuch as noone is perfect. The characters and scenes are painted brilliantly the sibling rivalry coupled with intense sisterly bonding the mother driving at night and as many people will have with a lack of sleep and so not as perfectly safely as normal. It is the realism and ordinariness of the situations that keep us on the edge of our seats. The dialogue has the realism that suggests youngsters may have suggested some of the lines with their observations that have the power to startle us out of complacency. The use of actors so young in fairly explicit scenes will be a matter of great concern but Breillat is serious about her work and convinces us that she is not pandering to sensationalism but raising valid questions about how we effectively handle the challenges presented by precocious adolescents. The film is more polished than Breillat's earlier work and has an unnerving denouement welldelivered.".

After all we are watching a film which implicitly is fantasy. For the entire film we've shared Anais POV. A shift like this isn't as off the mark as some viewers seem to suggest. We are seeing the world through Anais caged prepubescent eyes. To me it seemed like a clever collaboration between storyteller and character. It services the viewer's craving for resolution. The sudden presence of a hatchetwielding assailant is shocking and upsetting but such an event was clearly foreshadowed. Elena's reference to being in the dead man's seat and the mother's reluctance to drive as well as Anais' commitment to having sex for the first time with somebody that's she's not in love with all point to a resolution like this. It's as if Anais libidinous fantasy has come to life. Perhaps the filmmaker is simply saying Be careful what you wish for or maybe she saw no other alternative for her wishful protagonist than to experience the ultimate sexdeath scenario. Beyond the feelings that this climax generates what precedes it is a painstaking and honest portrait of youthful angst and sexuality.

I have read criticism of the violence late in the film as not having flowed out of what has gone before.  Such criticism misses the point of the movie I think which is about the contrast between Anais's first sexual experience and the lovely Elena's and Anais's acceptance of rape as being preferable to being in love with the boy as Elena had been when we and Anais watched Elena's first intercourse.I thought the acting in this film wonderful and Anais Reboux as the fat girl is an outstanding find.  This is a touching film with real characters with whom to empathize especially the two girls both young and romantic one with a saving touch of cynicism.".

Such criticism misses the point of the movie I think which is about the contrast between Anais's first sexual experience and the lovely Elena's and Anais's acceptance of rape as being preferable to being in love with the boy as Elena had been when we and Anais watched Elena's first intercourse.I thought the acting in this film wonderful and Anais Reboux as the fat girl is an outstanding find.  This is a touching film with real characters with whom to empathize especially the two girls both young and romantic one with a saving touch of cynicism.";

The relationship begs many questions not least why heterosexual sex needs to be conducted under the cloud of subterfuge. All of this is witnessed by the girl's overweight younger sister a heretic against society's body fascism who carries not just excess body fat but a cynicism about men and relationships which belies her age to a frightening degree.The long central sex scene in the sisters' shared bedroom is painful and authentic with a morbid humour. The adults in the film  a workaholic bourgeois father his neurotic wife and the blowzy Italian mama of the boy who indulges in overdramatic posturing suggest that the troubled teens have little but hypocrisy and pathology to look forwards to in adulthood.At the end of the film something truly shocking and horrible happens after a long and hairraising driving sequence as terrifying as anything in Duel. The ending is contentious and a deliberate nonsequitur. It seems to be suggesting that the truth about malefemale sexuality is a murderous fury from the male end combined with a retreat into selfprotective emotional catatonia in the female. A film which has been a social comedydrama turns into a transgressive fantasy and the effect leaves a very nasty taste in the mouth not least because some of the possible readings involve the younger girl both willing and needing the event to happen in order to liberate her from the prison of her family and the oppressive beauty of her sister.".

	schema:reviewBody "Catherine Breillat's Fat Girl 2001 is an astounding movie that provides uncompromising and unblinking look at the relationship between two teenage sisters and their first sexual experiences. The older sister 15 years old Elena has no problems attracting boys' attention and sexual desire and while on the family vacation she meets an older more experienced boy who will say and promise anything to seduce her. There are two long thorough and uncomfortable scenes of seducing Elena that take place in the girls' bedroom with the younger sister 12 years old Anais the fat girl of the title not quite asleep. Breillat remembers well what the hell it is to be a teenager to be confused frustrated to think low of yourself to be ready to enter the world of sexual relationships to be ready for love for intimate closeness and to pretend that you don't care about them at all. She also looks closely and with none a gram of sentimentality into siblings' and parents daughters relationship. The scenes of cruelty and contempt the older sister treats the younger one alternate with rare but poignant moments of tenderness and understanding. Breillat takes us to places we don't go often and we don't want to go but they exist. If you've seen Brellat's movies already you know that her outlook is not particularly happy optimistic or sentimental but Fat Girl will shock you as very few movies can. Just when you think that the movie is over and despite the disappointments embarrassing revelations and shameless manipulations live goes on and has so much to offer Breillat presents you with the final scene that is very difficult to watch and impossible to forget. It does not matter really if the final scene actually took place or was just a fantasy just the dream projected on the screen.".

That said I did not care for this movie. It's not the subject matter or the subetext or the mode of presentation that got me it was the cruel moralistic judgmental tone taken by the director. Dynamics between the characters were compellingly and interestingly explored the sisters' antagonism and moreso the contrast of one brilliant scene in which they convince us all that they do love each other the older sister's interaction with her parents which was realistically one sided and antagonistic she is a teenager after all. Even the wrenching scenes of her lover's manipulation of her were wellacted and occasionally subtle. Having to listen to her being sodomized however was unnecessary. It was the sort of shock technique that betrays a director's contempt of her audience We understand that his manipulation of her is evil beyond words and we hate him enough. As the scene descends from the quiet politics of basically a man trying to rape an unexperienced lovesick girl into a series of shrieks and abrupt grunts all the while we stare into the uninterested face of the Fat Girl of the American title it's not inyourface realism it's just bathos. Then there's the ending. The director spends an hour creating interesting character dynamics a tense conflict between a young girl whose desires conflict with her own best interest but is too young to understand it her sister who is forced to grow up under the influence of this person and her mother who is confounded by the whole affair and then decides to end it with a murderer with a hatchet. Yes the scene is thematically resonant All the characters get exactly what they want. The older sister gets to die along with her mom and the younger sister gets to lose her virginity to a man who means nothing to her. So that's what the movie is? The director saying Be careful what you wish for? Obviously a director has an obligation to follow her or his muse but that is no reason to revert to abject cruelty both toward characters and the audience. Again it's condescending We can see the moral issues at work in this situation so why do we need a psychopath to reduce everything to an obvious moral absolute in the most unpleasant brutal fashion possible? It's just annoying moralism on the director's part punishing the characters for... something  while punishing the audience apparently for caring about the characters. And we do care about the sisters. They deserve a better movie.".

This time it's two sisters Fifteenyear old Elena Roxana Mesquida who appears to be younger is the oldest and wishes to loose her virginity with someone she loves. Her younger sister is a innocent and chunky twelveyear old Anais Anas Reboux who would rather experience sex with a complete stranger. Both of them get their wishes.Most of the film takes place inside the girls' bedroom where Elena's slightly older Italian lover Fernando Libero de Rienzo hops through the window occasionally at night. The fact that Anais' bed is in the same room doesn't stop them from experiencing sex in front of her who watches them in curiosity as well as repugnance.Similar to the bedroom scenes in Breillat's previous film the dreadful Romance X these are actually some of this film's strongest aspects. They last for quite a while and they actually feel like one single scene. Unlike other films with strong sexual content Breillat never switches on the porno mode making the scene seem like one single unbroken piece.Briellat's films are famous for having graphic depictions of sex but Fat Girl uses a more subtle approach. While we do see the couple naked the camera never lingers into the bodies it is all filmed in one take. And not much of it is shown Breillat leaves it to our imagination by filming Anais' reaction to it all and only allowing us to hear the encounter. Alejandro Amenabar used a very similar trick in Thesis where sound would allow us to imagine the snuff film's brutal murders.The two sisters' relationship is a far cry from what one would expect. If you are waiting for constant whining and shouting between them you will be disappointed. While they do argue they are for most of the time friendly with each other. Little scenes like the family's visit to a mall or when they talk in bed together are what make this film special. In the end they are best friends and do love each other despite their differences and arguments.Many people have criticized Breillat for negative portrayal of men in her films. Lorenzo is indeed a narrowminded opportunist who is only seeking to take Elena's virginity but no other character in the film is very positive either except for the title character. Elena is so nave that at times she could be the protagonist of a Lars Von Trier tragedy and the mother Arsine Khanjian doesn't really know how to handle the situation near the end. One must give actress Anais Reboux credit for making her character adorable when many other characters could have failed to cross the from innocent and cute to annoying borderline.Similar to Takashi Miike's Audition Fat Girl goes from a slow drama to very disturbing horror near the end. Many people have criticized the ending but I am one of the defenders. SPOILERS It is very hard to believe the events in the conclusion were real. Like Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver I stand by the theory that it all takes place in poor Anais' imagination nothing but a twisted fantasy on how it would have all come fullcycle. In less than a minute both girls have their wishes come true. Elena gets both her and her mother killed just like she said in a roadstop and Anais looses her virginity to a complete stranger somehow. I would also like to mention the windowshattering moment has to be one of the most surprising moments in cinema in the last years. It comes out of nowhere and will make you jump more than any other cheap scare tactic used in many lame horror films these days. END OF SPOILERS One of the best and darkest comingofage films you will ever encounter Fat Girl is essential viewing to anyone who likes the genre. Great acting superb cinematography and wellhandled direction by one of France's most daring filmmakers.".

	schema:headline " Better than expected tale of adolescent sexuality";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by the 'controversial' Catherine Breillat she showed a hardon in her last movie 'Romance' the story revolves around a family on holiday with two adolescent sisters the chubby 13 year old Anas played by Anas Reboux and the rather more svelte Elena Roxane Mesquida who is two years her senior although rather less mature. Both girls are still virgins although Elena is clearly aware of the power of her beauty over the opposite sex. Effortlessly she pulls Italian law student Fernando Libero De Rienzo with whom she begins an intense relationship. Fernando talks of love but is obviously keen for sex. Poor Anas is unfortunately sharing a room with the pair as they fumble towards a deflowering. Indeed this is one of the most beguiling scenes in the movie you feel awkward bearing witness to what is going on  the constant demands of Fernando for 'a demonstration of love' which after refusals brings forth the sorts of coercing phrases regarding anal sex that so many girls must dread to hear. The animosity is often intense between the sisters Anas' bitterness towards her sister combined with a resigned maturity that only rejection and frustration can breed. But at the same time there are wonderful scenes of the two sharing sisterly moments albeit with bile never far away. The point is well made the bond is there no matter how much of a bitch Elena can be. Anas is such a lost sad character the melancholic beauty of one scene on the beach where she is singing to herself whilst Elena and Fernando 'make out' is incredible. Also well portrayed is the relationship with the parents. Mother is very much like Elena Father is a workaholic who hates holidays and returns home before the others. Although the parents are mostly secondary in the story you sense that they tend to reinforce Anas insecurities and knock her down further. This is exemplified in the scene the morning after the first Elena  Fernando night together. Anas is clearly really low crying and choked. Her parents offer zero warmth the only solace coming from a still caustic Elena shoving bread into her mouth to comfort her. The story climaxes as the sisters and their mother return home from their holiday after a gloriously comic scene where Fernando's mother Laura Betti visits to reclaim a precious ring that he had given to Elena as an engagement ring. The journey toward home is fantastically shot the claustrophobia of motorway driving  especially since the mother doesn't like driving and is pretty pd at Elena's antics and Anas' miserableness  metaphoring the unease between the three even more so as night wears on and mother becomes more wary of the huge dangerous lorries that she overtakes incautiously on the freeway. If I was an absolute ponce or totally fearless I would say these trucks are a metaphor for the male predatory sexuality against the tiny feminine car which still manages to nimbly overtake at will most of the time. But I'm not ? so I won't. Anyway the ending comes as a huge shock. So I'm not going to tell you it. But safe to say you don't leave the cinema with a laugh and a giggle. Overall I was actually surprised by how deep this story was there was only one gratuitous erection and even that was covered by a condom. A brave attempt to analyse adolescent female sexuality often leaving an unplesant taste in the mouth but well worth a go if you're in the mood.".

Further make no mistake that the grotesque nature of this sequence alone is not the source of my criticism. For example the violent scene in La Historia Oficial is quite jarring and cruel but perfectly appropriate and powerful... in short necessary. Saving Private Ryan is another example of overthetop grotesquery and intimate violence that did not feel gratuitous. This movie does not accomplish anything near the seamless integration of these examples.While I understand the role of the rape of the fat girl and would consider it powerful in isolation the scene as a whole is powerful only as an exemplar of superfluousness. In fact it seems to me that the tacked on violence does considerable damage to the painstakingly constructed emotion of the rest of the film. What can the viewer surmise from the juxtaposition of such graphic and senseless murder with the deceitful theft of an innocent girl's virginity but that the latter is natural fairly harmless and ultimately insignificant? Is this meant to cheer up the jilted teenagers of the world by emphasizing that worse things can happen? Is it meant to liberate women from society's emphasis on their virginity? Either way the extended shot of a young girl's cracked skull and oozing brain does not seem necessary. Can I suggest that instead the fat girl should have been quietly raped while going to the bathroom at the rest stop and failed to report the crime? I think this would have been more powerful.Without the unnecessary obscenity this is a thoughtful interesting study of the bond of sisterhood girls coming of age alienation and sexual liberation which I would give a 6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "CONTAINS SPOILERSThe ending is discussed Another stunningly strange film from Catherine Breillat director of Romance Anatomy of Hell and Real Young Girl.The plot concerns two sisters the older one Elena who is about 14 or 15 and is thin and beautiful and the youngerAnais who is 12 is fat. While on vacation they meet a law student and Elena begins a dangerous flirtation with the young man. This quickly leads to several secret night time visits to the girls room as Anais watches her sister and her paramour. Tension grows between the girls as Anais longs for the affection that her sister is getting.I should state I'm not a fan of Catherine Breillat. I find her films shocking and silly. Clearly she's going for an effect which she usually achieves and which is usually dissipated by the the lack of anything behind it to paraphrase some one famous she presents the obvious by way of the scandalous. Here for example we have several scenes of intimacy between Elena and her beau which are filmed in long almost painful takes that simulate Anais watching from across the room. The scenes are edgy for what they are showing and uncomfortable since the girl involved is 14 or 15. Anais is suppose to be 12. Though both seem older. For me the scenes went from intriguing to uncomfortable to dull rather quickly as they seemed to just drag on. To me the scenes would have worked better had we gotten to know the two girls more at the start. Certainly a later scene where the pair shows affection for each other adds a great deal the relationship between the pair but for me it was too late to affect the early sex scenes. Breillat also goes for effect when she has the mother drive the girls home and we have what seems like a two hour ride with the three women in the car moving in and out of traffic. Its grand foreshadowing and she builds tension for an event that never comes while at the same time keeping you sleepy enough that when the final bit comes you're completely unprepared.I have to tell you what that was but nothing that happens in the preceding 80 minutes prepared me for the unintentionally funny conclusion of this film. Many people find the sudden and shocking turn of events horrify and unnerving and the very end is however what sparks that is simply very silly and it was so out of left field so bizarre so ridiculous that the boredom of the long car sequence was sent packing as I doubled over in a fit of laughter. I can not and could not believe that anyone would do what Breillat does. Its a shock technique that doesn't belong in this film or a film like this which no doubt why so many people are horrified by it. Even if this were the sort of film that it might belong in no one would do it as silly as here. What bothers me is that it leads up to a disturbing event that and we should be really shocked and rattled to our core but for me it was wildly undercut in its power because what it took to get us there was so contrived and so ludicrous it runs the final bit.I don't know what deeper meaning was behind it all certainly the rivalry between sisters and sexual longing and suchbut I got no hidden truth nothing I didn't know before. I'm sure it has something with Anais' statements about sex then again it could be the most forceful statement of what many consider a slasher films morality namely sex is bad. To be honest I had my cage rattled a bit but to what end? Perhaps had I been a girl with a sister or two this might have meant something to me but as it stands now its a dullish movie with a WTF ending.I'd leave this review there except I have to say something about the best thing in this film namely the two girls the story revolves around. They are both stunning beautiful and damn fine actresses. The interplay between them is very real and I would love to see them paired up again in a better film. To be honest they are so good that I will probably watch this again to see them interact especially in the secrets scene 4 out of 10 I was tempted to say 5 out of ten but the ending really strikes me as too silly a great momentbut for all the wrong reasons. I think the end is what sealed this films doom".

Do not read the second review if you are one of the latter category.SPOILERFREE REVIEWThe less you know going into this movie the better but generally it deals with the complicated relationship between two adolescent sisters one strikingly attractive and undergoing an initiation into adult sexuality via a persuasive and manipulative law student but I repeat myself the other overweight and cynical observing her sister's experiences with alternating envy and contempt. It's pretty turgid going for the most part and its treatment of sex leaves one a little queasy but contains some memorable characterization and at least one very startling twist in the narrative that make it ultimately worthwhile. Rest assured you will be wide awake when you leave the theater.SPOILERS GALOREI was really very tired of this movie by the time the final sequence came around. I found the dialogue overwritten and overabundant and the characters undeveloped and the whole thing dragged itself along at a maddeningly slow pace. The actors are brave and they do the best they can under Breillat's incessantly voyeuristic gaze which if nothing else evoke the carnality and emotional maelstrom of adolescent sexuality quite well despite the aforementioned leaden dialogue but in such a clinical and dispassionate way that one feels bad for the actors not because of the explicit nudity and sexuality but because the inertness of the presentation sucks up all of their emotions and makes you feel as if you're watching the characters through a cage. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it's very uncomfortable to sit through.THEN comes the final sequence presaged only by a vaguely ominous long highway driving sequence that carries on for several minutes perhaps so that the audience will sympathize with the characters and nod off. It has previously been established that the mother is not used to driving and the trucks bearing down on her at top speed suggest that a car accident is in the cards. Instead they pull of the highway and the audience relaxes. And then comes as shocking an explosion of violence as I can recall seeing in any movie.In the context of all that comes before it feels like a cheat and my first impression was to say What a gimmicky copout. But it can't help but stay with one and I am hard pressed to find a film that reproduces as effectively the shocking suddenness of death which often DOES come out of nowhere as it does here. It's a shattering nightmarish and profoundly disturbing scene which trivializes all that comes before it although much of it seemed pretty trivial to begin with. The coda vitiates the impact somewhat it's implausible and considering what came before leaves a bad taste in one's mouth but without this final sequence I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone I know. Breillat pulls it off with a flourish but between her calculatedly callous treatment of the characters her tedious dialogue and the fact that as effective as the ending is it is still a gimmick I have some reservations in extending more than modest praise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fat Girl opens with a scene depicting the sister Anais 13 and Elena 15 walking to town from their vacation how to get a drink. At first it appears as a seemingly innocent scene until their conversation is overheard. Of course the topic is sex. While this topic is nothing new for teenagers going through the difficult years of puberty what strikes the viewer is that the conversation goes far beyond mere curiosity. Elena slim and pretty has already engaged in a number of amorous activities besides actual penetration and Anais overweight plain and deadpan while still a virgin is convinced that she wants her first sexual encounter to be with someone that she does not love so that she will be broken in for the man that she will one day love. This conversation devolves until Elena challenges Anais to see who can get a boy first.Arriving at a small outdoor caf an Italian university student invites to Anais and Elena to sit at his table with him. Anais is quick to sit beside the student whose name is Fernando but is ordered to stand by Elena. Fernando assures the girls that it is perfectly alright to sit with him and Elena quickly takes the seat next to him and soon after ordering some refreshments and making small talk the two are kissing. Because of her beauty and character Elena's parents made a rule that Anais must be with her at all times away from the vacation home but Elena is quick to abandon her sister for a short getaway with her new boyfriend.Later in the film after sharing a meal with Elena and Anais and their parents Fernando sneaks into the vacation home and puts the move on Elena and she is more than willing to do anything for Fernando outside of intercourse. On this point Fernando's demeanor changes and he tries to convince Elena to give herself to him as a proof of love because if she does not he will have to go off and find another woman which he does not want to do because he loves her. To appease Fernando Elena consents to another route of intimacy which leaves her feeling ashamed but Fernando assures her that it was beautiful and a proof of her love for him. During this entire process Anais has been watching the young couple. She was not spying on them per se because the activities were taking place within the bedroom that she shares with her sister. More mature than her amorously inclined but nave older sister Anais can see that things are leading to disaster.Always a controversial director because of her filmic depictions of sexuality that borderline on the pornographic some would say dive right into the pornographic Breillat delved into new ground and faced even more controversy because of its depictions of underage sexuality. However the sexual acts depicted in the film are not meant to titillate but to make the viewer feel uncomfortable because it is one of the few films that reflect the suffering of a young girl who has been suckered by a man she loves she is already talking to Fernando about getting married which he fully supports to reach his goal and the damaging effects that it has. Also the film does a wonderful job depicting children who grow up too quickly and the highly uncomfortable situations that it can create. The scenes depicting the drive home are almost exhausting because of the high sense of tension that they create.While I cannot recommend Fat Girl to everyone I can recommend it to film viewers who want to delve into a film that depicts sexuality especially on the part of the male at its mot base and the resulting psychological and sociological effects that it has.".

	schema:reviewBody "I adore Catherine Breillat. Her films really get at the core of the war and it's a war between men and women. Gone is any trace of silliness and sentimentality. This film Fat Girl aka For My Sister was the first film of hers I saw and it's still a favorite. The film centers around 2 sisters one seductive and one slovenly and fat yet the fat one seems to know what's going on better than her at least physically more attractive sister. The scenes where an Italian suitor tries to seduce the attractive sister are difficult to watch because they have so much truth in them. Many people dislike Breillat's film intensely usually American critics. Mind you the critics of Breillat's films aren't the usual religious fundamentalists. They are usually educated liberal critics who are supposed to be open minded but seems to shut down their minds when reviewing Breillat's films. They take scenes out of context like right wing fundies do when they criticise films they don't like and start attacking Breillat herself instead of looking at her work. She's been compared to the Marquis de Sade not in terms of SM sex but in the tone of her work regarding relationships many people have never read de Sade. His work is about much more than bondage. Watching interviews with her is as fascinating as her films. Her films are very bleak and cynical yet there is more truth in one frame of Fat Girl and Breillat's other work than in an entire season of Sex and the City I would have loved to see her as special guest director on Sex and the City. It would have been the best episode or many American films that are pretending to be edgy about sex but in fact end up being childish. Many people dislike the ending of this film saying it doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie. The ending fits in perfectly with the tone of the film and of the character it most affects. I think the ending is so unique that many people just can't accept it. This along with Anatomy of Hell are amongst the best of her films. To have a filmmaker as perceptive as her in this day and age is something we should all be grateful for. See Sex is Comedy as well. It's a companion piece to this film. Brilliant Breillat.".

In Britain and America we assume films are made for entertainment but tolerantly accept those that are patently art for art's sake for the dissemination of ideas or the questioning of commonly held views. I imagined being at the same premiere in France or Latin America  the heated debates that would follow over the gender politics the validity of the symbolism whether the underlying concepts were valid. In Britain even at a film festival we had the same old stuff about the genesis of the film working with the actors etc all valid enough then a sharp split between people who obviously had a brain in their head and the men  and women  who just felt it was pretentious to waffle on when you could be making comments about the erect penis of porn star Rocco Siffredi. But before dealing with the knobs question a brief synopsis . ..A woman walks through a gay nightclub. She is obviously alienated  it is not clear from what  she goes to the toilets and tries to slit her wrists. A man rescues her. After a short interlude she arranges to pay this gay man for four nights to watch her to tell her what it is that disgusts him about women. The nights and acts that fill them are accompanied by soliloquies by both the man and the woman as each states their primal sexual understanding of the other.The dialogue is fairly heavy  it could be put alongside works of philosopher Jacques Derrida it follows on quite nicely from his deconstructionist theories or the more extreme ideas of Shere Hite. Much of it has great poetic beauty  aided by the fact that the two characters are purely symbolic this according to Breillat herself  they represent a primal man and woman not in the context of any religious genesis but the two first adults dealing with their sexual reactions to each other. Breillat describes herself as a 'purist' and also heterosexual and says she finds many of the images disturbing and that is exactly why she wished to portray them  to ask why we find images such as a used tampon so disgusting when they are everyday things and have no inherent 'awfulness' or reason why they should be considered shameful. But she does not just ask the question or try to shock  she counters the emotion that has been evoked explains it the explanation may not be to everyone's liking but it is internally consistent and academically arguable and uses the example as one of the steppingstones to communicate some of her ideas about sexuality.One of Breillat's main ideas she seeks to get across in this film is that although a person 'has' an undeniable physical sex their actual sexuality  their bodies and everything that makes them sexually attractive is heavily involved with the meanings ideas fantasies or other things we attach to that body. We find a person 'sexy' because of what we think about them what they mean to us our understanding of them how they make us feel and this is projected onto the 'nice bum' aspect. Breillat says this is what distinguishes us from animals  our ability to attach meaning to sex I hope I have quoted her accurately  not easy when working through a translator and writing the notes up some hours afterwards. We do this by means of desire which means we project outwards what is inside. It is not automatic 'sex for reproduction and continuation of the species'  human beings have sex to satisfy our desires. The woman's body is seen in the film in ways that are normally 'unsexy'  it is the context and meaning subsequently applied which make it sexy  this is highlighted by the gay man's attitude and meanings that he attaches to all women.The sex between the man and the woman in the film is not tender or loving in any usual sense of the word. The gay man has great problems coming to terms with the idea of having sex in any form with the woman especially penetrating her a blow job didn't seem to upset him quite so much. His ideas of disgust for the female sex are welldeveloped and wellarticulated. She on the other hand can see many of the male attitudes that he displays in an extreme form in all men and can reduce male sex drive into fairly simplistic psychological forces.It could be argued that it is not productive to do this that the perceived male desire to dominate to take possession to control to glory in his penetrative power are pretty base instincts that are better sublimated or reinvented. This in fact is what we do  but seeing them in such a raw form not animalistically but portrayed by an articulate selfexamining man gives us a power of knowledge we can also argue. The theory also explains a lot of female psychology with which Breillat says she is mostly concerned and probably most of women's hangups about men. Anatomy of Hell has also been described as a companion to her earlier film Romance which follows a woman's quest for sexual selfknowledge and 'liberation'. But where Romance just asked questions the woman in Anatomy of Hell has answers  and most of the things she believes are oppressive to women the cause of women's problems are about illconsidered illogical but near universal male attitudes to sex. The film is not 'antimale'  it struck me as more about coming to terms with fundamental drives and then deciding how to handle them. In the case of the gay man his choice is to switch off completely not concern himself with a sex that controls him by means of its fragility or alternately tempt him to violence and anger.There is considerable discussion in the film about male and female psychodynamics  the male desire for 'dominance and control' for instance. It is expressed in fairly extreme form as it might be in classical drama. To get a handle on it try reading Shere Hite's analysis of maleorientated definitions of sexuality.The whole movie is underscored with vivid photography and images. minor spoilers follow. When the woman is in the nightclub she is seen against a background that totally isolates and distinguishes her from everyone else there. When she explains the female nature of the sea how it seems so strong and masculine but is really a feminine symbol we see the waves crashing at close quarters. Later on when the man strolls confidently along the cliff top we see the waves crashing far below him  something he cannot reach and which is vaguely threatening if he looked too closely. The woman explains the symbolism of menstrual blood to him  the only blood that is spilled without the need for a wound how it is 'purer' therefore than any blood that a man could spill. She delights in his appearance covered in her blood after she has had sex with him and when he returns to the empty room where she once lay he lifts the bloodstained sheets as if lifting on object of holiness and his manner is devout and the sheets also look like a shroud.Breillat in this cinematic illustration from her novel has provided us with a deconstruction of the feminine mystique. She has confronted us with our prejudices the inbuilt forces inherent in the 'battles between the sexes' she has given us two examples of human beings liberating themselves from their own disgust with their own bodies. Most of all to cinephiles she has made a classic that redefines French cinema at the forefront of art justifiable breaking false boundaries set by years of censorship selfloathing? and the effective ban on art to explore our deepest psyche. She has asked ageold questions but remarkably she has also provided her answers. Behold the work of a cinematic genius in our lifetime treasure her integrity and devotion to her work use this example of art to be inspired to selfexamine  or join the milling throngs calling for minddeadening Americanised cinematic artsubstitutes.p.s. this is the first nonmainstream film I have given a 1010 rating to  it is simply a superlative accomplishment in its genre accessible to anyone who applies sufficient intelligence  which rules out most critics and a lasting contribution to the study of malefemale psychology gender politics and sexual awareness.".

	schema:headline " Breillat certainly picked an appropriate title!";
	schema:reviewBody "It is fair to say that Catherine Breillat is a serious director who is serious about exploring aspects of sexuality via the medium of film and from a female's perspective. This is why I guess many people take an above average interest in what she produces. Perhaps even more so with this work  only those of the 'French New Wave' could produce films like this! Yeah right. It is apparently drawn upon her own writings and her own observations of the supposed rampant misogyny within all men gay and straight and the tendency for men to be more or less repulsed by females andor their genitalia. But there are three words I found particularly apt when describing the plausibility of Breillat's 'message' as proffered here and as it relates to this apparent misogyny. Those words are suspension of disbelief. There are some minor spoilers here by the way and if you were wondering what some of the more explicit elements of this film are then read on.Picture this if you will. The film immediately opens with a medium close up shot of a man fellating another man out in the open. Oh okay I get the message. This film obviously depicts explicit sex of a generally nonconventional nature so I can choose to flee the cinema if I want or need! Thanks Catherine. We shortly cross to a forlornlooking woman who for some unknown reason is hanging out in a gay bar prior to her sauntering upstairs to the bathroom to slash her wrists. Saved by a very 'straight' acting and looking 'gay' man Siffredi upon leaving the bar and getting herself patched up our 'gay' man is fellated by her out in the open. He somehow manages to produce an automatic erection. At this point the film has just lost me. This man is gay no? The absurdity continued.Our depressed female offers the man money primarily to invite him to observe her 'femaleness'. She spends most of the time naked prior to the 'gay' man engaging with her sexually. She's out to test her theory that all men are misogynistic. Is this for real? He seems such a natural heterosexual for a supposedly gay character! He experiences no trouble obtaining an erection with her around. He experiences an orgasm so quickly that I just cannot believe he is not actually attracted to women. He is more than happy to drink half of a reddened glass of water after our female dips her bloodied and used tampon into it. He cannot control his urge to digitally penetrate her and then lick her menstrual blood from his finger. The process of inserting a stone dildo inside of her vagina fascinates him as does the ejection of the same. And he just cannot help but insert the wooden handle of a long no doubt heavy garden implement inside of her while she sleeps. All the while we are subjected to these tedious pretentious monologues of men's deepseated hatred of women. It is surely the fault of the vagina! We endure a flashback of a girl and three boys playing 'doctors and nurses' in order for us to obtain a supposedly greater understanding as to the origins of such repulsion for the female anatomy. There is even a brief shot of the little girl's genitalia surely likely to draw consternation with censors somewhere in the world. Moreover we are unfortunately subjected to close up shots of what could possibly rank as the foulest looking adult vagina and anus in celluloid history. But the erect penises look fine perfect in fact. I suspect any man with a slightly confused sexual preference would surely jump to the gay side of the fence after watching this. Maybe some straight men will find the image of a naked male just a little bit more attractive after enduring these ugly images of female genitalia.I realise that some films can be so far fetched that one is required to suspend their disbelief for the sake of entertainment at the very least. But when a film as blatant and as occasionally explicit as this is offering forth the sweeping notion that all men are inherent misogynists it has to be outright plausible. No depiction of sexual activity in this film is plausible. In fact I found the 'message' downright implausible. This is not entertainment at all. It was made deliberately ugly almost to the point of disgust. This is one hellish depiction of female anatomy that is for sure! The title is perfectly apt  it was never titillating and could not really be labelled as pornography. I did not like the way this deliberately confronting film tried to portray its message. It was ugly pretentious silly implausible and utterly sickening in parts.".

The DVD for Anatomy of Hell has an interview with Catherine Breillat that I thought was very interesting and I highly recommend watching it right after the movie. Anatomy of Hell focuses on a women Amira Casar paying a homosexual man Rocco Siffredi to watch her in her home during her most private moments. It contains graphic sexual material but in a learning context. The woman's character seems to want to take the shame out of being a women by showing a man who is disgusted by women her most feminine self. By doing so they connect on a very raw level. I enjoyed the movie. If you like Catherine Breillat's particular form of artistry you may like some of her other movies as well.".

The woman's character seems to want to take the shame out of being a women by showing a man who is disgusted by women her most feminine self. By doing so they connect on a very raw level. I enjoyed the movie. If you like Catherine Breillat's particular form of artistry you may like some of her other movies as well.";

She is an interesting film maker always provocative always prepared to push the boundaries of cinema. 'Anatomy of Hell' tho left me somewhat bored. It seems to me that with each new film Breillat is becoming ever more compartmentalized. Here her mission is to specifically explore the female sex organ and the affect this may or may not have on the male sexual and emotional psyche. The problem is since she's chosen such a narrow subject no pun intended to examine there really isn't enough material here to sustain an entire film ... even one with a brief running time as this approx 80 mins.Another downside also is that the film is totally reliant on the 2 leads and frankly Siffredi is just not up to the task. On the other hand as always Breillat casts an interesting female lead. Amira Casar with her porcelain white skin her voluptuous curves and her pitch black hair certainly holds ones interest. I get the feeling Breillat when making the female casting choice looks for younger and more glamorous versions of herself  you'll rarely see a blonde.There are the trademark 'pluses' of Breillat in this film tho. Her thoughtfully conceived set design for example ... her minimal editing .. sparse use of lighting. These all add up to good story telling techniques in my book. But alas there is just not enough substance to the narrative to make this a good film.I really do wonder where she is going to go from here ... ?".

	schema:reviewBody "Most people who criticise this movie are coming from two anglesThey found it offensive or They didn't 'get it'In contrast I simply believe that this is a bad movie. As in the artistic decisions made by writerdirector Catherine Brelliat are detrimental to the film.First up don't believe the hype. It's not that offensive. In fact I've never seen a movie try so hard to be 'confronting' and 'controverial' and failing so badly. Brelliat clearly wants to shock and upset her audience with plenty of explicit depictions of oral sex wrist slashing and the like but she goes overboard in this respect. The scenes are so explicit constant and inyourface that the audience becomes numb to them. This makes scenes like the 'lipstick' and 'hairgel' moments come across as silly rather than shocking.And the movie is certainly not erotic. It's full of that cold passionless 'realistic sex' so favoured by the European arthouse.Where the movie really fails is in the plot acting and dialogue. Brelliat casts Italian porn star Rocco Siffredi and actress Amira Cassa in the leads but bungles this horribly by giving Siffredi all the important scenes and dialogue. We're treated to him mechanically reciting some impossibly pretentious rubbish while the more accomplished actress Cassa does little but lie down with her legs apart for most of the film. Again this is more likely to trigger some guffaws rather than the philosophical discourse Brelliat was hoping for.And the plot such as it is. Our hero can overcome his homosexuality by embracing his combined love and fear of the female genitalia. Or something. The idea that homosexuals are actually repressed heterosexuals and can be 'cured' is both ridiculous and offensive. Being a hardcore feminist doesn't give Brelliat the right to spout homophobic garbage. So stupid plot woeful dialogue wooden acting and explicit scenes so overthetop you end up sniggering. Anatomy of Hell is a terribly wrongheaded and unintentionally hilarious film that even devotees of hardcore arthouse cinema should avoid.".

I did not have as much of a problem with the disturbing sexual images as I did with the absurd dialogue. Nobody talks like this and it carried the film beyond pretension and into preposterousness. The plot is straightforward yet odd. A woman visits a gay nightclub and attempts to slash her wrists in the toilet however her motive is never revealed. She is rescued by a man who passed her on a stairway in the club and later she asks the man if she may buy his time for the next several days while she reveals herself to him during her most private moments. What follows is a series of turgid and sophomoric discussions which attempt to elucidate the various differences between Men and Women. Even if these two individuals were more articulate and believable the director does not show us why these characters are worth our attention. What enduring truths could this gay man possibly have to say about masculinity and why should we care about the observations of this obviously troubled young woman? ANATOMY OF HELL demonstrates our animal nature as sexual beings in exacting detail however the opaque reflections of the two central characters ring false and deaden the overall impact of the work. Many would welcome a cinematic journey in which honest philosophical insight is injected into the very artificial and contrived genre of pornography but ANATOMY OF HELL is neither honest nor insightful but only salacious.".

It is perhaps the most cheerful moment in this bleak drab film that takes a closeup and clinical look at women's genitalia and the men who don't love them. And apparently the women who aren't feeling too good about them either since the reason that the heroine attempts to kill herself is she says because she's a woman.A gay man saves her and winds up spending four nights watching her. Of course he winds up doing more than that. At one point he manages to lodge the handle of a large gardening tool in a rather intimate location... without waking her up. Does anybody sleep that soundly? Well maybe the audience...In between long segments of the character man telling us why he's gay although you wouldn't know it by watching this movie! and the heroine woman tells us why its so hard to be her we get some truly remarkable revelations. Ever wondered how long a woman could hold a rock inside her girlie bits or what large quantities of menstrual blood look like when smeared across the groin of a partiallyaroused Frenchman? Then this is the movie for you! At one point the heroine goes so far as to equate her reproductive opening to a vast black void and in yet another we learn that men can give only death and that's why gay men turn gay. Or something. You know it's hard to follow a story when every line in the script is a veritable hyperbola of pith and the observation of humanity. Well some seemingly quite miserable segment of humanity anyhow.I am admittedly not a devotee of French cinema. I subscribe to the stereotype that most French movies are... well... like this one. There are people in the world who take their lower regions far too seriously and one of them has made a movie.If you've ever wanted to kill yourself over the fact that you possess genitalia be sure and check out this fine croissant stuffed with French cheese and a few things that IMDb won't let me mention using the names by which they're most commonly called. Mark my words you'll never look at your crotch the same way again!".

I suppose if one wanted to inspire intense nausea that would work. Or what is the point of inserting a garden implement handle into a woman's vaginaand leaving it there? This movie consists of LONG vignettes of lackadaisical uppercrust European types talking in monotones leading up to profoundly disgusting physical acts. Breillat must think this equals artistic significance but it's more like a lousy geek show that overcharges for admission and then is boring. 9 Songs was similar in some ways but at least the sex in 9 songs was erotic and the music was hot.

After the film finished I was completely flabbergasted and amazed to have seen this work of art. The visuals were great and the movie was extremely entertaining. But that's not the main reason I loved the film so much. It raises a lot of questions about our modern day society without letting social commentaries get in the way of the drama and action.The movie is easily one of the top ten best SciFi films ever created it stands high up with Star Wars 2001 A Space Odyssey and The Day the Earth Stood Still.

	schema:reviewBody "1968s PLANET OF THE APES has been my favorite film since I first saw it in April of that year when I was eight years old.  The movie had a huge impact back then and I cannot emphasize more the power to grip the imagination it had  and has  and the shock the final image of the movie was back then. I literally left the theatre stunned and speechless.  No other movie of my youth had such impact or created such suspension of disbelief.  Over the past thirtyfour years PLANET OF THE APES has attained classic status and it's a tribute to the film's excellence that there are so many comments left here on the Internet Movie Database that this film is better than the viewer thought it would be or that it wasn't campy or cheesy as they'd always thought or that it was more intelligent and thoughtprovoking than most films they've ever seen and that despite the studio stupidly putting the final shot  one of the most famous last shots in the history of American cinema  on the cover of the video they were still stunned and haunted by it.PLANET OF THE APES is based on a 1963 French novel La planete des singes by Pierre Boulle most famous as the author of La pont de la riviere Kwai 1952 which became the 1957 film THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI.  The story tells of a French journalist Ulysse Merou who in the year 2500 travels with two companions in a nearlight speed spacecraft to the redgiant star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion.  There they find a sister planet to earth Soror and after landing on a remote plateau discover a race of human beings that are no more than animals naked and unable to speak. The three earthmen are stripped of there clothes by the humans who hate anything that isn't natural.  Their spacecraft is destroyed by the savage people and they are run off into the jungle.  The next morning the tribe of wild humans are attacked by hunters who are gorillas dressed like men hunting like men and acting and speaking like men.  One of the earthmen is killed another disappears and Merou is captured taken to a research lab and subjected to scientific experiments.A sympathetic female animal psychologist Dr. Zira a chimpanzee is intrigued by Merou keenness and soon learns that this man is highly intelligent and able to learn speech.  With her help Merou learns all about the simian civilization on Soror in which the apes live in modern cities drive cars fly planes and watch TV and where conservative orangutans especially one named Zaius so fear this intelligent human being that they seek to have him destroyed.   With the help of Zira's fiance an archeologist named Cornelius Merou unwittingly discovers a secret about the origins of intelligent life on Soror that's so dangerous he's forced to flee the planet of the apes and return to earth.Boulle's novel is a satire in the tradition of Voltaire that mocks humankind's anthropocentric theory of the universe from which human beings derive their sense of importance and is laced with the kind of harrowing ironies that Boulle was famous for.The movie based on this book is an 'Americanized' adaptation of it.  Rod Serling did the first drafts of the screenplay simplifying the plot by fitting it into the mold of his Twilight Zone TV series and introducing an antinuclear war theme not present in the Boulle novel.  Because of budget constraints the modern ape civilization had to be reduced to a less technological one something more reminiscent of ancient Greece.  In fact after Michael Wilson who had also adapted Boulle's Bridge Over the River Kwai to the screen was brought in to do the final script drafts what emerged was a political allegory more akin to an Aesop fable than a Voltairian satire.An improvement on the book was to turn the Merou character now named Taylor into a misanthrope and to reduce the scope of the story into a kind of 'misanthrope's comeuppance.'  Charlton Heston was a perfect choice to play the unlikable American astronaut having essayed such similar 'bastard' roles in 1954s THE NAKED JUNGLE 1963s DIAMOND HEAD and 1963s 55 DAYS AT PEKING and the movie would be a lot less funny and pointed without him.Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter as Cornelius and Zira and Maurice Evans as Dr. Zaius enjoy some of the best performances on the screen bringing the theninnovative makeup design of John Chambers to life under the intelligent and stylish direction of Franklin J. Schaffner.   Also excellent in this Arthur P. Jacobs production for 20th CenturyFox is the veteran cinematographer Leon Shamroy's Panavision lensing which makes great use of remote areas of southern Utah around Lake Powell to suggest an alien world and Jerry Goldsmith's avantgarde musical score which has become a landmark cannot be emphasized more for contributing to the weird atmosphere and eerie mood of the movie.  Rarely has a movie score so fit like handinglove than this one.PLANET OF THE APES was a box office smash in 1968 but if ever there was a movie that was more a victim of its own success it's this one.  Four sequels two TV series numerous novelizations and comic book adventures and a lamentable remake in 2001 have been spawned by its popularity most of which has been so inferior in quality to have tarnished the reputation of this classy and intelligent SF film landmark.  Luckily the qualities of the film remind viewers again and again of what noted New Yorker movie critic Pauline Kael titled her review of this movie Apes must be remembered Charlie!".

He has that look into the camera that can just describe so many things about his character and portrayal. He has that action hero look yet he is by all accounts a great actor. That is why when he just looks into the camera you get a powerful sense of what is happening on the screen. Heston actually is able to portray a man put into slavery by apes. Somehow though it works.Combined with Schaffner's directing abilities Heston and him were able to really take this movie to another level. Other than the costumes of the apes even though they were pretty impressive for that time everything looked very realistic allowing you to really get into the movie. That quality alone of this movie separates this between the ordinary scifi movies. It even has a plot. It is something we are all familiar with. A person fighting for their freedom and survival. Like everything else in this film the plot was also taken to another level. The ending was not cheap either it was a bit of a surprise and was really something I won't forget. It was one of those moments in movies you won't forget. This is a true classic.If you have seen any other Heston movies you just know that he is the king of scifi and transforms almost every single one of them especially this one into an unforgettable classic.".

This is a true classic.If you have seen any other Heston movies you just know that he is the king of scifi and transforms almost every single one of them especially this one into an unforgettable classic.";

Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.

	schema:reviewBody "The original 'Planet of the Apes' is better than the 2001 remake on almost every level. May be Tim Burton's version looks better no wonder with Burton as the director but the direction itself the cinematography the story and the performances in Franklin J. Schaffner's original are much better and more interesting.Heston is Taylor who crashes with his spaceship on what seems to be a deserted planet. He and two other survivors start searching for life. They run into other human beings and at that time they are all attacked by apes. The apes speak English the human beings are mute. In this society a human being is what apes are in our society. Animals nothing more. The humans are taken for research Taylor as well and since he is shot in the neck he is not able to talk at first. One of his fellow survivors is dead what happened to the other is unsure. A female ape who is a scientist discovers that Taylor understands her and even thinks he can talk. Of course this is not what the high people in this society want to hear.The movie has some very interesting elements. Worlds are upside down as Taylor says and in a way the movie puts a mirror in front of us. The human beings are humiliated in exactly the way we treat animals. What would we do if another mammal suddenly knew how to speak our language? We would probably react the same as the apes do in this movie and therefore it is even more interesting.In liked the movie very much and some very nice moments in particular. Early in the movie Taylor gets a woman in his cage. He calls her Nova Linda Harrison. We know what the apes want and it is funny because it is exactly how we do this kind of stuff to our animals. The apes are even surprised when Taylor wants to keep his woman and therefore seems monogamous.With some nice touches a great and famous ending some quotes that will sound very familiar Charlton Heston as a pretty good leading man a score from Jerry Goldsmith that is perfect for a movie like this nice direction and a fine cinematography by Leon Shamroy this movie is a very good classic.".

Exciting writing credits by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson from Pierre Boulle novel though the amazing final scripted by Serling. One of the important attributes of this work is the excellent spectacular production design by Walter Scott. Glimmer and luminous cinematography by Leon Shamroy. Magnificent makeup by John Chambers a firstrate expert such as proved in 'Blade runner Ssss Island of Dr Moreau' among others.

The film won two nominations for Academy Award the best costume and sensational musical score by a topnotch Jerry Golsmith Schaffner's usual Patton Papillon and deservedly won Oscar for makeup by Chambers. Schaffner was an impressive director with hits  'Boys from Brazil Papillon Patton War lord' but also flops  'Lionheart Island of streams Nicholas and Alexandra and Sphinx'. Schaffner was one of the most innovate creative minds from the 70s and 80s.Followed by four inferior sequels and a TV series as 'Beneath of the planet of apes'70 Ted Post 'Escape of planet of apes'71 Don Taylor 'Conquest of planet of apes'72 J.

	schema:reviewBody "In recent years scifi have been filled with flashing lights highbudget CGI effects and ridiculous stunts like in THE MATRIX and I ROBOT. If you don't like one scifi film you're unlikely to like any as they're all the same. However my dad took down PLANET OF THE APES from our video shelf. Unlike most scifi films it was made in a time that had to deal without CGI and relied completely on the break through movie makeup as well as providing what people have voted time and time again The Greatest Film Ending. PLANET OF THE APES has a memorable cast simple plot and it keeps your attention even as the credits are rolling at the end. Based on Pierre Boulle's lesser novel La Plante des singes AKA Monkey Planet tells of an astronaut landing on a distant planet and discovering that man's role as the superior life form has been reversed with the apes. The film has many needed changes to it to make it more watchable and tap into the true fears at the time the film was made. In 1968 everyone lived in fear of an atomic bomb attack and PLANET OF THE APES truly taps into that fear for reasons I will not reveal but it is understandable why the story was so popular at the time and why it shocked everyone.PLANET OF THE APES tells the story of George Taylor Charlton Heston when he and his doomed astronaut friends find themselves stranded on a distant planet. It seems to be inhospitable with no life. However after travelling throughout the place which is famously referred to as The Forbidden Zone discover plenty of life including ape like humans and human like apes. Taylor is shot in the neck rendering him unable to speak. Treated as a wounded animal he is taken to a humanape study lab where he meets Zira Kim Hunter a sympathetic and friendly chimpanzee. She almost straight away notices that Taylor's intelligence goes far beyond that of any other human and she encourages him to speak. However orangutan leader Dr Zaius sneers on Zira's and her fianc Cornelius' Roddy McDowall belief in any human intelligence and won't listen to reason. Despite Cornelius' skeptical feelings towards Taylor he agrees to help prove his intelligence which is proved once he finally says his famous line Take your stinking paws of me you damn dirty ape! Heston is anything other then a likable character. Unlike Ulysse Merou in the novel Taylor is slightly moody but a likable character who values his friendship with Zira and Cornelius. He represents what humans truly are that is selfcentered violent and dangerous. Though on stage he is reportedly according to Laurence Olivier truly a talented actor on screen and in PLANET OF THE APES Heston basically turned up and played himself. Nonetheless the character of Taylor works as you either love him or you hate him. The rebel Taylor is no different from the other pushy characters Heston has played over the years. With his tough physical godlike body you suppose that in a film where the apes are pushing us humans about because we're basically behaving like apes he is just what the doctor ordered.Of course we all know that it's the two lovable chimps Zira and Cornelius that we remember the most in the PLANET OF THE APES films for their charm and humor they bring to the story. Hunter's portrayal of Zira was a masterpiece on its own giving one of the most powerful performances. It's fair to say that Zira is the strongest and most developed character in the film. Indeed she is the only ape that Taylor actually likes! With her wit and admirable sense of humor it's not surprising that most people asked who their favorite character is reply Zira. Hunter manages to make Zira what she was meant to be more human then ape. In fact she's more human than most of the beautiful female actresses of the 60's films. Despite the fact she looks as ugly as hell in her ape makeup the charm still shines through.Of course if you don't love the intelligent and cool Zira you always have intelligent and nerdy Cornelius. McDowell next to Heston is the most celebrated male actor in the films as he comes over as the nerd of the rebel gang that you just want to hug. In the film Taylor seems to have a lovehate rivalry with Cornelius as they constantly challenge each other like fullblooded males do no matter how civilized. A good example of this is when Zira allows Taylor to kiss her on the lips as a goodbye and Cornelius makes his jealousy clear. However Taylor sticks up for him against Zaius which shows not as much friendship as understanding. McDowell is an irreplaceable member of the cast who is near impossible to live up to.PLANET OF THE APES is a mark in cinema history famous for these talented artists gripping story and an amazing ending that shocks you scares you breaks you and brings you to tears with the realization that you'll never truly experience a film like this again. Anyone who is anyone owes it to himself or herself to watch this film and experience the feeling. Even people who dislike scifi are likely to enjoy this. A film that truly did break STAR WARS and challenged it like no other film ever could. PLANET OF THE APES will live on in all of us. It will go on forever find its way to younger audiences and will win them over just it won over us.".

Hunter manages to make Zira what she was meant to be more human then ape. In fact she's more human than most of the beautiful female actresses of the 60's films. Despite the fact she looks as ugly as hell in her ape makeup the charm still shines through.Of course if you don't love the intelligent and cool Zira you always have intelligent and nerdy Cornelius. McDowell next to Heston is the most celebrated male actor in the films as he comes over as the nerd of the rebel gang that you just want to hug. In the film Taylor seems to have a lovehate rivalry with Cornelius as they constantly challenge each other like fullblooded males do no matter how civilized. A good example of this is when Zira allows Taylor to kiss her on the lips as a goodbye and Cornelius makes his jealousy clear. However Taylor sticks up for him against Zaius which shows not as much friendship as understanding. McDowell is an irreplaceable member of the cast who is near impossible to live up to.PLANET OF THE APES is a mark in cinema history famous for these talented artists gripping story and an amazing ending that shocks you scares you breaks you and brings you to tears with the realization that you'll never truly experience a film like this again. Anyone who is anyone owes it to himself or herself to watch this film and experience the feeling. Even people who dislike scifi are likely to enjoy this. A film that truly did break STAR WARS and challenged it like no other film ever could. PLANET OF THE APES will live on in all of us. It will go on forever find its way to younger audiences and will win them over just it won over us.";

I have always been disappointed and irked at the illwill that some people have towards Planet of the Apes. I almost assaulted someone who described Apes as one of those sobadit'sfunny type of movies a few months ago. I take this film very seriously and I wish others would do the same.I think one of the reasons there is so much animosity against this one is that it is undeniably dated. Not too much but it would be difficult to sit a young teenager raised on 1990s movies down in front of it and have himher enjoy it. Even a young adult between the ages of 18 and 25 would find it difficult. Planet of the Apes definitely exists in a specific time the late 1960s. This was the best decade for film churning out tons of both American and foreign masterpieces. Times were rough and the Vietnam War was growing in intensity by the time Planet of the Apes was made. Because of this we see many references to the current dilemma. The film willynilly debates issues like hunting violence animal rights evolution vs creationism class structure and nuclear war. Taylor tells a young rebellious teenage chimpanzee not to trust anyone over 30 a common youth adage in the late 60s. Yes it has so many topics that it seems to be about to burst at times. And yes the satire does go overboard once in a while. Still it is all argued passionately. You can tell that everyone involved even Heston believes in what they are saying. In its own way Planet of the Apes is as intellectual and philosophical a film as 2001. I know that when teens and younger people go see the Tim Burton remake which is not great btw there are going to be many who overpraise it and say that it is much better than the original. You would have to be mentally handicapped to honestly believe so.".

If ever there was a film that deserves to be a standalone this is the one. Follow Heston's brawny Taylor from the pitiful planting of the stars and stripes at the beginning to that monumental ending and then leave it at that do not pass go do not venture further into any sort of monkey business. No sequel necessary for Planet of the Apes to truly hit you with maximum impact it all needs to end right there on that shoreline.

He stumbles into a rude civilization in which apes rule while the tribes of speechless humans are treated as wild animals and periodically rounded up for experimentation or extermination. Heston is wounded in the throat during his capture and is rendered mute like the others. Since he demonstrates signs of intelligence he is singled out for behavioral examination and kept in a cage with a female of the species. The apes argue over whether he actually has brains or is simply aping his betters. When he regains his speech it upsets everyone's view of life as it should be as it's written down in the scrolls by the law giver. His chief enemy is an orangutan played by Maurice Evans. With the help of two enlightened scientific chimpanzees Kim Hunter and Roddy MacDowell he manages to escape with his Significant Other only to discover that he has landed back on earth whence he came but that a war has destroyed humankind and left an ecological vacuum that has been filled by the great apes.Actually the movie runs along three parallel tracks. One is the unraveling of the mystery of how the apes came to be superior to humans and the moral behind the puzzle. A second involves the internal dissent among the apes pitting those who scoff at the idea of man and culture and those who believe Heston and want to see him saved and set free. The third is a running commentary on Western culture circa 1967 the era of flower power and hippies and rebellious youth and disgruntled resentful elders clinging to old concepts. I discount the relationship between Heston and the young lady since she doesn't speak and was in real life the mistress of the producer Richard Zanuck.It all may seem a little preachy now and in some respects incomprehensible to those who don't remember the tumultuous 1960s. The morphed wisecracks are still amusing though. Don't trust anyone over thirty. Will the youngsters get that? Will they get Maurice Evans' speech before the Council of Three which alludes twice to the Declaration of Independence and once each to Alexander Pope and George Orwell? Probably not. The apes seem to be getting righter all the time.There are other instructive evocations of current social dynamics. On Planet Ape the lighter you are the better off you are. The buff orangutans are the aristocratic leaders. The grayish chimpanzees are their middleclass intellectuals and technicians rather like today's nerds. The black gorillas are the grunts. They do all the wet work. They're the guards and the police force and the flunkies and the shoeshine boys. An interesting remark by Heston in a commentary on the film the three simian strata subjected themselves to voluntary segregation. The separate species hung out together ate lunch together and though they showed no evident hostility towards the others they clearly preferred their own kind. Is this movie telling us more than we need or want to know? Shouldn't a sociologist find this as disturbing as Heston finds the wreck of the Statue of Liberty? Except for Charlton Heston there's no acting worth commenting on. The others are buried in carefully designed make up. They can only project the most rudimentary expressions  a slight frown a weak smile  and their voices could have easily been dubbed. Every actor down to the extras underwent this lengthy and elaborate disguise. Later versions of the tale as the concept became degraded and decadent saved time and money by giving the lesser performers simple rubber masks.They probably could have lowered the budget on this initial entry by using cheaper techniques. Few people would have noticed and really the story is determinedly middlebrow like Rod Serling's simple sermons on the excellent The Twilight Zone series. Not particularly subtle or challenging the story is what might be called thought provoking. It made scads of money which accounts for the many sequels and the recent remake. If there's a nickel left to be made out of the franchise we can expect another one any minute.Yet it's an enjoyable movie  amusing and well though provoking. Nice location shooting and imaginative art direction. See it with the kids. Explain to them that we hold these truths to be self evident is from a charter document that Pope said the proper study of mankind is man and that Orwell wrote some are more equal than others. They'll thank you for it and with any luck will climb down from the chandelier.".

The film's post apocalyptic look is breathtaking and Roddy McDowall Dr. Cornelius Kim Hunter Dr. Zira and Maurice Evans Dr. Zaius are the standouts in this finely written tale by Michael Wilson and Twilight Zone's Rod Sterling. The ending  which is still considered one of the best twist endings of all time  still doesn't disappoint.

	schema:reviewBody "I had been avoiding watching 'Planet of the Apes' for a long time as I thought it would be one of those silly futuristic scifi movies with men fighting monkeys. However the movie turned out to be so much more. The limited use of special effects give it an authentic look. Schaffner makes fine use of his equipments and crew. The reddish mountainous desertlandscape is mysterious and fascinating. The cinematography is good too. The makeup is terrific and beats what any CGI could have done. The plot is simple and yet engaging. One wonders what Taylor's fate will be. Just one you think it will take a predicted turn you are thrown away with a surprising but layered twist. Some parts of the film are quite disturbing to watch the museum sequence and the ending. The legendary Charlton Heston does a great job. Even though he brings the same persona that was evident in his other works it is what Taylor required. However the showstealers are Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter. Hunter's funny witty compassionate and clever Zira and McDowell's nerdy dedicated and devoted Cornelius bring a wonderfully humane quality to their characters. 'Planet Of The Apes' deserves to be watched because it is a wellmade and marvelously acted film but it also raises some relevant questions regarding humanity and nature.".

That is not to say that it does not contain any of the latter indeed it does have plenty but they are all suitably used in order to convey the message being put across not just to show off.This movie is definitely not to be taken on face value because although seriously campy and surreal in it's premise under all this is a brilliant palette of ideas and questions about human ideals our future as a species and the very nature of our existence. Combined with a highly interesting overarching science fiction plot of some space explorers landing on a presumably foreign planet ruled by apes Planet of the Apes serves as entertainment not just for the mind but for the heart also. As a whole the story itself is brilliantly paced allowing for detailed character and plot development that never drags or rushes along too quickly to be analysed.I noticed a lot of critics have slammed the acting and dialogue in the film but I couldn't disagree more. I adored every character in this film and thought the cast did a terrific job bringing them to life. Sure the dialogue is a little contrived here and there but in the context of the story it makes absolute sense. Also contrary to seemingly popular opinion I'm also a huge fan of the effects and costumes used in the film and regarded them as very well done for it's time and never once did they detract from the film.As I've said before in my reviews I often find it hardest to write about films that I find near flawless and this is no exception. By the end of Planet of the Apes I was overwhelmed with thoughts and views that would be impossible to get down on paper after a first watch. Instead I simply recommend you watch for yourself and see why I regard this as a fine example of intelligent science fiction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is Pauline Kael's review from the February 17th 1968 New YorkerApes Must Be Remembered Charlie 'Planet of the Apes' is a very entertaining movie and you'd better go see it quickly before your friends take the edge off it by telling you all about it.  They will because it has the ingenious kind of plotting people love to talk about.  If it were a great picture it wouldn't need this kind of protection it's just good enough to be worth the rush.Adapted from a novel by Pierre Boulle 'Planet of the Apes' most closely resembles George Pal's 1960 version of H.G. Wells' 1895 novel 'The Time Machine.'  It's also a little like 'Forbidden Planet' the 1956 sciencefiction adaptation of 'The Tempest' though it's perhaps more cleverly sustained than either of those movies.  At times it has the primitive force of old 'King Kong.'  It isn't a difficult or subtle movie you can just sit back and enjoy it.  That should place the genre closely enough without spoiling the theme or the plot.  The writing by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling though occasionally bright is often fancyironic in the old school of poetic disillusion.  Even more often it is crude.  But the construction is really extraordinary.  What seem to be weaknesses or holes in the idea turn out to be perfectly consistent and sequences that work only at a simple level of parody while you're watching them turn out to be really funny when the total structure is revealed.  You're too busy for much disbelief anyway the timing of each action or revelation is right on the button.  The audience is rushed along with the hero who keeps going as fact as possible to avoid being castrated or lobotomized.  The picture is an enormous manylayered black joke on the hero and the audience and part of the joke is the use of Charlton Heston as the hero.  I don't think the movie could have been so forceful or so funny with anyone else.  Physically Heston with his perfect leanhipped powerful body is a godlike hero built for strength he's an archetype of what makes Americans win.  He doesn't play a nice guy he's harsh and hostile selfcentered and hottempered.  Yet we don't hate him because he's so magnetically strong he represents American power  the physical attraction and admiration one feels toward the beauty of strength as well as the moral revulsion one feels toward the ugliness of violence.  And he has the profile of an eagle. Franklin J. Schaffner who directed 'Planet of the Apes' uses the Heston of the preposterous but enjoyable 'The Naked Jungle'  the man who is so absurdly a moviestar myth.  He is the perfect American Adam to work off some American guilt feelings or selfhatred on and this is part of what makes this new violent fantasy so successful as comedy.'Planet of the Apes' is one of the best sciencefiction fantasies ever to come out of Hollywood.  That doesn't mean it's art.  It is not conceived in terms of vision or mystery or beauty.  Sciencefiction fantasy is a peculiar genre it doesn't  seem to result in much literary art either.  This movie is efficient and craftsmanlike  it's conceived and carried out for maximum popular appeal though with a cautionary message and with some attempts to score little points against various forms of establishment thinking.  These swifties are not Swift and the movie's posture of superiority is somewhat embarrassing.  Brechtian pedagogy doesn't work in Brecht and it doesn't work here either.  At best this is a slick commercial picture with it's elements carefully engineered  pretty girl who unfortunately doesn't seem to have had acting training comic reliefs thrills chases  but when expensive Hollywood engineering works as it rarely does anymore the results can be impressive.  Schaffner has thought out the action in terms of the wide screen and he uses space and  distance dramatically.  Leon Shamroy's excellent color photography helps to make the vast exteriors shot in Utah and Arizona an integral part of the meaning.  The editing though is somewhat distracting several times there is a cut and then a view of what we have already seen from a different angle or from much higher up. The effect is both static we don't seem to be getting anywhere and overemphatic we are conscious of being told to look at the same thing another way.The makeup there is said to be a million dollars' worth and the costuming of  the actors playing the apes are rather witty and the apes have a wonderful nervous hoping walk.  The best little hopper is Kim Hunter as an ape lady doctor she somehow manages to give a better performance in this makeup than she has ever given on the screen before.".

	schema:reviewBody "1968 seems to have been something of a watershed year for cinematic science fiction. It was the year that both 2001 A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes were released. Both films were game changers in that they were big budget scifi made by the major studios. Up until that time the genre had been very much mostly the province of the B movie. After the massive success of those two a series of often extremely interesting science fiction films were released by the studios. In effect these movies created a situation where the genre could flourish with bigger budgets and more seriousness. Of course those films were quite different while both dealt with some serious themes 2001 is by far the more intellectual and is pure hard scifi  Planet of the Apes on the other hand lay somewhere between 2001 and traditional actionadventure fare.It does deal have definite social commentary and like many scifi films it's about the time it was made as much as it is a look into the future. It considers the dangers of nuclear war and comments on the racial tensions of 60's America  both through allegory in its postapocalyptic world. I guess this is one of the things that makes it work so well the upside down society of the Planet of the Apes allows for an underlying message while at the same time offering up a thrilling scifi adventure scenario. To be perfectly honest it works great as the latter. For me the best parts are the early scenes leading up to the capture of the astronauts. The mystery of the strange world and the unforgettable arrival of the horseriding apes in the fields are terrific. While John Chambers has been rightly praised for the ape makeup a lot of credit should also go to Leon Shamroy for his stunning cinematography which is particularly brilliant in these early scenes with great shots from unusual high angles that makes the planet seem so very ominous. Kudos too to Jerry Goldsmith for his soundtrack whose strange tones compliment the visuals. When we reach the ape town it's the fantastic setdesign that takes centre stage with those houses that seem to come out of the rocks organically. Charlton Heston leads the picture of course and he does provide star charisma but it's the character actors in the heavy makeup that make the best impression namely Roddy McDowell Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans. And of course wellthere's that ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Planet of the Apes starts as space mission that left Erath in 1972 to travel in space at the speed of light for six months crash lands on a planet that doesn't look too dissimilar to Earth. Only three crew members survive Taylor Chartlon Heston Landon Robert Gunner  Dodge Jeff Burton who find themselves in desert like conditions  struggling to survive the hostile planet. Just as all hope seems lost they encounter a tribe of humans who are then attacked by a group of man like talking Apes who have become the dominant race on the planet with man being the beast who are rounded up put in zoos  experimented on. In the attack Landon  Dodge are lost while Taylor is shot in the the throat unable to speak he is rounded up  put in a cage where kind Chimp female scientist named Zira Kim Hunter befriends Taylor  when he regains the ability to speak there are certain Ape hierarchy who want him dead so to preserve their own society  beliefs...Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner after J. Lee Thompson who was originally set to direct pulled out to make Mackenna's Gold 1969 this I suppose is considered as a true scifi classic  as I write this even makes it to number 228 in the IMDb's Top 250  since this is a forty year old film that's pretty impressive going. The script from Twilight Zone host creator  head writer Rod Serling  Michael Wilson was based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle although by all accounts refines it a little bit  adds that twist ending which surely everyone now knows Planet of the Apes is a good solid scifi action adventure that uses the role reversal of a dominant Ape society living next to uncivilised wild human tribes to make some nice points about humanity where we are going  has some strong social satire as well. From unfair trials to the religion versus science debate to prejudice to wanting to destroy what we don't understand to the ultimate devastation of war. Sure it's all good stuff it's well written  it's very well put together  the fact most of the main character's are talking Apes it's deadly serious  it all works surprisingly well on various levels as a film that entertains  social satire that has meaning. Some of the scifi elements don't add up though I don't believe the concept of time travel as described here  after a thousand odd years would that doll still be in perfect working order? Also I just don't believe Taylor wouldn't have guessed he was on Earth I mean there are people there Apes there the technology is the same  the trees sky water  terrain is exactly the same too so it wouldn't exactly take a genius to realise or even make an educated guess. Then there's that iconic twist ending sure it's a great image but the fact everyone knows about it means it might not have the impact it once did  the fact most should realise that this is Earth means it shouldn't really come as much of a surprise. That's a minor quibble though in an otherwise very good scifi film that probably just about deserves it's classic status.The one outstanding area of Planet of the Apes is the Oscar winning makeup effects which are really very impressive even forty years later the effects are very convincing  while not as good as the remake no matter what anyone tells you they hold up extremely well. There are some well staged action scenes too in particular the sequence about thirty minutes in when the Apes attack  kill numerous humans while on horseback complete with memorable images of the Apes standing over the dead bodies of several humans posing for photographs. The opening as the three astronaut's walk through the harsh desert is also well shot  you can almost feel the heat  isolation. An extremely popular film at the time Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels Beneath the Planet of the Apes 1970 Escape from the Planet of the Apes 1971 Conquest of the Planet of the Apes 1972  Battle for the Planet of the Apes 1973 as well as the short lived TV series Planet of the Apes 1974  the animated TV series Return to the Planet of the Apes 1975 before it was remade as a hundred million blockbuster by Tim Burton back in 2001.With a supposed budget of about 5800000 this wasn't mega budget but all money went on screen it seems this is a great looking  designed film. The acting is good especially from those wearing Apes makeup.Planet of the Apes is considered a scifi classic  despite one or two minor flaws I would largely have to agree it's maybe one of those iconic films that everyone should see at least once.".

That's a minor quibble though in an otherwise very good scifi film that probably just about deserves it's classic status.The one outstanding area of Planet of the Apes is the Oscar winning makeup effects which are really very impressive even forty years later the effects are very convincing  while not as good as the remake no matter what anyone tells you they hold up extremely well. There are some well staged action scenes too in particular the sequence about thirty minutes in when the Apes attack  kill numerous humans while on horseback complete with memorable images of the Apes standing over the dead bodies of several humans posing for photographs. The opening as the three astronaut's walk through the harsh desert is also well shot  you can almost feel the heat  isolation. An extremely popular film at the time Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels Beneath the Planet of the Apes 1970 Escape from the Planet of the Apes 1971 Conquest of the Planet of the Apes 1972  Battle for the Planet of the Apes 1973 as well as the short lived TV series Planet of the Apes 1974  the animated TV series Return to the Planet of the Apes 1975 before it was remade as a hundred million blockbuster by Tim Burton back in 2001.With a supposed budget of about 5800000 this wasn't mega budget but all money went on screen it seems this is a great looking  designed film. The acting is good especially from those wearing Apes makeup.Planet of the Apes is considered a scifi classic  despite one or two minor flaws I would largely have to agree it's maybe one of those iconic films that everyone should see at least once.";

	schema:reviewBody "Does contain spoilers!I remember recently having an argument at work with my boss who vehemently argued that 1968's Planet of the Apes is head and shoulders above Tim Burton's version.  I had just come back from seeing Burton's and was quite impressed.  And even though I had never seen this one I argued the other way.  I am not sure why I did this perhaps it was just to play Devil's Advocate maybe it was just cause I'm an ass at times or maybe I really thought that this version couldn't be better than the new one.  After all Burton's post apocalyptic futuristic ape world was inhabited by apes that were intelligent enough to form societies and create laws but they were too stupid to realize that the world they live in is big enough for both humans and animals.  It went to great lengths  or so I thought to show man's and conversely apes ignorance when it comes to the welfare of anything that is considered lower in intellect.  In short I felt that Burton's Planet of the Apes touched on many issues that are important to me.  I couldn't really see how a film made 30 some years ago could top that.  Boy was I wrong!I rated 2001's POTA an 8.5 based mostly on it's theories and because of the action in the film and because I have a soft spot for Michael Clarke Duncan.  If that is true and I do feel that way then 1968's POTA is easily worth a ten and that is what I am giving it.  Very few films make you feel something.  Let me rephrase that.  A good film will entertain you an even better one can enlighten you.  But only a very few precious films can keep you entertained and fill your head with a plethora of thought provoking ideas and whatifs at the very same time.  Planet of the Apes is one of those films.  JFK and all of it's pseudotheories about the assassination of the president left me feeling exhausted and afraid of the world we live in.  Films like The Matrix you're a disease Mr. Anderson and T2 it's in your nature to destroy yourselves and Instinct these are the takers gave me similar premonitions.  You can add Planet of the Apes to that select breed of films that gave me a similar feeling.  This is a film that takes its time to tackle such weighty issues as evolution human rights animal rights racism religious ambiguity military strong arms and many other issues.  The screenplay was skillfully adapted by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame from a book by Pierre Boulle. And although I have not read the book I have read that the film is different in quite a few ways.  For instance the book and subsequently Burton's version has the apes very technologically advanced.  But because of technological inferiority in 1968 the film took the apes and had them living in a primitively built cityvillage.  They had buildings made of rock but not concrete.  The had guns but not automatic weapons.  And although Burton's version hasn't introduced them to guns the apes are much stronger much higher up on the evolutionary scale.  But in this POTA there seems to be a missing link.  Certain apes have theories that apes really evolved from man and yet the humans in this world cannot speak.  They seem to understand some things but they cannot comprehend what is being said to them all of the time kind of like the way our animals are today.  This opens up a plethora possibilities.  Are these humans mutants are they a cross between man and ape?  Have they been scientifically altered by some medical Nazilike experiment and over time generations have adapted to these experiments?  There are many weighty issues open for discussion.  Other reviewers bring up the possibility of a nuclear war and one of Taylor's observations was that there may have been a nuclear shower or meteor storm that devastated humans just like the dinosaurs before them.  And doesn't that make Heston's speech at the beginning of Armageddon  it happened once it'll happen again.. it's just a matter of time all the more chilling?Contains major spoilers in the next few paragraphs.  Please do not read if you plan on seeing the film soon for the first time!!!!  You have been warned!  2001's version of POTA was quite impressive because of technology first and the story second.  While it did think about things such as animal rights and such it did not hold it as important as this version does.  This is a film that you could watch over and over again and still have it give you that sinking feeling in your stomach every time.  The ending alone is enough to open up discussion for months to come.  And I have a theory.  So bear with me.  If what he sees at the end of the film on the beach is really the whole thing sitting there and not just the head  meaning that the rest of it is buried some 200 feet in the sand then this presents a whole slew of possibilites.  Dr Zaius has discovered the cave where he believes there is sufficient enough evidence that there were intelligent human occupants before apes.  The basis of his evidence is that on different levels of the earth buried in the sand and clay there are artifacts to support his claim. One one level he found reading glasses and deeper still he finds false teeth and in another level even deeper he found a babies doll that talks. Proof that evolution granted man the ability to talk.  But when Taylor is left to find his destiny what he finds is the thing that may be buried so deep in the earth from thousands of years of stagnancy.  What if what he is seeing is really all in tact just buried some 200 feet under the earth?  If they could dig that far down what would they find?  Would they find dishes or the remains of houses?  Would they find subway tunnels sewage pipes bones of sewer rats bones of CHUD like people?  The possibilities are endless.  This could turn the ape world upside down and it would create a division in those that are ardent followers of the ape religion and those that believe in evolution.  Doesn't this kind of sound similar to situations here in our time?End of spoilersPOTA is the one of the best Science Fiction films I have ever seen and this would easily crack my top 100 films ever made.  And that is after 2 viewings.  I want to go back and watch this film a few more times so I can really understand it.  It is a rare film that entertains and poses some very interesting and provocative questions.  And as I said earlier there are very few films that can do something like that.  Films like American Pie or Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Godfather are great because they entertain and make you laugh or cheer.  POTA is in a class with other films like T2 and Aliens.  These are films that also entertain but they force you to examine who we are and where we have come from and where we could possibly go.  Is it possible that man will one day become so unbearable that some divine intervention will occur so that we are not the inferior species?  A film like this makes you think and wonder?  What if......?10 out 0f 10 This is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one that I am going to get my kids to watch someday.  Burton's is fun and thoughtprovoking.  This one is simply mind blowing and intellectually stimulating.  This is a must see for any generation.".

He was so believable as the 'godfather' neighbourhood restaurateur. The other principal actors were also brilliant although in my opinion Eduardo Blanco as the comedic interest overegged and hammed a little too much in a couple of scenes eg as bogus priest. But that is nitpicking in one of the most memorable romantic films I've ever seen.I totally agree with one of the reviewers who compared and contrasted to the dreadful film travesty made of 'The Notebook'recently which missed all the buttons around Alzheimers and real people with real believable feelings and reactions. I also agree that while if this product had been American with J Nicholson etc it would have been a surefire Oscar winner it would actually have been ruined by the Hollywood treatment...Thanks you Argentina and I hope to see much more of Senor Darin before long.".

He's complemented by Natalia Verbeke who plays his girlfriend and who is in possession of the world's greatest smile and Hctor Alterio and Norma Aleandro who play his parents. Aleandro in particular contributes some magnificent scenes playing an aged woman struggling to cope with mental illness.

He hasn't visited his mother Norma who is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's in a year. As the previews and the title reveal his father Nino decides that what he wants most of all is to give Norma the church wedding she always wanted although many wonder if she would even notice due to her mental state.The wedding and other story turns which I won't give away help the film turn gracefully from mostly a comedy in the early going into an outstanding drama in the later parts of the film. The performances are excellent by all of the actors helping to make all of the characters seem real. While the photography is often attractive I would not be surprised if the film was shot on 16 mm film or even high definition video and transferred to 35 mm film for exhibition.This film was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign film which should have given it a higher profile than it seems to have gotten. It is highly recommended and should not lose too much seen on home video assuming it eventually shows up there.Note that the star Ricardo Darn also stars in Nine Queens which is opening very soon in the United States.".

Darin has the authority of a major leading man and it's a great pleasure to see already familiar veterans like Alterio and Aleandro in strong roles. Her spin on senility is a beautifully judged mix of touching and funny that the film needs to grab the broad public. Verbeke registers as an exceptionally vivid version of the sexy winning fantasy girl that we keep on seeing in films. If you want to argue that these characters are a distortion of real life you're in a different mind set to the makers and the fourteen dollars a seat customers they are playing to. I enjoyed seeing this recognisable world of cell 'phones old friends resolved family tensions and gourmet food put across in an unfamiliar setting with superior film know how. It's like a good overseas holiday. The old Sascha Guitry gag of the security system picture or the finding the priest at the final wedding were worth the cheer they got at the performance I saw.".

The story has been well commented Rafael Ricardo Darn is a workaholic men that spends his whole life trying to be more important that he really is always forgetting about the ones that really care about him. But suddenly a heart stroke and the appearance of Juan Carlos Eduardo Blanco a friend that he has not seen in 20 years as a really true angel that came from the hell of a life full of tragic episodes turns upside down Rafael's life. All this mixed with the sacrifice that Rafael father is prepared to make deny himself from traveling to his mother country Italy just to make her wife dream true to have a wedding in a church before the eyes of god. This could be reasonable for any person but the fact that his wife Norma Aleandro has a very advance Alzheimer disease and his mind is elsewhere transforms Alterio act in a truly loving and heroic one. To people around the world go to your VHS or DVD store and go directly to this movie. Do not fall in the usual blockbusters that offer you more of the same. Son of the Bride has it all... you will not be disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "This low budget movie is one of the few Argentine movies that I have seen so far. I was at first very skeptic about renting the movie since I was not a very big fan of Argentine movies I lived in Argentina all of my life. But when I came here to Washington D.C my school offered it as part of an international movie fair. So I went to watch it. It is funny and as the movie proceeded I became homesick because of the different scenes of Argentine barrios and cultures which were brilliantly portrayed. One drawback to some people of this movie is that it is spoken in Argentine Spanish which is one that confuses even native Spanish speakers from other countries. The jokes are very Argentine and if you do not appreciate those I think that this movie is not for you. But what would be of your interest is the message of the movie. How he Ricardo Darin changes from being a selfabsorbed middleaged man to a family man who takes care of his parents and at the same time his own. The scene where he is arguing with his former wife is brilliant. The dialogue is full of Argentine culture and it remind me of my own infancy. For example when Ricardo Darin tells her that he wants to educate their daughter in Mexico she replies So who is going to be her teacher? PROFESOR JIRAFALES? Profesor Jirafales is a teacher that appears in the Chavo del Ocho a Mexican sort of sitcom. Argentines were fed up with the characters of this show and it was good to hear something like that which invaded my infancy. Well overall this movie is great. I laughed cried and loved it. Although it is slowpaced I believe it is appropriate for this movie because think about it... WHO CHANGES FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER??? It shows his transition from being a Meman to a Everybody's man. This movie deserves a standing ovation!!! Now I am going to order this movie online. Make sure you do it too! enjoy!".

The film's main purpose is to examine a situation that rises due to the severe economic crisis in Argentina. The film portrays a family that has to make an 180 turn and sacrifice the work of generations. It is an everyday life event in Argentina in which people are forced to leave its family business or life's work due to the circumstances in the country. It is movie in which the family decides to move on with their lives and yet keeping the digninty and unity of the family. It also portrays two different generations in which you see the grandfather still madly in love with its amnesiac wife and the son already divorced yet respecting and honoring the values of its previous generation. It is not meant to become an universal film yet in any country with sever economic crisis stories like this develop everyday.".

I down loaded it to my Tivo because of it's three star rating but had no great desire to relive my mothers long decline into that particular abyss.We had just started to watch Out of Sight a Hollywood product that had George Clooney meeting his costar cute in the trunk of a getaway car. A contrived vehicle for brand name stars that delivered the audience and made a buck for the investors. That's the American way. We cut it off after twenty minutes and decided we may as well give this one a try.Nobody met cute in this film. There is a son with a broken marriage and barely tolerable relations with his ex whom he kept in contact with over the shared love of their daughter. The demented mother was depicted with just enough realism to give a taste of the true sadness of this disease while not overwhelming the film with despair. Maybe it was extra meaningful to me since my Mother was like her the rare person who did not suffer from her illness but bathed in some blessed contentment.I will not try to go into detail why this film was so beautiful. When everything works perfectly the writing directing and the acting all you have is the unfolding of the story on the screen. There is nothing to say about the people or their interactions they are just being themselves. In real life we don't have heroes. The strongest people are those who can make the people around them feel good about themselves. If they are gorgeous they don't wear makeup to accentuate it. If they are rich they talk about a cheap meal they had a restaurant. And if they are very smart they talk sports.So by watching this film you get to spend a couple hours with these people. Nothing will be more enjoyable. And stay through the titles that roll at the end there is one final joke that completes the experience.".

But things take a different turn when he has a stroke. Campanella tells a sweet tale of self discovery or rather self rediscovery accompanied by a playful score. He does present the culture quite well as one does get the feel of the local Argentinian life. Hctor Alterio and Norma Aleandro give very spirited performances and they are a treat to watch. Ricardo Darin is adequate while Natalia Verbeke and Eduardo Blanco are very good. In spite of gaining widespread acknowledgement 'El Hijo de la Novia' remains a small humble little film. I liked how the relationships were portrayed and how the characters and problems were very recognizable. Nino's love for Norma was very moving.

	schema:reviewBody "''El Hijo de la novia'' is a comedy about a stressed man called Rafael Belvedere that is full of responsibilities and problems in his life. He assumed the restaurant that his father founded and is always living in his shadow because of that. The restaurant also demands his entire time making him almost not have time for his mother who suffers from Alzheimer his daughter and even his girlfriend. One day Rafael suffers a heart attack that compels him to think better about his life making him realize how wrong he was doing many things. He also reunites with his childhood friend Juan Carlos that becomes an important piece of his story helping him to deal with many things that happens in his life.I liked this movie because even having its predictable moments deals with many themes in a more real way that many comedies usually does like Rafael's and Naty's relationship or even his mother relationship with him. It is also a very sweet movie since it is impossible to not like the cute relationship between Rafael's parents Can you imagine how sweet is to be married for so many years and still be in love with the same person?.The only I didn't like very much was the fact that movie has some very slow moments that helped me to feel a little bored but this is a person opinion so maybe many people will not even notice or care.".

Short of Bertolucci I can't remember a movie where the use of warm rich colors and lighting added so much to the effect an effect augmented by the gentle guitar score. The story of a heart attack precipitating a reevaluation of life's meaning for successful Buenos Aires restaurateur Rafael Belvedere could have been played to emphasize the painful aspects but what we get here is a tender sympathetic often humorous treatment. The emphasis is on the changes in Rafael's relationships  with his aging parents his young daughter and his significant other.The treatment is not overly sentimental. There are moments of anguish such as when Rafael signs over his restaurant that had been founded by his parents to a large chain. That scene is filmed to stress the difficulty of the decision. The scenes with Rafael's mother who is suffering from Alzheimer's Disease are poignant. And there is no completely smooth sailing in Rafael's relationships after his crisis but they become more meaningful and complex.There are some scenes that are very touching like when Rafael reads an emotionally significant poem written by his daughter and winds up with the question Why hadn't I read this before.I was conflicted in my reaction to one of the central plot points dealing with Rafael's father's desire to give his wife a church wedding the one thing that he felt he had not given her. I could appreciate the sentiment but ultimately leaned toward Rafael's initial reaction It's crazy dad. She won't even notice.The idea that a good part of happiness lies in recognizing accepting and appreciating what we have is not new but the delivery of that message in Son of the Bride makes for an engaging film.P.S. Be sure to catch the scene inserted into the middle of the closing credits.".

Of the remaining three contestants I've only seen the overrated Amelie. No Man's Land is a good choice. Son of the bride has some wonderful moments but is on the whole a little bit overloaded.As the title suggests the story revolves around the son in this case one middleaged restaurateur Rafael Ricardo Darin in a midlife crisis. The film unfolds with a whirlwind of events activities and characters surrounding his life the parents' struggle with the mother's Alzheimer the stressful but rewarding restaurant business the relationship with divorced wife and her boyfriend reaching out to the growing daughter undercurrent of problem with girlfriend a childhood buddy appearing out of nowhere and becoming a rival for the girlfriend. The audience experiences something akin to the whirlwind of calls on the mobile pounding Rafael in the opening sequence eventually punctuated by Rafael's heart attack. Recovering Rafael reflects on his life and decides to get away from it all. The events surrounding him however do not seem to approve of his plan and he finally decides to sell the restaurant.The various subplots are handled with various degrees of success. But even at its worst however it's never sappy. At its best it's marvelous. That is when the other part of the title comes in about the bride accounting for the father's attempt to make it up to the Alzheimer patient mother by giving her a church wedding she never had. Here is the most touching part of the film played by two most wonderful Argentine artists. Comparison of Hector Alterio playing the father Nino and Norma Aleandro playing the mother Norma with two very similar roles in The Notebook 1994 played by James Gardner and Gena Rowlands right away shows how sensible subtle underacting outclasses tearjerking overacting. In response to Nino's deeply loving question although casually put of where should they go for honeymoon Norma's cryptic reply of To hell is at the same time both funny and poignant touching far deeper than a runofthemill tearjerking scene possibly can.Just like Les Invasions Barbares that won the Oscar Best Foreign Language Film two years later El hijo de la novia tackles brilliantly the touchy subject of aging and death. Consider the scene in which Nino makes a series of calls to line up wedding guests most of whom he apparently had not been in touch for a long time. In one of the calls he freezes for a second upon hearing the answer from the other side of the line and said Oh I didn't know that. On the immediately following call he starts by asking Is you husband still alive? The effect is hilarious and come closer to anything that I've seen in laughing in the face of death.In the final analysis this is a brilliant film and if there's a small flaw it's in having a little too much put into it. Trimming some of the nonessentials to reduce the 123 minutes to maybe 110 minutes may make it even better.".

What about him not packing a suitcase or taking a thing? She should have called the police to report his disappearance in case he was somewhere injured  which he was! Even if he wanted to hurt his wife in the worse way there was no indication that he wanted to hurt his daughters that way.I hope the wife threw up because she realized what an idiot she'd been to assume he'd left her. I hope she's haunted by the idea that he might not have died instantly that if she had called the police and if they had investigated he might have been found sooner perhaps even alive. Even if he hadn't lived maybe he could have said goodbye to his daughters.If I were the DA I'd charge that idiot wife with something!".

I can't understand the high rating it received.Her husband is gone and the wife assumed he left her without saying a word. What about his car or his usual means to get to work? What about his office? What about him not packing a suitcase or taking a thing? She should have called the police to report his disappearance in case he was somewhere injured  which he was! Even if he wanted to hurt his wife in the worse way there was no indication that he wanted to hurt his daughters that way.I hope the wife threw up because she realized what an idiot she'd been to assume he'd left her. I hope she's haunted by the idea that he might not have died instantly that if she had called the police and if they had investigated he might have been found sooner perhaps even alive. Even if he hadn't lived maybe he could have said goodbye to his daughters.If I were the DA I'd charge that idiot wife with something!";

	schema:headline " Costner's Gift to Joan Allen";
	schema:reviewBody "I've always admired Kevin Costner's laconic screen presence in BULL DURHAM TIN CUP even DANCES WITH WOLVES JFK and PERFECT WORLD. Now no longer leadingman handsome he's developed into a first rate character actor and as a washedup alcoholic exbaseball playerturned radio talkshow host Costner offers company and comfort to Joan Allen as a drinking buddy in the bittersweet THE UPSIDE OF ANGER. Mike Binder's superb film about an abandoned wife of four teenage girls should qualify as one of this year's best films. But because it was released so early did only respectable business and isn't a vehicle for an overhyped boxoffice attraction on magazine covers now it will probably only get the respect of wordofmouth. I saw this engrossing deeply wonderful film when it opened last winter and made up my mind that I would have to have the DVD as soon as it became available. Joan Allen as Terry Wolfmeyer dazzles us in a performance that is both comically and dramatically masterful as the drunken mother seemingly at war with her four beautiful daughters. Terry's rage over her husband's abandonment of her and their children is a meanspirited rebuke to her daughters who try with great patience to survive their mother's theatrical bitterness. But mama has given them the gift of her humor and I think it's what saves these girls. There's a look that Joan Allen gives when one of her daughters is doing exactly what she doesn't want them to be doing. What it is they are doing to upset their mother is always in doubt because she's never really making rational sense. She's only filtering her displeasure through the rheumy eyes of her last cocktail. There's a scene at the family dining room where Hadley her eldest daughter the ever fascinating Alica Witt who should be starring in her own movies announces she's pregnant with her second baby. Allen was nonetohappy that her daughter opted for marriage and motherhood over a career and her beady eyed stare at her daughter's latest announcement of her grandmotherhood is a comic masterpiece. But when Allen finally can no longer avoid facing her crippling anger Allen breaks your heart. Having never had an outlet for her comic abilities she's surprises you with her skill. That she walks this fine tightrope between both extremes says much for her talent as an actor. Finally back to Costner. Denny Davies might have been a dangerous character for Costner to revisit. Afterall he's played washed up or played out sports characters before. His career has suffered a very precipitous fall following the mediacreated debacle of his socalled grandiose ego in WATERWORLD and the opportunities have been few and far between since then. But Denny is a rich character any actor would love to sink their teeth into and Costner embraces Denny's humanity with consummate ease. Discovering his neighbor has been abandoned by her husband Denny offers to keep her company while they drink. They warily circle each other during these boozy afternoons of watching television drinking and not saying much to each other. And when that changes you see the transition from friend to lover mainly through the eyes of Denny. When she first proposes they sleep together it's Denny who chickens out at the last minute. But as their relationship develops you see Denny reach out to Terry's girls in a way that is sympathetic but also gives them room to accept and then love him in return. This is a terribly important test for Denny. So when the youngest of the girls finally asks him if he plans to marry Terry Denny comes to understand that the girls have welcomed him into the family. Costner is sensational in this film but he keeps it all so lowkey always keeping the focus on Allen's character and he ends up giving her the filmand rightfully so I think. This is a gift to Allen. Costner recognizes this and I think the movie is all the better for his act of generosity. This is a performance that people will talk about for years to come. Like Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid Costner is one of our best screen actors and it's great to see him in a role that is truly worthy of his fine talent. Each of the daughter's is skillfully rendered by Erka Christensen Evan Rachel Wood Keri Russel and Alicia Witt. These young women look and act like siblings. Auteur Mike Binder has given himself a role as Denny's radio producer who is romancing one of the daughters much to her mother's disgust. He's funny pathetic and just a bit creepy as a Romeo with romantic ideas way above his station!Binder's fine script gives this ensemble film the ballast that keeps you laughing and crying. He's found the emotional core in these character's lives and the pace of the film which clocks in at just under two hours provides a sense of completeness. Ultimately it is Costner's generosity as an actor that so disarms the viewer. In every shot Joan Allen's Terry is the riveting center with Costner playing to her every moment without stealing attention away from her. That earns my whole hearted respect. THE UPSIDE OF ANGER should be seen and savored by anyone who cares deeply about moves with something to say about the human condition. Binder's adroit direction makes this a film to set beside TERMS OF ENDEARMENT AS GOOD AS IT GETS and Lasse Hallstrom's vastly underrated SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. Finally it's such a pleasure to see two pros such as Allen and Costner hit it right out of the park!".

	schema:reviewBody "Life doesn't come with an instruction manual or a script to follow it's basically improv on a daily basis and as it plays out people and things often are not who or what they seem to be on the surface. It's reality as opposed to the way you expect hope or want it all to be truth as opposed to an individual perception of truth. That's life. And The Upside of Anger written and directed by Mike Binder explores some hard realities that differ drastically from expectations and perceptions.The film opens with a funeral a somber note which in a sense prepares you for what is to follow after a flash back of three years at which point the story begins. Terry Wolfmeyer Joan Allen is at loose ends because her husband has run off with his secretary leaving her and four daughters behind to fend for themselves. Angry distraught and a stone's throw from bitter Terry turns to alcohol to deaden the effects of what has been a lifealtering experience. Luckily or maybe not Terry has a neighbor Denny Davies Kevin Costner an expro baseball player turned radio talk show host with whom to share a drink and commiserate. Her daughters three teens and one in college are supportive as well to a point. But they are each in their own way also struggling to understand why their father deserted them. By all accounts this was in no way a dysfunctional angstridden family so the actions of their father is a mystery to them all. Naturally it's a pivotal point in their lives and before any of them can move on especially Terry they have to know why he did what he did. In the meantime with or without this needed closure life is happening to and around them.Binder who also appears in the film as the producer of Denny's radio show displays an astute knowledge of human nature with this film and how random the myriad twists and turns of life can be. He holds your attention from the opening scene who's funeral is it anyway? and just when you think you know where the story is going it takes an unexpected turn. And he is in no way attempting to manipulate his audience rather he is giving you a reflection of the way life so often simply does not go the way you think it's going to. It's a succinct look at relationships and of how fragile as well as resilient we all can be.As Terry Joan Allen sets vanity aside to create her character and turns in an Oscar caliber performance in doing so. When she gets up in the morning she looks like a middleaged woman with insufferable problems and a hangover a woman in the throes of coping with a traumatic experience who is desperate to reconnect with a life she no longer has and who will do anything within her power to hang on to what she has left. She's walking a tightrope over a deep abyss and she's understandably on edge so when one of her girls tugs the rope and compromises her control and security she quite naturally lashes out proving the old adage you always hurt the one you love. There's a scene in which a grieving Terry draws her hands to her breast and head lowered utters a cry and anyone who has ever known any kind of grief or loss in their life will at that moment know exactly what she is going through. It's a terrific piece of acting a performance that is altogether affecting and memorable.And as performances go Kevin Costner too puts vanity aside to create a character that is entirely convincing. Denny Davies is paunchy his hair is thin and most of the time he looks as though he's had one beer too many. Still he's engaging and you get the feeling there's a complex individual hiding behind an external simplicity that perhaps helps to mask his true feelings about a lot of things in his life including his career on the diamond. Why for example does he refuse to talk about baseball on his sports talk show? In it's purity this is arguably Costner's finest performance ever.Top notch performances are turned in as well by Erika Christensen Evan Rachel Wood Keri Russell and Alicia Witt as Terry's daughters respectively Andy Popeye Emily and Hadley and by Binder himself as Shep. In the end The Upside of Anger is an involving memorable film that celebrates life and leaves you with a sense of hope that no matter how bad things get we all have the capacity to get through it and somehow find the light at the end of the tunnel. And that's the magic of the movies.".

	schema:headline " The Joan Allen Show  highly recommended!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Upside of Anger showcases many good performances but make no mistake about it this movie's clearly the Joan Allen Show. And what a show she puts on.About an hour into the film Allen's Terry Wolfmeyer bursts into a room unannounced. Her reaction lasts just a few seconds but they're priceless. Writerdirector Mike Binder keeps the camera on Allen and what we get is a moment of sheer brilliance one that should be shown to all acting students.Binder does something awfully bold in this film. He lets his story revolve around two seemingly unlikable people  Terry and her neighbor Danny Davies Kevin Costner. They're two selfdestructive terribly selfish occasionally boorish people who wallow in their own pity. Terry's furious and hurt because her husband left her for his Swedish secretary while Danny's a former Detroit Tiger who now spends signing baseball memorabilia and running a radio talk show where he refuses to talk baseball.They find solace in each other not because they particularly like each other but because they each need a drinking buddy. But thanks to two very fine performances they're likable.Much to Binder's credit he doesn't simply settle his story on Terry and Danny. Wisely Binder lets his story take its time. We get to know Terry's children too. There's Andy Erika Christensen who's dating an older lech Shep Binder Popeye Evan Rachel Wood the youngest and budding filmmaker Emily Keri Russell who feels unloved and rebellious Hadley Alicia Witt. These young women have their own personalities and spending time with them makes the story richer.Costner is awfully comfortable playing Danny. In fact Danny is Crash Davis slightly older and a bit more cynical. Danny doesn't like clinging to his baseball past but he knows that's all he's got. It's nice to see Costner in these roles. He plays them better than most and it's a loose relaxed performance that never goes over the top.But the movie really is all about Allen. It's tough turning a selfdestructive and pitiful alcoholic into someone we want to spend time with. But Allen simply sparkles in the role. She's smart quickwitted and fraying at the edges trying to keep her wits about her. We not only understand her rollercoaster emotions but also find them believable. Performances like hers are truly rare and Allen does nothing wrong here.Had this film been released last year Hilary Swank might very well not have walked away with her second Academy Award. Not only does Allen deserve a nomination for her remarkable performance in this film she also probably deserves to win it.What surprising about Binder's story is that despite all its warmth and humor there's still a very nice and unexpectedly dark edge to it all. It's refreshing to see a film where the characters and the situations aren't exactly all that rosy. And even moments that could have easily been played for their melodrama are brilliantly underplayed and toned down. They work much better this way than having characters resort to histrionics.The film's voiceover narration on the other hand gets a bit preachy. And a revelation at the end is a bit questionable. Astute viewers would figure it out because that's really the only rational way to deal with it. Binder sort of lets us in on it very early on in the film.We never get to see the title's real meaning in this film. That presumably comes after the end credits and all these characters get on with their lives. Nevertheless The Upside of Anger is a good film studded with a great performance by one of today's finest actresses.".

And what a show she puts on.About an hour into the film Allen's Terry Wolfmeyer bursts into a room unannounced. Her reaction lasts just a few seconds but they're priceless. Writerdirector Mike Binder keeps the camera on Allen and what we get is a moment of sheer brilliance one that should be shown to all acting students.Binder does something awfully bold in this film. He lets his story revolve around two seemingly unlikable people  Terry and her neighbor Danny Davies Kevin Costner. They're two selfdestructive terribly selfish occasionally boorish people who wallow in their own pity. Terry's furious and hurt because her husband left her for his Swedish secretary while Danny's a former Detroit Tiger who now spends signing baseball memorabilia and running a radio talk show where he refuses to talk baseball.They find solace in each other not because they particularly like each other but because they each need a drinking buddy. But thanks to two very fine performances they're likable.Much to Binder's credit he doesn't simply settle his story on Terry and Danny. Wisely Binder lets his story take its time. We get to know Terry's children too. There's Andy Erika Christensen who's dating an older lech Shep Binder Popeye Evan Rachel Wood the youngest and budding filmmaker Emily Keri Russell who feels unloved and rebellious Hadley Alicia Witt. These young women have their own personalities and spending time with them makes the story richer.Costner is awfully comfortable playing Danny. In fact Danny is Crash Davis slightly older and a bit more cynical. Danny doesn't like clinging to his baseball past but he knows that's all he's got. It's nice to see Costner in these roles. He plays them better than most and it's a loose relaxed performance that never goes over the top.But the movie really is all about Allen. It's tough turning a selfdestructive and pitiful alcoholic into someone we want to spend time with. But Allen simply sparkles in the role. She's smart quickwitted and fraying at the edges trying to keep her wits about her. We not only understand her rollercoaster emotions but also find them believable. Performances like hers are truly rare and Allen does nothing wrong here.Had this film been released last year Hilary Swank might very well not have walked away with her second Academy Award. Not only does Allen deserve a nomination for her remarkable performance in this film she also probably deserves to win it.What surprising about Binder's story is that despite all its warmth and humor there's still a very nice and unexpectedly dark edge to it all. It's refreshing to see a film where the characters and the situations aren't exactly all that rosy. And even moments that could have easily been played for their melodrama are brilliantly underplayed and toned down. They work much better this way than having characters resort to histrionics.The film's voiceover narration on the other hand gets a bit preachy. And a revelation at the end is a bit questionable. Astute viewers would figure it out because that's really the only rational way to deal with it. Binder sort of lets us in on it very early on in the film.We never get to see the title's real meaning in this film. That presumably comes after the end credits and all these characters get on with their lives. Nevertheless The Upside of Anger is a good film studded with a great performance by one of today's finest actresses.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this when it premiered at the Sundance film festival although the director  actors didn't bother to come to our screening and I enjoyed it. Kevin Costner plays a baseball player but the movie is not about baseball it deals with the anger the lead character feels when her husband disappears along with his secretary. Joan Allen plays the wife of the missing man and is the mother to four daughters played very well by Evan Rachel Wood Keri Russel Erika Christensen and Alicia Witt. Joan Allen was marvelous. We laughed many times when she glared in anger at different characters in the movie and we were glad she wasn't mad at US! LOL... I have not been a big fan of Kevin Costner in recent years but thought that he did a great job as the man who helps Joan Allen's character pick up the pieces. The writerdirector also has a role in the film as an older man who dates Joan Allen's daughter. I thought the message of the film was delivered well and it was an entertaining story. There is a twist at the end that I truly did not see coming. I don't think it spoiled the movie it was just unexpected.".

Each character was developed uniquely with many different layers. Each character was matched by strong up and coming and veteran actors. Joan Allen as usual is a gem and proves that mainstream Hollywood is missing one of the great female leads of our time. Kevin Costner sticks out and steals the show. He's quirky but real and perfectly lovable. All the girls although they did not get enough screen time were capable exceptional actors with a bright future in front of them all. Especially the youngest daughter played by Evan Rachel Wood. This is a rare comedy that must be seen. Although the average American may find it slow with it's absence of car chases and sword fights one can only hope that this movie will find it's audience and grow enough to fall into the laps of the average and broaden their minds.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mike Binder both wrote and directed this searingly important film important for its concept for its ensemble acting and for performances by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner that are now the gold standard for the year by which all other award quality performances must be judged.Anger and how it paralyzes our emotional outlook and alters our perception of reality and works to destroy those around us is the harsh subject of this examination of a welltodo family of husband wife and four teenage daughters. The story is narrated by the youngest daughter Lavender 'Popeye' Wolfmeyer Evan Rachel Wood and never were the words 'out of the mouth of babes' so pertinent. The mother Terry Joan Allen is introduced drunk constantly in her nightgown with glass of vodka in hand and she pretty has spent her days in that manner since her husband Grey 'left her with his 22yearold Swedish office girl' without a note a call or confrontation with his family. Terry is consumed with anger self pity loathing and barely manages to maintain a household completely relying on her four daughters to cook clean shop etc while she finds reasons to berate them for every act and motivation the girls show. Hadley Alicia Witt is the oldest and enamored with a boy Terry considers a waste of time. Andy Erica Christensen doesn't want to go to college but to become a reporter instead  a fact Terry refuses to consider. Emily Keri Russell prefers to follow her dream of becoming a ballet dancer and attending an Arts College that of course Terry refuses to allow. Popeye the youngest is hungry for belonging and wants desperately to be noticed by not only her mother but by boys etc.A neighbor Denny Davies Kevin Costner is an alcoholic exbaseball hero who now has a cheesy but popular radio talk show produced by his buddy Shep Mike Binder yes the writerdirector!. Denny has been friends of the Wolfmeyers for years and shows up drunk warmly offering himself as a drinking partner to Terry. The two spend their time drinking and watching television and watching the daughters each arrive at crises Hadley gets pregnant and announces her engagement to Terry after everyone else knows rage from Terry and an embarrassing scene at Hadley's announcement dinner. Andy gets a job at Denny's radio show only to fall into bed with the lothario Shep rage and a public fight from Terry. Emily somaticizes her career frustration and ends up in a hospital with an ulcer selfpity and depression from Terry. Denny slowly works his way into Terry's bed and become a surrogate fatherlover to these five fatherhusbanddeserted women. The ending is a shocker and cannot be revealed because it would destroy the fine story line of the film. But it begins as it ends and that is the part that leaves the audience aghast that they didn't suspect that turn of event.Binder's script and direction achieve the impossible he is able to create a family in disarray deal with every aspect of anger desertion family ties motherdaughter love though severely tested the needs of the 'victim' and how they can be tended. Amazingly he does this with a large does of comedy acerbic dialogue restrained responses and a keen grasp of reality that makes this a film about a tough subject one that is engrossing and never offputting.The entire cast is pitch perfect each of the actors who portray the daughters is exceptional. But the brilliance that radiates from the screen is the triumphant performance by Joan Allen. She inhabits Terry and despite the fact that she has every reason to make us loathe her character she manages to keep her portrayal so sensitively nuanced that we stay close to her in this journey. She is simply amazing in her body language her understanding of alcoholic behavior patterns and her internalization of her needs at the expense of her eversurfacing rage. Much the same can be said for Kevin Costner who gives the finest performance of his career in a role that could be pathetic and negative in the hands of a less capable actor. His comedic talents shine but not at the expense of his enormous sensitivity to the five women with whom he ends up living.Alexandre Desplat has once again created a movie score that has perfectly beautiful passages of music while always underlining the story appropriately. The cinematography by Richard Greatrex finds the perfect vantages that seem like windows in the hearts of each of the participants in the story. Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "After her performance in The Ice Storm it is no surprise that Joan Allen could carry a movie like The Upside of Anger. Nor was it a surprise that she and Alicia Witt could beautifully play off each other in their confrontational mother and daughter roles. What did surprise was that the film featured equally strong performances from the other members of the cast. Even writerdirector Mike Binder does a fine onscreen job as a slimy but not entirely unsympathetic radio producer. Kevin Costner would be wise to stay with this type of role and with comedy instead of bigbudget epic stuff.The casting of Witt with Erika Christensen Evan Rachel Wood and Keri Russell as the four sisters was inspired. It was refreshing just to see a film family that looked enough alike physically to actually be related to each other. Since Christensen looks so much like Julia Stiles they could have even added a fifth sister although their resemblance is so strong that it might be confusing. All the subtle birth order distinctions felt right. The oldest Witt was the most connected to mom even though it did not appear so on the surface. The second Christensenwho absolutely glows on the screen was determined to be different than her older sister. The third Russell was the most connected to the father missed him the most and had the least understanding of the mother. The youngest Wood was way ahead of the curve and the most perceptive character in the film. Watch for all this stuff because it is there and watch how no matter how down the mother becomes she continues to monitor the welfare of her daughters.Binder gave into the temptation to use cheesy special effect gimmicks several times the explosion at the dinner table the neighborhood transition from summer to winter the ballet fantasy and the daughters growing older during the funeral scene. Although done well they seemed out of place. Also Binder should review the Kent State shootings there were four students killednot six.There is a spectacular shot at the wedding. Beginning as an over the shoulder shot of Hadley Witt sucking in her plump cheeks the camera pans slightly right and moves toward the wedding party as the focus changes to bring them out of a blur.The film's ironic twist in the last 15 minutes is borrowed wholesale from Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice. I particularly liked Wood's beautiful narration which helped clarify the title and theme necessary or at least helpful after this ironic story line twist. She managed to sound both detached and involved it is actually the voiceover for her broadcasting class project. When we are suddenly forced to reevaluate everything that has gone before in what we thought was just an interesting comedy Wood steps in and steers us to internalize the theme. They go out on a shot of Wood looking up from her Mac and smiling. Amazing.This is the best of Binder's writing Anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks. That's what I know now. It needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers. It's real though the fury even when it isn't. It can change you turn you mold you and shape you into something you're not. The only upside of anger then is the person you become hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they're not afraid of its journey. Someone that knows that the truth is at best a partially told story. That anger like growth comes in spurts and fits and in its wake leaves a new chance of acceptance and the promise of calm.The Upside of Anger is one of those rare films that I believe everyone should make an effort to connect with doing so will make you a better person. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Upside of Anger opens at a scene from the end of a movie a scene that stays in the audience's mind making us trying to guess its cause all the way through the movie.

Terry's husband has just recently left the family causing Terry to spiral into alcohol and bitterness. Along comes Denny Davies an exbaseball player current radio show host and Terry's neighbor. He too is a fan of the drink and strikes a friendship with Terry along with a fatherly role for her daughters. At its root it's Terry's story about how she deals with the continuous growing of her relationships of her daughters and of herself.Mike Binder the writer and director has a great way of showing the lives of all his characters. He is able to make this movie just as life really is its funny depressing uplifting bittersweet and sometimes tragic. He seems to be able to capture real life on camera and display it with all its truth and realism. The writing is completely intelligent hilarious writing is mixed with scenes of great emotion. Binder never relies on action or dialogue that will cue laughter or tears it comes naturally through the writing. It works differently for every person in the audience.Joan Allen is fabulous as the angry mother Terry. Her performance contains each the real emotion of a mother with all that she is dealing with. She plays it with vigor that strikes that fear in us that we all know mothers can emit but we also see her lighter funny side. Kevin Costner does very well as Denny who surprise surprise is a baseball player. His performance is hilarious as the washed up player who beams an empathetic hippie attitude. Costner in his first good and wellwritten role in a while is a relief to have. Also hilarious is Director Mike Bender's Shep Denny's radio show producer. The four daughters also add four different personalities to the family that interact very nicely.The Upside of Anger is a wonderfully acted movie and what's more it is superbly written. It captures a true essence of family life. And while its hilarious it's a refreshing kind of humor that is very mature and not based on the stupidity that many people think we want to see. Mike Binder is successful at making a movie about the characters and about life that actually does a good job at representing both things. Upside of Anger gets 5 stars out of 5".

So the inevitable question is the movie built around her worth watching?Eh not really. But before I move on to the movie's structural faults it's worth considering that another of the movie's faults just might be Allen's scenestealing scenerychewing performance. Perhaps illadvisedly encouraged by writerdirector Mike Binder Allen  the actress  behaves just as ungenerously to her fellow actors as the matriarch behaves towards her fictional daughters and other satellites like Kevin Costner's easygoing codependent neighbor. This is a shame because the supporting cast Evan Rachel Wood Erika Christensen Alicia Witt and Keri Russell as the daughters along with Costner and Binder are quite charming and good in the film they deserve better than to primarily exist as scratchingposts for the matriarch's petulance. Allen's character while successfully conveying the distracted apportionment of caregiving and overall rearing to each of her kids each of whom are pretty individualized within the script's cramped parameters is on the other hand too domineering to make us really like her. Evan Rachel Wood continually narrates that her mother used to be a sweettempered person but any evidence of sweetness left over from the past 50odd years is lacking. And LIKING her it seems to me would be a prerequisite in a movie like this which after all is said and done is little more than an upscale Lifetime movie with a sprinkle of WoodyAllenian angst over it. Otherwise we'll feel too encouraged to cheer when Costner breaks down her bathroom door after enduring one of her typical lacerating monologues. We'll perhaps feel a little too triumphant when Binder's character  a sleazy radio talkshow producer egregiously dating one of Allen's daughters  lays out to her in no uncertain terms why he's bedding the kid instead of her. Allen defeated skulks over to the bar and falls off the wagon. But after all The Upside of Anger comes from the mind of The Mind of the Married Man the aborted HBO comedy show that has become almost legendary for the misogyny cloaked under its middlebrow sophistication. Misogyny and middlebrow sophistication are certainly among THIS movie's problems. Binder's final insight seems to be menopausal women can be grouchy!  but they might get over it after awhile as long as there's a nonthreatening doofus e.g. Costner's former jock around who understands which one of them is wearing the proverbial pants. I suspect men will like this movie far more than they'll admit to as it confirms their own opinions about uppity middleaged rich broads. Imagine dating columnist Maureen Dowd!  every man's worst nightmare. Clever women will probably glean what Binder's up to and therefore will not be fooled.A final thought Binder clearly doesn't know anything about the milieu of which he writes. You'll note that Allen has no ladyfriends in the film there are no socials at the country club no FriendsoftheLibrary gatherings no slightlyLeftofCenter political Meetups. She's utterly without society apart from her daughters and newfound drinking buddy Costner. This is all rather unlikely for a suburban duchess living in the genteel outskirts of Old Money Detroit. Even more unlikely of course is her nervous breakdown upon discovering that her husband has dumped her for his Swedish secretary. Quite apart from the knowledge that any divorce proceedings would be a slamdunk in her favor her new liberation would be far more joyful than Binder's married mind suspects. Or fears. In other words it's not entirely clear what the hell this woman is so angry about gorgeous house four beautiful daughters obliging hunk lots of money. Given the current circumstances of the world the problems presented here amount to a really small hill of beans.3 stars out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is quite possibly the worst movie of the last decade. Six hateful spiteful characters with nothing to teach us no wisdom to share no insights to illuminate. Just vitriol and anger.Do we really need to see 130 minutes of Joan Allen snipping at everyone that gets in the way of her broodfest? Don't we get that she's bitter and resentful after the first few scenes? Don't we understand the level of her bitchiness is deep and the repercussions for trying to bring her out of her dark place are severe? So what if her husband left her for a Sweedish dish why do I care? I never cared. Quite frankly I would have left her for an ugly Romanian charwoman. I've never seen a story filled with more rudderless losers. I think you could go to an AA meeting and have more fun. Hell a funeral would be a comparative hoot.What's worse however is that this movie tries to pass itself off as some sort of social commentary on the human condition. It thinks it knows something or has something to say. Unless that message is people are bitter angry people that suck and when bad things happen to them they suck even more and can't pull themselves out of a death spiral even after three long boring years of drinking and hatred then fine I guess it has a message. Worse still is that a lot of people are buying it. Look at some of the comments on this site. So let me help you... it's crap. Don't pretend it's something that it's not. Dark films with points have their place but this isn't one of them. This is a dark POINTLESS film. Full of sound and fury... and all that. The characters too don't have any pearls of wisdom to offer us. They walk around drunk high or stupid the entire time. They don't even have reasons for doing what they do they all of a sudden just do things. For example when Joan's character gives up drinking for a brief moment. Why? No explanation. Or when Costner's character confronts writer actor doofus radio producer Shep about sleeping with Allen's daughter and says I should have stopped you earlier. Oh wow how powerful. Yeah but that would have made you interesting. And who would have wanted that?But don't despair all is not lost. Some fun can be had if you are drugged and forced to go see this... abomination. You can try to spot the hundreds of continuity problems. Here are a few to get you started a dog that appears out of nowhere a bedroom that gets a makeover halfway through characters that appear and then disappear for no reason seasons that change on a schedule unfamiliar with the pattern established over the last hundred million years or so... and my favorite a man who can fall into a hole die and while dead cover himself up with boards. Nice.The bottom line if you waste your money on this film there will be one more angry person out there and there is no upside to that.".

There are a couple of lines of dialogue that ring true and a couple of scenes that work really well but the true moments are awash in a movie so crass exploitative and phony it made me cringe.Mike Binder the filmmaker earned a lot of brownie points for making a movie about a woman over forty starring an actress over forty Joan Allen.But Binder is sure to surround Allen with a bevy of young beauties. Somehow this woman had four daughters who always look like they are posing for the cover of Seventeen magazine. Every one  one a blonde one a brunette one a redhead  is in every scene provocatively dressed perfectly coiffed and without a single zit. Tell me in how many families with that many teenagers can you find not a single pimple or kid who's too skinny or too fat or too shy or too loud or who moves awkwardly? Feh.Joan Allen bears about as much relation to a real woman over forty as Mickey bears to a real mouse. She drinks alcoholically and yet never has puffy eyes or sallow skin. After relying on alcohol for months she just one day quits with no addictive kickback. I don't think so.Oh and the day her husband disappears an incredibly attractive man  Kevin Costner!  throws himself at her. Oh yeah this happens to every newly single woman over forty with four kids. In Fantasyland! And after her husband disappears she never does a thing to attempt to contact him but somehow his money continues to support her lifestyle which is just a bit short of a Donald Trump style life. Where is all that cash coming from? Sure this is a movie and movies aren't supposed to be real. But this movie advertises itself as a film that takes on tough problems. There should be a word for this  advertising your film as a film that addresses alcohol abuse the loneliness of an abandoned older mother suddenly finding oneself single  and then lies about every one of those important issues.there are a couple of good scenes that just make everything around them look more like drek. An older nebbishy character Mike Binder the filmmaker also plays a small part in the movie tells Joan Allen exactly why he chases younger women. His point is a valid one and that scene deserves to be in a better movie.Throughout the movie Joan Allen plays a self absorbed ice shrew who deals with life and loved ones by pouring herself a stiff drink sitting around in her negligee and refusing to speak while shooting death rays with her eyes. This is never believable because we all know and love Joan Allen and she's the star of the movie so we keep waiting for her to show what a great gal she really is at heart.Kevin Costner though reaches a point where he won't put up with this any more and he emphatically tells her I'm tired of being your bitch. This is an electric scene and it very much deserves to be in a much better braver grittier funnier tougher movie.Finally the last act offers a surprise ending that makes everything that came before it cheaper and utterly unbelievable.Given the great cast here and the good intentions somewhere in here there is a good movie dying to get out. Sadly it never quite does.You almost want the cast to reassemble at some point in the future and try again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!! You call this anger??? You call this Transformation??? Anger is paying 8 bucks to see a film about the transformative power of anger and sitting for two hours watching Joan Allen give a stupefying performance as a boring selfindulgent housewife. What an utterly pedestrian take on anger! First as far as anger goes Terry seemed angry in a way only identifiable to a very sheltered WASPy class of people. I did not come away from this film understanding anything more about WASPy anger or the social pressures of conformity felt by upper class women or the challenges faced by women sheltered by marriage. What I did understand was that it's apparently quite easy to shock and offend people in Bloomfield simply by being snappish and socially inappropriate. Wow how outrageous! Oh that crazy angry Terry Wolfmeyer! How absurd! Secondly the film's fatal mistake was opening after the Wolfmeyer's marriage had apparently dissolved and Terry was already angryor grouchy as the case may be. Terry's transformation through angerthe entire premise of the filmwas left entirely to the pithy narration of the daughter My Mom had always been the nicest person really. Really??? How so??? How did she change??? How was she different by the end of the film??? Give me something to go on!! Narration is not a substitute for plotit's a weak copout. Just tell the audience the story instead of actually developing a script that demonstrates it. Thirdly I have to take issue with the way in which Shepthe only really noble honest character in this filmwas shabbily dismissed. Denny who had hooked up with his friend's wife a week after the marriage broke up physically attacked his friend Shep for making the most ambiguous possible pass at Terry weeks after she and Denny had split. What a hypocritical plot device! Shep was raked over the coals throughout the film for being an older and unattractive man who liked young womenOhhh how disgusting! How vile! What a bad bad man! Bad to whom??? Shep was honest about who he was and what motivated him and he didn't care what people thought about him. And he was the only character in this film who consistently stood up to Terry's whiny childish behavior. He should have slapped her! She deserved it! I supposed by the end of the film the audience was supposed to share Denny's righteous angerbut truthfully Denny just came off as a possessive hypocritical lout. I thought liking Kevin Costner's character in a film was too good to be trueand I was right. Basically this film seems to have been made exclusively for an audience of highly repressed selfinvolved suburban middle aged women.

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!! You call this anger??? You call this Transformation??? Anger is paying 8 bucks to see a film about the transformative power of anger and sitting for two hours watching Joan Allen give a stupefying performance as a boring selfindulgent housewife. What an utterly pedestrian take on anger! First as far as anger goes Terry seemed angry in a way only identifiable to a very sheltered WASPy class of people. I did not come away from this film understanding anything more about WASPy anger or the social pressures of conformity felt by upper class women or the challenges faced by women sheltered by marriage. What I did understand was that it's apparently quite easy to shock and offend people in Bloomfield simply by being snappish and socially inappropriate. Wow how outrageous! Oh that crazy angry Terry Wolfmeyer! How absurd! Secondly the film's fatal mistake was opening after the Wolfmeyer's marriage had apparently dissolved and Terry was already angryor grouchy as the case may be. Terry's transformation through angerthe entire premise of the filmwas left entirely to the pithy narration of the daughter My Mom had always been the nicest person really. Really??? How so??? How did she change??? How was she different by the end of the film??? Give me something to go on!! Narration is not a substitute for plotit's a weak copout. Just tell the audience the story instead of actually developing a script that demonstrates it. Thirdly I have to take issue with the way in which Shepthe only really noble honest character in this filmwas shabbily dismissed. Denny who had hooked up with his friend's wife a week after the marriage broke up physically attacked his friend Shep for making the most ambiguous possible pass at Terry weeks after she and Denny had split. What a hypocritical plot device! Shep was raked over the coals throughout the film for being an older and unattractive man who liked young womenOhhh how disgusting! How vile! What a bad bad man! Bad to whom??? Shep was honest about who he was and what motivated him and he didn't care what people thought about him. And he was the only character in this film who consistently stood up to Terry's whiny childish behavior. He should have slapped her! She deserved it! I supposed by the end of the film the audience was supposed to share Denny's righteous angerbut truthfully Denny just came off as a possessive hypocritical lout. I thought liking Kevin Costner's character in a film was too good to be trueand I was right. Basically this film seems to have been made exclusively for an audience of highly repressed selfinvolved suburban middle aged women. There was a really annoying wink and a nod quality to the dilemmas faced by Terrysomething I felt completely alienated by.The only Upside of this film is the fact that it'll make a great contribution to the Lifetime network's menu of pithy suburban drama. But I'll take real anger thank you very much.";

This one was memorable. The movie spoke of relationships emotion perseverance humor tolerance and of course anger. This movie was a near masterpiece really. The performances were terrific by all the females especially Joan Allen. The script was terrific and the directing was top notch too. Kudos to Mike Binder!!All people have shitty things happen to them...that's a fact. The lesson in the movie is that the important thing is how do we deal with those shitty things. We can choose alcohol we can choose anger we can choose to hurt those we love. But eventually we will chose happiness despite all the mayhem life throws our way. Happiness is a relative term. I loved the fact that there were many things about Terry Joan Allen that I didn't like yet I still liked her enough to be sympathetic towards her. I don't cry that easily during movies but this one brought the Kleenex out twice. I am a guy and I am aware that tears are very therapeutic. A good cry is awesome..if it's real. Many things have been said about the ending but watch it for yourself. I have no problems at all with the ending. See this movie I dare you not to like it.".

Poisons his children into believing her horribly wrong assumption. Destroys his reputation by telling everyone she knows what she wants people to believe he did to her.She is so selfcentered she doesn't even know if her husband exists. She slaps her daughters boyfriend because her trust issues run so deep she has uncontrolled violence towards men. The man didn't strike back which was a joke.The romance with the neighbor is a joke. The woman is so vile no selfrespecting man would go near her. She offers absolutely nothing. She disrespects every male within hearing distant.She is a contradiction. She wants her children to go to college but doesn't bother asking them. She is so selfcentered she couldn't possibly care about her children.The worst moment in the film was when she lead her children to announce they hate their father. And worse yet the kids all girls readily accepts this garbage. I guess father's rank right up there with dog poo.The second worst moment in the film was after the funeral the witch and her brood are sitting at a picnic table with the witch's boyfriend and they start laughing and smiling all gay and happy confirming the father was indeed dog poo. Yes folks. Not a tear in site for dear old dad who died and was forgotten quicker than they could get our of the funeral attire.The men are dog poo the women are selfcentered selfrighteous witches and the children are dumb as logs.So if that sounds interesting to you then watch the movie.

She does a lot of yelling at her daughters and using alcohol as crutches for the grief she is feeling.The mother has several exchanges of dialogue with eldest second and third daughters...but did mother and youngest daughter ever have a conversation?

The main culprit was not Joan but the horrendous dialogue she had to work with in this wretched film.What a shame since the cast was excellent! At some point the writer Binder should have decided whether this film was to be a comedy or a drama. As it turned out there was no grounding in reality and no credibility in the scenes situations and dramatic moments. All of the actors drifted through this film on autopilot because of the incoherent screenplay.In the main family there were four sensitive wellmannered and mature daughters and a mother who could well be classified as insane by any standards. It made no sense that the daughters would not stand up to their mother during her bouts of bad behavior. It stretched credibility as well that Kevin Costner's character would want to spend a minute of his life in such an unhealthy atmosphere as his neighbor's home.Joan Allen's character was so selfcentered and meanspirited that I had to go back in my mind to a film called Beaches to find an equally repellent screen matriarch. In The Upside of Anger her character kicks her drinking habit. Unfortunately there was no reforming of her shrewish narcissistic personality.This was the film that would never end!".

At some point the writer Binder should have decided whether this film was to be a comedy or a drama. As it turned out there was no grounding in reality and no credibility in the scenes situations and dramatic moments. All of the actors drifted through this film on autopilot because of the incoherent screenplay.In the main family there were four sensitive wellmannered and mature daughters and a mother who could well be classified as insane by any standards. It made no sense that the daughters would not stand up to their mother during her bouts of bad behavior. It stretched credibility as well that Kevin Costner's character would want to spend a minute of his life in such an unhealthy atmosphere as his neighbor's home.Joan Allen's character was so selfcentered and meanspirited that I had to go back in my mind to a film called Beaches to find an equally repellent screen matriarch. In The Upside of Anger her character kicks her drinking habit. Unfortunately there was no reforming of her shrewish narcissistic personality.This was the film that would never end!";

Yet this is a misleading beginning for a film that progresses into a thoroughly surprising and superior tale of a husband's desperate search for his seemingly dead wife.Canet executes the setup for his tale beautifully placing his couple stark naked lakeside and under the moonlight to emphasize the sheer indulgence of their love. Then with little dialogue he changes the tone from romanticism to blinding horror as Alexandre Francois Cluzet hears a scream and tries in vain to save his wife Margot Josee Croze but is beaten over the head by her attacker.The casting of this couple was crucial as for all its twists and turns what follows is essentially their love story and neither Cluzet nor Croze disappointthe latter possessing a perfect vulnerable quality akin to Naomi Watts in 'King Kong'. However it is to Cluzet that we owe such an absorbing tale of grief and that false friend memory.As we flash forward eight years he conveys sometimes only through his eyes the everpresent grief ready to resurface as soon as his wife's name is mentioned. And this being a thriller her name is mentioned pretty quickly in the form of an email plunging the audience into a taut whodunitwhat really happenedwho's hiding something tale the answer being of course everyone. And what a terrific supporting cast we are treated with Margot's father Andre Dussollier effortlessly conveys equal parts frustration and resolute duty while one cut to Jean Rochefort's brooding and wrinkled face alerts the audience to all the pain of his past. Kristin Scott Thomas is possibly even more captivating in French and her poise and cheekbones seem to be a natural marriage with the language and Parisian backdrop. . Canet uses this midsummer Paris to his full advantage to turn up the heat on his fevered search notably in a touching scene where Alex is racing through the sweltering streets with a giant dog.An innocent man declares Alex's lawyer does not run. Whathas she not seen 'The Fugitive'? In any case thank goodness in this circumstance he does as these provide the most compelling scenes in which even Alex crossing a motorway becomes a thing of beauty.What keeps us gripped though is that we actually care about these characters and their fateabout what really happened that night which is possibly why I put up with a slightly indulgent confession scene and despite the fact that this thriller utterly surpassed most of the usual Hollywood offerings I found myself craving what Tinsel Town does best a happy ending. 45".

	schema:headline " frantic intelligent and exciting what more do you want?";
	schema:reviewBody "Tell Noone is the debut feature from Guillaume Canet a guy arguably best known outside of France for being that bloke in The Beach who shouts Francoise! a lot. While he may not have seemed to be up to much then judging from this stunning adaptation of Harlan Coben's novel of the same name he certainly is now.Tell Noone is the story of Dr. Alexander Beck a man who gets an email from his wife. Boring you say? Beck's wife was killed eight years ago in an attack that left him in a sense lucky to be alive. The email instructs him to tell noone and with nobody to turn to Beck throws himself into a desperate search for the woman he loved and lost.What follows is arguably a typical array of thriller conventions the secrets the lies and the inevitable betrayals but what sets this movie apart is its pacing. Canet sheds some of Coben's superfluous subplots which ramps the tempo up so effectively that you soon forget that it's all in French. The move from the States to France also works in its favour especially for foreign markets as in the UK  US as it makes the movie feel edgier and more unfamiliar than a standard American copchase movie. The combination of these factors give Tell Noone a freshness and intelligence that a lot of modern thrillers are lacking.The quality of the acting especially from Cluzet and the dialogue no doubt helped by Coben's writing keeps the story believable as everyman Beck races ever closer to the truth and to round it off the score is great too with clever use of familiar tracks to help keep the audience somewhat comfortable as Beck's search becomes more and more dangerous.Tell Noone may sound like another average thriller but its pacing and finesse place it head and shoulders above the rest of the crowd.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tell Noone is the debut feature from Guillaume Canet a guy arguably best known outside of France for being that bloke in The Beach who shouts Francoise! a lot. While he may not have seemed to be up to much then judging from this stunning adaptation of Harlan Coben's novel of the same name he certainly is now.Tell Noone is the story of Dr. Alexander Beck a man who gets an email from his wife. Boring you say? Beck's wife was killed eight years ago in an attack that left him in a sense lucky to be alive. The email instructs him to tell noone and with nobody to turn to Beck throws himself into a desperate search for the woman he loved and lost.What follows is arguably a typical array of thriller conventions the secrets the lies and the inevitable betrayals but what sets this movie apart is its pacing. Canet sheds some of Coben's superfluous subplots which ramps the tempo up so effectively that you soon forget that it's all in French. The move from the States to France also works in its favour especially for foreign markets as in the UK  US as it makes the movie feel edgier and more unfamiliar than a standard American copchase movie. The combination of these factors give Tell Noone a freshness and intelligence that a lot of modern thrillers are lacking.The quality of the acting especially from Cluzet and the dialogue no doubt helped by Coben's writing keeps the story believable as everyman Beck races ever closer to the truth and to round it off the score is great too with clever use of familiar tracks to help keep the audience somewhat comfortable as Beck's search becomes more and more dangerous.Tell Noone may sound like another average thriller but its pacing and finesse place it head and shoulders above the rest of the crowd.";

	schema:reviewBody "You really have to concentrate in order to follow everything that happens in Tell No One. Unless you have an attentive friend who comes along with you to the movie theater and who you're counting on to tell you who's who and what's what then I suggest seeing the film one more time. The question remains is it worth seeing a second time? Yes but only if you're willing to accept all the contrived goingson.Dr. Alexandre Beck and his beautiful wife Margot go up to their summer house where she is murdered. Flash forward to eight years in the future when two bodies are discovered near the crime scene and the case is reopened. Meanwhile Dr. Beck receives an email with an attached video that suggests his wife is still alive. I'm not going to go into all the details of the plot since it would take too long to explain everything that happens. But it seems to me that the problem with the film is that there are too many scenes that don't add up.One big problem is the identification of Dr. Beck's wife. Her father a former police inspector is called upon to identify the body. They take his word for it and no further inquiries are made regarding the the true identity of the victim. As far as I'm aware eight years ago DNA testing was in existence so why wasn't a DNA test conducted on the body right then and there? The father's blood could have been used and they would have seen right away that the victim was in fact a prostitute and not Dr. Beck's wife. Even if you buy that there's the whole issue of Dr. Beck's pal from the other side of the tracks. He owes the good doctor after Beck diagnoses his son as a hemophiliac and saves him from mistreatment at the hospital. Wherever Dr. Beck goes his hiphop friend is there to save him even at the point where some professional assassins have kidnapped Dr. Beck and tied him up inside a van. Out of nowhere he's plucked from certain doom and some of the assassins are easily dispatched. Even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief again there's the whole matter of Margot disappearing for eight years and then suddenly deciding to contact her husband after so much time. We're told that Margot's father tells her that Alexandre is dead. Even if she's in another country presumably Brazil is it likely that she never once decided to google information about her husband or the murder case? She would have found out right away that her husband was still alive and that her father had lied to her. Thus she certainly would have then attempted to contact her husband soon after the murder.While I liked the mogul Neuville as the main antagonist his character needed a lot more development. That goes double for the shadowy assassins he hires to bump off anyone connected with the murder of his son. Tell No One is an absorbing film and keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end. But when all the loose ends are tied up it doesn't add up. Nonetheless if you're willing to be a little forgiving as to the plot contrivances you will find this film to be highly entertaining.".

The viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours only to have Margo's father explain everything to Alex very late in the film. To make matters worse the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to have the basic mystery solved but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about involving Alex's father!.There's some serious motivation issues with characters also. Margo's father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is over. Why didn't he just kill Philippe's father and be done with it? Instead a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years including the completely innocent photographer who gets murdered by Philippe's father's thugs. Although Alex is a doctor whom one would think is relatively bright he chooses to flee the police during which he not only endangers his own life but those whom he involves in a nasty pileup on the freeway. Why was Margo's friend so keen on keeping her promise to Margo once all the crap hits the fan for Alex? And are we to think that Margo's father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison? What about his wife? Did he consider her wishes? Those are some of the main problems.Then there are some nasty details like why was her father there the night of her faked death? How did he get a hold of the junkie's body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two? Alex's friend Bruno seems overeager to be part of the mayhem in which he and his friends have to kill for Alex notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes Alex for saving his son's life. What good would the photos of Margo do? They don't implicate Philippe at all. And why would Margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her wouldbe abductors to take? Did I miss some other things? Probably. Minor irritations of mine include the fact that although Alex is a doctor he smokes like a fiend. Which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive. Also when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer neither of them is wearing a seat belt.

	schema:reviewBody "This very powerful and high energy film combines American style thrills with European quality acting. The protagonist is perfectly believable in type of role Alfred Hitcock used to cast Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart in  an everyman trapped in a nightmare and finding an inner strength he never knew he had to allow him to become a hero. Ironically in the end we realize that he was never the hero of the story at all that in fact he has been nothing more than a puppet in a play managed by other apparently peripheral characters. That ahha moment is well worth the price of admission. My only complaint is that the film struggles a little too hard to incorporate the plot elements of what was apparently a very complex novel so that near the end it seems to speed up to try to tie together all the many different loose ends. As a consequence some people may not fully grasp the full complexity of the very busy plot at the first sitting. Nevertheless it is a very powerful feature film which fully deserves a big splashy Hollywood style promotion in the U.S.".

No one else saw the body? 4. Can a police officer really believe a person would allow himself to be hurt enough to be in a coma for 3 days to avert suspicion? 5. A sister remains mum despite the wife's 'murder' when she could have a crucial info? And why involve the sister really why couldn't the father have taken the pics?? After all this was after she had killed the guy so why involve anybody else who will be suspicious immediately! 6. And how did the wife set up an untraceable email account? 7. And really wouldn't the info with that kid come to light during the inquest? Like we are letting this kid off the hook since he was sleeping with this lady even if it was made up? After all a very prominent guy has been murdered one would think the reason exonerating the prime suspect would hardly remain hidden. And so on...really nothing adds up in the end...".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to see how it can be done but only so often do we get some good 'knockoffs' of Hitchcock films. Sometimes we get outright homages like with Brian De Palma or we get cheap ripoffs that some of us never see unless digging deep into the thriller bin at Blockbuster. Luckily the French seem to have it licked and in this case director Guillaume Canet takes Harlan Coben's potboiler and makes it into riveting if not quite linear filmmaking. You have to stay with the picture as it goes along at times you may get so confused you'll want to give up but if you can give yourself just a bit to the twists and paranoia it's very rewarding.It's in very simple terms about Alex Dustin Hoffman lookalike Franois Cluzet and his wife Margot stunninglooking MarieJosee Croze who one night go skinny dipping and... no not one of 'those' movies slasher. But murder is involved and we're made to believe Margot was killed and Alex was knocked unconscious that night. Then the story jumps ahead eight years later when Dr. Alex Beck is now living alone and still sort of mourning his wife as the anniversary of her death comes around. And yet even as the case seemed to be closed the police still have suspicions about Alex since he doesn't remember how he got out of the water onto the dock before being knocked out. Another two bodies are found buried near the original murder site and the case is reopened with Alex now once again a suspect. Then something else happens...I don't want to mention much else for fear of spoiling the daylights or just boring the hell out of you with exposition but suffice to say it becomes a mix of elements from the likes of Fugitive Vertigo yes Vertigo at least one element anyway and several of Hitchcock's wrong man on the run movies. There are things that the director does to keep things moving and fastpaced for fans of real hardcore thrillers a chase midway through the film might just top Fugitive for sheer audacious move on the part of the hero but he also makes the audience pay attention very closely to details. Just a subtle closeup of a computer screen with a 'new email' or a moment with Alex's dog or even a U2 song. And it's crucial to keep up with small scenes that shouldn't seem like they mean much the director understands all of the components of a warped mystery where characters and motives and even simple twists in a single bound are not what they seem.Luckily there is time in the last section of the story where a certain character I won't say who but it's an older one who can expound on the exposition that thankfully puts most of the pieces of the story into place. But then even after things are explained it gets one talking about what's just happened if everything made sense and not in that damn that was no good too confusing way. It doesn't underestimate the audience's intelligence or manner to keep up with a story that involves murder love lust coverups powerplays old rich French guys and and even a sliver of social commentary at one point. And the cast is uniformly terrific saying that Clement is like Dustin Hoffman isn't just as comparison in looks as he's really got the stuff to lead this film as someone you want to stick with 100 if not the Cary Grant type then certainly Jimmy Stewart Cruze for her moments on screen is gorgeous and sad and happy and all those things that make up a mysterious character Kristen Scott Thomas yes Kristin Scott Thomas speaks French is amazing for her time as a supporting character. And don't get me started on the guy who played Margot's father.It's a work of minor brilliance that unfortunately loses its footing in the last couple of minutes with a sentimental coda. For the most part Tell No One is what we want to see often in American movies but usually people aren't strong enough to just put it out there without mucking up the style. Canet is a strong director great with a lostinapretzelfactory story and it takes its place alongside the likes of With a Friend Like Harry Red Lights and The Beat That My Heart Skipped as one of the superlative neonoirs of 21st century French cinema. Sleepertastic!".

It also doesn't appeal to a lot of fans of hard hitting real life drama as it doesn't really examine the characters with any depth. The closest it comes to that is by explaining how the doctor and his wife were friends since childhood and how they never cheated thus providing a relative copout of oh look its true love at it's bestIn the end I came away from the film unconvinced either way in regards to the plot cohesiveness and to whether it was overall trite and contrived or poignant and well crafted so I decided to check out some of the negative reviews to see if they could sway me and in the end... not really. Most of the criticisms from people show they are just as undecided as I and deal simply with PROBABILITY factors and not much else in an attempt to make sense out of a story which remained unconvincing to some viewers merely because it does not FIT into what we would consider ideal of any one genre be it action mystery or drama and in terms of the plot twists and turns unlike in most mystery films nothing really SCREAMS in your face as being downright moronic or impossible thus it is difficult to find a worthy culprit.In reality this movie presents truly one of the most cohesive forms of a Mystery movie I have seen and where most of the criticisms focus on what would the characters realistically do or not do and explain certain actions and motivations as being stupid or nonsensical in reality you CANNOT over estimate the stupidness of any human being in a traumatic situation. The doctor fleeing from arrest seemed stupid and reckless and a bit of an excuse to package some high intensity action into this otherwise slow moving film but is it beyond belief? No. The fact that a street thug and his gang were so willing to help the fugitive doctor at great risk to themselves and were faced with police just as the doctor arrived on their turf coincidental? foolish? unlucky? Yes but not impossible and not unbelievable. Personally my biggest problem which surprisingly no one else brought light on so far was how the police would illegally break into the doctors place and search his apartment ONLY because he was the one last seen with the murdered photographer. That doesn't even amount to circumstantial evidence against him since they didn't even bother to first question him as to whether he had an alibi which in fact he DID.The entire complex plot was in the end revealed during the last 10 minutes of the film and like the doctors father in law you might want a shot of strong alcohol while hearing it out. It is really a LOT of probabilities motivations and facts to sift through but I will tell you in the end you can criticize the BELIEVABILITY of all of it but it really does all hold out and none of it is a direct slap in the face of logic and another important little twist to keep track of if you will is that the film clearly allows you to realize what the father in law SAYS is not necessarily the truth and thus everything he presents in itself is self serving to him and very open ended to ones imagination.The end result is one both as straight forward as you'd expect yet underwhelming given the overall buildup and complexity and in the end since we weren't really given much character depth many of us can not help to be unconvinced and undecided and seeking for answers and justification for our overall dissatisfaction with a film that required so much of our attention. To me this is a film that simply is what it is. Truly this type of film is a very difficult one to direct and I remain fully undecided as to whether it is a good or worthwhile film but any value is does have is how it is one of the few mystery movies out there who's plot twists do not scream in your face as being stupid or impossible.".

You might even say he overplays his sobriety because he's not so much impassive in the face of upheaval as blank to it at times. But overall it's what he is this man who faced a personal tragedy eight years earlier and now still struggles with the truth of it.And we all struggle with this truth. Once the initial murder happens we are struck by the absence of a body. And by a feeling that something isn't what it seems. When the police reinterview Alexandre after eight years which seems to be long enough for a statute of limitations declaration though I don't know French law we suddenly suspect him of either the murder or of complicity. There are new facts. There is a suspicious sighting in a surveillance video. There are his own doubts. And our doubts about his doubts.The cast sprawls a bit at timesthere are four main women and several lesser men so keep alert. The father and the fatherinlaw the girlfriend's girlfriend the sister the lawyer and so on. And it is the unfolding of conversations and stories and confessions that make the truth come out one of those cases of telling rather than showing what happened. By the end this becomes a huge weakness in a movie that had so much shown and so much action until the last half hour. The twists are so huge and played out with a couple of remakes so that the same actors replay the scenario differently now that the facts are rearranged it's slightly flabbergasting. If you don't mind having the wool pulled over your eyes this way in a way you can't object to you will be impressed by the overall tone of things. There is the energy and worry of a good American adventure crime film with fewer pyrotechnics and some convincing realism both welcome in a world of overly produced movies. And the chase scene is notablethe man gets tired and sweaty he has a lucky break or two and then there's a brilliant if unlikely entry of a side of Paris we don't often see in mainstream movies the minority neighborhoods with their brooding anger against the police which reminded me of late 60s America. It's a short insight.If this seems like your arena at all I'd definitely give this a look. We're all pretty used to unlikely twists by now anyway so the rest of the movie will hold itself up well.".

It's a classic tale of the wrong man who may or may not be responsible for the disappearance of his wife. Here instead of Harrison Ford this also reminds me of Frantic we get a younger taller version of Dustin Hoffman  the resemblance is uncanny. But he's a good actor and so is the ensemble cast that appears in this movie.There's suspense tension action everything. It's very rare that I applaud a movie let alone a scene in a movie. Well Tell No One has one scene I won't say which but it's in the middle of the film that made me get up and do that and when a movie makes me do this well that's a very good sign.The mystery is great until you find out what really happened. The third act ruins all the fun. It's too unbelievable too complicated too convoluted. It seems like all the effort went in the first two acts and the third was almost like an afterthought.So this is a thriller a mystery and an action movie. And a good one at all that. It's a shame that the 'dnouement' is so bad because the movie makes big promises but in the end it all just fizzles out. Oh and the plot holes. Don't get me started on that.But hey don't listen to me. Watch this movie if you're interested  I loved it up until the ending so who knows you might like it and it's a wellmade effort.

	schema:reviewBody "Tell no One a terrific mystery thriller adapted for the screen by its director Guillaume Canet offers an two hours of nonstop action and one of the best films that came from France recently. This thriller ranks with Claude Chabrol's La Ceremonie as one of the best treatments mystery novels have received.In fact we had read Harlan Coben's novel when it first came out and since the action had changed locales we wanted to read it again in order to compare. Alas all the copies of the book had disappeared from the shelves of all New York's bookstores because of the success of the movie. Eventually I was lucky to find the original text. The treatment differs as far as the way Mr. Canet decided to change some key characters but as a whole his interpretation of Mr. Coben's work remains intact.The action revolves around Alex Beck a physician who has suffered a severe blow when eight years early he and his wife Margot were viciously attacked at their lake retreat. Margot is killed by the attacker Alex survives but he is soul will never recover itself from the loss of a soul mate a spouse and a friend. Margot and Alex's relationship goes back since their own childhood.As the film opens Alex who is now a well regarded doctor starts getting cryptic email messages. What he doesn't know is that he is being watched closely by people that were connected with the tragedy he and Margot suffered. That is why when Alex receives a video clip he can't get over of what is revealed to him in it. He decides to dig deeper into the whole affair. That journey will take him to an unknown territory where reality mixes up with the not too distant past.The best thing in the film is Francois Cluzet who gives an inspired performance as Alex. This actor does wonders with a role that fits him like a glove. Mr. Cluzet is marvelous he contributes to make the film even better with his intelligent portrayal. Andre Dussolier is also seen as Margot's father a retired police officer that is key to the mystery. Jean Rochefort is also impressive as the man who has a lot at stake and is bent into getting a justice for a loss of his own. Also the elegant Kristin Scott Thomas makes a great contribution to the film.The film enjoys the crisp cinematography by Christophe Offenstein and the wonderful music score of Mathieu Chedid. One of the best sequences involve Alex Beck running through the streets of Paris and getting across a busy highway that keeps the viewer gasping for air because it seems an impossible thing to accomplish. The director appears briefly in a minor but pivotal part. Mr. Canet clearly shows he is a force to be reckoned with in the French cinema.Highly recommended for fans of the genre and specially readers of one of the best mystery writers of the moment Harlan Coben.".

The way that she and her paternal half sister Pauline Avery her closest confidante deal with men and sex has largely been affected by their father who is working on marrying wife number five. Frannie thinks about sex more than she has it. Her lack of a sex life is further exacerbated by being the object of obsession of James Graham a man with who she had a few casual dates and two sexual encounters which has made her even more cautious. This complete experience is why she has a somewhat inappropriate albeit nonsexual relationship with Cornelius Webb one of her students.

	schema:reviewBody "In the Cut features solid acting and a nice color scheme but is mostly unremarkable in terms of story script and visuals. Savvy viewers will recognize most of the plot elements and characters from other recent thrillers. The film does however have two remarkable elements an amazing 5.1channel sound mix and a nude scene that is notable not for its pornographic or fantasyfulfilling qualities but for its stark realism.Anyone who appreciates film sound should watch or rather listen to In the Cut because it's one of the few existing films that uses 5.1channel sound for more than SFX gimmicks or making sure the Dolby Digital logo appears on its DVD case. The film creates real ambiance and mood with its sound mix which helped suck me into the story world and get a sense of the characters' environment. I first noticed this when Frannie descends the stairs in the restaurant just before she sees the mysterious villain. As she walks through the noisy crowd and down the stairwell the conversations bustling and other background fade from the front to rear channels and mix with her footsteps as she descends. This to me is much more elegant use of 5.1channel surround than sticking a few whizzing noises in the rear channels when a spaceship flies off the top edge of the frame. In the Cut makes full use of its available channels which is more than 99 of highbudget films can say.The other piece of the film that stuck with me was the nude scene with Frannie and Malloy that follows their inevitable hookup. It's so rare to see a Hollywood nude scene that features characters just lounging with nothing on and in such an unromantic setting. It's especially amazing with an established star like Meg Ryan. There are no mysterious Lshaped sheets to hide their bodies but there is also no sense that Campion left them nude to attract voyeurs to her film. The characters don't assume erotic poses they simply act as if they've already seen what they have to show each other as most people do after sex. I don't often praise realism in films especially stupid thrillers but this scene stood out as much as the excellent sound design. If only the rest of the film could live up to those standards.".

	schema:reviewBody "Meg Ryan gives what may well be the breakthrough performance of her career in 'In the Cut' a violent erotic thriller from maverick filmmaker Jane Campion. Ryan plays Frannie a college English instructor who is instinctively drawn to the seamier side of life. When women in her Manhattan neighborhood start falling victim to a grizzly serial killer Frannie as a possible witness becomes a prime source of interest both professionally and personally for a homicide detective named Malloy who has some troubling sexual proclivities of his own to deal with. Attracted by his edgy darkness and smoldering sexuality Frannie succumbs to his advances fully cognizant of the possible danger he represents. Is the law enforcement official as much of a threat to this young woman as the psychopath going about town decapitating and dismembering the local ladies? It is this kind of moral ambiguity that informs the entire movie.From the very outset Campion makes it clear that we are not in for a conventional police procedural. She is obviously more interested in character and mood than in the niceties of a welloiled plot and streamlined exposition. Frannie is far from being the helpless victim or plucky heroine one usually finds at the center of such tales she is a complex moody taciturn woman who seems to be drifting passively through life with little passion conviction or purpose to make any of it worthwhile. Even when it comes to her sexual obsessions it often feels as if she is just going through the motions. It is hard for us to get a bead on her for she is a perfect reflection of the world she inhabits a world without a clear moral compass  so much so that we often don't know what we are supposed to think of her or the other people with whom she comes in contact. The script plays up the sense of dislocation by having characters appear and disappear seemingly at random throughout the movie sometimes serving as little more than red herrings for both the story and Frannie's life. This often makes it so that we in the audience feel clueless as to where exactly the film is headed and what the overall purpose of it really is. It's often hard for us to get our bearings yet it is this very ambiguity this sense of being rudderless and confused that lifts the film above the tired conventions of the genre. In fact the film is at its weakest when it concentrates on the intricacies of the plot  the resolution is remarkably mundane  and at its strongest when it merely records the eccentricities and passions of its two enigmatic characters.The sexual content of the film is highly charged but not overtly offensive with one glaring exception at least in the 'unrated' version I assume this does not apply to the version released to theaters. Early in the film we are treated to a graphic hard core closeup of an act of fellatio that clearly is not simulated. Consider yourself forewarned.Ryan has never been better than she is here. She plays Frannie almost as if she were one of the urban walking dead just right for a modern woman who feels no real emotional connection with the world and the people around her.Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the cop who may be more of a threat to Frannie than the killer who's terrorizing the area. Almost as an afterthought Kevin Bacon makes little more than a cameo appearance overacting in the role of Frannie's stalker exboyfriend. 'In the Cut' is a subtle little mood piece that is more about observing behavior than it is about searching for a killer. Those looking for an intensely plotted thriller may not be as intrigued by this film as those searching for a psychosexual character study. It's the atmosphere and the performances that count in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Campion always impresses. Do not go into this film seeking a tightly woven suspense thriller. This film deals more of what happens when a woman is continuously victimized by the idea of true love and the world it places her in. Meg Ryan? I gave her the benefit of the doubt. It paid off. She is marvelous. Her character is enigmatic and sexy. The fact that they washed away her Hollywood image delighted me. Her sexual demands are tastefully perverted. Mark Ruffalo? His primitive macho cop demeanor plays well for Ryan's repressed desire to have sexual fulfillment. Why does sex effect so many of us? Why not just tell us all about it as children. We're not stupid. Just tell us the truth.Ryan's character has lost connection to the world. Her wisdom and insight comes from banner poems on public transport. Ryan displays an inner coolness that I find attractive. She does not respond to silly questions and reacts slightly to incredible events such as being hit by a car. She is in her own world of thought lost in an idealistic vision of happiness and love but lives her reality in perverted surroundings and grime. The people in her life all seem to be disconnected.There is a serial killer on the loose and Ryan's interaction with him is hauntingly chilling while at the same time beautifully shot. There is a mystery as to whom he might be. The riddle was of minor concern. I was more fascinated watching Ryan's character. The film is filled with fabulous shots. Highly stylized. Several closeups of Meg Ryan's world. The film drags a bit and lingers into the unknown at times just as the protagonist Ryan. It has moments of beauty that is rarely seen on the screen in this day and age. I give this film a 10.Victor Nunnally BFA Dramatic History and Theory BFA Film Theory and Production".

	schema:reviewBody "In a word this film is disappointing. From the beginning things felt disjointed and confusing. I had the sense that the director was trying to bring me into Frannie's world through visual tricks but they seemed forced. It was apparent early on the color red was going to play an important part in the end of the film because almost every scene had some red peppered through it but it was done is such an obvious way that it became distracting. And every time I saw the red hat or the red shoes or the red newspaper box I was struck that it seemed so dated  I remembered how effective a trick it had been with the movie 'The Sixth Sense' and how long ago was that? I found nothing sympathetic about the main characters. And while I didn't expect Frannie or Malloy to have a heart of gold I would have preferred to care about whether or not she gets killed in the end. As it goes I didn't. Casting babyfaced Ruffalo as a toughguy sexstarved cop seemed a confusing choice. I love Ruffalo even in his darker films but throwing a Village People mustache on a guy does not necessarily make him appear more menacing.And I know this will make me seem like a prude but I did have a problem with the first sex scene where Frannie comes upon a couple in a sex act. There is a close up view of a portion of a penis on screen for several seconds. I don't have a problem with the act itself but I do wonder why it was necessary to show the penis. It was fully apparent that the guy was getting a blow job I'm not sure what cinematically was gained by showing that level of detail. I can only think that it was put in to push the boundaries of the rating system or to fulfill some strange agenda. It seemed pointless and arbitrary. Well I guess that is in keeping with the rest of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people out there do not understand the difference between the Best Picture and Best Director Oscar. After all if the director is responsible for making sure all the elements mix well together then surely Best Director should be the same as Best Picture? Well that is not quite the case as far as I understand it. The writing of the film or the story itself is at least the main thing that a director does not have complete control of. There are other elements too of course. But the reason why it is so hard to explain the difference to people is that it is rare to come across a film that is well directed but nothing much else. However 'In the Cut' is an example of such a film.The plot is a thriller about some serial killer who is killing young women. Sound familiar yet? However there is a pseudo erotic romance involved too. Our protagonist is an outgoing female but yet one with weaknesses. The storyline revolves around a primarily sexual relationship that she starts with a detective investigating the case however all along she suspects that he is the killer because she saw someone with the same tattoo receiving oral sex from one of the murder victims. I won't reveal the rest of the plot which may sound slightly original but yet I can reassure you it is quite hackneyed in the execution.The film is based on a novel written by Susannah Moore which I am yet to read and after seeing the film adaptation I am in no mood to. Campion takes to writing the screenplay but helped along by Moore. In 1993 Campion did a superb job writing 'The Piano' for which she received a welldeserved Oscar. The characters in the film were all interesting and well developed and the story was no difficulty to understand. It was also quite original. The material for this movie however revolves around a familiar plot that has a thriller element. More time in the script is dedicated therefore towards the thriller  and romance  aspects of the story and less towards the drama. That's not to say that the characters are poorly developed or anything but it does not help. The main problem with the writing of the film is the story itself. It has so many familiar elements and at times it is predictable and clichd.The acting is not much better than ordinary either. Ryan has a few good moments but is often overthetop. The rest of the cast is well satisfactory but nothing special give or take Kevin Bacon. However Bacon's character is perhaps the most questionable one of the lot. So if the writing and acting in the film is ordinary can it be a great film? Not really. How then one might wonder is it well directed? Campion is a very good director. She knows exactly how to direct a film to give it the right atmosphere and make it look good. In the Cut is one of the bestlooking thrillers I've seen of this decade. As in 'The Portrait of a Lady' Campion demonstrates an acute eye for colour and light in the film. The execution is very polished. On a surface level it does not look like a cheap Hollywood film. It does not look like a vehicle for Ryan or any of her costars. Kudos especially goes to Campion's vision of the flashbacks used in the film which are reminiscent of the vignettes Kidman's worldwide voyages in 'The Portrait of a Lady'. Even Campion's use of black and white aids the visual style.This is certainly one of the most unique films I have come across but I don't say that in an overly positive manner. It is a very goodlooking film and ignoring camera angles and editing techniques it still looks very solid on a visual scope. There is plenty to admire about Campion's direction of the film but under this polished surface that Campion has created lies an ordinary predictable clichd and only semiinteresting thriller. It is a film worth seeing to admire Campion's craft as a director but the film is otherwise rather unrewarding though it surely will still keep one watching until maybe the last ten minutes.".

I know Meg Ryan's character is supposed to be bland and timid but she's also supposed to have some fire burning within some unfulfilled desire that makes her enter into a risky affair remember Diane Keaton in 'Looking For Mr. Goodbar?. She shows this in her sex scenes but none in other moments. Mark Ruffalo? Wonderful performance if being both wooden and extremely repellent at the same time was the requirement. Kevin Bacon slumming once again he seems determined to make 'Three Degrees of Kevin Bacon WAY to easy to play provides the only interesting performance but his character is such an obvious red herring that the fun of it diminishes under the formula. The worst offense however is the total lack of motive for the killings. 'In the Cut' is apparently and I'm just guessing here a skating reference but what's the point? All the sturm and drang about the mother and father's romance on skates and the ridiculous dream sequence...why? After nearly two hours spent with ugly characters in ugly surroundings amidst ugly circumstances there is no payoff no explanation no insight. Yuchh.Later I read the book. Somehow I was compelled. And it made this abortion of a movie all the more egregious since the author had a hand in it. The book was honest and compelling and had an ending that was DEVESTATING and COMPLETELY in sync with the rest of the story. Why why why do these filmmakers think they can't offer an honest violent sad ending to an American audience? This sellout on the part of the author ranks right up there with the one inflicted by the director of both the original 'The Vanshing' and the US remake. Shame on you for selling out your vision.".

	schema:headline " Pleasure and Fear Campion's Guide to Female Eroticism SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "In Jane Campion's films women are stunted communicators. They are overwhelmed by largerthanlife men in the presence of whom their words are clearly futile not to be uttered. In In the Cut the protagonist Frannie is an English professor who collects the words of others but does not have much to say on her own account. She is silenced inside by a bewildered fear of peoplemenwhich she carries around in the form of a great vulnerability. As we see her in the streets of New York in the bars on the train in her house we are struck by how small and fragile she looks a beautiful thing in a very rough world. Frannie is constantly pondering over the little poems or fragments of poems the transit authority posts in the New York subway trains. She is also writing a book on slang words which she gathers by regularly meeting a black student in a seedy restaurantbar. The words are very much not her own words part of a culture she studies as an outsider. In her home she meticulously posts words and sentences on cork boards on the walls. When the cop who will become her lover first enters her place the first thing he notices are the words. When he leaves he leaves behind a new word disarticulated' which Frannie hastens to scribble down and put up with the others.Disarticulated or inarticulate is in fact what Frannie is. She cannot articulate her unease and stumbles through a traumatized post911 New York in a state of shellshocked withdrawal. Along with her unease she cannot articulate her desire. Pauline her sister who knows her well pressures her into dating men presumably because she doesn't. Pauline herself who lives surrounded by sex because her apartment is literally  above a gogo bar and she's close to the girls is in love with a doctor who sleeps with her but does not love her back and whom she sees mainly by making doctor's appointments. Frannie's and Pauline's lives are filled with desire and sensuality. Their houses are steeped in color and sound wonderfully cozy houses not expensive but lusciously decorated with red shag carpets and piles of soft cushions. At the beginning of the film Frannie's and Pauline's desire shows itself in their love for each other. Since we don't know the two are sisters halfsisters actually we think Pauline is Frannie's lover. The two women touch a lot walk holding hands part with a loud kiss on the mouth. The play of their hands their touch their physical proximity dominates all the scenes in which they appear together in the film. In the meantime the doctor Pauline is in love with is seeking a restraining order against her. The idea that she may be issued a restraining order feels absurd to Pauline who tells Frannie the story in grief and disbelief. Looking at Frannie and Pauline huddled up in Pauline's apartment it feels absurd to us too theirs is clearly a world in which women have a lot more to fear from men than men from women.Men are portrayed from the start and consistently as dangerous predators. The student Frannie meets in the bar is cocky and macho and Frannie looks remarkably vulnerable sitting with him with her professorial glasses on. In the back of the room women giggle with a guy or two. When Frannie goes to the restroom she gets lost in the back of the bar and comes across a woman giving a man a blow job. The scene is again filled with menace. At the same time Frannie is attracted to it and look on unseen. When she comes back to her table her student is gone sent away by a mixture of impatience and jealousy.These threatening men besides the student who will later try to rape Frannie there's Frannie exboyfriend who breaks into her house and of course the cop and his partner serve the purpose of the film which as a slasher thriller means to keep us guessing which one of the guys is the serial murderer who strangles women rips their throats open and cuts them to pieces. Juxtaposed to Frannie's desire though this pervasive sense of male threat functions at a deeper level because it provides a context to her inwardness and isolation. When Frannie finally gets her detective into bed Campion does a great job of making the intensely erotic and explicit lovemaking all about Frannie and her pleasure. Molloy's own pleasure is not even addressed. The sex is all about Frannie and her delight. In his review of the film Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald describes the sex in the film as cold. I am not surprised though I think he is dead wrong. The film's exceptional eroticism may fail to register or register fully on the American viewer's radar screen because its polarities are subverted. I never thought of this before seeing this scene but in fact movie sex scenes the heterosexual ones are all about the man's conquest of the woman. The man fucks the woman. In In the Cut Frannie fucks the detective not in the sense that he is passive he isn't but in the sense that the whole scene is about her pleasure her desire. So the typical parameters along which we are trained to register eroticism on the screen do not work here because there is no sense of male conquest no taking over of the female body. The female body is possessed only of its own pleasure a pleasure Molloy serves. The camera is focused on Frannie's face on her gestures and expression of sexual delightand these are conveyed rather restrainedly in terms of movie conventions without moans or grunts and little verbal ejaculations. Frannie moans only when she gives herself an orgasm not when Molloy gives it to her. Also and significantly Frannie is the one who initiates the lovemaking in a matteroffact unromantic way that is atypical of this kind of movies. So it requires a different mindset to appreciate the eroticism of In the Cut a mindset focused on the pleasure of women rather than on the pleasure of men.Besides wanting to hurt women men want to own them. This theme runs through the film as a constant thread. Pauline's and Frannie's father whom we see in sepiacolored sequences ice skating with the woman who's destined to be Frannie's mother fell in love with her on a frozen pond while he was already engaged to another woman. The woman disgusted by her fiancee's behavior threw her engagement ring on the ice. The man picked it up and half an hour later put it on the hand of his new conquest. The sepiacolored sequences return two or three times. Just to make sure that we get it Campion has the iceskating father run over his new fiancee cutting her to pieces with the sharp blades of her skates. The men who want to own women are the same men who will cut them to pieces. Molloy also asks Frannie to get engaged to him as will the serial killer before she kills him and ends the movie. So Frannie is constantly fighting to protect herself from male violence and to retain her independence. When towards the end Molloy apparently frustrated by Frannie's silences and withdrawal shouts at her that she's exhausting him she locks him to a drainpipe with his handcuffs and fucks him. The sex as before is about her not his pleasure.Frannie doesn't win her battle. The ravaged city of New York is too far gone too lost in violence and horror for a small woman like her to right things. But as in her other films Campion shows us a woman who reappropriates her desire without emasculating her partner or turning away from men altogether. This is a great victory unto itself.".

There was no sustained tension to speak of no humor to break up the monotony no likable characters just a few pointless and really tiresome sex scenes scattered throughout a terrible story with lots and lots of talk about sex.And what's with Meg Ryan's long walk to Manhattan from the lighthouse across the George Washington Bridge while she's drunk covered with blood? After the anticlimax of her killing the murderer her struggle to get home on her own  exhausted drunk emotionally devastated by the last 12 hours  struck me as just completely stupid.".

There was no sustained tension to speak of no humor to break up the monotony no likable characters just a few pointless and really tiresome sex scenes scattered throughout a terrible story with lots and lots of talk about sex.And what's with Meg Ryan's long walk to Manhattan from the lighthouse across the George Washington Bridge while she's drunk covered with blood? After the anticlimax of her killing the murderer her struggle to get home on her own  exhausted drunk emotionally devastated by the last 12 hours  struck me as just completely stupid.";

Kill Bill was a fabulous romp The Italian Job was an excellent BMW commercial and Pirates of the Carribean was just plain fun. Most everything else I've trudged along to the cinema to see this year has simply been rife with garbage. I needed a good slick well written and executed thriller to restore my faith in cinema.In The Cut was definately not it. The trailer looked good incidentally it contains the only exciting sequences from the film and the few reviews I could find were promising. With my enthusiasm in hand I proceeded to drag my better half and my housemate out for a meal and a movie.Well after it all at least the meal was pretty good.I'll break 'In The Cut' down into its base elements and you can make up your own mind if you want to read any further. 1 Meg Ryans breasts. They get a lot of completely pointless screen time. 2 Masturbation. 3 Neurotic characters. All of them seriously. 4 A plot that attempts to simulate depth by using vague referances and sexual deviancy.That's about it.The blurb informed me that the movie revolved around a terrible serial killer and the turmoil involved in finding him. From where I was sitting it appeared to revolve a little more around loose women and bad dialogue. I could be wrong about the loose women though with the quality of the camera work they very well could have been men.I am not too familiar with the directors previous work and after sitting through this garbage I'm really not keen to look into it any further.The movie attempts to give us some insight into a group of terribly traumatised minds all of them obviously quite desperate for some human contact but falls over itself by giving very little in the way of background to support these characters. I couldn't give two sts about any of the people I was seeing on screen. I didn't want to know any more about them and I didn't want to see another person touching up Meg Ryan. That got old after the first seventeen overly dramatised and completely inappropriate sexual interludes.The cinematic equal of prison rape except I actually had to pay for the privelige.That about sums it up people. If you only completely avoid seeing one movie this year make it this one.Completely woeful. I want that two hours of my life back.".

I really did not understand why she accepted to work in this movie. The camera is horrible looking like a soap opera and staying a few seconds focusing the face of an actor or actress or a location with millions of cuts and without any sequence longer than a few seconds. The plot is so simple and silly that has to explore an explicit free oral sex scene in the beginning of the movie and lots of bad language contrasting with the correct use of the English language by the character of Frannie to make some sort of difference. I saw this movie in an American DVD and at least there is a slang dictionary with the use of unusual expressions and words that I found interesting to learn some new slang in English. My vote is four.Title Brazil Em Carne Viva In Live Flesh".

	schema:headline " Sandler's lovable fool has a serious message while slipping on a banana skin";
	schema:reviewBody "Nobody goes to see an Adam Sandler movie for spiritual enrichment or intellectual stimulation  let's get that out of the way first. Once you accept you've paid your money to be mildly entertained in a lighthearted slapstick manner strap in and enjoy the ride. I keep hearing Sandler is a major Hollywood player these days with an equal footing as producer as he is actor he has produced a considerable amount with fellow actor Rob Schneider  the similarly inane but funny  mostly in spite of yourself  Hot Chick being the most recent example in which he has a cameo role and indeed Schneider helps Sandler out in Mr Deeds so it's hard to prove that Sandler is now typecast as a lovable fool because it's fairly likely he chose the part himself possibly aware that Hamlet might be a little out of his league. Sandler need only check his bank balance to see that the lovable fool is certainly a lucrative one having made an absolute mint playing countless other characters blessed with naive charm and a heart of gold. The story  we all know it's a remake of the classic depressionera propaganda film starring Gary Cooper designed to lift spirits and foster a sense of community  centres around a picturesque New England town and its pereniallycheerful smalltown inhabitants chiefly Longfellow Deeds Sandler who inherits a fortune from an uncle he never knew finds himself at the helm of a media empire and heads to the Big Apple to find out more. Here Winona Ryder steps in as the ambitious TV reporter determined to get her big scoop and dupes the affable Deeds into falling in love with her. All the time she's wearing a wire and a hidden camera to enable their courtship and his antics sometimes drunken sometimes heroic to be broadcast on the evening news. Typically Deeds is the last to know and is appalled when he makes the connection. By which time Ryder's character has fallen in love herself resigned from her job and is begging for a second chance. Deeds' only flaw is a short fuse and this is at odds with his generous spirit who at times could be George Bailey James Stewart's kindly smalltown character in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life 1946 but this spices things up a little and allows the suspension of disbelief to continue a little longer. The number of disrespectful foulmouthed city folk he takes out is entertaining while not always convincing but then times have changed and these days your average bloke doesn't think of taking a swing at a man for swearing in front of a lady more's the pity I say. While you could aim criticism at this and jeer at the corny lines and simplistic moral at the film's end there is something to be cherished here. The moral of course being that money is less important than being true to yourself and while you're at it be nice to your neighbour. As Mother Teresa once said kindly words are heard once but their echoes are heard for ever  Deeds' character and his deeds pun definitely intended themselves are echoes of another lamentably more innocent time and it's uplifting to see this spirit so laboured in the film's remake. It's also refreshing to see this bravely recreated by the producers who have not shied away from dealing with the film's essence in these cynical times. It's not all sentimental Queen of Hearts stuff though. There are some hilarious laughoutloud moments that counter the film's message perfectly  the helicopter ride to Manhattan where the crew and Deeds are singing 'A Space Oddity' complete with airguitar springs to mind here  and there is the usual dose of slapstick you'd expect from a Sandler picture. The 7 flying cats rescued from a burning building by our hero is particularly memorable and as I say I was laughing in spite of myself. This humour compliments the film's slushy message and prevents any actual retching in the theatre  leaving the cinemagoer shuffling out content with a smile on his face  definitely a feelgood movie. I just hope Sandler doesn't attempt It's A Wonderful Life next I don't think the world's quite ready yet.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Deeds the remake of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town Mr. Deeds Goes To Town is an old comedy that is personally one of my favorite comedies. It's just a wonderful film that I highly recommend you watch if you get the chance. So Adam Sandler decided to take on that classic and make it into his film which honestly isn't that bad just in comparison believe me then you look at it as a horrendous film. It was just one of those movies that really didn't need a remake. But Adam Sandler did bring his own bite to the film and just updated the story for the younger generation that obviously never heard of the movie.After Preston Blake freezes to death at the summit of Mount Everest with a triumphant smile on his face a search for his heir for his successful company begins. When it is found that he has a living nephew named Longfellow Deeds who runs a pizzeria in New Hampshire Deeds is contacted and brought to New York City by attorney  businessman Chuck Cedar. Plans are made for Deeds to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home 40 billion richer but he must remain in New York for a few days as all the legal details are worked out. The story is major news and reporter Babe Bennett who works for a tabloid show has a friend pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds because their research indicated Deed wanted to meet a girl by saving her the same way his father had met his mother. Deeds rescues her and she continues to go out with him under the disguise of Pam Dawson school nurse. Though Pam initially hopes to just get a good story on the new heir she eventually falls for the kindhearted Deeds while realizing that all she's done is lie to him and wants to be with him. Chuck is also up to no good in wanting to take over the company from Deeds and doesn't have the best intentions.Mr. Deeds has a few funny moments even though it was incredibly immature I do have to admit that I got a kick out of the scene where Longfellow shows off his frostbite foot and tells the servant to hit it with the fire poker and screams to freak him out yeah it's something that most little brothers would do to their older sibling but it still got a laugh. Wynonia Rider was actually pretty good in the film she was very adorable but her chemistry wasn't exactly on key with Sandler not her fault just I wasn't feeling it too much in the film. Over all the film is worth the look if you see it on TV but otherwise I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see the movie.510".

The latter is fine  I want the good guys to prevail  but they way they go about it is stupid.I did think this movie had a little softer edge than most other blatantlylow class Something About MaryAmerican Pietype comedies of today however. I guess what I am saying is this isn't as inyourface type offensive most of the rest are.Of course Adam Sandler is playing the lowkey Gary Cooper role of Mr. Deeds from the 1940s so he's not the highstrung Happy Gilmore type here although he does get violent at times. Winona Ryder plays the love interest a tabloid lowmoral reporter who is reformed by the amiable Mr. Deeds. She's not believable at all and one can see one reason she isn't much of star actress anymore. It isn't just her reallife problems. She's pretty and she's okay in the role but something's missing in her acting.The real star of the film is John Turturro as the Spanish butler. He's funny in about every scene he's in and he's a guy everyone roots for here.In summary it's a pretty nice film with a number of laughoutloud scenes but it's still a long way from the Gary CooperBarabara Stanwyck classic film version at least in terms of an awshucks wholesome hero. This film just doesn't have the heart and soul of the original because it's more concerned with cheap laughs than a moral message. Still it has its funny moments and I found worth watching.".

THIS is a leading man?peter gallagher's eyebrows bald guy's beard everyone's performance  SADISM.french fries and oreo's on pizza?  hooooeeee!   that guy is mad cap. same guy that gives the hero the turning point plot exposition in the end. while you're at it why don't you land the helicopter at Wendy's?  yeee haw. they're out of control.OMG the torrent of lost jokes on the JETS.  ye gods what a real writer could have done with them...Yes like any sensible American I found myself actually rooting for the ice on the lake to win after the egregiously fat woman didn't have the cajones to finish the jobI am making travel arrangements to hollywood to personally get my money back from these thieves.  Time permitting will torture them for 90odd minutes by making them watch....well Little Nicky comes to mind... ";

Naturally Sandler is much smarter than he first appears and proves to be an individual that can handle swindlers. However he does let his guard down around supposed school nurse Winona Ryder in actuality a reporter for a tabloid and that is when his bigcity troubles start. Mr. Deeds is a watchable and somewhat entertaining film that works because of Sandler's screen persona. Sandler continues to raise films that are duds just because of his enormous talents.

Capra won his second Academy Award for Best Director for the 1936 classic. Gary Cooper received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his sincere portrayal of a simple man thrust into extraordinary circumstances. As in many of Capra's films Cooper's character guided by a genuine moral center and sense of compassion for those struggling through difficult economic times the Great Depression fights against the shallow the insincere and the corrupt.This 2002 version of Mr. Deeds directed by Steven Brill possesses none of the charm or drama of the original. The task of updating Robert Riskin's and Clarence Kelland's Oscarnominated script went to Timothy P. Herlihy who received his professional break as a staff writer on Saturday Night Live. The Oscarwinning Riskin also authored such acclaimed screenplays as Lost Horizon It Happened One Night You Can't Take It With You and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. In contrast Herlihy has no nonAdam Sandler bigscreen credits having penned or coauthored the screenplays for Billy Madison Happy Gilmour The Wedding Singer The Waterboy Little Nicky and Big Daddy. Herlihy's unfunny adaptation of the original script is therefore not surprising. Unfortunately the direction the script and Sandler's performance all make Longfellow Deeds' character look shallow and the character's transformation into compassionate philanthropist seems contrived. The result of this collaboration is a film which is fundamentally insincere and lacking any charm.Do yourself a favor and rent the DVD of the original 1936 film and you'll see why Frank Capra and Gary Cooper were respectively among the greatest American directors and actors of the 20th Century.".

Perhaps I expected myself to laugh a little. I should have watched 'Spaced' instead that was the original plan. The film really drags in the first 45 minutes and the 'comedy' is hardly funny. The chemistry between the lead couple is hardly convincing. The whole romance angle is pretty boring. Sandler seems to be playing a 'nicer' version of himself. Having seen Winona's comic guest appearance in the TV series 'Friends' I would have expected better from her. However she seems really uncomfortable in the initial reel ironically the film was just released after the lawsuit against her and hams in the last half. John Torturro and Peter Gallagher are quite good in their roles. I actually enjoyed Torturro and Sandler's shared scenes. Conchata Ferell was quite funny too.

I have been big fan of Sam Rockwells since the Green Mile and in Seven he is hilarious. Colin Farrell was great and as usual Christopher Walken was superb. Mickey Rourke was originally cast in the Woody Harrelson part and while he did a good job I think the character might have been better suited to Mickey Roarke. There something about Woody playing a character that is way over the top that feels like he's playing it way over the top none the less he was still funny.This movie was full of hilarious one liners and some very smart dialog the plot was at the same time funny and ridiculous. I read a few of the reviewers that slammed this movie and most of them were bashing the plot or the lack thereof this is not a great who done it and I will agree the plot was paper thin at best.If you see this movie you need to see it for the acting and a fun way to spend 110 minutes.

The film was very satisfying to me personally weaving an original story around rich characters. Story is something that I take into great consideration when viewing a film as it has lost a foothold in many films today. In terms of presentation I felt this movie to be a combination of Guy Richie Quentin Tarantino and The Coen Brothers. It's hilarious dark gripping precise quirky demented gory and British. The frequent narration and character introduction of the movie gives it a constantly evolving lure and makes you feel like you're sitting by a camp fire listening to something unfold. Even though their is a thick layer of narration and Peckinpah darkness it's fun as hell with the acting a huge aspect of that if you want to experience a great story that discovers a point to the whole mess these characters undertake and have a blast at the same time then go see this awesome movie!".

Every time the story started to get even a little generic wild cards came firing in from all sides.The actors played their parts well but Rockwell gave the best performance. I was impressed by Woody and Walken's abilities to shed their skins and get deeper into character than I've seen them be in years. This is a writer's filmthe subplots really borderline vignettes about the various psychopaths that Marty encounters are well done their back stories unfold at different paces and their details that connect them to the central plot are creatively deployed while the momentum of the film clearly hinges in the here and now and does not make the mistake of merely chaining together several subplots to produce one dog of a story.I enjoyed almost everything about Seven Psychopaths. 1010 to offset the 2 that someone without a brain will rate this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get the insane plot of Seven Psychopaths out of the way Marty Collin Farrell is a struggling Irish screenwriter who hopes to finish his screenplay for a film called Seven Psychopaths while battling a case of writer's block and authorindecisiveness. His best friend is Billy Sam Rockwell a boisterous dogthief who usually winds up dictating Marty's life rather than helping him along in tough times. Hans Christopher Walken is Billy's best friend and partner in crime when it comes to dogsnatching. After both Hans and Billy steal an unpredictable crime boss's Woody Harrelson shihztu it becomes a violent relentless catandmouse chase to get the pup back and in the meantime we get lengthy monologues between characters about the production of Seven Psychopaths and how Marty's inspiration begins to bubble when he starts considering the barrage of real psychopaths in his own life.There are several films that exist about the moviemaking process and it is a very difficult genre to make effectively. Seven Psychopaths succeeds in balancing the art of characters and the art of plot coherency and it doesn't cross the line of becoming too involved in the process and too concerned with in jokes that leave the audience lost. To put it simply the actors look like they're having fun but they make sure we are still amused and connected with the film.Right off the bat the first thing one can commend about this entire experience are the rich performances by actors of all different career heights. Collin Farrell plays a wonderful straightlaced man victim to idiocy and unhelpful circumstances and is only made better by Sam Rockwell's character's shameless belligerence. Woody Harrelson giving us one of his many diverse roles in recent years has the rare ability of rustling up a fierce moment of seriousness and delivering a devilishly funny laugh in the same breath. And who could forget supportingrole king Christopher Walken who continuously borders the line of selfparody here in a memorably sophisticated role? At times Seven Psychopaths is a witty riot and at other times it can be monotonous and lengthy. For starters the film looks and feels like a Quentin Tarantino film blended with the likes of Guy Ritchie. Shots have a very slim sense of narrative cohesion and many many times are we left bewildered at what we just watched. It's also apparent that the film has a meta selfaware tone that can be pleasantly charming and sometimes cloying and overlycheeky. To simply my feelings after many sequences was I trying to comprehend what was just given to me and how was I supposed to digest the experience all together.I mentioned my feelings that the film seemed to drag and felt a little too long  specifically the final scene in the desert which is roughly twentyfive to thirty minutes. Perhaps if your interest is in cheeky comedies and selfaware humor you won't mind at all. The film is certainly smarter and a lot brighter than some of the flyweight narrowminded comic exercises that have bestowed on the mainstream public in recent years. For once it's refreshing to see a comedy pay close attention to its characters its events and its performance never shortchanging anyone in the process.NOTE There's also something very very different about the cinematography of this picture different from any kind of visual atmosphere I have seen this year. The southern California area seems to be captured through a grungy saturated lens with colors appearing bright humid and very warm. This easily makes Seven Psychopaths one of the most visually calm pictures of the year.Starring Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken Tom Waits Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko. Directed by Martin McDonagh.".

Maybe it supposed to represent the director in some level but it is very interesting to see the story teller who doesn't even realize how little control he has on his own story.But I am mainly reviewing this title to praise Christopher Walken.

The movie stars Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson. Colin Farrell plays a writer struggling with a screen play called Seven Psychopaths. His friend Rockwell is desperate to help write the screenplay. In the midst of all of this however Rockwell also has a business on the side with Christopher Walken where they steal dogs return them and collect the reward money. Unfortunately Rockwell and Walken make the mistake of stealing Woody Harrelson's dog a psychopath who will stop at nothing to get his Shiatsu back.This script for this film is one of the most original I've ever seen. There are a lot of twists in this movie plotwise and genrewise making it a fantastic unpredictable adventure. Many would think that a movie that jumps around through different genres would be a bad thing but this movie is so fluid and every plot point connects so well that you aren't bothered in the slightest about deciding what the genre is of this film. A film with the title Seven Psychopaths promises intense violence and you will get that but not just that. This is not a mindless movie that uses just blood as entertainment. This is a smart movie that has plot and meaning. Yes it's violent but there is also drama and a surprising amount of comedy. This is without a doubt the funniest movie I have seen this year. The dialog in this film is perfect. All of the characters have a certain wit to them delivering lines that are beyond hilarious.The acting is superb. Christopher Walken is the best he's been in years. This could very well be one of my favorite performances from him. I liked Woody Harrelson in this movie more than I liked him in Zombie Land. I applaud Sam Rockwell for being in this movie. He is just so funny in this role and plays it perfectly. There couldn't have been a better cast for this film. Everyone was flawless.If you enjoy creative writing talented acting and movies that are allaround completely original then I encourage you to see this movie. Martin McDonagh has outdone himself and made an incredible movie. Seven Psychopaths is a must see. A".

	schema:headline " Psychotic hysterical and brilliant in its own way especially for cinephiles";
	schema:reviewBody "In the marketing for Seven Psychopaths CBS Films wants you to count  the film's seven stars but the one real psychopath and I mean that in  most positive and endearing way possible that matters is writer and  director Martin McDonagh whose sophomore film and followup to In  Bruges is a cockeyed stroke of genius.  Sticking with what the marketing tells us this is a film about a  couple dognappers who steal a mob boss's Shih Tzu and get their friend  and girlfriends wrapped up in the mess. What it doesn't tell you is  that Colin Farrell's character is a screenwriter working on a script  called Seven Psychopaths and all he has so far is the title. Oh and  Farrell's character is named Marty.  If you can't tell where this is going let's just say that Seven  Psychopaths is one of those films that reserves a special place for  movie junkies and cinephiles. Everyone will find a great deal to laugh  at especially Sam Rockwell but only a certain percentage will have a  gleeful appreciation for the metanarrative at work.  Luckily you don't have to identify as a film nerd to enjoy Seven  Psychopaths. The film is by no means exclusive or inaccessible it  just reaches another level of storytelling and maniacal brilliance if  you can make those connections. Beyond that layer the film offers a  potent combination of semigratuitous violence loony antics and some  stirring poignancy. Throw the meta layer back in and you have the  equivalent of if Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation had been directed by  Guy Ritchie.  The film begins with Marty an alcoholic writer looking for  inspiration for his seven psychopaths. His first psychopath is inspired  by the Jack of Diamonds Killer a guy running around Los Angeles  killing off midtohighranking mob men. Funny then that his nutty  friend Billy Rockwell should happen to steal Bonny the precious Shih  Tzu belonging to Charlie Woody Harrelson a sensitive yet unforgiving  mob boss. Charlie is able to track down Billy's partner Hans  Christopher Walken and the trio is forced to make themselves scarce.  If you're still using the poster to count then you're probably  wondering about the other three psychopaths. Well one is a true  psychopath and that's Zachariah Tom Waits who responds to an add  that Billy put in the paper to try and help Marty find more  inspiration.

	onyx:emotionText "In the marketing for Seven Psychopaths CBS Films wants you to count  the film's seven stars but the one real psychopath and I mean that in  most positive and endearing way possible that matters is writer and  director Martin McDonagh whose sophomore film and followup to In  Bruges is a cockeyed stroke of genius.  Sticking with what the marketing tells us this is a film about a  couple dognappers who steal a mob boss's Shih Tzu and get their friend  and girlfriends wrapped up in the mess. What it doesn't tell you is  that Colin Farrell's character is a screenwriter working on a script  called Seven Psychopaths and all he has so far is the title. Oh and  Farrell's character is named Marty.  If you can't tell where this is going let's just say that Seven  Psychopaths is one of those films that reserves a special place for  movie junkies and cinephiles. Everyone will find a great deal to laugh  at especially Sam Rockwell but only a certain percentage will have a  gleeful appreciation for the metanarrative at work.  Luckily you don't have to identify as a film nerd to enjoy Seven  Psychopaths. The film is by no means exclusive or inaccessible it  just reaches another level of storytelling and maniacal brilliance if  you can make those connections. Beyond that layer the film offers a  potent combination of semigratuitous violence loony antics and some  stirring poignancy. Throw the meta layer back in and you have the  equivalent of if Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation had been directed by  Guy Ritchie.  The film begins with Marty an alcoholic writer looking for  inspiration for his seven psychopaths. His first psychopath is inspired  by the Jack of Diamonds Killer a guy running around Los Angeles  killing off midtohighranking mob men. Funny then that his nutty  friend Billy Rockwell should happen to steal Bonny the precious Shih  Tzu belonging to Charlie Woody Harrelson a sensitive yet unforgiving  mob boss. Charlie is able to track down Billy's partner Hans  Christopher Walken and the trio is forced to make themselves scarce.  If you're still using the poster to count then you're probably  wondering about the other three psychopaths. Well one is a true  psychopath and that's Zachariah Tom Waits who responds to an add  that Billy put in the paper to try and help Marty find more  inspiration. Zachariah has a fascinating story of little consequence to  the film about how he and his wife decades ago went on a serial killer  killing spree gorily offing renowned American killers including  Zodiac. His wife left him however for getting too soft.  As for the ladies they have actually no bearing on the movie at all.

	schema:reviewBody "Depending on how you count there really are seven psychopaths. Also depending on how you count there could be more which is a good thing because Marty  the lead character played by Colin Farrell not the screenwriter Martin McDonagh  can use as many as he can find. Marty Colin Farrell is an alcoholic Irish screenwriter suffering from writer's block since Hollywood's needs and his ideals do not match up at all.Seven Pyschopaths the rather ingenious wellwritten violent hilarious crime drama comedy does manage to find a happy medium between what Hollywood wants and what romantic idealist Marty wants. If you can imagine how hard it would be to find that happy medium then you can probably imagine how easy it would be to find detractors for this film. They complain about the senseless violence the meandering story lines and the shifts in tone. But the brilliance in the screenplay and the ensemble cast can allow many to ignore all that.Marty wants to write a character study a meaningful one where he finds significant life events to reflect upon to find love and happiness. Hollywood wants an action film. One with shootouts with as many characters and as many violent deaths as could possibly be included. Marty is a gentle spirit even if he is neurotic has a bad taste in friends and indulges in unhealthy habits he does want to find that happy place in life. He relies on the chaotic crazy and cruel world around him and also his chaotic crazy and cruel friends to provide inspiration for his screenplay.Independent Spirit Award nominee Sam Rockwell plays Billy a manic ne'erdowell who kidnaps dogs and then returns them for the reward. His compatriot Hans Christopher Walken is a philosophical old soul who takes all the violence and craziness in stride. Their criminal actions could catch up to them sooner rather than later when psychopath Charlie Woody Harrelson has his dog stolen and he has no problem killing everybody in his path to retrieve his precious Shih Tzu.As these great actors and psychopathic characters all come together they provide Seven Psychopaths with exactly what was needed unrestrained shootouts and philosophical musings on life love and death. I would prefer just comedy but the script the great actors and the psychopathic characters provided that as well.".

I've been following this film for some time now and spreading the word trying to get as many of my friends to watch it when they get the chance and low and behold they are raving in approval.'In Bruges' writer and director Martin McDonagh returns with possibly the most perfectly written directed filmed and acted movie that I have had the pleasure of watching in years. I say this even though I cannot compare it to the last allegedly perfect movie I saw because goddamn it it can't be compared. It is in a league of its own and as a true original.Marty Colin Farrell is an Irish scriptwriter in LA constantly hung over treading on eggshells around his girlfriend and hanging around with his neurotic dogkidnapping best friend Billy. Unable to find the inspiration he needs to start his new script aptly titled the same as the film he is thrust into a deadly situation of unbelievable magnitude.Billy Sam Rockwell and his elderly friend Hans Christopher Walken have kidnapped the cute cuddly Shih Tzu of psycho gangster Charlie Woody Harrelson who will have his dog back at all costs. At the same time saving Marty and Hans' lives before a pair of mob goons can find out the whereabout of the dog vigilante mafia boss killer 'The Jack of Diamonds' executes the gansgters and spares the two men who decide to grab Billy and head for the hills.But never mind wondering what he's going to do when Charlie comes back for his dog Marty has yet to find the inspiration for his script closer to home than he has been looking as both Billy and Hans turn out to be two completely different breeds of psychopath.Without spoiling it this film is not your run of the mill loony comedy. That's just a consistently underlying theme throughout the entire movie. What it's really about is the importance and meaning of life to many individuals and what separates the psychopaths from the seemingly ordinary folk.What was most fascinating about Seven Psychopaths is that there is more wisdom emotional longing vulnerability and personality in each psychopath than there is in the presumably mentally stable characters. We know they're crazy and dangerous almost from the offset but at the same time we  and also Marty  cannot help but feel endeared towards them.So what we really have is a crime drama that is up to its ears in hilarious comedy tragedy and deep meaning and this to me is perfect enough before the style and the powerhouse acting takes it graciously towards the end credits.This film boasts a genius example of ideal ensemble casting which also includes an awesome turn by music legend and actor Tom Waits as Zachariah. It's also nice to see Abbie Cornish Kevin Corrigan and Harry Dean Stanton supporting.But OH MY GOD Christopher Walken's best in years Sam Rockwell's best in years and Woody Harrelson's best in years. You can thank the amazing writing and cinematography but the leads do so well with their own individual and collective roles that I was captivated from beginning to end and had to watch it twice within a few short days.Excellent through and through go own it on DVD and never let go!".

Next minute he says it's 'just a flesh wound' and carries on as though nothing has happened.

The movie does have some faults like some predictable plot points and the humor fails at some parts but this shouldn't discourage you from watching the film. It is worth the price of the ticket. Seven Psychopaths is one of the better movies to come out this season. It doesn't disappoint. Its a great flick to go out with the guys.

The next 30 minutes you are faced with a string of senseless dialog and some weirdos doing weird stuff. OK it's gonna be hilarious soon you think. The allexplaining twist is only seconds away when all will make sense and the ultimate wittiness of it all becomes obvious.But it never comes. It just goes on with one pointless scene after the next. Some people get killed in a disturbing way. And because it's disturbing and doesn't make sense it must be funny somehow mustn't it? No it must not. Bad movies are just bad movies no matter what the authors intentions were. There's not a single character in the movie that deserves any emotional consideration whatsoever not even the dog. I feel kind of bad writing this review. Usually when people say only negative things about a movie they didn't really understand it and are just expressing their frustration with a hate review. But I understand quite well what the movie was trying to be and I would have really wanted it to succeed just like Pulp Fiction did in a strange but great way or like the weird but always well thoughtthrough stuff Charlie Kaufmann writes. But the simple truth here is the author had no real idea for a movie so they went for a movie about movie making threw in seven psychos and a few murders and some weird talking that could be mistaken for some sort of philosophical pondering and hoped for an audience that doesn't make the mistake of bringing a brain with them.

	schema:reviewBody "Seven Psychopaths is a black comedy and comedy is highly subjective with black comedy even more so. I was loving this movie as a throwback to the violent yet humorous crime thrillers of the 1990s most of which were written or directly inspired by Tarantino.Seven Psychopaths plays out like a true homage to those classic Tarantino style flicks with witty dialogue quick and sudden acts of violence and colorful characters you just can't help but like despite their severe problems. Sam Rockwell is fabulous Colin Farrell nails it and both Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken are at the top of their game and combined with a strong first act the movie takes off from start like a rocket. About halfway through the film just as everything seems like it's coming together the true nature of the script reveals itself and in my opinion falls apart. What was a fantastic recreation of a classic genre turned into a parody of the genre and as the movie progressed it became increasingly self aware until it was a parody of itself. The plot and characters became increasingly ridiculous and over the top but since the movie is now a comedy you're supposed to be OK with that. I wasn't but I wanted to be I just wasn't feeling the shift in direction.There aren't seven psychopaths whose stories intertwine to serve a greater narrative there are actually only six with one being a dream and boring the other a marginal character who I would have liked to have seen more of and yet another only seen briefly. It's really a story about 3 psychopaths and the Colin Farrell screenwriter character becomes the focus but he got duller the more I got to know him. Once the movie slipped into self parody territory where the characters joked about genre clichs such as final shoot outs graphic violence and how women are depicted yet did all these things anyway I found myself bored. I was disappointed for a similar reason I was disappointed with Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation where the script was clearly self aware of filmmaking clichs so it joked about them only to end up doing them anyway. I would have preferred Seven Psychopaths been more sincere to the genre and actually tried to do something different or didn't and just further developed its plot and characters while providing the laughs through witty dialogue and clever staged violence. I laugh much more watching True Romance and Pulp Fiction. Perhaps the best joke towards the end of this film was that reading Noam Chomsky would provide for intelligent conversation.My mixed feelings on this movie remind me of No Country for Old Men where I was absolutely glued to the screen for the first half but completely turned off by the second half where it became a completely different movie. I understand that Seven Psychopaths Adaptation and No Country for Old Men are all critical darlings and I do recommend you check out this film for what it is but I'm writing this review for those who are of like mind  you're not alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where 2008's In Bruges saw the perfect marriage of heavy drama and rather hilarious dialogue writerdirector Martin McDonagh's newest venture Seven Psychopaths shows how easily a plot containing heavy drama and rather hilarious dialogue can all but fall apart if not perfectly structured. Starring the likes of Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken Tom Waits and Abbie Cornish the actual plot itself is kind of difficult to explain. It follows the story of a dog napping business lead by Rockwell and Walken a screenplay writer played by Farrell who has writers block a man also played by Walken attempting to deal with his wife's impending death a masked psycho killer who leaves playing cards on his victim's bodies a Quaker who seeks out revenge on the killer of his daughter a mafia boss played by Harrelson on a psychopathic quest to find his beloved Shih Tzu a man who calls himself a serial killer of serial killers and a Vietnamese priest no this is not the storyline of Kill Bill 3. While this synopsis may come off as overwhelming the fact that it is riddled with such interesting characters would lead one to believe that Seven Psychopaths is peppered with immensely intriguing story lines. But one would be wrong because instead what McDonagh has done here is preformed the cardinal sin of storytelling by creating a plethora of story lines with characters that by the third act nobody cares about.I cannot deny that there are more than a few laugh out loud moments here mostly in the first act which plays out like a very clever but understated comedy. But the rest of the film with its hypereccentric but purposeless storyline and its meandering ways is all sorts of disappointing. So I guess the real issue with Seven Psychopaths is that tonally it's too all over the place. During its momentary lapses of quippyness the movie is very funny and works the way it is intended. But when McDonagh attempts to create a dark atmosphere he doesn't hold back slicing throats shooting people in the back of the head burning people alive etc. In other words if one scene resembles an episode of The Odd Couple very timely reference I know then the very next scene contains gruesome Tarantinoesque violence but without the coolness factor that appears to come out of a different movie entirely. And while I could say that this movie may have worked better on every level in the hands of a filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino that only reinforces that fact that McDonagh is no Tarantino and shouldn't try to be.The Star Studded Cast Every one of the actors here is rather good in their roles chewing every bit of scenery they can get their hands on especially Rockwell who is given the best lines of the film. And since a large majority of American audiences never saw In Bruges this film is sure to garner Colin Ferrell some attention from audiences who are not used to seeing him play such a neurotic character. Furthermore the chemistry the cast has with one another especially Farrell and Rockwell is very watchable and gets no complaints from me. As for Chris Walken every critic is likely to try and say that his is the stand out performance here as he recites diatribes in his infamous speech pattern but in this reviewer's opinion his characterperformance in Seven Psychopaths is nothing more than a peculiar if not rather forgettable one.Final Thought Seven Psychopaths is the type of film that seems confused about what it wants to be beginning as a flat out comedy filled with witty back and forth then quickly transforming into an ultraviolent revenge story filled with some of the most graphic sequences I've seen outside of the horror genre in quite a while. So while Seven Psychopaths does display moments of smart comedic brilliance which include some of the best lines and observations of any film of 2012 far too much of this movie is a mishmash of extensive and tonally odd brutality and men sitting around speaking in absurd nonsequiturs. And all of this is topped off by McDonagh's script which takes an entertaining plot and careens it into a seminonsensicalsemishrug inducing ending. In short because Seven Psychopaths teeters so carelessly on the fence of selfawareness without choosing any particular side it is sure to become be it rather slowly tiresome to some audiences who were expecting to see a straight forward crude adult comedy. Truly this is like the Coen brother movie that the Coen brothers never wanted to makebut hey Spoiler Alert at least there is no dog killing just in case you were wondering after watching the commercials.Written by Markus Robinson Edited by Nicole I.

	onyx:emotionText "Where 2008's In Bruges saw the perfect marriage of heavy drama and rather hilarious dialogue writerdirector Martin McDonagh's newest venture Seven Psychopaths shows how easily a plot containing heavy drama and rather hilarious dialogue can all but fall apart if not perfectly structured. Starring the likes of Colin Farrell Sam Rockwell Woody Harrelson Christopher Walken Tom Waits and Abbie Cornish the actual plot itself is kind of difficult to explain. It follows the story of a dog napping business lead by Rockwell and Walken a screenplay writer played by Farrell who has writers block a man also played by Walken attempting to deal with his wife's impending death a masked psycho killer who leaves playing cards on his victim's bodies a Quaker who seeks out revenge on the killer of his daughter a mafia boss played by Harrelson on a psychopathic quest to find his beloved Shih Tzu a man who calls himself a serial killer of serial killers and a Vietnamese priest no this is not the storyline of Kill Bill 3.

	schema:headline " I did not expect it would be such a good film";
	schema:reviewBody "In the beginning of the film an old man Luis Fernando Rey is working on his memoirs or something of a kind. The chapter he is currently writing is the monologue of his estranged daughter Elisa. The father's voice recites her confession 'I hadn't seen my father for years I almost never wrote him... When I got my sister's telegram telling me of his illness... I decided to go to Madrid. Selfishly speaking finally I had an excuse to get away from home... I left I now realize knowing I'd never return'.Luis had left his family many years ago. He did not write a farewell letter or took anything with him. His wife was devastated and her belief that Luis was a sick and selfish man somehow affected her daughters. Luis felt that he had a talent for literature and moved to a distant countryside because he couldn't stand the routine full of false values. But in the beginning we see Luis' family coming to the countryside to his birthday. The visitors are Elisa Geraldine Chaplin and her sister Isabel with her husband and two children. Elisa finds some papers in the father's room. Luis is painfully reflecting on his life he is tired because he isn't sure whether all his past experience has any value. Now he has come to a conclusion that one just needs to enjoy every moment of his life but he is afraid to take this new path thinking that it might be too late. As Elisa reads these words the sadness in her eyes is striking it seems that she has just found an explanation to something very important for her.The family spends a few days in the countryside and is about to leave but at the last moment Elisa decides to stay. She and Luis go for a walk it is very beautiful there. In the field Elisa sees a strange white stone and a vase with flowers by its side. Luis tells her a story some years ago he encountered here a murdered woman later someone brought the flowers  it was actually the killer. Elisa is deeply affected by the story and imagines that she is this woman.As time passes Elisa and her father get closer. Luis takes her to a local church school where he teaches kids. There is another scene when Elisa recalls one of her father's letters. He confesses that his attitude to his own writing is not what it used to be. He would write several drafts for his letter and hoped they'd be published one day there was something snobbish in this practice. Now it is clear to him that a writer is just one of the many jobs in the world he is not superior to a simple worker. This understanding is tied to one of the closing scenes. The children whom he teaches are rehearsing a play and they constantly argue about the roles. Everyone wants to play a king or some other man of power no one agrees to take a role of a poor man and there is a belief that one must be a good person to deserve a 'decent' role. But it is a wrong perception because one's role is not to be confused with the life itself. A good man is the one who makes the best of the role he is given. Elisa wants to have a look at her father's manuscript but he says he can't show it at the moment. Later Elisa tells him a story of her failed relationships with Antonio her husband who has cheated on her with her best friend. This marriage was doomed from the beginning and she always felt it but for some reason tried to deceive herself and now her world collapsed. Antonio comes to the countryside and tries to talk to Elisa. She explains to him that everything is over between them they have a painful exchange of reproaches. What comes after Elisa sends Antonio home is a surreal scene of closeness on the verge of incest. It occurs in the mind of either Elisa or Luis who at this moment writes down Elisa thoughts of her life with a man she has never actually known. He stops when he hears her crying in the other room and goes to comfort her but she bursts out in rage and they nearly beat each other.Next morning Elisa lingers by a white stone and says a sorrowful monologue 'Nobody has told me that all this beautiful story would have such a horrible ending'. Elisa imagines again that she is the murdered woman to be more precise she lives deliberately through the woman's horrible death as if feeling that something inside of her must be killed. Then she and her father are reunited but he is getting worse. He refuses to go to hospital. In the morning while Elisa is out he leaves too. Elisa encounters him in the field he is dying and this is a really unforgettable sad and beautiful episode one of the most affectionate farewell scenes I have seen in the movies. Elisa stays at her father's home and continues his book. At the end she writes down the same monologue that we heard in the beginning spoken out by her father.It seemed to me really weird that 'Elisa vida mia' is a film so little known. It is masterfully crafted and beautifully acted deep and full of nuances. I loved this film just as much as Cria Cuervos and would recommend it to everyone.".

	schema:headline " Thoughtprovoking but slow Carlos Saura film about a complex relationship between father and daughter";
	schema:reviewBody "Fascinating though overlong tale plenty of good feeling  haunting moodpieces  enticing images and attractive ending . This weird flick contains symbolism  emotion  drama and an almost diabolic spell . Well directed film by Carlos Saura  including his own story and screenplay  who tried to create a charming flick plenty of symbolist scenes  flashbacks and metaphors by tackling a description about a particular fatherdaughter relation . The picture is set in a village called Melque De Cercas  Segovia . Elisa has not seen her father Luis for long time ago  but she receives a message from her sister Isabel Isabel Mestres telling their dad is ill and wants to visit him for his birthday . The daddy called Luis Fernando Rey is an old retired teacher who occasionally teaches at a girls school  and lives at a rural mansion in Segovia countryside . Elisa  then decides to travel from Madrid  along with Isabel  her brotherinlaw Julin Joaquin Hinojosa and their two children to visit Luis . There Elisa gets closer to Luis  her estranged daddy  understanding why he abandoned her mummy years ago . Elisa tells Luis that her relation to husband Norman Briski has terminated because she was deceived . When Antonio unexpectedly arrives at home  things go awry . Agreeable film filled with excessive dialogue  haunting moodpieces  marvelous frames  and portentous interpretations . However  it turns out to be slowmoving  dull and little bit boring  being mostly filmed in Segovia . This extraordinary flick spells through intricate patterns of frames  sets  sound and color . This film along with others as Cria Cuervos  Peppermint Frapp were notorious in the years of the Franco's downfall dictatorship including provoking and polemic issues and played by known and prestigious actors as Geraldine Chaplin  Fernando Rey  Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez  Monica Randall and Hector Alterio . Elisa Vida Mia stars Geraldine Chaplin who displays a nice acting as a woman in a moment of crisis of her marriage and decides to stay with his father  taking place a complex relationship . Fernando Rey also gives an awesome interpretation as an old teacher with dark secrets . And Norman Briski as her hubby Antonio who cheated her with her best friend as well as Isabel Mestres as her sister . His style is pretty much dry in the atmosphere as in the fresh dialog  as well as realistic  and including fantastic elements as when appears some strange images  dreams and nightmares . Elisa Vida Mia is one of Saura's and fundamental in his filmography where shows efficiently some peculiar characters and shot at the height of his creativity in a period cultural difficult where the enormous censorship of the political regime exacerbated the ingenuity and imagination of the scriptwriters . Splendid  luxurious photography with juicy atmosphere by Teo Escamilla who along with Luis Cuadrado are considered to be two of the best Spanish cameramen  both of whom worked for Saura . Interesting screenplay by the same director based on a original story . Moving and emotive musical score composed by piano . This touching picture will appeal to Spanish films buffs .The motion picture perfectly produced by magnificent producer Elias Querejeta was compellingly directed by Carlos Saura  a good Spanish movies director . He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed Los Golfos 1962 dealing with juvenile delinquency from a sociological point of view . He subsequently made LLanto Por Un Bandido 1964 starred by an European allstarcast . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally and in proof of it he won many prizes among which there are the following ones Silver Bear in Festival of Berlin for Peppermint Frapp 1967 and the successful La Caza 1966  considered to be his undisputed masterpiece  that also won numerous prizes in International Festivals and in which four characters facing each other and terminating into a jarring burst of violence . Saura achieved Special Jury Awards in Cannes for La Prima Anglica 1974 in 1973 and for Cra Cuervos 1976 in 1975. Also the film Mam Cumple Cien Aos 1979 got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival. He subsequently made Deprisa  Deprisa based on facts about juvenile delinquency in Spain since the 80s  as he tried to take a position in favour of outcast people and he got to make a both lyric and documentarystyle cinema . In 1990 he won two Goya  The Spanish Oscar  as best adapted screenplay writer and best director . Saura became an expert on Iberian musical adaptations as Carmen  Amor Brujo  Bodas De Sangre  Sevillanas  Iberia  Salome  Fado Flamenco  and even recently Opera as Io  Don Giovanni".

Elisa tells Luis that her relation to husband Norman Briski has terminated because she was deceived . When Antonio unexpectedly arrives at home  things go awry . Agreeable film filled with excessive dialogue  haunting moodpieces  marvelous frames  and portentous interpretations . However  it turns out to be slowmoving  dull and little bit boring  being mostly filmed in Segovia . This extraordinary flick spells through intricate patterns of frames  sets  sound and color . This film along with others as Cria Cuervos  Peppermint Frapp were notorious in the years of the Franco's downfall dictatorship including provoking and polemic issues and played by known and prestigious actors as Geraldine Chaplin  Fernando Rey  Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez  Monica Randall and Hector Alterio . Elisa Vida Mia stars Geraldine Chaplin who displays a nice acting as a woman in a moment of crisis of her marriage and decides to stay with his father  taking place a complex relationship . Fernando Rey also gives an awesome interpretation as an old teacher with dark secrets . And Norman Briski as her hubby Antonio who cheated her with her best friend as well as Isabel Mestres as her sister . His style is pretty much dry in the atmosphere as in the fresh dialog  as well as realistic  and including fantastic elements as when appears some strange images  dreams and nightmares . Elisa Vida Mia is one of Saura's and fundamental in his filmography where shows efficiently some peculiar characters and shot at the height of his creativity in a period cultural difficult where the enormous censorship of the political regime exacerbated the ingenuity and imagination of the scriptwriters . Splendid  luxurious photography with juicy atmosphere by Teo Escamilla who along with Luis Cuadrado are considered to be two of the best Spanish cameramen  both of whom worked for Saura . Interesting screenplay by the same director based on a original story . Moving and emotive musical score composed by piano . This touching picture will appeal to Spanish films buffs .The motion picture perfectly produced by magnificent producer Elias Querejeta was compellingly directed by Carlos Saura  a good Spanish movies director . He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed Los Golfos 1962 dealing with juvenile delinquency from a sociological point of view . He subsequently made LLanto Por Un Bandido 1964 starred by an European allstarcast . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally and in proof of it he won many prizes among which there are the following ones Silver Bear in Festival of Berlin for Peppermint Frapp 1967 and the successful La Caza 1966  considered to be his undisputed masterpiece  that also won numerous prizes in International Festivals and in which four characters facing each other and terminating into a jarring burst of violence . Saura achieved Special Jury Awards in Cannes for La Prima Anglica 1974 in 1973 and for Cra Cuervos 1976 in 1975. Also the film Mam Cumple Cien Aos 1979 got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival. He subsequently made Deprisa  Deprisa based on facts about juvenile delinquency in Spain since the 80s  as he tried to take a position in favour of outcast people and he got to make a both lyric and documentarystyle cinema .

	schema:reviewBody "Stphane Briz's Not Here to Be Loved Je ne suis pas l pour tre aim is the mournful character study of an aging divorced court bailiff a hussier de justice who handdelivers eviction notices and requisitions property  a distasteful job and business passed on by his father which he understandably hates  and on weekends goes to a retirement home where his father  the dad from hell whom it's utterly impossible to please  makes cruel remarks to him. Life has little to offer the dour and unsmiling JeanClaude till he starts going across the street from his office to attend a tango class first glimpsed enticingly from afar like the dance studio in Almodvar's Talk to Me. There he meets and starts seeing a much younger woman.At his first class he's approached by another student Francoise Anne Consigny not because she's attracted to him but because his mother babysat for her when she was little. She's supposed to be marrying a schoolteacher named Thierry Lionel Abelanski whom she's already living with not altogether happily. He has taken off half a year to write a book and does nothing but complain about how badly it's going. Francoise is obviously as displeased with Thierry as JeanClaude is with his entire life. Both suffer with what the French call mal de vie. Francoise and JeanClaude are both bottled up and with their awkward silences they send confused signals to each other.The movie isn't a happy ride but develops conviction and a subtle lifeaffirming feel thanks to the nuanced performance of sadfaced Patrick Chesnais  which got him nominated for a Best Actor Csar last year. Perhaps one of the reasons the French can make a film like this is their wellestablished willingness to see aging unhandsome men as potentially attractive to the likes of Emmanuelle Bart and Catherine Deneuve. Chesnais has a kind of dignity that neither his deeply lined face nor his hangdog manner can erase. Anne Consigny is subtle as the lady friend and longtime veteran film actor George Wilson is formidable as the hateful and ultimately pathetic father. Minimalist and depressing this film is but not boring because director and cast wring the ultimate riches from every moment.There is much subtlety and humanity in this film whose minimal plot and minimalist style give the actors and their characters maximum room for development within a narrow but compellingly real range of emotion. But for some the result may be a bit overshadowed by other treatments of shutdown male characters like Daniel Auteuil's violinmaker in Claude Sautet's luminous Un coeur en hiver. It seems possible that indeed this film in the series will not be picked up for US distribution because it's so downbeat. If so a pity because this movie is not only a subtle character study but one that's very French.Shown as part of the RendezVous with French Cinema in New York's Lincoln Center in March 2006 Je ne suis pas l pour tre aim opened in Paris October 12 2005.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie because it was advertised as having Argentine tango in it. I am a tango dancer and I was completely blown away by it. But even so let me emphasize that this is not only a movie for tango dancers. I spoke to a nontango dancer right after the showing and she was equally fascinated. But since this was the reason I wanted to see the film I choose the tango angle to comment on it.In this movie tango serves as a metaphor for how people communicate and meet in the truest sense of the word. But apart from this Argentinian input it is very French in so far as it has all the significant qualities of a typical French flick long takes closeups much silence and intense but subtle emotions  mostly all of the above at the same time. And altogether quite conducive to the tango content much more so than an American production could have achieved I daresay.All throughout the 20th century the Tango and France especially Paris have formed a lasting passionate bond a love affair that feeds both sides and still prospers. Tango is everywhere in Paris. It's as much part of the upper middle class culture as going to vernissages is. It is useful to know this otherwise one could wonder how the main protagonist JeanClaude Delsart a middleaged very reclusive marshal could so easily end up on the floor of the tango studio across the street from his office.The way Argentine tango is portrayed in this movie is gracefully true to the soul of tango. It has only one flashy scene a performance by a professional tango couple and as usual with public tango performances I find this one of its weakest moments pure form and posture completely void of feelings and emotions.But the important scenes in the studio do capture aptly what is so fascinating and endearing about the mastering of this dance the carefulness and timidity in a beginner's approach toward his or her partner's body the subtlety the listening the addictiveness of the intimate atmosphere the beautiful beautiful music the gradually growing confidence and freedom andsometimes eventually  the passion.Tango can at times have a quite positive and joyful air about it. But its origins have much more in common with what the Portuguese call fado. A melancholic mood full of heartache and longing with the heaviness of reality weighing down on minds and souls that are capable of enduring deep sorrow and intense passion.This is what the movie is about. Je ne suis pas l pour tre aim could be translated as I do not exist to be loved. A stark even cruel normative statement that is the point of departure for Delsart. The rest is a journey and no I will not tell where it ends. The story as it evolves is sometimes almost unbearably sad and yet the protagonists keep on living through it. The dance isn't over until the last note is played.The tango metaphor works extremely well with this story and does so until the end. Compared to other tango movies this is one of the better ones. Of course nothing beats Sally Potter's The Tango Lesson  but what could.The only reason I don't give this movie full marks is the fact that some of the plot turns are a bit too predictable. But nevertheless this is an engaging story well told well made with extraordinary characters. A modern fairy tale  or maybe not?".

She has that 'something special' which cannot be quantified or defined but you just have to keep staring at her as if she were a new species suddenly discovered of unknown habits who might do or say anything but never does. This quiet brooding film carries introspection and intimacy to new cinematic extremes and invents a higher definition for 'subtlety'. The characters are deeply depressed and wholly incapable of expressing themselves so that this is a not a film to watch if you are feeling down. On the other hand manic depressives might be cheered up by it because they would see that there can after all be communication between moles in adjoining tunnels. The tango provides the medium for this cheek to cheek resonance which transcends speech. Patrick Chesnais and Georges Wilson as his father are superbly inarticulate having both mastered the art of noncommunication. This film is deeply sensitive in the same way that small mammals are it blinks its eyes wonderingly as we shine light into its face 'Am I really on camera?' Yes. And you are doing really well. A wonderful wallow in disabled humanity with suppressed needs. Although I felt sorry for the characters I wanted to kick them in the backsides and make them snap out of it and 'get a life' preferably each other's.".

There he meets Consigny a quietly beautiful young girl Consigny is actually 43 but looks at least ten years younger engaged to be married and living with one of those Mr Cellophane guys that other guys always say 'what does SHE see in HIM' about. The livein lover is a teacher who has taken a sabbatical to write a novel and has writer's block. Consigny is drawn to Chesnais because his mother once baby sat her and her feelings are confused. Not a great deal happens they grow close share tender moments infused with gently warmth part.This is Art House fodder writ large but no worse in fact all the better for it. A delightful movie.".

Affleck's directing was solid and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. I loved it. It did have one irritating thing though kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book which to be fair is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role I said 'Well that's going to be interesting.'....The movie's fun it's thrilling it's pertinent it's timely he said. But look Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner.The old postscript sent the message that for political reasons Canada took the credit. A sarcastic kicker noted that Taylor received 112 citations. The clear implication was that he did not deserve them.SeptOct. 2012 thestar.com.So the USA does another revision on history here. I believe 'Argo' goes this far. Yes it's based on a true story  the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners rioters gate climbers etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation actually they were barely there. Since the movie premiered Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.I can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible don't get me wrong. But this film needs to let the audience know that more explicitly than it does even after the changed postscripts.Still a really entertaining and riveting film very well done and easily worth seeing. As a matter of fact don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I understand it may flatter US patriotism or recall memories to those who remember the events and I don't even dispute Affleck's directorial and acting skills. However this is a completely superfluous empty and desperately predictable movie. The historical inaccuracy has been pointed out by several other reviews no things didn't happen that way the Canadians deserve much more credit in that operation than this portrayal ever shows. Notwithstanding the role of the US in sustaining a puppet dictatorship during the Shah and actively interfering in a sovereign country's domestic politics for decades prior to the events. But this is only a secondary concern historical accuracy is not the most important factor for a fiction even when it's based on actual events. What I dispute is how incredibly shallow and predictable the storytelling is clich anonymous US CIA antihero agent with issues at home goes to a dangerous place saves innocent lives takes risks against orders comes out victorious to reunite with his family. Who on Earth cares seriously? And no the fact that it's based on historical events  and therefore you can't argue with history  is not an answer precisely because the script takes so many liberties with the events. I don't care about the liberties taken with history but I care about the ability to portray convincingly the complexity of human emotions and relationships. There is none here. And make no mistake a fictitious 2 min car chase at an airport is the closest you ll get to see some emotions ie. anguish at being killed by the revolutionary guards. The characters come out of a cardboard factory they have zero critical selfreflection about their own role in interfering with a foreign country's domestic affairs total solidarity with each other and pure love for their partners. This is a Disney version of human psyche a dishonest and partial historical account and a debauchery of time energy and money ill spent. Affleck is an able actor and I hope will prove more convincing in his future efforts as a director but what really baffles me is not the mediocrity of this film it's the uncritical enthusiasm of so many for it.".

While I was watching it something was bothering me but I didn't say anything because I thought the other two were into it Ben Affleck with a beard doing CIA stuff in 1980 Iran being a sort of archetype of what an cool movie should be these days...Anyway I kept my mouth shut and when the movie ended I looked at my two companions. They both seemed a little off I couldn't tell if it was indifference or confusion or flat out boredom. One thing was clear though this movie sucked.First at no point whatsover does one feel any connection andor sympathy for the main character. Ben Affleck makes the SAME FACE during the entire movie his eyes gazing in the distance and his mouth gaping ever so slightly giving him an expression vaguely similar to what I imagine someone coming out of months of Electroshock Therapy would have. I never saw how this 'acting' contributed to the 'character' in any way. In fact there is almost no character to speak of and you'd almost forget him if it weren't for the fact that he is in almost every scene of the movie.Second Spoiler I guess even thought it started with a cool premise the story unraveled poorly and I honestly didn't get the point. So what they spent the whole movie training all of it to get through a 5 minute scene at the customs where nothing really happens and another climatic 5 minute chase on the runway where clearly the car has no chance of stopping the plane and in fact it doesn't so there the end? I mean seriously?? I can only imagine that this movie has such a good rating because most people haven't even bothered reviewing it. There was a bunch of other stuff I wanted to complain about but that movie was so bland that I forgot.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was so horrible that I can't even begin to describe it.First I'm going to break it down in 2 sections the technical part and the historical aspect.The Story was a mess and clich. Such stories have been done so many times that 2 minutes within the movie you are able to guess every event and turnover that the story is going to take An Unknown CIA agent who has troubles with his wife and family goes on a dangerous life threatening mission to save the lives of Americans. In the process he disobeys a direct order accomplishes the mission comes back home and gets a medal for it. And he is reunited with his family. And everyone lives happily ever after. The end.That's the movie summed up. And I can bet everyone can agree that it's a clich and overdone story. Other aspect is the historical aspect. I'm from Iran myself but I don't live there now so I know exactly what went down. Let me start by saying that the movie in fact IS a true story but it's not the WHOLE truth. They managed to forget some important notes that I'm sure lots of people noticed but chose to ignore it because of all the undeserved hype around the movie. First thing is that the U.S government could give up the Shah at any time and got the hostages back in a moment's notice. But they didn't. Why? Didn't the lives of 60 US citizens outweigh the life of a dictator who needed to be brought to justice? This was never mentioned. Secondly the Canadians role it's very popular among the people to call that mission Canadian Caper. The Canadians had a HUGE role in this process. In fact they had the main role. They were the ones who issued REAL Canadian passports they were the ones who arranged the flights and coordinated people within Iran. But we see their role cut down substantially to just the mere presents of the Canadian Ambassador. Thirdly the movie fails to mention that the attack on the US embassy in Tehran was a result of decades of the US interference in Iran's politics and decision making All the way from appointing prime ministers to staging coups. That's what drove the people to that point and the film once again fails to mention that. The film goes on to do what a typical Hollywood true story does. Dramatize actual events and make it into a Hollywood film. and a typical Hollywood ending scene which never happened in real Once again horrible horrible movie. Rating 410  Only for the visual effects and production design which was adequate.".

Ironic because the central tenet of the tale is an imaginary movie and how Hollywood could create a lie to mask the rescue told in a way that is in itself as big a fantasy as the movie for that very rescue.I am a big fan of Ben Affleck and enjoy his films and think he is a capable director. But sadly Argo is pretty dull and even the fake scenes made up to ratchet up any tension fall flat.The acting is not particularly that good either. Not because the actors were at fault. Clea DuVall is a fine actress and Arkin and Goodman both excellent. But sadly the script does not give them a lot to work with. The fake scenes in the Canadian Ambassadors house are hardly riveting. Although we do get a bit of Led Zeppelin IV which showed they had some musical taste.Afflecks character is pretty two dimensional with a bit of a sad family background thrown in to make us sympathetic. Sadly it does not work. The CIA look a bit more organised than Zero Dark Thirty but we do get the odd banging and shouting scenes at the climactic fake finale scene as they rush desperately to make the flight out of Iran.That whole segment of the film was quite the worst part of the whole exercise and the shots of the Revolutionary Guard chasing the plane was frankly silly more than tense. Of course in reality they just turned up early in the morning and were waved with no fuss onto their escape flight and the movie cover was barely an aspect of the getaway.Another aspect of the movie was how it makes a point that the British and New Zealand embassies turned away folks from the American embassy which was NOT remotely the case and both embassies played a part in keeping them safe. I understand that for the narrative and pace of the movie these facts were not addressed. But I don't understand why Affleck felt the need to lie about what these people did by saying they did NOT help. Why not just say nothing at all. I guess it is a sop to the uninformed American audience who like to think that their allies are so unreliable and it makes the American part in the rescue more important. The Iranian's or Eyeranians as they have become known don't get much of a good deal either reduced to screaming lunatics rampaging around the streets hanging people from mobile cranes. But let's not forget how they ended up like this due to decades of Western interference. I am sure the vast majority of people there are decent enough folks. But America needs its boogie men and after all to be fair the hostage taking and probably rather frightening captivity of the other 50 odd Americans was not a fantasy. Overall the lies and fantasy of Argo overwhelm the good parts of the tale and drag it into the realms of the nick of time Bourne type thriller without the car chases shoot outs or cool martial arts fights.Along with Zero dark Thirty and Lincoln another revisionist pap fest wrapped in red white and blue. Which is a shame as the real story was quite a decent tale on it's own but probably not as exciting.".

Proof is present as it won 3 BAFTA's for best picture best director and best editing also nominated for a further 8 Oscars in 85th Academy Awards.The film is packed with a sense of threat peril and intensity all portrayed exceptionally well through the ensemble cast including Ben Affleck The Town John Goodman Big Lebowski Bryan Cranston Breaking Bad Alan Arkin Edward Scissorhands and Victor Garber Titanic. The ending is by far the most intense ending I have seen in a long time visually presented in such an astounding way.Director Ben Affleck started out his auteur career after his directional debut Gone Baby Gone became critically acclaimed three years later The Town came out with an Oscar nomination.

	schema:reviewBody "It could not be more islamophobic if it tried. I am not saying the Iranian revolution was something pretty. It really wasn't. Here is a list of the disturbing in the portrayal of Iran in Affleck's Argo When the Iranian people spoke Farsi in the film there were no English subtitles. If an American spoke farsi there magically appeared subtitles. Every single Iranian in the film was angry. This was the only emotion they could express. According to Argo all Iranians are hostile. Showed no culture not a single educated Iranian of there own right. There was one good Iranian who was a housekeeper to the Canadian ambassador. No character development at all she serves her purpose and leaves. Apparently fled to Iraqi cause thats going to end well for her children.

Here is a list of the disturbing in the portrayal of Iran in Affleck's Argo When the Iranian people spoke Farsi in the film there were no English subtitles. If an American spoke farsi there magically appeared subtitles. Every single Iranian in the film was angry. This was the only emotion they could express. According to Argo all Iranians are hostile. Showed no culture not a single educated Iranian of there own right. There was one good Iranian who was a housekeeper to the Canadian ambassador. No character development at all she serves her purpose and leaves. Apparently fled to Iraqi cause thats going to end well for her children.

In the next shot from the side she is gone. That is basic continuity. The head of security for the US embassy out of the blue decides to open the door to 'reason with these people' only to be taken hostage within 5 microseconds. That is beyond stupid. The entire film crew plot never makes any sense and is never put to work as everything comes down to a security guard at the airport by accident reading about the filming of the movie. Right. What are the chances of him having a magazine on his table and accidentally stumbling upon just that article ? The guard then calls the office in LA which had already been shut down but Goodman and Arkin for some inexplicable reason HAVE to go there in a hurry even at the expense of ruining the shooting for another movie. What do they want in that office and why the hurry ? The final car chase at the airport is the low point. There is no way an open jeep can keep up with a commercial airliner at full takeoff speed. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just another Ben Affleck ego trip as we are treated to many many closeups of his face.".

Maybe with the positives?Well I found the pacing to be pretty good and this film wasn't an overlong snoozefest like Lincoln so that made it somewhat entertaining. Some of the camera work was very goodI really liked some of the shots they took. Bryan Cranston was amazing in his roleit made me want his character to be the lead actually. Alan Arkin also shone in his role. Finally the editing was good and is rightfully nominated for an Oscar.SPOILERS!All of the other Oscar nominations are pure folly. Best Picture? Absolutely not. Really? A more boring Oceans 11 meets the streets of Tehran is good enough for Best Picture these days? How sad is that? Best Screenplay? So turning an interesting reallife caper into a droll boring formulaic Hollywood movie is a good thing? The dialogue was generally trash when Goodman and Arkin weren't delivering oneliners. At no point did any character say anything about themselves or their situation that felt like it actually mattered or had any impact. Best Sound? Seriously? In a movie that has a soundtrack populated with Led Zeppelin Van Halen and Scottish bagpipes? Sure real original....You can go to any college bar in America and hear that soundtrack. Did America's movie establishment collectively snort a few lines of PCPlaced coke before watching this? Is that how it came to be such a great experience?As for the picture itself aside from the nominations this played quite fast and loose with actual historical facts which is kind of a nono when doing a film based on reality. To divide the credit 955 USACanada is about a 50point swing from where it probably should be and Canadian reviewers have said as much. Also the fact that Iranians are writing in that they feel the need to say they are not from Attila and the Hun and they aren't all bloodthirsty psychos bent on pillaging and murdering is pretty telling. Hollywood hasn't produced a film so stereotypically wrong about a whole race of people for what 3 months? I mean Persian culture developed mathematics for crying out loud! Yet this group of people has no more human qualities now than territorial apes? The fact that this was set in Tehran which makes Iranians kind of important to the story and not a SINGLE Iranian is portrayed with any shred of a conscience is deeply troubling. The pigeonholing of Iranians as barbarians and Canadians like a little ineffectual brother is absurd.I was struggling with the fact that the movie would have been so much better had Ben Affleck's character actually been played by Chuck Norris! That says something and not that I'm a fan of Walker Texas Ranger which I'm not. The worst part aside from 35 minutes of Affleckface screen time was the meeting he went to and completely shredded everyone's ideas which were stupid but...no one had any other ideas seriously? In an intelligence agency?. He subsequently proposed something so preposterous that no intelligence agency would EVER have greenlighted it except for that it actually happened...hmmm...HOW? Maybe some more background about how this proposal made it through! Surely that's not still classified at this point. This is how you immerse your audience in the story Ben you need to be stronger with the detailsand give history buffs a reason to say hmmm that's something I didn't know!TLDR As for my rating being 210 which may seem overly harsh well an OK movie technically was ruined by historical pandering a suspenseless caper that was oh so predictable and a series of implausible action scenes with virtually no action in them. That this and Lincoln will be duking it out for many Oscars really makes me happy that I don't go to the cinema all that often anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here we go again. This time a really exciting true story has been dumbed down with mostly fabrications by Ben Affleck and his writers for reasons unknown.Argo claims to be an accurate account of the evasion and escape of six American embassy staff from Iran. Tag lines for the movie Argo state the movie was fake but the story is completely true. Nothing could be further from the truth. Argo is as fake as the movie cover story in the true story and in fact this movie cover story was concocted by the Canadians not the CIA.Argo is mostly a complete fabrication of the events surrounding the evasion and escape of the six American Embassy employees from Iran and not only deters from the exciting true story see Escape From Iran the Canadian Caper but does a tremendous disservice to the staff of the Canadian embassy especially the late John Sheardown. Mr. Sheardown was the first Canadian the Americans contacted for asylum and he and his wife Zena actually did hide some of the American evaders in their home in Tehran for almost three months. Yet the late Mr. Sheardown and his wife are not even mentioned in the movie Argo. Also the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor and his wife were relegated to the role of mere overwrought if not somewhat incompetent bystanders. This is misleading in the extreme. Argo's original credits stated that the awards received by the Canadian Ambassador and his staff for their role in the evasion and escape were undeserved since it was a complete CIA operation. This is a lie. Ambassador Taylor called these postscript lines disgraceful and insulting and demeaning to the Canadians involved. This movie's claim that Canada was allowed to take credit for the operation because the escape plan was a secret CIA operation is also a misleading lie. Argo's claim that there was only some cursory help from the Canadians is a misleading fabrication.U.S. President Jimmy Carter commented on the accuracy of the Argo story when he appeared on CNN recently Thursday night Feb 21 2013. President Carter said 90 per cent of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was Canadian but the film gives almost full credit of the plan to the American CIA. Also in a recent address to Queen's University President Carter called Argo a complete distortion of what happened. He stated I saw the movie Argo recently and I was taken back by its distortion of what happened because almost everything that was heroic or courageous or innovative was done by Canada and not the United States. Argo's claim that it was a completely a CIA operation is untrue and an insult to the Canadians who helped the Americans to evade capture and escape from Iran. The Canadian exit visas and passports issued to the Americans were forgeries made on authentic documents and passports that were supplied by the Canadian government not the CIA. In truth the CIA agent was actually in Iran for less then 36 hours and he was not even at the airport when the Americans exited Iran. It was the Canadian Ambassador his wife and his staff who smuggled the Americans through Iranian controls and checkpoints and onto the departing flight at Tehran airport.Ben Affleck must apologize to The Canadian Ambassador the ambassador's wife the late John Sheardown's widow Zena Sheardown and all the other Canadian Embassy staff members who made the escape of the six Americans from Iran possible. Also Mr. Affleck should then apologize to all Canadians. I was going to say Argofk yourself to Mr. Affleck but why bother.From a technical point the cinematography is very good and with several exceptions the cast was adequate. However Argo's script is something you should not put aside lightly it should be thrown with great force.This story needs to be remade perhaps using the script from Escape From Iran  The Canadian Caper and not turned into some mindless drivel that is represented by the movie Argo. The true story of the evasion and escape of the six Americans from Iran is so exciting and full of tension that it would definitely keep you on the edge of your seat unlike Argo which is full of something else.310 stars for the cinematography only.".

And that's not all each tension filled moment is followed by an even more tension filled moment like a boss level in Super Mario World. First it's just some jumps but wait fireballs and what's this the ceiling is falling very stressful.Oh that's something else this movie lacks suspense. I didn't feel any of these so called hostages were in any danger.

The tension in this film is so well done it's ... over cooked. Yeah I said it.Wow the car won't start and wait spoiler alert it starts. The security guard is staring at her fake passport for what seems to be an eternity is this the end spoiler alert he passes it back and sends them on through. And that's not all each tension filled moment is followed by an even more tension filled moment like a boss level in Super Mario World. First it's just some jumps but wait fireballs and what's this the ceiling is falling very stressful.Oh that's something else this movie lacks suspense. I didn't feel any of these so called hostages were in any danger. Except when the Iranians were chasing them near the end but we're they really chasing them because since they had no idea they were being chased...hmmm if a tree falls in a forest...and something I forget nevermind. Anyway this movie has it all and Ben Afflect.";

	schema:reviewBody "No movie being showcased by this year's Toronto International Film  Festival caught our interest as much as Ben Affleck's directorial  follow up to The Town. Argo based on a true story and starring  Affleck Bryan Cranston John Goodman and Adam Arkin tells the  astonishingly true story of how a CIA exfiltration specialist attempts  to free six Americans who have taken shelter in the home of the  Canadian Ambassador during the Iranian hostage crisis.  The story opens on November 4 1979 when Islamist militants took  control of the U.S. Embassy in Iran. 52 Americans were taken hostage  and held for 444 days until their eventual release. But six American's  were able to sneak out of the Embassy and find refuge unbeknownst to  the Iranian rebels. The CIA lead by agent Tony Mendez Ben Affleck  hatched a plan to rescue the house entrapped Americans by posing as  producers of a fictional science fiction film. The idea was that Mendez  would land in Iran and then convince the six Americans to assume roles  as screenwriters directors and coproducers of the film and they would  all fly out of the country together once location scouting was complete  in 48 hours.  In an effort to have the mission legitimized Mendez recruited  Hollywood producer Lester Siegel and Special Effects man John Chambers  to greenlight the script and give the entire project credibility.  If the entire notion of the plan sounds like something that only  Hollywood could come up with  well you're half right. But Affleck  sticks to the facts of the true events and ravels a biteyournails  type thriller that is guaranteed to be rewarded with yearend  nominations for Best Picture Best Director and most certainly Best  Supporting Actor for Alan Arkin.  Every note every frame of Argo looks authentic. Affleck who received  incredible support for his last directorial effort The Town ups the  ante and films Argo with the confidence of a maestro at the top of his  game.  The movie shifts between locations of Iran Hollywood and both the CIA  Headquarters and even the White House in this brilliantly crafted  adventure. Each scene and character oozes with atmosphere and purpose  and Affleck confidently and flawlessly directs himself as the expected  hero of the film  a man who risks his own life and career for the  lives of six strangers.  Towards the concluding chapters of the film audiences are sure to be  on the edge of their seats  even if they are aware of the historically  recorded outcome shades of Apollo 13. Once the rescue attempt his its  apex the audience at the Toronto screening erupted in an applause  never before experienced by this reviewer in his thousands of  theatrical screenings. That reaction is a testament to Affleck's  direction that grabbed audiences by the emotional drawstrings keeping  us involved in our character's fates and caring for their safe return.  Argo is not only an important piece of history that many of us were  completely oblivious  but it is also one of the better films of this  or the past few years.".

After his last film The Town received so much acclaim and award nominations everyone was wondering if it was just a fluke. His latest film Argo takes on the actual events during the Iran Hostage Crisis finds him once again taking on double duties with directing and starring but can he bring these events to life and create another great film along with it? Argo follows the unbelievable true story of six Americans that have found shelter with the Canadian ambassador in Iran when the revolution reaches a boiling point. The CIA works alongside some heavy hitters in Hollywood to create a fake film production to concoct a risky plan to try and get them out of the country. For a movie that focuses on a situation that was so dire and heavy this film comes off a bit lighter than expected. Ben Affleck has crafted a brilliantly entertaining film on numerous levels. The story alone is intriguing watching their unbelievable plan come to life. During this time of the film it delivers some really funny moments without falling to far off track and confusing the kind of film this is. The acting here is top notch with everyone involved including Affleck himself delivering some awesome performances. The dynamic between Affleck and Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston is perfect creating a duo that both entertain as well as keep this story on track. The biggest treat in this film are brilliant and a lot of time funny performances from John Goodman and Alan Arkin. These guys really bring all the Hollywood aspect to the film to life while delivering Oscar worthy performances that will hopefully be recognized. The gritty look to this film really helps to capture the vibe and tone of the film while combined with the attention to detail helps take you into the time period it takes place.Brilliant directing acting story and some fun scifi references throughout takes Argo into the realm of one of the best films to come along in some time. Affleck proves once again of his talent as a director and that The Town was no fluke. This is a must see film that will no doubt be allthe buzz when award season comes around and deserves every bit of it.".

More than sixty Americans from the US embassy were held as hostages but six of them escaped and were hiding out in the home of the Canadian ambassador Garber. Tony Mendez Affleck a CIA extraction specialist came along to concoct a plan to rescue these six Americans.After speaking to his son while watching a movie one night Mendez had a creative yet genius idea. He and the escaped hostages would pretend to be the film crew of a new scifi movie called Argo. With the help of Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers Goodman and producer Lester Siegel Arkin this fake crew made their story quite credible.Ben Affleck did a spectacular job directing this film which pretty faithfully follows such an unbelievable story. Every actor is convincing as hisher character and the cast was impeccably chosen. Make sure you stay in the theater to watch the credits. You'll see some real photographs and clips that mirror Affleck's film and actors.Argo is basically only rated R for language making it appropriate for most teens in my opinion. I definitely recommend this film to everyone whether you're an adult who remembers watching this on TV or you're a kid who doesn't know anything about politics. It is extremely dramatic exciting and heart wrenching but also hilarious on many occasions. When the movie ends the entire audience applauds and cheers. It's an amazing story that deserves to be heard.I give Argo a 10 out of 10. I have no complaints.".

	schema:reviewBody "Americans like redoing wars in movies  and they do not avoid the lost wars. The hostage crisis in 1979 which cost president Carter a second presidential mandate was not exactly a war but a conflict generated by the departing paths of the Iran in revolution after the overthrow of the Shah and on its way to become an Islamic Republic and the United States government which supported for many decades the old regime. One rescue mission went terribly wrong but this is not the one shown in Argo but the lesser known and successful one in which six employees who escaped the embassy when events started and were hidden in the house of the Canadian ambassador were taken out of Iran under the false identities of Canadians working for a Hollywood movie. As with the Rambo series for example the story is first of all a pretext for action entertainment and a way of making audiences feel better about a problematic episode in the American history. Same as with Rambo success with audiences and in this case also with critics which I am a little surprised was achieved but this does not make in my opinion for good cinema and of course does not really change history.Does it matter that the film is inspired by a true story? That's an interesting question and I would say that the answer is to a large extent No. It is not really the factual truth that matters when you watch a fiction movie but the artistic news. Reality sometimes exceeds imagination but art is first of all about imagination and not necessarily about the imagination of the makers but of the one of the receivers the viewers in the case of movies. The analysis on the Internet show discrepancies between the real events and the story on screen  this is not what bothers me but the result. The final chase for example between the Iranian police cars and the commercial airplane taking off would fit fine a James Bond or Mission Impossible film but not one labeled a true story. There was enough material in the story for a much deeper psychological processing both of the CIA and other people involved in the plot and of the American confined in the Canadian ambassador's house and waiting for the rescue. Ben Affleck and the other authors of the film went for the broader audiences using the action film tools and inflating the role of the Hollywood producers and of the Americans in general in the whole story. It was a fair and legitimate choice which probably improved the rating but did not in my opinion make the film better.I do not like Ben Affleck as an actor. He inspires me dullness in most of the roles he takes simply made me lose interest in more than a few characters I saw him acting. This is the case here as well. I am not inspired by his Tony Mendez I cannot distinguish his hero from many other similar action movies heroes I never got his motivation for making the tough decision of going rogue in order to save lives and accomplish his mission his divorce and remote father background is as banal as it can be in the script and Ben Affleck the actor does not pour any life in it. Actually as a director and script author he may be more interesting his director hand is sure and witty and as an action movie director he is above average. His image of the 70s is precisely executed with the help of costumes and sets artists and despite use of stereotypes like excessive smoking. As with many other of his films Argo promises more than it delivers.".

	onyx:emotionText "Americans like redoing wars in movies  and they do not avoid the lost wars. The hostage crisis in 1979 which cost president Carter a second presidential mandate was not exactly a war but a conflict generated by the departing paths of the Iran in revolution after the overthrow of the Shah and on its way to become an Islamic Republic and the United States government which supported for many decades the old regime. One rescue mission went terribly wrong but this is not the one shown in Argo but the lesser known and successful one in which six employees who escaped the embassy when events started and were hidden in the house of the Canadian ambassador were taken out of Iran under the false identities of Canadians working for a Hollywood movie. As with the Rambo series for example the story is first of all a pretext for action entertainment and a way of making audiences feel better about a problematic episode in the American history. Same as with Rambo success with audiences and in this case also with critics which I am a little surprised was achieved but this does not make in my opinion for good cinema and of course does not really change history.Does it matter that the film is inspired by a true story? That's an interesting question and I would say that the answer is to a large extent No. It is not really the factual truth that matters when you watch a fiction movie but the artistic news. Reality sometimes exceeds imagination but art is first of all about imagination and not necessarily about the imagination of the makers but of the one of the receivers the viewers in the case of movies. The analysis on the Internet show discrepancies between the real events and the story on screen  this is not what bothers me but the result. The final chase for example between the Iranian police cars and the commercial airplane taking off would fit fine a James Bond or Mission Impossible film but not one labeled a true story. There was enough material in the story for a much deeper psychological processing both of the CIA and other people involved in the plot and of the American confined in the Canadian ambassador's house and waiting for the rescue.

He saw that Nathalie only likes Cuban people and its music so for this reason he decided to present himself as a Cuban young man under the name of Mongo. At the end everything was obviously discovered Nathalie knew that he was as French as her and she finally accepted him as he was. The film had the participation of some Cuban artists among them Alexis Valdes already based in Spain who showed how to dance good salsa and Aurora Basnuevo who is still working for radio and TV in Cuba. Here she played the role of Cuban Yoruba Santera. Cuban nostalgia is well noted in the film in one scene Valdes told Mongo that Cubans'smile and laugh are good to hide their pain behind it.

But we don't really care because this is a musical comedy looking for every opportunity to show off music and dance.  And that's not bad at all. Salsa' reminds me of Round Midnight' Bertrand Tavernier's homage to Dale Turner and the American jazz musicians who came to Paris in the 1950's. There too it is the story of a Frenchman who adores 'exotic' music from the other side of the Atlantic.  Of course Round Midnight' is serious whereas Salsa' is a clicheridden comedy about one Frenchman's desire to join the fun that Cubans in contemporary Paris are having.

At first glance it seems to be a film about food which is not bad  hey I love food but turns out to be so much more. The reasons I liked it? Well read on.First of all it is a way above average production for Greek film standards. Music camerawork photography CGI scriptacting everything is very well done. Some people complain about the CGI used saying that it looks fake that it looks more like a painting mostly the shots of Istanbul that it looks unrealistic. Well they are probably right it does look a bit unrealistic but I think this is intentional. We see someone's memories and memories tend to be polished and larger than life.Second it is probably the only Greek film I've seen that while dealing with a subject that only Greeks and Turks can really relate to you don't have to be a Greek to enjoy it. It's easy on the eyes it's touching it's well written. And amazingly it deals with GreekTurkish relationships without passing blame it provides the facts but avoids passing judgment this is actually very rare as both Greeks and Turks tend to blame each other when these events are mentioned.Finally you end up feeling better and hungry after watching this film which is reason enough to watch it. Highly recommended to everyone I give this film 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read all the comments about this movie before posting mine and I happen to agree with a couple of them about some flaws in this movie. But I'm still giving it a 8510 because it's pretty good in general. Oh and the Turkish actors are not dubbed they're speaking English with their own voice. What's so unbelievable about that? Anyway..Politiki Kouzina has the utmost political message ever Politics is bullst and it's only useful for tearing people and nations apart! I was really touched by the line Turks are sending us away as Greeks and Greeks are receiving us as Turks. I know that pretty well because the situation with the Bulgarian Turks is pretty much the same and it was a very popular issue in the 90's. Bulgarians hate us for we're Turks and Turks address us as Bulgarians. I guess that's the way it goes as much as it pains anyone with a heart. You have no problems with the place you're living in you hardly consider yourself a foreigner at all and all of a sudden someone says you have to go home. And where the hell is that? A place you go to hear you're from some place else is home just because you come from the same race with its occupants? Doubtful.. This movie delivers the reality behind the TurcoGreek political tension without going into too much depth and staying loyal to the facts. Moreover it delivers them without hurting anyone just the reality as it is. Did the whole Cyprus thing begin because of the evil Greeks or the evil Turks? Probably neither. As a Turkish proverb says The wet burns along with the dry. Some nasty people decide to destroy peace and the innocent ones who have the mental capacity to love everyone without checking their passport are the ones who get hurt. Politiki Kouzina depicts this issue oh so very perfectly! You don't need to be Turkish or Greek to enjoy the movie but you really have to be one of those to get the feeling as it's supposed to be delivered. I can relate to the issue better than an average Turk or Greek and less than a Greek who's been deported from Turkey or vice versa. My mother was brought up in a neighbourhood of Greeks and Jews. Her friends still send cards and call from Greece and Israel and some still in Turkey. OK Turkey and Israel never had problems but this shows Turkey and Greece could very well overcome their problems too. I've been in Greece loved the people. I've heard the same several times from Greeks visiting Turkey. What's it that people can't share then? I believe the director of this flick is also one with this sentiment and fascists of both sides would be utterly disappointed by the movie. Istanbul or Konstantinopolis Izmir or Smyrna.. Big deal? But it was a big deal for some people so big that they couldn't even allow innocent children's sweet love to stay intact.As for the cinematography and such it's quite alright except for a few minor flaws. Many Turks have been acted by Greeks that's so very obvious with the accent. Maybe that's a problem only to the Turkish audience but it doesn't take an IQ of 500 to figure this movie was also meant for Turkish audiences. It can't be THAT hard to find someone who can speak both advanced Greek and basic Turkish or vice versa. The acting by ALL the cast is really good. My favourite is the head actor whom I've seen on Peppermint before and was impressed by. The kids are also doing great. An exceptional story does not always suffice to make a good film but this one seems to have added enough of the other ingredients to make it as interesting as the plot line would suggest. Recommended to everyone and extra recommended to Turks and Greeks.".

	onyx:emotionText "I read all the comments about this movie before posting mine and I happen to agree with a couple of them about some flaws in this movie. But I'm still giving it a 8510 because it's pretty good in general. Oh and the Turkish actors are not dubbed they're speaking English with their own voice. What's so unbelievable about that? Anyway..Politiki Kouzina has the utmost political message ever Politics is bullst and it's only useful for tearing people and nations apart! I was really touched by the line Turks are sending us away as Greeks and Greeks are receiving us as Turks. I know that pretty well because the situation with the Bulgarian Turks is pretty much the same and it was a very popular issue in the 90's. Bulgarians hate us for we're Turks and Turks address us as Bulgarians. I guess that's the way it goes as much as it pains anyone with a heart. You have no problems with the place you're living in you hardly consider yourself a foreigner at all and all of a sudden someone says you have to go home. And where the hell is that? A place you go to hear you're from some place else is home just because you come from the same race with its occupants? Doubtful.. This movie delivers the reality behind the TurcoGreek political tension without going into too much depth and staying loyal to the facts. Moreover it delivers them without hurting anyone just the reality as it is. Did the whole Cyprus thing begin because of the evil Greeks or the evil Turks? Probably neither. As a Turkish proverb says The wet burns along with the dry. Some nasty people decide to destroy peace and the innocent ones who have the mental capacity to love everyone without checking their passport are the ones who get hurt. Politiki Kouzina depicts this issue oh so very perfectly! You don't need to be Turkish or Greek to enjoy the movie but you really have to be one of those to get the feeling as it's supposed to be delivered. I can relate to the issue better than an average Turk or Greek and less than a Greek who's been deported from Turkey or vice versa. My mother was brought up in a neighbourhood of Greeks and Jews. Her friends still send cards and call from Greece and Israel and some still in Turkey. OK Turkey and Israel never had problems but this shows Turkey and Greece could very well overcome their problems too. I've been in Greece loved the people.

The tables were full of all kind of good stuff dolmades eggplant salad baba ghanoush if you know the term though the Greek name is different and backed eggplant stuffed peppers taramosalata and tzatziki fasolatha and gigandes plaki souvlaki and keftedakia and moussaka cheese of all ways and salami black and green olives fish prepared in many ways and many many other dishes. That restaurant is no more but there are other nice Greek restaurants in the DC area.All this stuff is also in the Turkish cuisine both are very similar and they have a strong resemblance with the cuisine of all other Balkan countries Romania included and also with all countries in Mid Orient.Which is the best of them? There is only one answer you'll find it in Istanbul. It's Politiki Kouzina the term has double meaning. Politiki Kouzina is the Cuisine of the Polis because the Great City of Constantine Constantinopolis is unique it is THE City THE Polis. Politiki Kouzina means also political cuisine as the relations between Greeks and Turks have always been so complicated that everything there has a strong political dimension.I watched yesterday a Greek movie from 2003 Politiki Kouzina the English title is A Touch of Spice a movie about politics and about cuisine. Greeks who used to live in Istanbul and have been forced to leave for Greece due to the complicated political contentious between the two countries. They moved to Greece and remained nostalgic for their lost Polis and a way to keep their distinct identity was Politiki Kouzina the dishes they went on preparing exactly like in Istanbul. The same spices in the same proportions giving the same flavors. Their touch of spice their Constantinopolitan touch.A movie calling in mind Cinema Paradiso full of nostalgia. I have read the reviews to this movie. Most of them were enthusiastic. I'm sorry to say I did not appreciate very much the realization. When you tell its story it sounds great while the movie itself seemed to me artistically flawed. Maybe too onesided politically though very decent maybe somehow irresolute like not knowing what turn to take in the unfolding of the plot maybe some solutions in the plot suffer from lack of consistency.I am sorry to say that because I am fascinated by Istanbul I haven't had the occasion to go there so far it's one of my dearest dreams. And where A Touch of Spice definitely succeeds is in communicating a superb love for the Great City for the Polis. if I were to choose one scene from the movie this will be the one in which the father is suddenly telling his love for the most beautiful city in the world. It's one of those scenes that will remain in my memory for ever! This movie for all its flaws deserve to be watched for this scene. Three personages are gathered at the table where else? in their apartment in Athens. They have been forced to leave Istanbul many years ago their souls still belong there.".

	schema:reviewBody "When i first saw the Movie it was completely in Greek so i wasn't able to understand it entirely since my Greek is a little bit rusted  But i saw that it was excellently made and was overwhelmed when i saw Tamer Karadagil the actor who reminds me so entirely of my own blood and flesh father!So it had my interest. After seeing it in the cinema with my Greek BTW girlfriend in Munich in German it conquered also my heart. Such a fantastic movie about Love Politiks Meals Old Men Astronomy Gastronomy and the enduring pain of homesickness even after so many years. Without spoiling The acting of Fanis Father Ieroklis Michaelidis is so beyond fantastic that you wish the whole movie was made again from his perspective! A great contribution to the TurkishGreek relations and hopefully it will finally find its ways to the Turkish cinemas as far as i know it wasn't shown there yet. It surprises me by the way that it came nearly 2 years after the premiere into German theaters. Why so extremely delayed? And why in some Countrys even not? For example Turkey Great thanks to my Greek neighbors for this great movie. And by the way good luck in 4th of June in Istanbul  WM Qualification 2006.".

Fanis Iakovidis a professor of astronomy in Athens Greece finds out his grandfather who leaves in Istanbul is terminally ill and that brings about a series of flashbacks explaining why they have not seen each other for forty years.We watch young Fanis's family get deported from Istanbul and their struggle to fit in Greece while maintaining their identity.And then we watch Fanis as an adult going back to Isatnbul to face the memories and a lost love that have haunted him all his life.Though very lyrical and emotional the film is not too serious. The scenes of family life are hilarious especially Fanis's parents . The film deals and mentions certain painful moments in Turkish and Greek history yet it manages to stay on neutral ground focusing on people and their feelings rather than who is to blame politically.The film is filled with symbols and details woven throughout the story. Every scene is there for a reason conversations and jokes get repeated and food spices and the family table are the themes that push the story forward.If you understand Greek its a plusmost of the funny scenes are in Greek and it seemed that the subtitles were missing some of the jokes. If you don't do not let that stop you the theme is universala movie that everybody can enjoy.".

The old man an early influence on Fanis was the man that was instrumental in guiding him in his career and his love of cooking with the right spices. After all Vasilis owned one of the best shops specializing in those rare spices that according to him were the cause of many wars.Fanis learning his grandfather is dying rushes back to Istambul the city where he first met Saime the daughter of his mother's best friend. Even in spite their separation they had kept in touch by the cards she sent him. The grandfather Vasilis was always planning to go to Athens for a visit but it never happened. Fanis gets to the hospital too late but he gets to meet Saime now a grown up unhappily married woman. Sparks fly as the two meet again but Saime decides to save her marriage for the sake of her young daughter.Tassos Boulmetis directed this nostalgic account of a fragmented family separated by the hatred between their countries. The screenplay is sentimental as befitting a loving look at the past. A hit in Europe but it did not find an audience in America. Georges Corraface plays the adult Fanis. The lovely Basak Koklukaya is the adult Saime. Tassos Bandi plays the grandfather.".

It is ironic and strangely fitting therefore that it should be the Russians who almost a full century later have now produced the first fulllength feature film ever to be composed of a single unedited shot running uninterrupted from first moment to last Hitchcock came close with Rope' but he did include a few cuts' in the course of the film.  Even Sergei Eisenstein who in films like Potemkin' and Ten Days That Shook the World' spent his career developing and demonstrating the power of editing would I dare say be impressed by Russian Ark' a film every bit as innovative and challenging as those earlier seminal works.For their bravura aweinspiring cinematic tourdeforce director Alexander Sokurov and cinematographer Tilman Buttner take us into the famed Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace in St. Petersburg providing us with a grand tour not only of the opulent rooms and famous artwork contained therein but of 300 years of Russian history as well as various vignettes involving famous people from Peter and Catherine the Great to Nicholas and Alexandra and events are played out within the glorious gilded walls.Russian Ark' is a bold and audacious project that is the cinematic equivalent of a breathlessly performed high wire juggling act.  We know that one false move on the part of the actors or the cameraman one missed cue or accident of fate could bring the whole delicately poised enterprise crashing down around them.   How often one wonders did a perfectionist like Sukorov have to resist the temptation to yell Cut!' to his actors and crew?  It's truly amazing to see just how beautifully planned and flawlessly executed the final product turns out to be especially the ball sequence at the end which features hundreds of dancers and spectators who are set in beautifully choreographed and constantly whirling motion.  What's most remarkable is how much of a participant the camera itself is in the proceedings.  Not content to stand idly by and observe the scene like some passive onlooker the camera moves right into the center of the action gliding in and out of the crowds with utmost grace and precision.  Visually the film is stunning with exquisite costumes and furnishings as far as the eye can see.  Indeed Russian Ark' is among other things a veritable feast for the eyes the likes of which we have rarely seen on film before.Russian Ark' does have something of a plot' involving a narrator whom we never see a 21st Century filmmaker  we assume it's Sukorov himself  who's found himself inexplicably caught in some type of time warp and magically transported to this strange spectral world.  There's also a bizarre European ghost' figure from the unspecified past who comments  and occasionally attempts to intrude  on the actions taking place around him.  But these two characters are of far less interest to the audience than the aural and visual delights of the film itself. Russian Ark' is a wonder to behold for it is much more than just an exercise' a gimmick' or even an antithesis' to Eisenstein it is a vibrant work of art that challenges the limits of its medium and reminds us of just what it is about movies that we love so much.".

	schema:reviewBody "Western fascination with Russia whether the land of the Tsars or the cruel empire of the madman Stalin  is one of our unending cultural fixations. Endlessly studied painstakingly analyzed mocked and admired  Russia is a massive ongoing colossal story. An enigma that never yields its deepest secrets.Director Aleksandr Sokurov is the voice of the anonymous inquisitor who accompanies nineteenth century French marquis Sergei Dreiden Sergei Dontsov on a breathtaking tour of the physical and spiritual Hermitage of St. Petersburg.  He has made a groundbreaking stunning film.  Shot from a Steadycam in one continuous over hourandahalf stream the film  explores the treasures of one of the world's greatest museums. Equally Russian Ark rambles without regard for chronological order through snatches of Russian and Soviet history each short episode a fantastical peep into a wild rich often terrifying but always fascinating world.In the nineteenth century European travellers most often men Charles Dickens for example and some women Fanny Trollope for one visited and wrote about the two untamed civilizations that beckoned to foreigners and promised adventure and intrigue  Russia and the United States.  Count Dreiden a not atypical Frenchman of haughty selfassurance and ample means viewed Russians as boorish and their culture a giltsplendored front for a nearly barbarous land. His book would not have been picked up by a publisher linked to the travel industry.In Russian Ark Dreiden is more muted than he is in print but his unquestioning cynicism comes through as Sokurov captures the imagined journey in one building of a French nobleman through both his time and a future he questions without developing much understanding.So we have both an Acoustaguide tour of a wonderful palace of culture and myriad treasures and snapshots of everyone from Catherine the Great to Nicholas and Alexandra and their children including an adorable Anastasia fated to be one of history's silly mysteries. Noblemen and contemporary sailors bemedaled officers and bejeweled women a cultured woman gallery guide and apparatchiks  they all fleet through and interact with the questioning but stolidly biased Frenchman.How did Sokurov pull off a continuous take through over 4200 feet of the Hermitage with a cast of many hundreds gorgeously costumed without a hitch? Unbelievable! That feat alone propels him into the Cinema Pantheon of Fame.  At times I felt like I was drawn into the crowd especially when they depart a dance to head for a fabulous banquet the dance band is conducted by Valery Gergiev the only famous  to Westerners  person in the film. And even though I knew from reviews that Sokurov pulled it off I kept waiting for the seemingly inevitable Cut! following a miscue or stumble.The hint of intrigue and menace that is so much part of Russia's past and present lurks behind an almost impressionistic front with scenes of onedimensional gaiety almost but not entirely hiding a complex society. Sokurov teaches and teases simultaneously.As visual splendor and directorial innovation this is one of the great films of our time.  I look forward to owning it on DVD knowing that its magic can never be realized fully outside a theater.Don't miss this one and see it more than once.1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "A 90minute movie centered on St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum filmed in one unbroken take by a digital steadicam didn't send a lot of Americans racing to buy tickets when it was shown here two or three years ago. The movie however is far more than just a technical stunt. It's a unique tour de force with emotional impact.Russian Ark portrays the Hermitage as a kind of cultural and historical ark floating on centuries of Russian seas. The narrative device is a shadowy eighteenth century Frenchman who wanders the halls and time periods commenting often with goodnatured European condescension on what he sees. He is accompanied by a Russian who is never seen and who questions him about his comments. The movie ranges through time with appearances of Peter the Great Catherine II Pushkin Nicholas II and his family generals maids flunkies and diplomats. The Frenchman played with great style by Russian actor Sergei Dreiden takes us to painting and sculpture galleries kitchens ballrooms storerooms basements and living quarters as we observe things that happened in the Hermitage over the centuries.At first I was very aware of the technical feat of no cuts. Gradually though I think most people just relax and accept the skill of the director and photographer and become immersed in what they are seeing. A kind of unreal imagery takes hold. The movie ends with the last dance held in the Great Ballroom before WWI. Hundreds of actors and dancers in full costume swirl around this ornate setting and swirl around the camera as well while the camera glides through the crowds. It's a terrific scene and is followed by the end of the dance with all the hundreds of guests making their way through the halls and staircases to leave the building with the camera facing them and moving along in front of them.This is a highly unusual film probably a great one.".

	schema:headline " A meditation on the individual's journey from life to the hereafter";
	schema:reviewBody "Focusing on three centuries of Russian history from Peter the Great to Tsar Nicholas II Russian Ark the latest film by Alexander Sokurov is an amazing tour de force. Shot in one long 96minute tracking shot with a cast of 2000 actors and extras the film takes the viewer into the great Hermitage Collection in St. Petersburg Russia showing real works of art from 33 rooms and exploring their meaning in a larger context. More than just a great technical achievement this is also a sublime meditation on the individual's place in the universe one that does not recreate history but allows us to revisit it on a dreamlike stage where past present and future are one. The film begins in the dark with the narrator apparently Sokurov commenting about how little he sees. My eyes are open he says and yet I see nothing. He does not know where he is but apparently has just died in an accident of some kind. Is this a movie? A play? he asks. He receives no answer except a vision of 18th century aristocrats moving slowly into the Tsar's palace. An elegant whitehaired man in a black cloak Sergey Dreiden suddenly appears and escorts the confused narrator into the corridors of the grand palace. Everyone knows the present but who can remember the past says the stranger as they walk from one ballroom to the next witnessing great works of art as well as ghostlike presences from Russia's past. We see works by El Greco Rubens and Van Dyck in their awesome splendor. We run into Peter the Great thrashing a general Catherine the Great looking for the bathroom and Nicholas II the last Russian Tsar hosting the Great Royal Ball of 1913 the last such formal occasion of its kind.As we enter the Great Nicholas Hall the opulent room is filled with thousands of aristocrats dancing the mazurka in gorgeous period costumes. A full orchestra is playing in the background and young soldiers are nattily dressed in their uniforms. How beautiful it all seems and how it appears they were destined to live forever but we all know how the nasty Bolsheviki spoiled the party. Ah yes how green was my valley then. Sokurov said he wanted to make a whole film in one breath and he has succeeded in simulating the breathing process pulling us in then moving us out as we feel the rhythm of our own life beating with the swirl of lost humanity. At the end of Russian Ark we see the peaceful flow of a river outside the hall to which the narrator comments The flow is forever. Life is forever. Having completed the past our invisible guide is now ready to move into the endless silence that is in the phrase of the Anglican priest Thomas Kelly the source of all sound.".

	schema:reviewBody "An unnamed and unseen filmmaker finds himself in the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg in what appears to be the 18th Century.  No one seems to be able to see him except his travelling companion Frenchman Marquis de Custine who he talks to.  Together the two of them go around the museum flitting between time as they go gradually covered 300 years of Russian history.I was drawn to this film as I have recently had to install digital television in my house just for 24! and I figured that I might as well see what the channels had to offer.  After working out that I had access to numerous shopping channels I also found that I had BBC4 the arts and history channel and that it was to be showing this film.  I was interested in it not for my love of Russian history but for the fact that it was done in one take and for that reason I quite enjoyed it.As far as plot goes I really think you need to have an existing knowledge of Russian history as this film will not help you understand anything about it other than a passing impression.  This was the case for me as I know next to nothing of the history but I was still able to gleam some things about the political relationships between Russia and Europe as well as some of the main players.  However it never got to the point where I was taken or engaged by the material interested is perhaps a more fitting word to use  and that's still a good thing.Technically the film is gripping and very impressive.  Much was made of Snake Eye's 20 minute onetake opening even thought it was actually 3 takes or Goodfella's seamless move from street to table but this film blows them away.  I cannot even imagine the sheer logistics involved in creating such an effect.  It would be impressive if the film was all shot in one room with a few cast members but this film moves around the museum with a cast of thousands and set pieces that vary from two people looking at paintings to a massive ballroom scene.  I was held totally impressed by the whole film as the entire one take was delivered seamlessly without flaw. For this reason the acting is impressive whether it is Dontsov's acerbic Frenchman or just some extra's  everyone had to get it right bang on time and they did.Overall this film will be a masterpiece if you have a good working knowledge and understanding of Russian history.  However even if you don't know that much like me the technical aspect of this film will impress you no end even if the material is best seen as interesting' at best.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like visiting the homes of the formerly high and mighty or have a passion for museums this film ought to satisfy. It's really a virtual tour of the Hermitage Museum the former Winter Palace in St Petersburg but with 2800 actors and extras in full costume to add a little verisimilitude to the occasion. If you want to repeat the experience for free visit the Hermitages' brilliant web site. I can believe that the whole 90 minutes was filmed in one take at the third attempt but I was staggered that the museum authorities allowed them to do it. Perhaps the clincher was to include a role for the present museum director who is seen with some of his predecessors fretting over the state of the Tsar's throne's upholstery.Not knowing a lot of Russian history some of the scenes didn't make much sense but I did cotton on to Anastasia being late for tea. Maybe she got away after all. There was nothing from the Soviet era except a brief scene during the German siege of Lenningrad a million died mainly from starvation and many made coffins for themselves before they expired. This seems appropriate since the communists contributed nothing to the buildings which were started by Peter the Great and added to by his successors. A bad fire in 1837 was followed by extensive reconstruction and many of the rooms we see in the film date from that time.I suppose this is the first film in which the set is the star and the actors merely props. There is in fact one dramatic part that of the French Marquis who attended the Tsar's court in the 1840s and who is somehow able to take us backward and forward in time. Even he is a bit twodimensional in fact the other unseen presence the voice of the director of the film is as real. Towards the end we attend a great ball and the Marquis gets to dance the Marzurka again. The music is great is that Glinka conducting something of this own? and the atmosphere gay as somebody says you can't be shy for the Mazurka' and for a moment history is forgotten. But we don't have a plot the characters are cutouts with the exception of Catherine who seems to have been one of the more boisterous Empresses in history and basically nothing happens. Yet I found myself absorbed by it all occasionally wishing I could click my mouse to zoom in on an interesting painting. Ironically much of the art is nonRussian so Russian Ark' is something of a misnomer  EuroArk' is nearer the mark. At the end of the day though I am lost with admiration for the cinematographer who managed to keep his digital camera running and pointed in the right direction for 90 minutes without making a mistake. Madness brilliant Russian madness.".

Alexander Sokurov has proved himself one of the greatest artistic directors of the age in this enthralling journey through Russian history society and culture. As a viewer I was emotionally overcome by the simultaneously melancholic frenetic and enigmatic atmosphere. The actors are fantastic allround the script is flawlessly coherent the cinematography is unparalleled and it goes without saying that the scenery is nothing short of jawdropping. A powerful and moving insight into a beautiful complex and tragically misunderstood culture.Artistic perfection. 1010!".

	schema:reviewBody "Sokurov breaks boundaries with his dreamlike vision of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. It's the first featurelength narrative film shot in a single take on digital video using a specially designed disc instead of tape. Russian Ark is shot from the pointofview of an unseen narrator as he explores the museum and travels through Russian history. The audience sees through his eyes as he witnesses Peter the Great Maksim Sergeyev abusing one of his generals Catherine the Great Maria Kuznetsova desperately searching for a bathroom and in the grand finale the sumptuous Great Royal Ball of 1913. The narrator is eventually joined by a sarcastic and eccentric 19th century French Marquis Sergey Dreiden who travels with him throughout the huge grounds encountering various historical figures and viewing the legendary artworks on display. While the narrator only interacts with the Marquis he seems to be invisible to all the other inhabitants the Marquis occasionally interacts with visitors and former residents of the museum.The film was obviously shot in one day but the cast and crew rehearsed for months to time their movements precisely with the flow of the camera while capturing the complex narrative with elaborate costumes from different periods and several trips out to the exterior of the museum. Tillman Buttner the director of photography was responsible for capturing it all in one single Steadicam shot. Russian Ark is an amazing accomplishment and clearly made with passion but while the film is sure to be hailed as a masterpiece by some its narrative conceit isn't nearly as interesting as the technical feat of its creation. The result is a unique and intelligent film with sporadic moments of transcendent beauty that fails to create a strong emotional connection with its audience. It's essentially a 96minute museum tour with the added benefit of time travel and wax figures that briefly come to life.But wax figures are all they are essentially. Sokurov as though following a hasty guide spends so little time with the historical figures he portrays that it often feels as though he's moving on just as you begin to figure out who and what you're watching. The Russian experience of World War II for example is portrayed with a brief stop in a foreboding ghostly room filled with coffins. The filmmaker is known for his lugubrious pacing but Russian Ark has the odd distinction of seeming both slow paced and rushed. It moves slowly and mournfully but still only glances across the surface of the eras it portrays. It's a demanding film encompassing a wealth of Russian history and art history between its first and final frames. Those who stay with it will be rewarded in the end by a gorgeously mounted ball in which the camera gracefully slides among elaborately costumed dancers as the orchestra plays. It's a deeply felt irony that this transcendent moment of joy takes place on the eve of the Russian revolution and the world of these briefly glimpsed characters is about to come crashing to an end. It's a shame that the film has few moments where form and content align so powerfully".

Three years after its initial release and subsequent DVD releases Russian Ark should be a title that is recognized even by the general non artfilmaddicted audience by its one unique feature a 96 minute single take that constitutes the film in its entirety. But that does not take anything away from the marvel of this amazing accomplishment. There are side effects though. I did find myself somewhat distracted as the film unfolded by a continuous anticipation to the extent of trying to visualize ahead how the cast for the next scene is being assembled in the adjoining room awaiting the languid camera to roll in. I also found myself continuously marvelling at the meticulous planning and execution in a situation that completely removes the freedom one would expect from making a motion picture and replaces it with the realtime constraints of a stage play in which every enter and exeunt has to be made with flawless precision.The idea of the project alone radiates brilliance. Slightly reminiscent of Pictures at an exhibition the audience wanders through the Hermitage the repository of Russian art and history in St. Petersburg including the Winter Palace and a museum housing over three million pieces of paintings sculptures and other artifacts. But then in Russian Ark there's more a lot more.Serving as the audience's POV is the voice over belonging to a contemporary artist awaking in what seems to be a void and then entering this fascinating world both real and imagined guided by Marquis a 19th century French diplomat who as the tour progresses engages alternatively in challenging dialogues with him and varied interaction with characters appearing en route. In the process the audience gets a grand sweep of three centuries' of modern Russian history through Marquis' encounter with contemporary figures including the real director of the museum and reenacted scenes taken from random cross sections of Russian history. Obviously those familiar with the modern history of Russia get the most but in general we would at least recognize names of the various Czar Catherine the Great Anastasia etc as well as historical event such as the siege of Leningrad.Although the film comprises one single take from beginning to end it is the furthest away from being monotonous. We see intimate suggestive intercourses verbal as well as a royal court ball in its utmost grandiose form and everything in between. The natural constraint of the onetakeonly camera is more than compensated for by the dexterity of its use and the imaginative manipulation of characters and miseensine both. The spectacular ballroom scene in the finale complete with an orchestra playing Glinka is a wonder to behold.A remarkable cinematic experience".

I love great cinema whether it is silent talkie thriller comedy musical or documentary and this film being shot in one continuous take excited me greatly and I watched with huge interest expecting a great piece of film making. I'm afraid I found it extremely poor as a film.There is no disputing the amazing logistical difficulties the director has overcome to film one continuous take for an entire feature length movie but if I was interested only in logistics I would study the London traffic system or the engineering of the channel tunnel! To be a great or even a good film takes more than logistics.Even the technical brilliance of filming in one take is reduced these days massively due to digitalvideo technology. Reels of film only lasted a short time so Hitchcock filmed Rope in long takes but had to cut them cleverly together to give the appearance of the take continuing each time he had to change reels of film. It was impossible to shoot a whole film of feature length on one reel of film. Now anyone could make a film in one take as long as they avoid making a mistake messing up the take.The only clever thing about this film is that the director has choreographed the movements of groups of people and planned out camera movement etc and managed to film it all without any obvious mistakes. This is pure logistics though not pure cinema! There is no drama no characterisation no humour no ingenuity of storytelling it runs like a documentary or video tour. On top of that the script and acting of the people appearing and the narration are inane and ridiculous. It is at times meant to be funny but is pathetically unfunny and idiotic. There is nothing to recommend this as cinema its only benefit is to show the beautiful building and works of art. This could be done better in a documentary without all the nonsense.There is nothing I hate more in films than pretentious attempts to be something they are not. I give this 1 12 or 2 out of 10 rather than 1 simply for its choreographed movement of camera and people.".

	schema:reviewBody "'It's a pity you're not here with me. You would understand everything. Look. The sea is all around. We are destined to sail forever. To live forever' quotes the narrator of the story. To live forever was this movie mission and for the most part it kinda does. A 90minute Russian film shot using only a Steadicam and over 2000 actors inside a Russian history museum in one complete continuous uninterrupted take is indeed going to stand out! However there were a few mistakes on the camera that was noticeable such as children looking at the camera or people tripping down the stairs. I guess the director didn't notice or he really didn't feel for film editing. Still the enormity of their accomplishment is even more striking when one realizes that the 33rooms museum only granted one day for director Alexander Sokurov to shoot the film. After three false starts he completed it just in time. That's pretty impressed. Set entirely within a dreamlike world the film tells the story of an unseen narrator Voiced by Alexander Sokurov and a foreign nobleman from the 19th century named Marquis de Custine Sergey Dreyden checking out the artifact artwork within the St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum complex. As they talk about the relics within the museum each new room holds 300 years of recreated Russian history allow them to witness key events with key people play out in front of them across different times within Russia past. This achievement was made possible by over 4500 cast in many different lavish period outfit  historic costumes. It took four years of practice to get the film choreographic right. For that hard work ethic we can only be thankful. The fruit of all their labor is a delicate exploration of the nature of history and its effect on a national consciousness. Without spoiling the movie too much I found the movie to be beautifully shot by Cinematographer Tilman Bttner. I love how the steadicam camera floats glides and even waltzes its way through all the film's commotion spotlighting various moments of action and people seemingly at random as if a trance. As much as I would have love to see the historic events play out in order. The nonlinear improvisational 'structure' of the film thus acts as an evocation of the disarray of a nation's past as if somebody is looking back only through nostalgic goggles at Imperial Russia. Trying really hard to remember the good thing about Russia's Golden Age but also trying really hard to ignore everything that wasn't good about their history such as anything before Peter the Great or the time the country was rebranded as the Soviet Union. Clearly the movie had some troubles talking about certain events like World War 2 or the Russian Revolution. It felt like it was trying too hard to steer away from conflict. Some viewers might hate the film due to that reason. I can understand why certain audience members felt the movie was somewhat dull or boring. Without conflict you don't have much of a story. Despite the narrative's sluggishness the movie does try to have somewhat of a storyarch with Marquis de Custine. I like his character development. At first the Marquis' attitude toward Russia was mostly negative. He found the country to be a bit too savage and full of uncreative actors. He felt like they were trying too hard of a carbon copy of other European countries at the time  incapable of something ingenuity. By the end of the film he became much more aware to Russia dusha and start to warm up to the idea of Russia having their own culture. As much as certain critics might find the character unlikeable. His real lifecouther part was a little harsher about Russia than this one. The movie got nearly nothing right about the character. The reallife Custine really hate autocracy and everything about Tsarism. Another thing is that he wasn't a womanizer but an open practicing homosexual. I really found it odd that he was chosen to be one of the film's narrative voice. Still I love the actor that play him. He remind me so much of Christoph Waltz in the way he speaks and moves. I also love the smart dialogue that seem to follow him but it's clear that the sound was added way after filming was done. You can clearly see it in the voice dubbing. The dialogue doesn't really match with the character's mouth movement at times. Another problem is that it's really hard to figure out who is speaking and what they're trying to say. While intriguing some of the dialogue and artwork use are so vague that it doesn't make much sense. Then there are plenty of artwork that doesn't get explain. Maybe the film was a bit too artsy in the arthouse department for me because I really didn't get some of what the film was trying to say. Despite that the climatic ending was very clear but somewhat predictable. The whole movie then can be seen as a fight against the complex of inferiority of the Russian artist. At least that is what I got from it. Anyways the music and set pieces that follow the narrative were great. Overall I love the elegant dream like historic reenactments in this film. It was a somber watch worth checking out. It's a very trippy film.".

And clearly nobody can say a single unkind word about the mesmerizing beauty of both the Hermitage museum and costume design.  And clearly nobody can take anything away from the brilliant direction given to over 800 actors in order to have them work seamlessly in such a creative endeavor.So then where can one find fault in this film.  Oh wait I know.  How 'bout the fact that few have had any idea as to what the hell was going on. Now I know that to fully appreciate Russian Ark one must have at least a basic understanding of Russian and European history but this has nothing to do with the fact that no matter how you slice it this was just a bizarre plotless stroll through a magnificent building.I'm all for weird... but for weird with a purpose.  I'm all for obscurity... but for obscurity with a fragment of common understanding.  I'm all for an intelligent film for some and not for all... but for intelligent film that at least gives the others a clue.  Russian Ark did not fill this criteria.However going back to my initial comment... this film IS gorgeous. Bored as I was I admit that I somewhat looked forward to gliding into the next room and into the next challenge for the cast and crew.  And it wasn't always perfect.  I took pleasure in the fact that every now and then I could spot a cast member staring at the camera for just a brief moment  like taking a halfsecond peak down a woman's blouse before she looks up. There are some things that just attract our attention.  These were endearing moments in the film where just as we the film's viewers have been astonished by the visuals on screen  you could tell that the cast was just as amazed at what they were a part of.Russian Ark is worth seeing just so one can appreciate all that went into the film.  The first few moments are difficult because in this fastcut MTV world our attention spans last about as long as a WB sitcom and many just can't adjust that quickly to the singleshot idea.  But give it a few minutes and your brain will revert to the functionality for which it was initially created  to see beauty in an unhurried appreciative manner. What it won't get used to is the absolute boredom and pointlessness of the plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene in Secret Things slams you with its voyeuristic impact suggesting that this is a softporn exploitation in someone's private bedroom however the scene turns out to be an autoerotic exhibition onstage in a bar in Paris.  Nathalie Coralie Revel is a gorgeous exotic dancer headlining in a dank bar in Paris.  She is fired after a tiff with the calloused owner together with a nave bartender Sandrine Sabrina Seyvecou. The two ladies vow not to be used by men again.  Nathalie encourages Sandrine to loosen her sexual inhibitions to get more out of life.  She instructs Sandrine how to awaken her sexuality both in the bedroom and at public places such as a tunnel in the Metro.  The pair decides to room together and scheme on how they will better their lot in life by using men to climb the ladder of success and become free spirits.After the ladies land a job at the same firm they plot on how to advance their positions using their sensuality as a manipulative tool.  Nathalie quickly maneuvers a job as personnel assistant and Sandrina is now an executive secretary.  Sandrina currently an apt pupil in sexual prowess manages to manipulate her superiors until she finally lands a position as secretary to the main supervisor.  This formerly monogamous married man who is twice Sandrine's age falls madly in love with her to his detriment as they secretly hump their way across the screen both on the job and at other more acceptable venues.  Sandrine flagrantly uses him to advance her career yet plans on dumping him once she conquers the young CEO a handsome and clever womanizer.As the affair with her boss hardens she begins to back off and he becomes more desperate to possess her.  Nathalie on the other hand has fallen hard for an unrevealed lover who apparently has dumped her.  Sandrine attempts to console Nathalie and ultimately winds up in the sack with her.  Now the plot begins to deteriorate as the newfound freedom they were both relishing begins to erode.  Trapped by the amorous attention of her boss Sandrine now imposes upon him to promote Nathalie to their office where they eventually indulge in a mnage  trois.  This scenario further crumbles when the three are discovered in hot embrace in the restroom by the young stud of a CEO who is even more Machiavellian than they are.The plot now totally disintegrates into a banquet of ruthlessness group sex lesbian sex threeway sex and masturbation.  Our heroines now suffering much more than they did before they decided upon their quest to manipulate men go along with the bizarre program foisted upon them.  The story unfolds into some off the wall twists and unexpected ironies. However when mixed with the continual bombardment of sexual exploitation it adds little to the theme of the story.  The film appears to take away more than it provides.The first three quarters of the film are fun and interesting as we observe the women taking charge of their lives and maneuvering through office politics.  The movie eventually falls apart dropping to the level of a softcore porn movie without rhyme or reason until the plot regresses to something secondary to the sexploitations.  The director JeanClaude Brisseau presents quite a banquet of sexuality turning on both men and women audiences throughout the film while maintaining a nice balance of story and visual indulgence.  This picture in French with English subtitles is deftly crafted so that you easily forget that you are reading everything instead of listening to the dialogue.  Nathalie is so stunning and sexual on the screen that it is by itself well worth the price of admission.  It is too bad the story falls apart in the third act nevertheless I would still recommend it for its visual arousing energy and remarkable premise.".

But for adults who are willing to see some frank discussion about sex and some deliciously devious sexual politics this film provides wonderful entertainment.Choses secrtes is enormously entertaining with two thoroughly captivating leads. Sabrina Seyvecou who turns in a spellbinding performance has a sort of Heather Grahamish innocence and sexiness to her and along with Coralie Revel provides some of the most titillating scenes seen in a mainstream movie in many years. There really aren't any goodwholesome characters in this film. But that's OK. I suppose Cadene qualifies as a nice chap but he's a minor character. Because the cunning of the two women is so absolutely engrossing that you're quickly drawn into their wicked world. Watching them use people for their own ends and not quite knowing who is manipulating whom is one of the many charms of this sensual and exciting film.The film comes apart toward the end. Unravels a bit especially when writerdirector JeanClaude Brisseau resorts to awfully heavyhanded and needless symbolism. There's also a superfluous orgy scene that comes out of nowhere. I wish Brisseau would have come up with an original atypical less conventional denouement for his story.If you like the works of Neil LaBute  The Shape of Things Your Friends and Neighbors and In the Company of Men  you should appreciate and enjoy Choses secrtes.".

	schema:headline " Devolution";
	schema:reviewBody "S P O I L E R SEither because they were too shocking or too bad or just too French JeanClaude Brisseau's previous nine films some just done for TV haven't made it to the US. Choses secrtes Secret Things is having some limited distribution here. The film seduces initially with its intelligence and its elegant look then it betrays us with tendentiousness tedium and numbing excess.  If you loved Luchino Visconti's The Damned or Pier Paolo Pasolini's Sal you will have to see this.  If you respected Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut you may want to consider Choses secrtes which some think does its moral consideration of sex and its orgy scenes better.Whereas Dangerous Liaisons the Choderlos de Laclos classic as well as its various film adaptations involves the plot of a man and a woman to demolish a powerful and wicked female this film involves two women out to get men in general. Brisseau's Nathalie Coralie Revel a stripper coaches Sandrine Sabrina Seyvecou a barmaid on how they can both become powerful through exploiting their own sexual daring. They've just been fired  literally thrown out on the street  from the club where they both work for refusing to have sex with customers afterward. Nathalie persuades the nave penniless Sandrine to move in with her and next day outlines her plan for the two of them to conquer the Paris business world.This is all to be done through sex and from scene one there's plenty of masturbation   orgasms real or faked come as often as explosions in action flicks  and plenty of nudity but only female in each case. Nathalie's simplistic rather oldfashioned rule is that if they can give themselves pleasure they need never be enslaved to any man.  The typically French rationality of Nathalie's exposition of her plan undercuts the obvious softcore aspects of the film  for a while that is.And so does Choses secrtes' splendid appearance the beauty of the two young women is set off by handsome cinematography and a generous use of sumptuous richly colored drapery that makes the dcor a pleasure to look at.  One wishes American filmmakers could generate effects of taste and elegance with such simple means.  But there is more to cinema than the visuals and this movie begins to seem little more than a Vogue shoot.Wilder and prettier  that's the two girls' selling point.  On the strength of a certain provocative appeal we're to believe they're hired at a major financial corporation Nathalie in personnel Sandrine in the top administrative office. Again the film's seductive  the sudden rise may be far fetched but you want to see what happens.Sandrine follows Nathalie's instructions and rejects a younger executive who wants to marry her  a big mistake but she sticks to the program. Instead of dating the sincere young man Sandrine seduces Delacroix the firm's married bored fiftyyearold but handsome and lean manager.  Delacroix falls hopelessly in love. Sandrine fakes everything.  Nathalie ignores her own rules and has a secret lover who hurts her.  We have to guess who he is but it's not hard we know that Christophe Fabrice Deville the aged ill boss's son who's heir to the corporate fortune is a gorgeous seducer who's literally driven women to commit suicide right before his eyes  and enjoyed watching.  Christophe has a preposterous backstory to explain his moral emptiness.Things go rapidly downhill when this monster of evil begins to dominate the scene.  It doesn't help that the slightly corpulent Christophe looks more like last year's model than a real person.  Looks and sound effects have started to take over Choses secrtes at this point. There haven't been such scenes of elegant depravity since Visconti.  But there are too many orgies with Bach and Vivaldi masses played at top volume for background. It's over the top the film selfdestructs before one's eyes.  And the oldfashioned moral tale  replete with blatant titillation over the hell' it depicts  morphs into an increasingly tedious and surreal scenario.  There's an angel of annihilation a face transfixed by death a bird of prey pecking at a bleeding chest  we're on the wilder fringes of the French imagination. Cocteau did this sort of thing much better.In a final scene several years later Nathalie and Sandrine now on separate paths have a brief final meeting.

	onyx:emotionText "S P O I L E R SEither because they were too shocking or too bad or just too French JeanClaude Brisseau's previous nine films some just done for TV haven't made it to the US. Choses secrtes Secret Things is having some limited distribution here. The film seduces initially with its intelligence and its elegant look then it betrays us with tendentiousness tedium and numbing excess.  If you loved Luchino Visconti's The Damned or Pier Paolo Pasolini's Sal you will have to see this.  If you respected Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut you may want to consider Choses secrtes which some think does its moral consideration of sex and its orgy scenes better.Whereas Dangerous Liaisons the Choderlos de Laclos classic as well as its various film adaptations involves the plot of a man and a woman to demolish a powerful and wicked female this film involves two women out to get men in general. Brisseau's Nathalie Coralie Revel a stripper coaches Sandrine Sabrina Seyvecou a barmaid on how they can both become powerful through exploiting their own sexual daring. They've just been fired  literally thrown out on the street  from the club where they both work for refusing to have sex with customers afterward. Nathalie persuades the nave penniless Sandrine to move in with her and next day outlines her plan for the two of them to conquer the Paris business world.This is all to be done through sex and from scene one there's plenty of masturbation   orgasms real or faked come as often as explosions in action flicks  and plenty of nudity but only female in each case. Nathalie's simplistic rather oldfashioned rule is that if they can give themselves pleasure they need never be enslaved to any man.  The typically French rationality of Nathalie's exposition of her plan undercuts the obvious softcore aspects of the film  for a while that is.And so does Choses secrtes' splendid appearance the beauty of the two young women is set off by handsome cinematography and a generous use of sumptuous richly colored drapery that makes the dcor a pleasure to look at.  One wishes American filmmakers could generate effects of taste and elegance with such simple means.  But there is more to cinema than the visuals and this movie begins to seem little more than a Vogue shoot.Wilder and prettier  that's the two girls' selling point.  On the strength of a certain provocative appeal we're to believe they're hired at a major financial corporation Nathalie in personnel Sandrine in the top administrative office. Again the film's seductive  the sudden rise may be far fetched but you want to see what happens.Sandrine follows Nathalie's instructions and rejects a younger executive who wants to marry her  a big mistake but she sticks to the program. Instead of dating the sincere young man Sandrine seduces Delacroix the firm's married bored fiftyyearold but handsome and lean manager.  Delacroix falls hopelessly in love. Sandrine fakes everything.  Nathalie ignores her own rules and has a secret lover who hurts her.  We have to guess who he is but it's not hard we know that Christophe Fabrice Deville the aged ill boss's son who's heir to the corporate fortune is a gorgeous seducer who's literally driven women to commit suicide right before his eyes  and enjoyed watching.  Christophe has a preposterous backstory to explain his moral emptiness.Things go rapidly downhill when this monster of evil begins to dominate the scene.  It doesn't help that the slightly corpulent Christophe looks more like last year's model than a real person.  Looks and sound effects have started to take over Choses secrtes at this point. There haven't been such scenes of elegant depravity since Visconti.  But there are too many orgies with Bach and Vivaldi masses played at top volume for background. It's over the top the film selfdestructs before one's eyes.  And the oldfashioned moral tale  replete with blatant titillation over the hell' it depicts  morphs into an increasingly tedious and surreal scenario.  There's an angel of annihilation a face transfixed by death a bird of prey pecking at a bleeding chest  we're on the wilder fringes of the French imagination. Cocteau did this sort of thing much better.In a final scene several years later Nathalie and Sandrine now on separate paths have a brief final meeting.  One has a wholesome life and the other has become a pampered princess  using a stretch limo to suggest the latter's wealth was a genuinely bad idea.  Both women look exactly the same as ever  like this year's models.  The movie has completely disintegrated. There is nothing left to care about.But I did love the drapery in Nathalie's bedroom.

	schema:reviewBody "The anthropologist Jules Henry once wrote that men compete for power women compete for men. Okay it's kind of simple minded but this movie neatly illustrates the point Henry was trying to make. Two women Sandrine and Nathalie meet by accident and begin an affair. Nathalie the older and more experienced of the two teaches Sandrine how to seduce her way up the corporate ladder including instructions on how to improve your fake orgasms. Treat them nice and then dump them for someone better but do it subtly.The first guy at this huge corporation is nothing more than target practice for Sandrine. She works through him to get at the next guy in the bigger office a happily married winsome man with a face that has all the sympathetic appeal of road kill. Sandrine following Nathalie's instructions works overtime at the office and spurns all hits until one night she allows the 47yearold boss in the bigger office to catch her in a doityourself mode. The older man Delacroix whom I'd supposed to be dead since 1863 begins a passionate affair with the delectable young Sandrine. She teases and taunts him and makes him feel vigorous again. He can't do without her. Then after tricking him into visiting her unannounced at her home she lets him wander in on her and Nathalie while they are making love. Only in a French movie would his first question be Are you in love with her? No bothering with the fact that he's got two women humping in front of him. That is what we blueblooded churchgoers call sangfroid. Anyway  skipping some additional steps  Sandrine finally makes it into the office of the boss's son a young rich hunk Christophe. The real boss doesn't count because he's old and moribund. He's my age. But now our story turns a bit and begins to get REALLY creepy.It develops that Nathalie has having an affair with Christophe and has been spying for him too. And this Christophe is a match for the two plotting women believe me. Me cruel? Am I more cruel than God or creation? What a cold blooded cad. Or cod. Let's see. The film turns into what could have been a softcore porn film from any country except that in France they do it to an oratorio by Handel. We have ordinary intercourse but not much of that. Then there's the lesbian affair of course. And let me think oh yes incest and orgies. Christophe winds up marrying Sandrine and as a special treat on their wedding night he has her dragged screaming down to a dungeon and gang banged by a bunch of strangers. All this to the tune of Bach's Missa Solemnis or something and the reassuring sight of softly billowing scarlet curtains. When Nathalie finally plugs Christophe seven times he begs her not to commit suicide because then she will follow him to hell and harass him for eternity. When Christophe dies on the staircase his body is enshrouded by white smoke and a hawk lands on his chest and begins tearing at the bullet holes around his heart. Don't ask.Well Nathalie doesn't kill herself. She goes to prison for seven years marries her prison guard and has a family with him. Sandrine having lost her husband inherits everything he had meaning their vast estate and the huge corporation. She runs the business with the nowchastened Delacroix as her loyal assistant.I'm not trying to hack the movie to pieces although I have made fun of some of it. I found myself genuinely interested in where it was going  in where it could POSSIBLY go next. And I was sincerely happy that both women wound up evidently satisfied with their secure circumstances. And I appreciated the way Sandrine presented herself. She's attractive without being beautiful. And she has a way of grooming herself and walking and posturing that makes the most of what the Intelligent Designer has given her a trait more commonly found in Europeans than Americans if I may make such an Olympian generalization. The story and some of the scenes are pretty erotic but they're done with style. There's little nudity and what there is of it isn't vulgar. I kind of liked the whole thing.".

This is a movie that showcases the violence and the decay that is just under the surface of respectable society. It's about two strong characters who begin down the road to a tragedy of their own making. It questions morality it pushes the limits it steps over 'that thin line' and it takes us over the line with it. It is human weakness irrationality and most of all obsession on film. The acting both in and out of the bedroom was excellent. It is sometimes hard to follow especially with the subtitles but that only makes watching it a second time more worth it. I've never seen it on sale or for rent in a store but if you have an online DVD rental service then you'll have no problem getting a hold of it.".

The joyous impish scenes when the two women dare one another to surreptitiously remove their underwear whilst seated in the subway are long forgotten.

It begins as a feminist fable  the two girls thrown together at a strip club consorting exhibiting and daring one another to ever greater public displays of pleasurable posturing between hands and genitals supposedly in the belief that with training Sandrine can get an office job and sleep her way to the top.Now had this been tongue in cheek  and I'm not saying whose tongue in whose cheek  had M JeanClaude Brisseau the director used a lighter or defter touch the sensual side would have melted our HaagenDazs and there could still have been a thoughtprovoking moral aspect reflecting the power of well the femme fatale.As it is the film gets lost towards the end implying that the playboy office boss is the real manipulator and the girls are mere pawns. The joyous impish scenes when the two women dare one another to surreptitiously remove their underwear whilst seated in the subway are long forgotten. Thankfully Sabrina Seyvecou's natural charms are sufficient to blot out any significant disappointment. She could conquer my office any time.I think the HaagenDazs has left a stain.

But rarely have I seen it given a worse treatment than in JeanClaude Brisseau's goodlooking but shallow SECRET THINGS.  Two French hotties Sandrine and Nathalie are booted from the bar where they both work for refusing to have sex with a patron and defending that decision respectively.  Soon they're moving in together and engaging in an endless series of sexual exploits themselves to prove they aren't like everyone else.  If they can screw in public and get away with it what don't they have the nerve for?  Both women are unemployed and both have healthy sexual appetites.  Why not use what they have to get what they want  in this case climb the corporate ladder?  It's a logical step I guess. But then Sandrine seems perfectly competent in her new job without the sex stuff.  Sure all the men want her and without having to so much as flash a smile their direction she's on her way to being promoted.  So why the insistence on manipulating men too?  I mean aside from the bar incident have they been wronged in some way?  What makes these women tick? The film doesn't quite know and it has to.  Otherwise it's just sex scenes strung together in no discernible order for no apparent reason other than to be titillating on top of intellectual.  Only it isn't either really.  It's far too talky for one thing and it doesn't make a great deal of sense someone please explain to me why there's a wedding in this film. If not for the occasional display of the female form in all its glory SECRET THINGS would be unendurable.  The overheated episodes between Sandrine and Nathalie mostly the masturbatory variety are energetic but redundant and there's an EYES WIDE SHUTesque orgy scene that comes out of left field for no apparent reason other than two minutes have gone by without a sex scene.  Then again this movie hits narrative bankruptcy long before.  And the ending if you can stay awake long enough is absurd.  SECRET THINGS is not nearly as brazen or interesting or complex as it thinks it is.  I don't have the energy to hate it nor would I waste it if I did. The projector stopped about three times throughout an interminable hour and fiftyminute running time I wish it had stopped more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler The opening scene in Secret Things slams you with voyeuristic impact suggesting that this is a softporn exploitation in someone's private bedroom however the scene turns out to be an autoerotic exhibition onstage in a bar in Paris.  Nathalie Coralie Revel is a gorgeous exotic dancer headlining in a dank bar in Paris.  She is fired after a tiff with the calloused owner together with a nave bartender Sandrine Sabrina Seyvecou. The two ladies vow not to be used by men again.  Nathalie encourages Sandrine to loosen her sexual inhibitions to get more out of life.  She instructs Sandrine how to awaken her sexuality both in the bedroom and at public places such as a tunnel in the Metro.  The pair decides to room together and scheme on how they will better their lot in life by using men to climb the ladder of success and become free spirits.After the ladies land a job at the same firm they plot on how to advance their positions using their sensuality as a manipulative tool.  Nathalie quickly maneuvers a job as personnel assistant and Sandrina is now an executive secretary.  Sandrina currently an apt pupil in sexual prowess manages to manipulate her superiors until she finally lands a position as secretary to the main supervisor.  This formerly monogamous married man who is twice Sandrine's age falls madly in love with her to his detriment as they secretly hump their way across the screen both on the job and in other more acceptable venues.  Sandrine flagrantly uses him to advance her career yet plans on dumping him once she conquers the young CEO a handsome and clever womanizer.As the affair with her boss hardens she begins to back off and he becomes more desperate to possess her.  Nathalie on the other hand has fallen hard for an unrevealed lover who apparently has dumped her.  Sandrine attempts to console Nathalie and ultimately winds up in the sack with her.  Now the plot begins to deteriorate as the newfound freedom they were both relishing begins to erode.  Trapped by the amorous attention of her boss Sandrine now imposes upon him to promote Nathalie to their office where they eventually indulge in a mnage  trois.  This scenario further crumbles when the three are discovered in hot embrace in the restroom by the young stud of a CEO who is even more Machiavellian than they are.The plot now totally disintegrates into a banquet of ruthlessness group sex lesbian sex threeway sex and masturbation.  Our heroines now suffering much more than they did before they decided upon their quest to manipulate men go along with the bizarre program foisted upon them.  The story unfolds into some off the wall twists and unexpected ironies however when mixed with the continual bombardment of sexual exploitation adding little to the theme of the story the film takes away more than it provides.The first three quarters of the film are fun and interesting as we observe the women taking charge of their lives and maneuvering through office politics.  The movie falls apart somewhere to the level of a softcore porn movie without rhyme or reason until the plot develops to something secondary to the sexploitations.  The director JeanClaude Brisseau presents quite a banquet of sexuality turning on both men and women audiences throughout the film while maintaining a nice balance of story and visual indulgence.  This picture in French with English subtitles is deftly crafted so that you easily forget that you are reading everything instead of listening to the dialogue.  Nathalie is so stunning and sexual on the screen that it is by itself well worth the price of admission.  It is too bad the story falls apart in the third act nevertheless I would still recommend it for its visual and arousing energy and interesting premise.Opens in the Bay Area February 6th at the Landmark Opera Plaza in San Francisco and in Berkeley at the Shattuck.".

If you are familiar with French films there is a relatively little amount of full frontal nudity. And the sex scenes are on par with those of many a British film. Though that being said whilst the nudity of french cinema might be there to merely add a simple level of realism or aesthetic to the film and the sex of British cinema be there again to add realism and a bit of British bravado. Les Choses Secretes uses sex merely as a plot device and since the plot is pretty awful so is the sex and by extension the film.The film starts with a woman masturbating in front of a big crowd of people at a bar. The bar tender is a young twenty something who seems to have formidable maths skills yet is working at a sleazy bar?. She befriends the masturbating lady and from then the two girls seem intent on playing a game of manipulating men for no apparent reason other than to assert their female dominance on them.What has the potential of being an interesting treatise on feminism ends up essentially being a misogynistic bore. Whilst the first two acts keep you mildly interested with suspense to see how things unfold it is the third act which ruins the film. Too much is given too late we are suddenly confronted with a character and a whole other plot dimension within the last 10 minutes. We are left asking many questions and none of them are answered. This coupled with a bizarrely surprising orgy scene and a curiously operatic score shows how confused the film is. It sits on the fine line between potentially an arty shoot and a soft core porn shoot.It would have been a lot better if it chose to be one or the other.".

At its center this movie bravely and honestly covered a great panoply of the ills found in 'the human condition' with all the builtin conflicts dualities and indefinable vagaries each of us must endure depending to a greater degree on which hand we're dealt at birth. The originality was the movie's hidden reveal  namely the devastation which occurs when a child loses his faith as does Christophe who at 9 years of age finds himself in circumstances too hideous to even contemplate.

At its center this movie bravely and honestly covered a great panoply of the ills found in 'the human condition' with all the builtin conflicts dualities and indefinable vagaries each of us must endure depending to a greater degree on which hand we're dealt at birth. The originality was the movie's hidden reveal  namely the devastation which occurs when a child loses his faith as does Christophe who at 9 years of age finds himself in circumstances too hideous to even contemplate. With time this movie will grow in its appeal and its audience and be seen as the truly unique and wondrous film that it is.";

Even as a gay man i found the sexual tension palpable and clearly not for any gratuitous reasons. This movie found the perfect balance of what was shown and what was not. Many men whom believe in a innate weakness of women would not like to watch this movie it will make you feel uncomfortable.

	schema:reviewBody "In fact it's a bit of a soap opera. Take away all the sex and you're left with some boring office politics you've seen dozens of times before.The story has 2 girls Nathalie and Sandrine get fired from their jobs at a tawdry Paris strip club. They move in together and strike up some kind of weird halflesbian friendship. Sandrine has never had an honest orgasm and Nathalie teaches her how to. She also teaches her to lose her inhibitions and masturbate in public. Wow this may have been shocking back in the 80s with Nine and Half Weeks and even lesser drivel like Wild Orchid but now in the 21st century it's just plain boring. If the film thought it could use this frank portrayal of sexuality in its favor then it is very much mistaken.In fact the most interesting part of the film is when Nathalie and Sandrine both get jobs in the same office and use their sexiness to climb the ladder. This bit has also been done before in Neil Labute's In The Company of Men but not as good. It's here that the best characters are featured but towards the end of the second act the film goes off in another tangent with the evil boss of the company turning out to be a crazed sexmaniac with delusions of godhood.Again sexuality is used as a way of shock or arousing us but it just fails. There's so many other films out there that try the same thing and if you want to succeed at it then you either have to be really erotic or just plain pornographic yup two different things. Choses Secretes is neither. And the women need to seriously think about shaving George W. if you know what I mean. I know European women like to be au naturel but DAMN!Overall Choses Secretes is neither good or bad. It's simply middle of the road. For a film that tries to sell itself on loads of sex it's somewhat ironic that the best bits are in the scenes where people are just talking.".

During a drunken confessional a close relative tells Oleg that his father is a Jew and still alive in Moscow.This fact turns Oleg's life upsidedown partly out of revulsion from whom he is descended and partly because he wants to know and be with his father and he must someway reconcile himself with this with discovery.The film is not one necessarily of thoughtful quiet introspection but of hijinx clashes and turmoil and interactions. Oleg vacillates between his role as the participatory leader of a brutal gang and that of a son learning about his father. Without giving away too much information Luna Park the amusement park where it begins is where it ends and is a metaphor for Russia and what it has to face.Luna Park may not be a pretty film. There's the ugly side to human nature depicted in the brutal actions of the skinheads and the decay of Russian society that the skinheads blame on foreigners and Jews. But the majority of the film regards Oleg's journey and transformation as he gets to know his father and this is the rewarding and ultimately beautiful side of the film.".

	schema:headline " A Film that Defines a Generation";
	schema:reviewBody "Zach Braff's Garden State manages to accomplish something that very few films have been able to do throughout the history of cinema. It is a film that speaks to an entire generation. 1947's The Best Years of Our Lives spoke to our grandparents. The Graduate spoke to our parents. Fight Club spoke to our older brothers working deadend jobs in the 90's. But it is with the arrival of Garden State that our generation is spoken to those of us born in the earlymid 80's who are in our late teens and early twenties trying to make it by in a environment that seems all at once to strange and yet so familiar.Homecoming is the theme of Garden State. Andrew Largeman Zach Braff has been away from his hometown of New Jersey for the past nine years and returns to attend the funeral for his mother. While having been gone Andrew has been on lithium and other forms of antidepressant medication all prescribed to him by his psychiatrist father Gideon Ian Holm. Upon his homecoming Andrew has decided to take a vacation from his medication and take some time to reconnect with himself. From there the plot grows as he connects with old friends and makes new ones and discovers the joys of life and love mostly thanks to the arrival of freespirited Sam Natalie Portman. Braff has written and directed scenes that qualify to go down in the movie history books along such moments as Pulp Fiction's dance sequence and The Deer Hunter's Russian roulette scenes. Two of said scenes that come to mind are when Sam takes Andrew up to her room for the first time and does something totally original that has never been done before in this location and will never be copied again throughout the rest of human existence in order to ease the pain of an awkward situation. Another scene occurs late in the film when the three principals stand at the edge of a seemingly endless abyss and scream at the tops of their lungs into the gorge. It is this moment that defines with one pure act the epitome of what it feels to be in your late teens early 20's looking out at life. Standing at the edge of life and screaming. While all the acting is noteworthy including a hilarious cameo by Method Man yes that's right Method Man it is Natalie Portman who steals the show. Sam is in essence the adult version of her character from Beautiful Girls. She's 26 but an old soul. It his in her that the movie comes out the realm of quirky offkilter comedy and gains heart soul and intimacy all to rare to achieve in films these days. Bravo Ms. Portman. In addition Peter Sarsgaard is becoming one of my new favorite actors after having seen him in this film Shattared Glass and Boys Don't Cry within a matter of approximately three weeks. I will go on record an call Garden State a masterpiece. It does exactly what films are supposed to do take from all areas of art and incorporate them into one. It is a passionate mixture of visual flare tremendous dialogue hip music and heartwarming pathos. I encourage anyone who is young to see this film. See it with the people you care about this is your film this is OUR film and it couldn't be better.".

Listening to the answer machine message from his dad about his mother's death was disturbing and really drew me in.So many memorable moments The funeral touching and funny the party scenes the scan scene...And as for the dialogue  well sharp and witty. I don't think I will ever forget Natalie Portman's dancing in her bedroom  just to be 'unique' or Zach Braff's touching comments about what makes a 'home' in the swimming pool.Even those touching moments were funny the fact that he couldn't swim!As a mid twentysomething This film really spoke to me. It's that question we all dread. We've graduated university got jobs....then what?Fantastic...just a shame it is not on wide release here...One of the best films I have seen in ages!910".

It can be slow or awkward from time to time and there are one or two moments that just don't work.  But.  By and large I was really impressed.It's a great little story with just the right balance of comedy and drama full of quirky characters and interesting performances.  Ian Holm demands attention as always and Natalie Portman's Sam while offputting at first definitely grew on me as she grew into a real character.But the real story here is Zack Braff.  It should surprise no one who has ever watched Scrubs that his performance keeps the movie together or that he is able to create a jokey distant somewhat sarcastic character who also elicits real empathy from the audience and manages to emanate deep wounds. What amazes me is the work he has done here as a first time writerdirector.First off there is an actual narrative here with meaning and relevance. Too often the big Hollywood movies will have a plot that resolves itself but means nothing on the flip side independent movies almost seem to disdain plot for mood and thematic concerns.  Braff is able to weave both togethera difficult task for a young writer.  The dialogue is witty plot situations intelligent and creative and overall the writing is justgood.As for his directing there are a few odd choices.  I'm still not sure I like one scene the main characters are screaming into a deep ravine and the camera sweeps away into said ravine.  It just tossed me out of the movie a bit.  I'm also not completely sure what to make of the movie's ending which I won't go into further except to say that I felt it almost changed the focus of the movie up to that point and made it about something else. However there are moments of absolutely beauty as well here.  The entire scene where Sam and Andrew talk in his friend's pool has some great shots and Braff's comedic flair and timing are evident in his directing style which still manages to pull back for the more dramatic and poignant moments.I urge you to see this movie.  It's not a big movie.  It was never meant to be.  But I have little doubt that once it finds an audience it will be remembered for years to come.  Sort of a modern day Graduate with a more hopeful outlook on life.".

Besides that this movie overwhelmingly surprised me with its directing and acting. Natatlie Portman did an amazing job playing Sam. She really worked the part. Zach Braff's directing debut is stunning. I had never heard of Braff except for his character on the TV show Scrubs. He also did an excellent job acting. There were so many surprising elements thrown out during the movie. Braff just kept piling one thing on top of the next to make the story more interesting as it rolled on. I was very pleased with Garden State!!!!!!!!!11".

I don't need to see a movie that captures the Garden State.What I do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy on you. We'll use some bulletpoints. There are probably some spoilers that follow. Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie ANYWAY The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing. Example Large What are you listening to? Sam The Shins. Ever heard of 'em? No. Listen to this song  it will change your life! And then they proceed to play that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. Don't you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you  the viewer  how to react to something? I love that! Hey they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing us to chuckle Say 'aaaaaw' cry feel inspired etc. The scenes were SO BAD. SO Clich. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example The entire movie. But no really example They're in the rainy quarry by the ark. Large runs up  in the pouring rain oh he's SO TORMENTED!  on top of a piece of heavy machinery and SCREAMS! Oh how moving! But wait! Here comes Sam and his buddy the annoying drug addict and they ALL SCREAM!!!! BUT WAIT!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! Here it comes! THEY KISS!!! LONG DEEP!!!! IN THE RAIN!!!!!!!! The dialogue was SO BAD. SO Clich. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They're leaving the ark and Sam says something like Hey. Good luck exploring the infinite abyss. And the guy says back You too. Oh...Oh my! I never realized...could it be? Oh my God it is! Large's life is like...ohmigod...AN INFINITE ABYSS!!!! Another example Large and Sam in the airport. Sam says something like Is this goodbye? Not enough for ya? OK Largeman says something like This isn't a period at the end of the sentence... it's an ellipses. And guess what happens when he tries to walk down the jetway and go back to his life in LA. You know what? Don't guess. It's a waste of your time.It's a Grade Z Wes Anderson ripoff movie. When not busy being melodramatic and clich the movie spends lots of times with crazykookyoffkilter characters. Hey Sam's brother... thank you Zach Braff for including him because it really made the movie so much more textured. Also ripping off Anderson the dialogue. Scene Sam and Largeman are in a bar. In walks friends Vagina! says one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam so one of the friends says Sorry I said vagina. And Sam says It's OK. Inventive cinematography that's not inventive but pointless and annoying. Give me a break with the speedupslow down of film. Again Wes Anderson does it effectively in his movies. And it was done well in Donnie Darko. But really it was pointless. Wow. A crazy party where people are taking X and snorting coke. Better roll out all the tricks! You can count the good moments on one hand even if you're missing fingers. That's what makes it even WORSE. The retarded quarterback thing...well that was good! The little thing he largeman says as they're about to enter the quarry something about huffing turpentine...that was good! Oh wait that's about it.You know Zach Braff is I think always a little too cute. But he's likable. But man this is forced pretentious melodramatic have you gotten that yet? overly cute overly everything. This movie is terrible. Apparently I'm outnumbered as this waste of time is currently rated an 8.0.Please though if you're looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique DO. NOT. RENT. THIS. MOVIE.".

	schema:reviewBody "Garden State must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time. The plot is a simple one involving a young man returning home after his mother's death and discovering love. But really the plot isn't important. What is important to Zach Braff  writer director and star  is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an 'indie' or 'arty' film. We therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that don't exist for reasons of plot or character development but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film  la Wes Anderson  or so Braff hopes. Unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly Braff has not only fooled many on IMDb but also some critics who really ought to have known better.Of course Braff's gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make Garden State a bad film. What really makes Garden State a stinker is Braff's script. He simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal. Braff often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he can't achieve through the writing. For example the numbness of the Braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash this can't be worked into the plot and so has to take place in a dream! later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss life  a bottomless abyss very clever Mr Braff. Those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen.On the plus side the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with by which I mean a script and I do admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as the love interest  a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that Braff moulds into his fantasy woman.It apparently took Braff 3 years to write the script for Garden State 3 years to write a script this bad  he really is inept!. Hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film.".

The disjointed plot may have been more engaging if it weren't interspersed with pointless scenes that were nothing more than quirky. Coincidentally these scenes are often the ones that are relayed in conversation Zack walking past faucets that turn on as he passes crazy undercranked party scene shouting over a gorge the list goes on.The main character is flat disengaging and ultimately unlikable which is exhibited most in the scene where he talks to his father selfishly ignoring his fathers problems including a recently deceased wife and droning on about his own What am I to do with my life? problem.The film ends when Andrew Zach Braff decides not to go back to LA because he cannot tear himself from the love of his life Sam Natalie Portman whom he has known for 2 days. Which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight cures occupational dilemmas... Sure you could interpret it as a misappropriation of priorities but if that is the case it could have been done better. Much better.This film does not know what it wants to be. A drama a comedy a teenagewasteland film or a gamut of other things. I say this not as a singlegenre oriented person but as a person who loves multigenre pieces such as those mastered by Stanley Kubrick. The reason I feel it does not work for Garden State is because rather than blending the genres together it jumps around one scene is one genre the next another and back again so on.I have heard many people tell me to cut Zach Braff some slack after all it was his first feature film and he debuted as Director Writer and lead actor. Impressive as it was a first film I should think that with as much money as he has he could do better. There have been much better firsttime feature film directors Michel Gondry Human Nature David Gordon Green George Washington. Maybe if he stuck to writing OR directing OR acting it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented performer maybe his second attempt won't be so tedious and disjointed.".

In this classic case of Telling instead of showing I personally was annoyed as I felt that as an intelligent viewer I didn't need to be spoonfed these ideas but rather as in any wellwritten movie or literary piece could have derived them from the work itself without them being thrown into my face.Please keep in mind that this was something of a Devil's advocate opinion as I did enjoy parts of the film and certainly recommend it above most of the other films in theaters now.".

Sure Zach Braff star of a rather overrated sitcom surprises people with some talent behind the camera but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. Indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones. Garden State isn't atrocious but its isn't great.First off the film is too quick resulting in a rather fast reemergence of Large into his former life. After ten years people tend to act like he never left. Where's the awkwardness? Of course the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene which I will say was portrayed rather accurately. The film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. However it fails to deliver on those fronts leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved like Peter Saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies. It wasn't completely abysmal but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Garden State is another of these indietype pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real truetolife human drama. Oddly enough the production is very good so are the performances by some fairly bigname actors as well. Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff's script which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.When you're as young as Braff is you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. Braff's experience looks to be from watching movies then repeating the same trite clichs in his own movie. In Garden State he plays Andrew Largeman a semisuccessful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to bury his mother who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. He appears to have no feeling about any of this he has no relationship with his father who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident as a sixyearold and has no particular despondency over losing his mother in fact he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his who works as a cemetery gravedigger. It all smacks heavily of Beautiful Girls also about a guy who returns to his hometown to find himself and hang with his old friends with a little Ordinary People thrown in on the side. It's really a miracle Braff could accomplish anything at all in his life given his father and his useless friends I'm surprised he didn't kill himself who are still living their lives as though they're still in high school partying with dumb bimbos drinking and drugging etc. None of them even recognize him from his TV role as the retarded quarterback Natalie Portman's character the most aware person in the movie does and say things like Hey I remember you from Junior year. These guys are such losers for them watching television would be a cultural leap forward. Even one friend who made millions inventing a silent Velcro has no real reason to live because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying. And you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore.Braff it is revealed is heavily medicated which keeps from feeling and dealing with anything really like an adult would. Then he meets Sam Natalie Portman a sortof lost girl who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10yearold in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size. Anyway they fall in love and Braff learns to feel again. The clichs come fast and furious. Braff has a long delayed hearttoheart talk with his cold distancing father and tells him What It Is and The Name Of The Game. In one scene Braff and Portman are in the millionaire kid's house playing touchyfeely is front of a giant fireplace and the bit is so routine so standard movieschtick I swear I halfexpected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire. In another Braff visits a doctor Ron Liebman to get his junk refilled and Liebman tells him in easily the worst line in the movie The body can play tricks on you. I once found my exbestfriend's cufflinks in my wife's purse and I didn't have an erection for a year and a half. Obviously no licensed physician would ever say that but it's dirtbag poetry a nod from Braff to I guess his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them just as the 37 joke in Clerks was Kevin Smith's nod to his dirtbag buddies. Anyway Braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope the story plays itself out predictably. But if you're going to have a movie that's walltowall clichs at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it. And Braff does. He has the right sort of vacancy of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonkedout Andrew both real and poignant and Natalie Portman also of Beautiful Girls gives the movie a big lift. With her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother and Peter Saarsgard though much better in Shattered Glass is notable as the gravedigger friend. I would recommend Garden State if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece they're just clueless. Braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot write in a few fks and awesomes and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material. It doesn't.".

Andrew BRAFF is a failed actor trying to make it in LA when his mother dies he is forced to go back to his town in New Jersey for a couple of days where he reencounters his past. This might sound familiar till you met the Klingon medieval knight the man who reinvented the wheel with a twist and the misfits version of Noe's biblical apocalypse to top that Andrew's family is the mount Himalayas of dysfunctional families facing a Murphy's law gone mad kind of scenario. He put his mother on a wheel chair when he was nine and has his own father giving psychiatric advice and a lot of pills. The last thing I would expect from the funny doctor of SCRUBS is to write direct and act in what is hands down the best story of the year. Already comparisons with ALLEN let me tell you that for a debut feature he has managed to trash the early years and move straight to the best subtle blend of comedy and drama that are MANHATTAN and ANNIE HALL. There is nothing classic about the structure that works as a relentless succession of magic moments chain together with great gags. Something that opens musically with COLDPLAY can not possibly go wrong and it doesn't gets even better when we are introduced to the song that will change your life I promise or so says Sam NATALIE PORTMAN I'm not sure if somethings can be change that easy but certainly will have you running to buy the soundtrack when the credits roll the song NEW SLANG... the band THE SHINS. BRAFF acts his way out even when he struggles with the more dramatic bits thanks to his companions. I have never understood all the buzz with PORTMAN so he played an OK role in LEON and moved on to the galaxy far away... so what? I really think this is the turning point for her at least she has been given the chance to chew a very challenging persona and delivers an honest performance and then we get PETER SARSGARD who is mastering the art of getting great chunks of acting from the STAR WARS puppets as he did with VADER in SHATTERED GLASS. He is the most talented actor of this crew following GABRIEL BYRNE advice that in acting the most important things are looks movements and silences. In the best year for both music and films since the Tarantino revolution I dare to say if you only watch one film this year make it to GARDEN STATE and you better make it quick because HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS may have that edge. Like the SHINS would say it's a luscious mix of words and tricks watch it. ".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that the movie made only 26 mil in 26 weeks clearly shows how poorly it was written. This of course is a common problem with actor ego projects. The story has many unnecessary scenes that don't connect or contribute at all to the story or characters but are thrown in for the sake of getting a cheap laugh  like the knight in the kitchen and the fast motion party scenes. The entire film is full of extra meaningless shots and scenes that could easily be and should have been cut. Why should we care about this character? The film contains virtually no conflict or drama or emotion or humor or cleverness or originality. We have no reason to care one way or the other about Graff. Other than the girlfriend who is well written everyone else is straight out of a bad college student film as are most of the scenes and the story in general. The movie was so concerned with trying to be antiHollywood that it failed to be anything else but that. There is virtually no story here just style in place of substance and the style isn't even new or different  rather straight from the 70s. So if you're a college student longing for the old days of the 60s  70s you'll really enjoy this film. For the rest of the world  well Nepolion Dynamite made almost double the box office and that wasn't so great either but at least it was original.".

I don't mind a love story I like subtle ones as well as the cheesy stuff but this is just useless. I'm sure some readers of the Guardian lefty UK newspaper will enjoy it but that's by no means a recommendation...It started off a bit 'Grosse Point Blank' like although that is clearly a great movie then it descended into a poor man's 'Lost in Translation'. Two people connecting... that's about all I got from this movie. The jokes aren't funny in fact I did wonder at one point if I was even supposed to laugh! I feel sad that I wasted my time watching it and I sincerely hope that you don't make the same mistake. Why it has such a high rating on here I'll never know but at least it means I might get some money back selling it on eBay!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like serial killer films that like to tax your brain you should probably give this movie a look exactly the reasoning I was following when I picked this up at a video store. Chances are you'll be entertained by what you see. Just don't expect this one to be a nailbiter like Silence of the Lambs or Se7en. This one comes across as more than a little forced at times something that can't be levelled against those two superior films.The plot setup is as follows. A forensic psychologist whom we get to see in action in an unrelated case as an introduction Dr. Alex Cross played by Morgan Freeman is placed in a personal position when his niece disappears among 8 other women  two of which are soon found dead in a forest clearly brutally raped earlier. Cross a clever guy soon determines that the other six are probably alive out there somewhere including his niece. Meanwhile a young doctor named Kate Ashley Judd is herself captured by the rapistmurderetc. we see the events unfolding from her perspective. She however manages to escape. Dr. Cross and she then try to solve the case so that Cross's niece may be rescued.From here on we get standard cop thriller fare  and I'm not saying that as a bad thing as such stories when well crafted are inherently interesting  with a clear bond not a romantic one forming between Cross and Kate. Of course plot twists abound you get plenty of surprises about who the killer might be until the inevitable and a bit predictable violent conclusion. Of course the serial killer seems to be pretty kinky an important element for a film like this his depravity is unfortunately or fortunately? never fully fleshed out.Through it all Morgan Freeman does an admirable job. You feel the weight of his intellect and emotion as he goes about this personal case even when the script doesn't project this weight itself. It's fascinating to see a professional transcend this material so easily. Freeman makes this film 100  he's not only realistic but also heavily charismatic without seeming forced as Al Pacino on latecareerautopilot seems to be. Ashley Judd does a good job as does the supporting cast well... the serial killer isn't that great... though a certain scene where she emotionally tells her story to Cross is way forced.There are times however when great acting just can't make up for a mechanical script. It's not that the plot is bad itself it's that it's exposed somewhat mundanely. It seems as though whenever a plot point is determined by the characters they dwell on it for a bit until it becomes uninteresting and then the next plot point is delivered to us. The method of delivery never seems to flow out of the film's preceding movement and often defies common sense why would a psychologist be able to pick up a medical reference and easily pick out the drug used on a victim when the actual medical doctors could not? it's possible but seems a bit too convenient.The film's handling of the script is good. It looks good and sounds good in 5.1 surround. I still couldn't help but notice that all the tricks one normally sees that are supposed to increase tension and drama are used in this film too even when the script just doesn't provide the same tension and drama. For instance when Freeman makes a solemn pronouncement about some trait of the killer he randomly decided on because he's so good. When this happens it feels like the movie is going through the motions no matter how hard it tries it's just not as hardhitting or dark as say Se7en. Often enough though the cinematographer's and director's work fits the screenplay perfectly especially during the action at the end. The experienced movie goer however will probably detect a moment of randomness watch the camera work during the bar scene with the three detectives after Jeremy Piven asks Ashley Judd to stay still  I'm probably nitpicking here.Well there you go. It's a good movie but quite cliched and too often it just doesn't feel right. But if you use it to admire Morgan Freeman's work you will be entertained. 610".

Freeman is excellent as Alex Cross and heroine Judd is a study in grit and survival and is very effective in a finely nuanced role.

This is mostly due to its cast and fine thriller concept that however doesn't always gets handled well.Not all plotlines get handled and wrapped up properly and the movie leaves some loose ends. The movie also picks some not so likely approaches with each story sometimes which goes at the expensive of the credibility and therefore also the tension of the movie.It's a movie that had the potential of becoming a real dark and eerie thriller I mean the concept of the movie would definitely allow this but the movie gets somewhere stuck between its successful and not so successful thriller moments.Guess Morgan Freeman wanted to make another Se7en like thriller. Well it's not completely fair to compare this movie to Se7en but because Morgan Freeman is in it and it's from about the same period it's easy and tempting to do so. Also with some imagination the plots and approaches of both movies show some similarities. But unfortunately Kiss the Girls is nowhere in the same league as Se7en but fans of the genre will still find plenty to enjoy in this movie.The movie features all of the right required thriller ingredients. So a psychopath a cop trying to solve the case and of course a couple of plot twists. It also has all the right looks for a thriller. The movie has the right sort of dark undertone and handles some of its moments effectively.The movie truly benefits from its cast. Morgan Freeman is an experienced actor and always good in these sort of roles. The movie also among other features Ashley Judd Cary Elwes Bill Nunn Brian Cox and Jeremy Piven.A better than average thriller.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Also with some imagination the plots and approaches of both movies show some similarities. But unfortunately Kiss the Girls is nowhere in the same league as Se7en but fans of the genre will still find plenty to enjoy in this movie.The movie features all of the right required thriller ingredients. So a psychopath a cop trying to solve the case and of course a couple of plot twists. It also has all the right looks for a thriller. The movie has the right sort of dark undertone and handles some of its moments effectively.The movie truly benefits from its cast. Morgan Freeman is an experienced actor and always good in these sort of roles. The movie also among other features Ashley Judd Cary Elwes Bill Nunn Brian Cox and Jeremy Piven.A better than average thriller.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

Freeman has the kind of screen presence that other actors only dream of possessing. He is calm reassuring magnetic... he is wise without acting like a knowitall maturity and decency seem to radiate from him. It's interesting to ponder whether Freeman is really that good of an actor or if he simply possesses an overdose of charisma like Errol Flynn. In any event he's the best thing about 'Kiss The Girls' a standardissue sickoontheloosekidnappingbeautifulwomen thriller. It's basically a rehash of 'Silence of the Lambs' without the Hannibal Lecter character. And without the style. Much is hinted at and some of the dialogue is explicit but that's as far as 'Kiss The Girls' goes. Visually it's really pretty dull. Good thing it has Morgan Freeman to aim the camera at. Ashley Judd plays the one who gets away a kidnap victim who escapes the psycho's dungeon. And it is literally a dungeon. No basement or shed. A real dungeon. She is also a brilliant doctor. See this sick creep likes to kidnap INTELLIGENT and INDEPENDENT women. No airheads for him. Unfortunately this little twist in the usual plot provides no new ideas or fresh situations unless you count Freeman's daughter playing the violin. Judd is adequate in the notverybelievable role she strikes me as a female Keanu Reeves something sort of androidish about her. And good old Cary Elwes warning spoiler coming is surprise! the psychotic kidnapper. Like we were going to believe he was a sincere good old boy policeman. Poor Cary Elwes he is really typecast. But I can see why. He just has that kind of face. 'Kiss The Girls' seems a lot like your typical TVmovie of the week it's what the critics call an 'agreeable timefiller'... but it DOES have Morgan Freeman in it.".

An eerie atmosphere prevails throughout and some interesting characters tense moments and unexpected developments ensure that the action remains thoroughly engrossing right through to the movie's gripping climax.Alex Cross Morgan Freeman is a Washington D.C. police detective and forensic psychologist who travels to Durham North Carolina when his niece Naomi Gina Ravera becomes the latest in a series of young women who have recently disappeared. He soon discovers that the missing women have all been kidnapped by a man who calls himself Casanova and one of his captives has been killed and left in a forest tied up to a tree. Cross is relieved to discover that the murder victim isn't his niece but very soon after a local young doctor called Kate McTiernan Ashley Judd is also kidnapped from her home.Cross is a cool and methodical character who after studying the available information comes to the conclusion that Casanova is actually a collector rather than a serial killer and is probably only murdering the women who persist in disobeying his orders.Kate McTiernan is a feisty person whose pastimes include kickboxing. She's initially kept in a drugged state by her captor and when she recovers consciousness finds herself in an underground cell where she can hear the voices of the other unseen captives. Shortly after she manages to make her escape when she bravely jumps from a very high cliff and has to be rescued from the river below before having to spend some time recuperating in hospital. When her recovery is complete Kate and Cross decide to work together to hunt down Casanova. Despite the useful information that Kate is able to contribute to the investigation their task becomes more complicated when some new clues unexpectedly point them in the direction of Los Angeles.Kiss The Girls is wellmade visually impressive and has a consistent sense of impending danger. The dialogue is good and occasionally amusing for example when the unhelpful Durham Police Chief tells Cross to make yourself at home but don't mess around in the kitchen. It also has a very talented cast and two lead performances which are excellent both individually and in the way that they complement each other. Morgan Freeman is faultless as the intelligent investigator and Ashley Judd conveys her character's combination of courage and vulnerability very convincingly. Freeman and Judd interact naturally and the scenes in which Kate is abducted and later escapes from her captor's hideout provide some of the movie's best moments.".

Elwes does superb acting in this film and really displays his range. After reading the novel I was surprised by Freemans casting. He impressed me with his comittment to the character however during the film he seemed overdramatic taking away from the realism of the story what makes the film and novel so terrorizing. Ashley Judd played Kate McTieran well and portrayed Pattersons heroine with the courage and bravery expected. Where the movie falls short is in the script. The adaptation leaves out numerous key elements to the story. What makes the plot so riveting is the psychological trauma Cassanova and the Gentleman caller force onto their captives. With brief scenes portraying the womens captivity they film takes away from the character development of the murderers and focuses too heavily on superfluous tidbits not necessary to the story. If you are seeking a true thriller you may want to choose another movie. Although the film is entertaining and the acting decent the novel is much better and the thriller genre is better utilized in other films.".

He impressed me with his comittment to the character however during the film he seemed overdramatic taking away from the realism of the story what makes the film and novel so terrorizing. Ashley Judd played Kate McTieran well and portrayed Pattersons heroine with the courage and bravery expected. Where the movie falls short is in the script. The adaptation leaves out numerous key elements to the story. What makes the plot so riveting is the psychological trauma Cassanova and the Gentleman caller force onto their captives. With brief scenes portraying the womens captivity they film takes away from the character development of the murderers and focuses too heavily on superfluous tidbits not necessary to the story. If you are seeking a true thriller you may want to choose another movie. Although the film is entertaining and the acting decent the novel is much better and the thriller genre is better utilized in other films.";

Cross is a detective and psychologist who works for the Washington DC police department. As a series of young women are kidnapped in the area around Durham North Carolina Cross is drawn into the case when his own niece falls prey to the kidnapper. Only a couple of bodies have been found leading Cross to believe that those killed are being punished for some reason and that the kidnapper is actually collecting women as trophies and keeping them alive for some unknown reason. The story doesn't really revolve around Cross's niece though. It's power comes from the kidnapping of young Dr. Kate MacTiernan Ashley Judd. It's her ordeal that we basically follow through to her desperate escape and then her involvement with Cross in trying to track down the man responsible. This becomes a truly taut thriller  very exciting and with a real sense of suspense about exactly how this is going to be resolved. A mystery is introduced when evidence seems to point to the possibility that the kidnapper is working not only in North Carolina but also in California because there have been a number of similar disappearances there.Freeman and Judd were very good in these roles. Both captured their characters almost from the start and both were totally believable. I felt that almost too much was introduced near the end of this with the result being that I found myself confused by exactly what was happening. Perhaps that's appropriate for this kind of movie but the confusion seemed almost too much although eventually everything came back together and there's a good finish to the story. 810".

Often said by moviegoers to be the actor whose presence has the most authority of any of his generation Freeman has an exceptional bearing on the screen a particular determination that we believe. He never looks or sound like he's pretending. He never gives a superficial obvious or distracted impression and even in movies that aren't that good he's not guilty by association You feel he's genuine even as a film may capsize around him.Freeman plays Patterson's pet character Alex Cross a forensic psychologist with the Washington D.C. police who becomes entrenched in a chain of kidnappings in North Carolina. When his own niece is taken he flies there and calls on the police department where he's kept waiting for hours until he ultimately barges into the office of the chief. The victims are being taken by a man who inscribes himself Casanova and one of his victims is found dead tied to a tree and left for the critters to find. Cross questions why there aren't more bodies and speculates that Casanova is a collector who kills only when he believes he needs to. His niece and her fellow captives must still be alive somewhere. His hypothesis is certified by what comes of extraordinarily sexy local doctor Ashley Judd who also gives the sometimes humdrum drama a helping of forceful energy.And what Freeman brings to all of his scenes is a really specific thoughtfulness. He doesn't just listen he appears to cogitate what he is told to gauge it. That masterful attribute begets a funny outcome when other actors will tell him something and then stop to see if he trusts it. And Judd shows us such a boldly defined personality which makes their dialogue scenes after she's been developed for awhile engrossing.Kiss the Girls was directed by Gary Fleder whose first feature Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead boasted skill but too much artifice. Here he's more careful and restrained with a story where the shades and details are as chilling as anything else. Here as in Seven we get a steady feeling of not being able to see everything we believe we want to as in a chase through the woods which Fleder makes effectively tense through its efficient use of space never revealing the distance between victim and pursuer.When the film is over and we know all of its enigmas there's one we'd like to know more about What precisely are particulars of the histrionics between the two most nefarious characters? But being left with such a wringer is much more fulfilling in a way than being given the explanation in the conventional fastsketch Freudian description. What we're also left with is the genuine feeling of having met two authentically defined people in the leads. Freeman and Judd are so good you almost wish they'd chosen not to make a thriller at all had just discovered a way to create a drama really sinking their teeth into their characterizations. All things considered I would've preferred that movie.".

And how did the busy surgeon suddenly find time to tag along a police investigation? At the end when Alex fires the shot how come none of the cops outside the house come rushing in or even before when all the commotion was going on?";

	schema:reviewBody "The niece of a Washington D. C. police psychologist disappears from her campus in North Carolina. The psychologist Freeman goes down to help out the local cops. Shortly another young woman Judd an intern at the local Regional Center is likewise kidnapped. We follow her story as she is taken to an underground dungeon drugged and bound and raped. She escapes. Judd and Freeman join forces. They match the local kidnappings which sometimes end in murder with others that seem to follow the same pattern in California. They fly to California and discover that a cosmetic surgeon who lives in Marina Del Ray all L.A. doctors live in Marina Del Ray has ordered a huge supply of the rarely used drug that was used on Judd during her captivity.If you find this a little confusing wait until you see the movie. The plot is not simply complicated but riddled with lacunae. Unless I blinked at the wrong moment the movie doesn't explain the relationship between the East Coast killer and the West Coast killer who is duplicating him. I also have no idea how the Eastern killer got hold of the same drug that the West Coast killer is using. And I don't understand why just before they fly to L.A. Freeman rejects Judd's suggestion that they notify the F.B.I. It's impossible for anyone to know why after Judd escapes from the killer's hideaway she stumbles through perhaps 100 yard of forest then jumps into the river and yet the police and the FBI still can't find the obvious superterranian entrance to the killer's lair. I mean why couldn't they figure out that it must be located along a two or three miles stretch of the river less than 100 yeard from the left bank? Why do they refer to benzodiazepines as benzos when docs call them diazepines? I don't know why the killers off some of the girls and preserve others. The first girl who is offed is Heidi Schanz. The killer deserves to be strung up by his Buster Browns for that. I don't care how many rules she's broken. No additional clarity is provided by the director who seems to have found out that a camera can be hand held. And the editing introduces further murk. Quick cuts of Ashley Judd practicing her kick boxing in the dungeon with an occasional brief shot of her doing nothing in particular. Irrelevant tanker trucks that zoom suddenly out of nowhere and almost run Freeman down at a tense moment.Why go on? Some people will undoubtedly like it because watching it will be comforting. Like all rituals watching a variation on the serial killer theme may provide a fixed point in a changing and disappointing universe. Well a chaque a son gout. I don't know how many times I've heard Stan Getz's solos with Woody Herman's band but I could listen to them a hundred more times. Speaking of music somebody plays a sprightly jig from a suite by Bach and later another piece. The first is really difficult. The violinist deserves a medal for introducing some unexpectedly fresh airs into an otherwise stale production.A shame too because the leads are both imposing performers in their different ways.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Some unknown serial kidnapmurderer is on the loose in the woods outside Durham North Carolina. It gets back to Washington that the niece of D.C PD Dr. Alex Cross Morgan Freeman Naomi Gina Ravera is missing and possibly kidnapped by the killer and has Dr. Cross shoot down to Durham to not only find Naomi but solve the crimes and catch the perpetrator. Alex Cross is a man not to be taken lightly by the local Durham PD or anyone else for that matter. He's a Inspector Doctor PHD of criminology in the police department of a major US city Washington D.C. Cross is also a well known and top selling author of books about crime and a famous Forensic Psychologist who's wrote scores of collage papers on the workings of the criminal mind. On top of all that Dr. Cross has a degree in Pharmacology the science of drugs and the effects that they have on those who use them.The police find one of the missing girls dead in the woods tied to a tree but happily for Dr. Cross she's not his niece Naomi. As all the leads are being checked out by the police Dr. Kate McTiernan Ashely Judd who works in the Durham General Hospital. Kate gets kidnapped by the killer and is drugged and put in a cell underground in the woods that used to be the basement of an old southern plantation. We learn from Kate after her rescue that the killer who calls himself Casanova because he thinks that he's the world's greatest lover likes to get beautiful as well as strong willed and psychically active young women and then break them down mentally and turn them into a bunch of obedient and helpless sexslave zombies who will do anything he wants them to.Kate fakes being drugged and kicks and boxes her way out of the cell that Casanova locked her into and then running through the woods she jumps down a waterfall and escapes from the pursuing Romeo. In the hospital Dr. Cross concludes that Kate was under the influence of a powerful knockout drug called Sistol which doesn't show up in a persons blood and urine. Checking out the sale of Sistol Cross finds out that a curtain Doc. William Randolph Tony Goldwyn an L.A plastic surgeon who comes from Durham ordered the largest supply of Sistol in the country and Sistol has nothing to do with plastic surgery. Dr. Cross and Kate fly to L.A with D.C Det. Sampson Bill Nunn. Dr. Cross meets with local L.A police detective Henry Costillo Jerry Piven as they plan to catch Randolph in the act and arrest him. The plan backfires when outside his house they hear a girl scream and as they stormed the house Randolph killed Det. Costello and ran over Cross who tried to stop him from getting away. Going to Randolph's house in L.A Dr. Cross and the L.A police find a large supply of Sistol. They also find a 20 yearold newspaper clipping with a photo of Dr. Wick Sachs William ConverseRoberts who teaches at Durham Collage. Cross figures out by putting all the evidence together that Randolph is working together with both Dr. Sachs and Casanova back east in the kidnap murders in and around Durham. It turns out that Dr. Sachs was used by Casanova to get him beautiful girls with strong wills after he sampled them to find out if the girls fit Casanova's high standards of mind and body in the women that he's looking for.Dr. Sachs tells Dr. Cross that he sexually sampled as much as 100 women students in 75 different positions over the last four years including Cross' young niece Naomi. Dr. Sachs was so sick in his description of how he sampled the girls especially Dr.Cross' niece that the always cool and collective Cross lost it and almost put Dr.Sachs' head through a twoway mirror. Meanwhile back in the basement in the woods Randolph who escaped from the police in California and it turned out that he did worked with Casanova in doing all the legwork for him has it out with Casanova. complaining about how he does all the work and that he Casanova has all the fun partying with the girls and that he Randolph also wants to get a piece of the action too. it's during the argument with Randolph that Casanova takes a shot at him. Unknown to both Casanova and Randolph Dr. Cross is in the woods looking for the Civil War plantation. When he heard the shot Dr. Coss found where the kidnapped girls were hidden and came to their as well as his niece Naomi's rescue as both Casanova and Randolph fled. Cross guns down Randolph as he tries to escape in the woods but Casanova gets away. The ending of Kiss The Girls was as contrived as it can get with Casanova who was so careful during the entire movie for no reason at all exposing himself and ending up getting his brains blown out by Cross. This is all done with the help of a milk carton you have to see for yourself as Casanova tried to murder both Kate and Dr. Cross with his lighter you'll have to see that for yourself too.The movie ' Kiss the Gils had a lot of potential at first but sadly fell completely apart with the story going in all different directions and all of them at the same time going absolutely nowhere.".

Ashley Judd plays a girl who has gotten away from the killer and things get better for all the detective trying to catch Casanova. That's basically all about the plot.The performances could've been better. The character study try fails but after all I enjoyed Casanova's way of torture. I enjoyed the music and the modern thriller atmosphere. Also the dialog is often impressive for just another thriller. It's probably better than Along Came a Spider. That's personal opinion. And as I have already mentioned Kiss the Girls is kinda predictable. Forget the twist. I'm talking about the whole story development. It's just too contemporary.Overall it's not a skip it's not strongly recommended but you could watch it if you're looking for a simple killerdetectivegirl story.510".

	schema:reviewBody "If you know at least something about the events that took place in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s you should be able to understand this movie.Many people have misinterpreted this movie as a vicious depictment of some sick Serbian mentality or an exaggerated vision of a postwar Serbia. None of this is true. The theme of Cabaret Balkan is not violence. A great parallel can be made between Cabaret Balkan and A Clockwork Orange. The violence in both movies is not the theme  it's merely an extreme way of proving an important point.The oppressors and the oppressed. The small fish and the big fish.  The dogs and the sheep rock fans might find interesting similarities between this movie and Pink Floyd's Animals. There seems to be certain hierarchy present in Cabaret Balkan. The passive majority is constantly oppressed by the violent minority many of whom themselves are victims of bigger fish. The passive majority is always ready to turn a blind eye to look the other way or as a scene from the movie so visually illustrates sit on a different side of the bus.Who should the war be blamed on? Is it the government's fault? Or is the fault of the people who elected the government? Should the criminals in power take the blame or the people who let them stay in power? A key scene of the movie which takes place in the bus seems to tell us the most about this issue. You finally stood up to me says the young bully to the old man who refuses to play along and answer his insulting questions. In a way the young bully on the bus is the only real hero of Cabaret Balkan. He is the only one with the guts to stand up for his rights  everyone else would much rather look the other way ignore the situation and mind their own business.The original title of the movie  Powder Keg draws its name from an old nickname the Balkan peninsula earned at the beginning of this century  a powder keg ready to explode with multitudes of people constantly fighting wars making up then fighting again. After all isn't that what all the characters in the movie do? The strange mentality of the Balkan people cannot be easily explained so director Paskaljevic takes it into extremes and creates extremely surreal scenes like the one in the boxing ring and the bar. Fight. Drink. Fight. Drink. War. Peace. War. Peace. What's it going to be? Doesn't matter as long as we're all in good health.".

The bus scene especially shows that the Yugoslavian people have forgotten to take their fate in their own hands. A young men is fed up with the system his wasted life and the apathy of his people in general. The best scene in the movie for meTragiccomically ends this scene like the whole movie. The whole plot takes place one day before the Dayton agreement another twist of fate that just on this day those people lose their lives for nothing and absolutely nothing.When you watch this movie you have to realize the deeper message has been made for the Yugoslavian audience to show them the mechanizations of their lives and their own guilt going with it.

	schema:reviewBody "Guilt is probably the major theme in this great Yugoslavian film which is a mixture of interrelating stories taking place in Belgrad during one eventful night. The film ends with one of the main characters being stoned while he's yelling I'm innocent. Whether he did actually try to steal gasoline from cars the deed he was accused of is irrelevant besides if he did the gasoline was meant for his family which had none and thankfully the director Paskaljevic leaves this question unanswered. More important is the fact that right before the hypothetic theft he was taking part in the torturing of a young couple so his claim of innocence doesn't really correspond to the truth. On the other hand a mob which tries to kill a young man for stealing gas doesn't have a much higher position on the moral scale. What Bure Baruta shows is a postwar country where the ethics of people are so dimmed that none of them can really call himself innocent. These people commit horrible acts in the name of love hate or both. Even the film's most sympathetic character an old bus driver ends up killing the man who tried to hijack the bus. But none of these people are thoroughly guilty either because what they are is what the war has done to them. The bus driver kills not because he likes to but because he's tired of the chaos his country has descended into. The irony lies in that the hijacker probably felt the same way he only expressed himself differently. It is the film's strength that even the worst of it's characters are not monsters and in the end we can't really condemn single one of them. Otherwise we would be in that mob stoning that young man.Although I've given examples of the stories contained in Bure Baruta they are only facets of the full spectrum the film paints before us. Bure Baruta is one of the greatest European films of the last decade and quite possibly the best postwar depiction ever made for the big screen.".

The bus driver kills not because he likes to but because he's tired of the chaos his country has descended into. The irony lies in that the hijacker probably felt the same way he only expressed himself differently. It is the film's strength that even the worst of it's characters are not monsters and in the end we can't really condemn single one of them. Otherwise we would be in that mob stoning that young man.Although I've given examples of the stories contained in Bure Baruta they are only facets of the full spectrum the film paints before us. Bure Baruta is one of the greatest European films of the last decade and quite possibly the best postwar depiction ever made for the big screen.";

Particularly fine performances come from Miki Manojlovic Mirjana Jokovic Mirjana Karanovic Voja Brajovic Aleksandar Bercek Nebojsa Glogovac and Lazar Ristovski. The storyline is incredibly well built and all stories and characters are equally good.This is a flawless high quality tragicomedy which will provide you great entertainment and watching experience as well as a good insight into the situation of this country.

The play is even far more surrealistic with more killings that come out of nowhere with more violence that comes out of nowhere with basically no character with a clear mind. Everyone is mad but that madness comes from nowhere else but the tonnes of anger buried in their souls.And that's what this movie is about madness as a result of anger.I just find the movie not so surrealistic and therefore losing the power of the original text.Now few words on other users' comments.I just can't agree with the users saying that this is about the Serbs or about the Serbs at that very moment in their history about the guilt or something else.I also find it very shallow to think that the movies coming from Serbia should portrait the Serbs the way they are. Movies as any other form of art are there to show some thoughts some emotions which the author needs to express. Should we say that 'Clockwork Orange' is a bad movie for portraying Brits in such a way?

The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that their father keeps hiring and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives she is initially met with the same hostility but her kindness understanding and sense of fun soon draws them to her and brings some muchneeded joy into all their lives  including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love even though Georg is already engaged to a Baroness and Maria is still a postulant.

	schema:reviewBody "Capitalizing on two hot properties of the early sixties director Robert Wise and the infinitely talented Julie Andrews this film delivers some pure cinematic magic like none before it nor since especially the sequences which feature the songs Do Re Mi 88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time through the streets of Salzburg and The Lonely Goatherd performed with puppets.These among others helped it capture the Best Picture Oscar that year over David Lean's Doctor Zhivago 1965 Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools 1965 A Thousand Clowns 1965 and Darling 1965 which like Doctor Zhivago 1965 also features Julie Christie in her Oscar winning Best Actress performance. Wise who would later receive the Irving G. Thalberg Award from the Academy picked up his second Best Director Oscar for this film Andrews her second consecutive Best Actress nomination she'd won for her film debut in Mary Poppins 1964.Written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse and Maria von Trapp's novel Ernest Lehman's screenplay tells the story of the Austrian von Trapp family who after their first public performance as a singing group fled when Hitler annexed their country the Anschluss in March 1938. The real von Trapp family had performed all over Europe because Maria with the help of a local priest fashioned as Max Detweiler played by Richard Haydn in the film had turned the family's hobby into a profession when an Austrian bank crash caused Georg to lose his fortune.Though this musical is almost three hours in length the plot interspersed with magnificent Rodgers  Hammerstein songs helping the film to win the Oscar for Best Music Scoring of Music Adaptation or Treatment keep it from feeling overlong.In fact it's the kind of film like The Wizard of Oz 1939 that one can watch every year and never tire of it. The title song is 10 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time My Favorite Things is 64. And no one can forget how do you solve a problem like Maria sung in part by Marni Nixon known for dubbing Deborah Kerr Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn in The King and I 1956 West Side Story 1961 and My Fair Lady 1964 respectively in one of her only onscreen appearances as Sister Sophia ... or Climb Ev'ry Mountain Edelweiss and So Long Farewell especially little Kym Karath's goodbye in the reprise as the seven year old Gretl. Each of these tunes and their just right lyrics move the story along such that one never has cause to look at one's watch to wonder when will it end?. The film's Sound and Editing as evidenced in the aforementioned Do Re Mi and The Lonely Goatherd numbers also won Academy Awards.Christopher Plummer whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee is terrific as the stern aristocrat widower who marries his governess after she and his children had helped the Captain to rediscover song love and what it means to be a father. The cast of kids is marvelous the most recognizable of which is Angela Cartwright as Brigitta who would go on to star in the TV series Lost in Space that same year. Nicholas Hammond Friedrich also had a television career which included playing roles in several series most notably as Spiderman. Heather Menzies's Louisa TV career was shorter. Charmian Carr gives a strong performance as the eldest child Liesl who's Sixteen going on Seventeen. Peggy Wood's head Mother Abbess whose singing voice was dubbed by Margery McKay earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Her best line Him?! after which she immediately excuses Sister Margaretta Anna Lee when Maria is telling her why she's returned to the abbey.I also especially like the dueling Sisters Margaretta and Berthe Portia Nelson who despite their disparate feelings towards Maria's suitability as a nun work together to foil the Nazis in the end. Ben Wright plays a credible Herr Zeller. The recognizable Norma Varden is Frau Schmidt the von Trapp's housekeeper. And to have the great Eleanor Parker in a supporting role as the Baroness who presumably doesn't sing or perform she that forgot her harmonica such ironic and fortunate casting! Also Maria von Trapp herself appears briefly uncredited during the I Have Confidence number.The film's Color Art DirectionSet Decoration Cinematography Costume Design also received Oscar nominations. Plus besides being added to the National Film Registry in 2001 the film is 55 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list and 27 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. 41 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list. 4 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list.One of the best family movie night film's ever made make it an annual tradition in yours!".

	schema:headline " The Sound of Music rules because it has everything.";
	schema:reviewBody "While many people agree that the Sound of Music is one of the best films of all time some are at a loss to adequately explain why they buckle under and admit that there are parts that are syrupy etc. Well I'll tell you why it's the best movie ever and I DON'T agree that it's too syrupy. It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all it has a REAL romance  one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It's not like today's movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor but very wry dry tongueincheek humor. For evidence look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially welldone in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. Good bye Maria. I'm sure you'll make a fine nun.  You want to smack her. Thirdly it's got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie  WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find making it great fodder for films  and so it's great to see Maria the Captain and the kids outwit them.

Finally is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? The Sound of Music does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.  It succeeds because it is a wonderfullyconstructed wonderfullywritten wonderfullyacted brilliant movie.  For me no other movie can compare.  Not to be obsessed with it or anything. ".

	onyx:emotionText "While many people agree that the Sound of Music is one of the best films of all time some are at a loss to adequately explain why they buckle under and admit that there are parts that are syrupy etc. Well I'll tell you why it's the best movie ever and I DON'T agree that it's too syrupy. It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all it has a REAL romance  one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It's not like today's movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor but very wry dry tongueincheek humor. For evidence look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially welldone in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. Good bye Maria. I'm sure you'll make a fine nun.  You want to smack her. Thirdly it's got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie  WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find making it great fodder for films  and so it's great to see Maria the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly it's got great music. Fifthy it's got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? The Sound of Music does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.

Singin in the rain is sewer water compared to this. Not that Singin is a bad musical but not as good. The Wizard of Oz is learning how to make fire The Sound of music is inventing the Flying car. This film is timeless beautiful inspiring and uplifting but I would advise that anyone who watches this would be mature enough for anyone under the age of 15 will brush this movie aside saying it is lame so as to maintain their level of coolness. I saw this happen when I asked my little sisters to watch it with me. They rolled their eyes and said the movie was terrible and boring. If only they understood. You have to have an open mind and forget everything every little kid has said negative about this film. I never wanted to watch this but some fellow high school seniors RECOMMENDED it to me. Obviously they had open minds and they didn't care if they looked cool or not. Please watch this movie. It will make you happy and it is so beautiful you will almost cry. I had never really liked musicals and perhaps I still do not overly enjoy them but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven which is where it should belong not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours. To simply conclude you will never see a more heartstopping beautiful movie in your life.".

It was seven years before anyone was able to sit me down in front of the T.V to the musical during the annual telecast in Sydney. Almost to my horror I was falling in love with the musical. More than two years later not a single movie has been able to pass it in my favourite movies stakes. I have made judgemental mistakes with great movies. Greats like Casablanca The African Queen and The Wizard of Oz have originally also been frowned upon. The Sound of Music expanded my horizons on the movie world. I eventually went on to view nonmusical classics as a result of this single movie and now old classic movies have become a genuine passion. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote their greatest work in the form of their last musical despite the fact it was Carousel that was their favourite. Although the changes made from the original stage production have now been evident in the arrival of the excellent musical currently playing in Sydney much have been for the better. Throughout their career the duo created immortal musicals but in story song and film The Sound of Music surpasses The King and I Oklahoma! Carousel and South Pacific in all aspects. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical The Sound of Music My Favourite Things DoReMi or Edelweiss. Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet outspoken novice nun turned governess who should have taken out the oscar that year. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965.Yes there are sugary elements in the movie that cannot be denied. But this movie has never been reliant upon sex violence or drugs to make it one of the best things to come out of Hollywood. It can be appreciated truly for what it is pure art talent and spirit. It is not a real perception of the world nowadays but for all the joy it brings who cares?It was the last movie I expected to love as a fourteen year old. It was also the first movie I watched in seven years that could manage to make me shed tears and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled.Singin' In the Rain is the only other contender to the title of The greatest movie ever made. Whatever its flaws The Sound of Music is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.Rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect from the cinematography to the acting the sets to the costumes the music choreography script is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more wellrounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit humor romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime and a voice to match but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome but his decision to play the Captain as a complex sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal humor or menace as called for in the script. However the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time is the slinky catty toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely her songs were cut further separating her from all the glee around her so that she could whip out such zingers as Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica? or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun If you need anything I'd be happy to help you. The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue unlike in the play is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression every syllable every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are aweinspiring. This type of filmmaking is GONE. The location photography the simplicity of story and design the sheer goodspiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines Seven Brides... Singin' in the Rain ...Molly Brown The Music Man to name just a few... They are all highly enjoyable but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome there is still genuine suspense at the climax of The Sound of Music. The film has it all.".

Most of us grownups still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and over again maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year anymore. Julie Andrews takes her MARY POPPINS success and adds even more to it with her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin originated on the Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could. In my opinion and I don't think I'm alone here Martin was too old for the part she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage version and Andrews was 30 when the transition came to film came arounda perfect age. As for the rest of the cast it is just as talented Christopher Plummer in the role he will be forever remembered for even though he hated the part is an achingly true Cap. Von Trapp with those hidden talents making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out into the open in the film's closing scenes Richard Haydn makes for a comical and yet sincere Uncle Max Peggy Wood is a starchy yet compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our perrenial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as well esp. the opening scenes which is probably the most beautiful aerial shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public Austrian gardens during the DOREMI sequence. So let's all keep watching this most cherished of all musical films each year and never forget it's universal sentiment to 'climb ev'ry mountain ford ev'ry stream follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'.".

	schema:reviewBody "If West Side Story was the best musical film of the sixties then The Sound of Music adapted from the longrunning Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family was certainly the most popular With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves religion in the Hollywood tradition of serene kind nuns romance actually two romances one adult one adolescent and antiNazi feeling Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invadersand with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid conscientious craftsman and a fluent storyteller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions The Sound of Music is perfect with its sumptuous location photography immaculate fluid editing and splendid tones The film does have a justifiably famous opening the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews as mischievous warmhearted Maria exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter Charmian Carr meets her shy beau Daniel Truhitte in the family garden he sings Sixteen Going on Seventeen to her and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo Maria's music lesson to the children DoReMi is beautifully staged set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg changing their clothing through camera wizardry And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest Edelweiss with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and HammersteinAnother of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and selfconfidence implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her selfesteem... It works to balance the tightlipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp the adorable posturings of the children and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness...".

	onyx:emotionText "If West Side Story was the best musical film of the sixties then The Sound of Music adapted from the longrunning Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family was certainly the most popular With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves religion in the Hollywood tradition of serene kind nuns romance actually two romances one adult one adolescent and antiNazi feeling Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invadersand with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid conscientious craftsman and a fluent storyteller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions The Sound of Music is perfect with its sumptuous location photography immaculate fluid editing and splendid tones The film does have a justifiably famous opening the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews as mischievous warmhearted Maria exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter Charmian Carr meets her shy beau Daniel Truhitte in the family garden he sings Sixteen Going on Seventeen to her and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo Maria's music lesson to the children DoReMi is beautifully staged set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg changing their clothing through camera wizardry And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest Edelweiss with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and HammersteinAnother of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and selfconfidence implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her selfesteem... It works to balance the tightlipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp the adorable posturings of the children and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness...";

	schema:reviewBody "1965's The Sound of Music is everything a bad musical should be. Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples it has coy silly songs an inane innocuous script and unbelievably sugary characters.  So why is it one of my favorite musicals?  OK go ahead.  Shoot me at twenty paces.  But after all this time it still remains a guilty pleasure.  I find myself going for a tub of rocky road ice cream and Rodgers  Hammerstein's immortal classic whenever the real world gets to be too much.  I seem to play it a lot around tax time.And I'm not alone.  Why is it still considered the most popular musical of all time?  Well first of all they spared no expense.  The extremely wellproduced blockbuster has gorgeous eyepopping scenery.  From the first moment Julie Andrews flails her arms and circles around on that beautiful sunny hillside singing the rousing title song I know I'm being swept away to another world.  I'm not in Kansas anymore...or L.A. anyway.  The panoramic Salzburg background complements and never intimidates or takes away from the characters or their story like the other R  H extravaganza South Pacific.  That in itself is an incredible feat.Now about those songs.  Almost every one of them is absolute drivel.  So what makes them work?  Easy.  The utter joy and sincerity of the cast who sings the infectious hummable tunes which are backed by  extremely moving orchestrations and an exceptionally beautiful score.  It's hard to resist Maria prancing about pillowfighting with a bunch of kneehighs and gushing about her most favorite things.  Or the austere Captain Von Trapp the meticulous Christopher Plummer turning to butter after hearing his brood sing in perfect harmony for the first time with no prior lessons even and joining right in.  Or the Mother Superior's soaring number that unknowingly forewarns Maria to head for the hills I mean mountains before the Nazis escort them elsewhere.  Or the 16yearold going on 17 squealing with delight after receiving her first kiss.  Or the kids working up a clever little ditty to leave their formal party guests when its time for bed.  Or two people declaring their love in a moonlit gazebo.  The songs work because they come straight from and aim for the heart not the head which is exactly the place the viewer should be coming from when watching this movie. If the songs don't transcend the script which they didn't prior to the 70s they certainly transcend the mood.The script is undeniably trite and probably the film's weakest link.  But again the characters play it straight all the way.  Not one actor looks embarrassed.  Every scene is done with total enthusiasm and total commitment and the performers who are telling the story are pitchperfect and picture perfect. And as for the characters.  Try and think of anybody better than jubilant crophaired Julie Andrews as a postulant nun who has gorgeous pipes can make play clothes out of curtains can set up and operate marionette shows at the drop of a hat and is confident enough to convince a man that a failed nun is ideal marriage material.  I certainly can't.  Thank heavens for her Oscarwinning Mary Poppins the year before or we might have gotten Julie LONDON instead!  After all Andrews did lose out on My Fair Lady the year before.  But now  certifiably bankable she proved she could handle this dream role.  Andrews is cutely silly cutely stubborn cutely astute cutely shattered and cutely...well cute.  She gives the most wholesomely appealing musical perf since Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz.  To actually make you forget Mary Martin in the Broadway role takes some doing and she does it effortlessly.  Christopher Plummer is all seriousness handsomely patrician and quite a catch for anybody...much less a nun.  I can't think of anyone more suitable for this role either.  As for the Seven Little Foys I mean the Von Trapp children they are adorable and perfect in their own ways too whether they are marching or singing  creating their own individual personalities by film's end.Richard Haydn as Max and Eleanor Parker as the flamboyant haughty Baroness provide wonderful catty relief.  Despite having their musical numbers snatched away from them they make up for it with droll sophisticated humor.  The elegant perfectly coiffed Parker is particularly delicious as Maria's chief romantic rival getting some of the film's best zingers and delivering them with biting understatement.  Parker developed a devout cult following after this role.  Peggy Wood's Mother Superior is suitably reverent and inspiring.For those who tear The Sound of Music apart for its shameless sugarcoated manipulations well I can respect that.  But to attack it for its political and historical inaccuracies is like attacking Peter Pan for being a subversive plot that encourages young children to run away from home.  It's ludicrous.  Despite the fact that it's based on a true story we're not watching The Sound of Music for stark realism.  Like a sparkling and lavish Ernst Lubitsch operetta we want a feelgood movie with feelgood songs with a feelgood story and a feelgood ending.  Nothing more.  If you want a movie that presents a potent depiction of prewar Austria or antiNazi sentiment rent Holocaust or Schindler's List. Here we want to believe that a group of nuns can tear out an automobile carburetor and save the world!  Period.I suppose the realitybased MTV generation cannot truly respect or relate to the relative innocence and pure escapism like The Sound of Music.  If this movie was made today I'm afraid the Von Trapp children would not be dangling out of trees for fear of driveby shooters.  It's a tough new world today sad to say.  The 50s and 60s are looking better all the time.Anyway for what it's worth The Sound of Music is indeed schmaltz but its QUALITY schmaltz at its very very best.".

What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for romance humor singing dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable although I admit that still hearing Few Favorite Things is strange during Christmas time. But moving on Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.Maria a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows the Mother Superior sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp. Arriving at the Trapp home Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof and his seven children virtual automatonsat least whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise the kids are holy terrors as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children especially oldest daughter Liesl who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness. But the children insist that Maria return the Baroness steps out of the picture and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song Something Good. Unhappily they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the glories of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.Julie Andrews had come off fresh from Mary Poppins which her character wasn't that far from being the nanny caring for children with a stuffy father. But the thing that made this film so special is that you honestly feel the love between Maria and Von Trapp what a wonderful love story they had. The film is a bit long but back in the day they had intermissions and oh boy do I miss that. Come on Lord of the Rings could have used one of those lol. Back onto Sound of Music my favorite song is probably Confidence in Me such life to it due to Julie's beautiful voice and her dancing along the sidewalk could make anyone want to do the same thing. I love The Sound of Music my boyfriend who hates musicals and said this was the crown of the worst I asked him to watch it with me to see if he would give it another chance I glanced over to see him singing a little to the songs! He finally admitted that the songs are very catchy so see? You can find any little positive thing to say about this film The Sound of Music brings you to life and you can't help but fall in love with this spectacular musical.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sound of Music 1965 is an all time classic family musical that has always been one of my favorites. Ever since I was child I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast great performances top notch singing and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria who is a nun but not a very good one and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding every single musical number is just as good if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing but it is great singing by talented artists which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 1010 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a music romantic drama film which through melodic and sentimental story shows us a rhapsodic family. The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name. The opening sequence is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. A charming scenery with the musical score is the biggest asset of this film.The Sound of Music is based on the true story of the Trapp Family Singers. Maria is a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing and enjoy in nature. Her imagination and lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children. Arriving at the Trapp home Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and harsh with his children. A young nun wants to change the condition in the house and returns a smile on the face of children however she falls into a sweetest life trap ...A fictional reality flashing on all sides. Simply it is hard to make sense. A warm and colorful family story is out of control. There are funny nuns rich man with two faces modest Baroness and an interesting fraud. A delicious lie in which song makes dreams come true.Julie Andrews as Maria is mischievous nun full of enthusiasm and energy. Her character is attractive and lively while she sings. However what is worse she becomes an uninteresting character in the second part of the film because she could not bring their feelings in a pale romance. Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp is a firm hand which quickly opens and turns into a frivolous grimace.Richard Haydn as Max Detweiler is a harmless impostor who sees all and slyly silent. Eleanor Parker as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder is a nice and fragile character. The children are very entertaining.No matter what if you like to sing and dance in a quiet night this is the movie for you.".

While the leads balance each other the sweetness of the music is equally balanced by the sobriety of the situation in which they find themselves during the Nazi occupation of Austria. What intrigues me is that in the song 16 Going on 17 the young boy Rolf who appears to be in love with Leisl warns her of being seduced by men but in the end it is he who is seduced by the Nazis... and it is so often the case in life that while teaching others we grow cocky and forget that we too are still students and capable of falling prey to our own folly... We also must understand though even as the Von Trapp family escapes over the Alps to Freedom the truth is they fled by train during the day to Italy that those who helped them may not get off so lightly even though it is unshown in the film... the nuns who would obviously be recognized as having helped them by removing the car's carburetor the man at the festival would likely be found complicit in helping them escape and I mention them because it is impossible not to think of those who gave their lives to help so many escape the Nazis tyranny and now it is our turn to help new refugees escape tyranny... the more that things change the more they stay the same... I am an emotional person and connecting emotionally with characters does help enjoyment but also confirms bias and dilutes objectivity for sure... but ultimately I believe The Sound of Music earns all five of its Oscars.The Amazon film ends with a onehour behind the scenes look into the film and the Von Trapp family hosted by Julie Andrews. A perfect way to end the film.And like Maria like Julie Andrews my life is truly eased through singing my music so perhaps as a singer as a Jew I relate quite intimately with the story.And it is true as is sung in the movie and I leave you with that idea now...

I had never heard of that movie and since I am quite fond of musicals I gave it a try.Now I dearly love my hostfather but I really hate this movie. I have seen it twice so far once with him to get to know it and once a few months ago when it was shown on German TV for the first time !!. But the second time I only watched it to play Mystery Science Theater 3000 with some of my friends.The reason why this movie had never been shown on German TV before was because the German language track had been lost for many years and was only rediscovered by accident a while ago. But why did nobody in the German speaking region care to find the language track of this much beloved movie earlier? The main reason is that this movie though it may have been successful in most parts of the world was not so in Germany Austria or Switzerland  and for good reason.Everything in this movie is just sooooooooooooooo terrible clich! The cinematography the dresses the way everybody behaves.... ugh! If this is the way Americans look at Austria or Germany and Switzerland since I have the feeling that many do not really know the differences between these countries than we really have a lot to do to correct this picture.But there is another reason why I don't like this movie. It is really insulting to one's intelligence. The whole thing feels like it was made for kids and done badly everybody is virtuous smiling all the time bouncing around happily running through the countryside just enjoying being alive. Above all they sing songs that could come out of Sesame Street. Actually I was expecting a song that teaches you how to count to ten to pop up any minute. Come on! This is not beautiful it is just plain dumb!There was a German oder Austrian movie made in the fifties called Die Trapp Familie and following its success a sequel was produced later about their life in the US. The fifties in the history of German movies were notorious for the tacky Heimatfilme homeland movies that were produced in this era portraying Germany and Austria as happy beautiful places where happy people lived who did nothing but smile and enjoy the countryside all day long. Die Trapp Familie was one of these bad movies but even this movie did not come close to the abomination that is The Sound of Music. At least the former had some level albeit small of realism.I like Julie Andrews as an actress and singer but this movie was not only not saved by her performance but made even worse. I hope they put the German language track back on the dusty shelf where they found it and never show this movie in Germany again.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the advertisements for The Weather Man it seemed like the movie was going to be another formulaic feel good Hollywood redemption tale. In reality it is a dark scathing satire of American values. The marketing likely scared away a lot of people who would enjoy the film while attracting an audience who was presented with something unexpected and perhaps uncomfortable. The comedy is quite raunchy the tone is bleak and the story is anything but formulaic throwing industry conventions right out the window which leads to a film that's more believable than most.David Spritz is a man whose life has become the ultimate exercise in futility. Each day he wakes up and goes to a job that despite paying a handsome salary is entirely unfulfilling. His relationship with his exwife is strained his relationship with his children distant. To make things worse his Pulitzer Prize winning father seems to be disappointed in what David has done with his life.In real life progress in one's personal life is generally made in baby steps. Usually people don't undergo a drastic transformation over the course of several months. David attempts to improve his standing in life at times failing entirely at times succeeding in small doses. The results of these attempts range from very funny to downright saddening and this helps lend the film an air of realism. This is a complicated character study about a man coming to grips with the fact that he's failed to meet any of the goals he set for himself in life despite attaining a social standing that many people are envious of. There aren't any easy answers or life altering epiphanies selfimprovement is a long gradual task that will probably never be completely fulfilled and The Weather Man reflects this reality. While not for all tastes this movie deserves credit for tackling a relatively conventional subject in a very unconventional at least for a mainstream Hollywood movie manner. I imagine that this film will be a bigger success overseas and on DVD than it will be in its US theatrical run.".

	schema:headline " Nicolas Cage is Amazing in Verbinski's Flawed Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "I've thought long and hard before saying what I'm about to say. I've searched my memory for something to disprove it but I can't think of anything. Here it is The Weather Man the new film directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Steve Conrad is the most relentlessly pessimistic mainstream American film that I have ever seen. It seems to be telling us that over time you become a shell of the person you once were and a pathetic ever decreasing fraction of the person you one day hoped to be. You will squander potential and become incapable of giving meaningful love to anyone that you care about. This doesn't happen as a result of some huge disaster or tragic mistake no this happens as a result of hundreds of minuscule failures every day. As you might imagine this is excruciating to watch. But in creating one of bleakest portraits of contemporary American life you will ever see Gore Verbinski also creates a film that is shockingly humane funny and beautiful.Nicolas Cage who I don't always like gives a fantastic performance as David Spritz a Chicago TV weather man with no degree in meteorology. The thing that makes him great in The Weather Man is that he consistently plays the part in earnest. There's plenty of opportunities to ham it up or play it for laughs especially because David acts like such an asshole so much of the time but Cage never falls into those traps. One feels at every turn no matter how disgraceful his behavior that he's just a guy trying to do what seems right to him in that moment. At one point he drops his daughter off at his exwife's house. When his exwife played with terrific subtly by Hope Davis remains outside for a moment he suddenly decides to throw a snowball at her which hits her in the face and cracks the lens of her glasses. Rather than playing it like it's funny which it is Cage seems like he's making a sincere attempt to connect with his former wife in any way he can.I wish with great passion that this film was truly great but unfortunately it's just inches short. Nine out of ten times Verbinski hits the mark. From the very first shot he creates a perfectly executed world of an ice bound Chicago during the winter months. His most impressive feat though is managing to craft a film that is in some ways highly stylized yet instinctually feels like the human experience. He has a wonderful and surprising sense of composition. One finds the characters in disconcertingly angular frames with vast expanses of empty space above their heads. In tandem with this he uses a fantastically chilly color scheme throughout. He also triumphs in his insistently measured pacing. In contrast with such a harsh statement about life the pacing serves to lend the film a strange gentleness that allows for us to feel the characters are truly human. The pacing is absolutely vital and absolutely brave in a Hollywood film. Along with the performances it makes one feel that the characters are being not being tortured out of gleeful spite on the part of the filmmakers but out of profound empathy and understanding of our shared human weaknesses.Verbinski's trouble comes in just a few isolated areas nevertheless they are important and significantly damage the film as a whole. The ugliest problem is a woefully illadvised quasi dream sequence in which Nicholas Cage sees himself happy and well adjusted as the grand marshal of a parade. The whole thing is presented as if his hotel room window is like a TV on which he is seeing himself. It introduces us to no useful ideas and is an immensely distracting stylistic departure. I'm really puzzled by its inclusion in a movie that on the whole demonstrates a lot of restraint. Another issue is the handling of Cage's son who gets himself involved in a weird molestation situation with his drug counselor. This subplot is painted in the broadest of strokes rather than with the painstaking specificity one finds elsewhere. Every time we return to the plot with the son the film begins to feel bogged down and uncharacteristically unsure of itself. Some of the blame for this surely must be shared with Steve Conrad the mostly solid writer of the film. One wonders why Conrad and Verbinski shy away from the unbending frankness they are generally so willing to dole out. There are a few other troubling mistakes the blame for which I have to rest on both of their shoulders. Most notably the film relies too heavily on voiceover. While some of it works very well and all of it is delivered with sincerity from Cage there is at least twice as much as is necessary. Similarly there are a couple flashbacks that work but just as many that are unneeded. Also the handling of Cage's father who is played with solemn dignity by Michael Cane rings a little false. He is written as a noble and stalwart man devoid of any flaws not only in Cage's mind but apparently in real life as well. On the whole this actually works much better than it should but I can't help but feel that there's a note missing.The aforementioned issues aside The Weather Man is a rare achievement and one of my favorite films of the year. It is so honest and so bleak that I can't believe that a major studio let it get made. In an industry where schlock and melodrama are passed off as great statements about us as humans The Weather Man is monumentally refreshing. I have nothing but respect for Verbinski and Conrad for having the nerve to make a film that on the one hand is crushingly negative but on the other endlessly humane.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a great piece of social commentary on the emptiness of our current American culture. Being the weatherman appears to be a great job. It pays almost 300 Grand a year and you can afford a nice apartment and a mansion for your beautiful blonde exwife and your two estranged children. A job as a weatherman without a meteorological degree entails absolutely no challenges. You become lazy and bored because you think you have everything. After all isn't the entire purpose of life to make money drive nice cars and wear nice clothes and eat out every night of the week? You are able to spoil your children hence never teaching them the value of challenging themselves and depriving them of ever working toward a goal and feeling satisfied. This is what we think living is today in this country! We have no depth! We have toxic vocabulary eat useless toxic food we watch useless toxic entertainment and we have completely useless jobs that create nothing. We wonder why our children have no idea what to do with themselves? Wealthy Americans which most of us are by the standards of the world have no skills no integrity and no character. The only things our children grow up knowing for sure are what a Frosty is and a Big Gulp. The gap between this generation and their grandparents is vast. Our elders worked hard at jobs which created the foundation of wealth and substance that we erode every day with our irresponsible selfish consumerist conduct. Mr. Spritz has no idea what a Big Gulp is but he's dying of the cancer that eats this country.The Weatherman Nicholas Cage has a better time with himself and everyone else as soon as he figures this out. Hilariously he had to actually get hit in the head with a Big Gulp. We need to focus on the things that matter take responsibility for our children and ourselves. The one thing that I think was off in the movie was the line about how being an adult does not include the word easy. The big secret to life is that when we do things the correct way often the hard way life actually gets easier for everyone.I went to the theater expecting the usual vacuous Hollywood bomb. I was blown away with the power of this movie. On the way out we asked a young man that was working the theater what he thought. He said that he thought The Weatherman was incredibly dark and very far fetched. I agree our culture is dark and far fetched. The movie however was dead on. Our current life is a bubble about to burst. This movie offered a solution  find some meaning in your life and get after it. Pretending this vacuum doesn't exist and that Jessica and Ashley Simpson are talented individuals worth our time and interest is incredibly bleak to me. On the other hand I was pretty sure this young man had no idea the scale of these problems. How could he when he has never experienced anything else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thankfully Hollywood has made a movie that values our integrity and intelligence. Here is a film showing us that life is beautiful but challenging and requires a little bit of work to move through. Through its protagonist we encounter daily frustrations of every type from conjugal discord to simple dissatisfaction's with our everyday existence. Nicholas Cage might not have the extended range of performers like Penn or Brando but he does competent work here. He earns our sympathy and our attention with some of the best work he has done recently.The Weather Man is an extended metaphor for what goes on in our lives every day. The film apparently didn't charm the pants off a few members of the audience when I saw it. It didn't have the prepackaged bombs and special effects. It lacked enough vulgarity to appeal to those peopleinstead it had one of the most touching and intelligent scripts in the last year. Attendance might be down and ironically quality is up in Hollywood. The Weather Man deals with real issues such as insecurity love and trust. It presents scenarios where the audience might become uncomfortable looking at an aspect of their lives they might not like. Here is a parent who is challenged by his inability to connect with his own children who appears to have unsurmountable challenges dealing with a spouse and who is now not very sure his job is truly what he always wanted.Michael Caine once again shines in his supporting role as the father who can't communicate with his son and has now pressing issues to deal with before it's too late. Hope Davis does a bit of againsttype work with a woman who might be lacking in the warmth department. Both are impeccable and very effective in their performances.Verbinsky keeps a leisured pace allowing the audience to meditate and understand how critical this stage of his life is for Dave Cage. This is a sink or swim situation and he must do some careful reevaluation in order to succeed. Whether he is able or not is one of the joys of the film. This movie will be remembered for its depth and quality for its attention to detail as well as its realistic approach. It's a 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "I can already tell that people are going to have very strong reactions to The Weather Man. People are either going to love it or hate it. They're going to find it shockingly hilarious or just plain shocking. I loved it and found it hilarious but I'm not easily offended I do a show with Jegar how can anything offend me?. There were many instances where I was the only person laughing in the theater. For instance Michael Caine who plays Robert Spritz tells his son David Spritz played by Nicolas Cage that David's daughter is getting teased at school and called Camel Toe. Just to hear Sir Michael Caine use the expression camel toe is pretty unexpected. But then various shots of camel toes pop up on the screen to illustrate this phenomenon to anyone in the audience who's unfamiliar with the concept. I found it all absurdly hilarious but I don't think many of the greyhaired audience shared my sentiments.This movie was not at all like I was expecting. The Weather Man is crass and silly but it's also extremely dark and sad. David Spritz is a sad lonely man who's trying to reconcile with this exwife and get his family back together but despite his best intentions things just never work out the way he wants. More than anything he wants to prove to his dying father that he can be a great man too but time is running out. This is not your typical comedy. It's not easy to watch sometimes but according to Robert Spritz Easy doesn't enter into grownup life.".

I expected a rather shallow comedy but instead received a wellthought out and delivered work which was insightful quirky funny and touching film which was far above my expectations. Cage delivers a great performance as usual and the fatherson relationship between Cage and Caine was authentic and balanced. This is not just a comedy but is a study of the importance of family and an overlying existential questioning of what our lives are all about. I highly recommend it for men and women alike. On a side note... Verbinski's works are diverse fun and interesting and this is no exception.".

You just don't understand tragic comedy some of you may suggest. Oh I understand it all right. Only The Weather Man makes a dog's dinner of that particular genre if that's indeed what they were going for. I'm not sure.If awards are given for such things Nick Cage might get an award for maintaining the same long monotonous hangdog facial expression in nearly every scene for two hours of screen time. Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton perfected this bit. The sad luckless clown wondering through life getting beat down but winning our hearts because they persevere. Cage can't bring it on like Keaton. About half way through this mess I was hoping he'd get hit with a brick not a sandwich.But I have to hand it to Paramount Pictures for the most shameless product placement I've ever seen in a film They literally throw their products logos and all right at Cage making the image stick in your mind while it sticks to Cage's suits and overcoats.Splat! McDonalds. Splat! Big Gulp 7Eleven. Splat! Splat! Taco Bell. And it case you were too dense to pick up on that you could see the McDonalds golden arches reflected in window glass and slightly out of focus in the background of a half dozen shots. I mean come on! If this was supposed to be Haute Cin it must be some kind of cynical inside joke to have the lead character covered in advertising like a NASCAR hot rod.I won't spoil it for those of you who like to wallow in excruciating maudlin muck. I know some people are uplifted watching other people morbidly depressed. But for the rest of us who may be less enlightened to the entertainment or artistic value of watching some unloved schmendrick stumbling along in misery this film will make you want to have a drink or several. Or worse jump off a tall building or stick your head in a gas oven.In short this film doesn't deliver any truth you didn't have already. It's just a depressing mess.It was only when Michael Cane's character delivered the line In this sht life you have to chuck some things pretty far into the picture when I suddenly realized I should have chucked this thing after the first twenty minutes. Take his advice and mine and leave this one on the video rental shelf.".

Nicely written great photography of Lake Michigan covered in ice. Lots of great scenes where Nicholas Cage pull off difficult performances. Many sadly comic scenes including a dream sequence with Sponge Bob that is a wonderfully surreal. I am afraid that disapproving critics don't understand the deep irony and existential humor like a Kurt Vonnegut novel. Nothing illustrates this better than the scene where Cage's character sees the giant balloon of Sponge Bob floating by. The meaning and meaningless of life together with family and ambition together with human frailty come together wonderfully and with humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. So Close. This is painfully close to being a great film. Although still very good at presenting issues normally not seen on film director Gore Verbinski Pirates of the Caribbean The Ring falls just short of making a very powerful statement.Please do not let the trailer fool you. This is not slapstick comedy like Anchorman. This is deep often dark subject matter addressing the emotional struggles men face when dealing with a bad divorce trying to maintain a relationship with kids and the pressures of trying to make one's own dad proud or at least gain acceptance. So often Hollywood deals with the plight of the woman and her emotional turmoil. Instead we are treated with watching a man's attempt to live up to what he thinks are expectations of others and how somehow the right job will make everything OK ... his life will be whole.Nicolas Cage gives another outstanding performance as The Weather Man on a Chicago TV station. To add to the complexity he is not a meteorologist and he is being courted by a national morning talk show featuring Bryant Gumbel. Two areas with this character are poorly written in my opinion. First Cage's hair weave is bloody awful. At least in Dallas weather men all look like Televangelists with perfect hair. His is always askew ... don't they have hairmakeup staff in Chicago? Second the character is written as too much of a loser in all aspects. He is not just struggling he is not someone any guy or girl would want to hang with. The film tries but fails to show the switch come on when Cage steps in front of the camera. They tell us this happens but it needed to be presented much clearer.Playing Cage's father Michael Caine is a pretty intimidating figure as he is confused about his son's direction in life while at the same time facing a very dark future of his own. Caine is wonderful in the role and when he tells his son Sometimes in life you just have to chuck it we really get it and hope that Cage does as well.On the other hand Hope Davis is cast as yet another frigid B yuppie whom I don't understand how any man could be attracted to. Yet somehow this is the woman Cage wants back. Time to stretch your talent a bit Hope. You showed plenty of promise in About Schmidt and have been working steadily since. But to take the next step as an actress you need to try a new character. Gil Bellows Aly McBeal has a creepy role as Cage's teenage son's counselor. He is responsible for some of the most uncomfortable moments as well as a way for Cage to finally cut loose.As I said this is a very good movie that falls just short of greatness. While providing insight into the male psyche it fails to deliver the message or solution it seemed to be leading up to. However it is nice to see a man portrayed as something other than a superhero adulterer international spy or Olympic caliber lover.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first it would seem that The Weather Man doesn't have a point to make. We follow David Spritz as his life falls apart around him and it would seem like that's all the film is. By the ending we do get a defining point and while Gore Verbinski hammers it home a little too hard for it to be as effective as it could have been it's a good point and gives credence to a thoroughly enjoyable little film. This is a pretty big change of pace from the big budgeted kids' films that Verbinski has been making recently and his approach to this far more low key film is sombre and relaxed and The Weather Man benefits from that. The plot focuses on the difference between one man's personal and working life. At work he is a successful weather man who's been headhunted by a bigger network. But in his private life he's estranged from his wife his kids aren't exactly top of the class and just to top it all off every time he steps onto the street fast food gets thrown at him! Spiralling downwards his life is approaching collapse and he must choose between his family and a big salary in New York.Nicolas Cage takes the lead role and while he's never really stretched he manages to give a fine performance throughout the film. In support we've got the likes of Michael Caine and Hope Davis as well as talented youngster Gemmenne de la Pea who all round the acting off nicely. The film manages to pull together two very different tones and make it work. There's some rather funny humour on display and this is mixed with an overall pessimistic mindset. This gives The Weather Man something of an original standpoint and although it has to be said that the plot itself is never overly interesting the tone of the movie is good enough to see it through. From mainstream cinema especially American mainstream cinema you don't expect to see films with such a depressing viewpoint on life  but it really doesn't get much more depressing than the one professed here. Verbinski's film states that like the weather life cannot be predicted  and no matter what hopes and dreams you have they're likely to be smashed by the time it comes to realising them. Ouch.".

This isn't that movie. But neither is it very good at all  lots of things just don't make sense are never really resolved or they're just no exposition  they just hang there like his daughter's smoking habit or the existence of his mother  neither of these do anything for the film at all or worst are internally contradictory without a hint of irony. During the movie while coping with his father's sickness the aftermath of divorce and problems with the kids at home it's shown how Dave is just barely able to cope. One would think that somebody this dysfunctional would be unable to find the studio for his New York audition let alone do a creditable audition. Yet it appears to go well and there's no concept that personal problems might create a problem performing up to standard. Another contradictory element is his announcement in one of the nonsensical voiceovers how good his father a Pulitzerwinning writer played by Michael Caine by varying his face from blank expression to Semi grin was as a father.

If what Dave wants from his dad is just the right platitude and this is it Dave's life and career is a direct refutation of this one  he admits that his job doesn't take any knowledge whatsoever. And how hard does he have to work at even the things he works at?

It had a feeling like the director and the writer were just being smug by putting together a story of someone so mundane and selfcentered that they could pass this off as dark comedy. It is pitiful and very painful to watch. I do not want to put any spoilers in here so more people will read this and hopefully never go to this heap of garbage. Needless to say I even think less now than I did before of Cage and put him right there with the likes of Keanu Reeves. The Weather Man finds Nicolas Cage in a selfpitying mood. In the past this would have been happy news. Cage in a funk was good for ''Leaving Las Vegas and ''Adaptation. Even in a movie as imbalanced as Martin Scorsese's ''Bringing Out the Dead Cage's depression soulfully complemented Scorsese's mania. Those movies gave Cage an opportunity to be inventive and inspired. The Weather Man gives him license to drift for nearly two hours like a parade float. The film takes too many of its cues from Dave's Cage depression. It is like a funeral. I really have to laugh and get a little peeved when I see many people get suckered in and write good and Great! for their review here on IMDb. In the end this movie's attempt at selfcentered humor flops unlike Sideways which was overrated yet still far better than The Weather Man. Forecast Stay away from this dustbowl of stink.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Spritz Nicolas Cage is an affable weather reporter on local Chicago television. He is well liked and may even be in the running for a bigger gig on a national morning show out of NYC. However away from the cameras things are very different. For one David's father Robert Spritzer Michael Caine is a famous writer who has cast enormous footprints for his son to follow. Now news comes that his dad is seriously ill. In addition David is divorced from his beautiful wife Noreen Hope Davis and has trouble connecting with his children teenage Michael Nicholas Hoult and twelve year old Shelley. Shelley especially is a point of concern for she is slightly overweight and the object of school bullies on occasion. Although David tries to ignite her interest in hobbies such as archery Shelley remains very aloof. It is in fact Robert who has the better relationships with his granddaughter grandson and exdaughterinlaw. Therefore while Daivd continues to let a smile be his umbrella on the news he is juggling major problems with his family AND pursuing the chance to be a bigtime weatherman on a national show. Will he be able to maintain his sanity? This is a dark dark film in the vein of American Beauty but alas not quite as good or cohesive as that Oscarwinning movie. However Cage as usual does an excellent job as the very mixedup local television star and be still dear hearts he looks very handsome. The rest of the cast is also superlative in their difficult roles especially Caine as the highly intelligent and refined author. The scenery in and around Chicago is mostly bleak as the film takes place in winter while the costuming and camera work are excellent. Thus the film's deficiencies stem mostly from an uneven script and a very slowmoving pace. Yet despite this the movie has some sharp observations to make about the human condition. If you are in a depressed mood DO NOT see this one as it can lay low the most optimistic of folks. But if you are a fan of Cage Caine or the other cast members or if you have a yen to ponder the dark side of life this flick does offer much food for thought indeed.".

He is a celebrity he gets a big paycheck and he makes a chance of getting a job at a national TVstation in New York. Too bad his private life is a miserable failure. He's divorced he has estranged himself from his children and his father Caine looks down on him. So yawn he tries to straighten his life and learns that taking a piece of the American Way or something is the way to go after all which is taking the job in New York and go for the money.Admittedly I've had a bit of an overdose of Nicolas Cage recently he's everywhere. I reached a point where I cannot make a distinction anymore between his roles. Whether he plays a family man in FAMILY MAN an Ukranian arms dealer in LORD OF WAR or a conman in MATCHSTCK MEN they all seem the same to me now. For some reason there is a strange recent trend to shoot almost all Hollywoodmovies in the same icycold blue lighting which doesn't give this film any distinction in this department either.The film definitely isn't the comedy it appears to be. Perhaps this was the maker's original intention but the result is a dark a very dark film. It definitely has it's moments with some of the most embarrassing scenes I've seen in a long time. David Spritz sometimes makes such a complete ass out of himself I found it extremely painful to watch at times. Sadly as mentioned the other characters are flat and unappealing most painful for Michael Caine who plays an especially unappealing character. The young Nicholas Hoult as David Spritz his son is a standout with a small but great part. Watch out for him next teen idol and hopefully in acting a harbor of things to come.It was watchable but maddeningly uneven. For a film with a message we've heard it all before in better films.Camera Obscura  510".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING LOTS OF SPOILERSThis movie got marketed as though it were a comedic piece of fluff. People came in expecting something to laugh at and of course they were disappointed. If you in the mood for light hearted fare you would not have been pleased at this film.I didn't have a TV when The Weather Man came out and I hadn't seen the trailers so I went in with no preconceived notions at all What I came away with was the feeling that I had watched the best movie of the year.This is not a humorous movie in the least. It's the story of a man going through a midlife crisis and it never takes the easy way out. Nicolas Cage's David Spritz is the son of Pulitzer Prize winning author Robert Spritzen played by Michael Caine. Caine's character is dying and Cage's character has never lived up to his father's image. He's tried writing a novel but frankly it stinks.Instead Cage is a TV Weather Man. Every day he provides the people of Chicago with the two TV minute equivalent of a McDonald's Happy Meal. He's extremely good at what he does but he also feels valueless. His personal life is the same with his minicelebrity he can get laid any time he wants but he has completely botched it with the one love of his life.Every time I thought that this film would go for the cheap emotional reward instead the film takes real life turns. Cage still loves his exwife but he never gets her back and instead she marries someone else. Michael Caine's character dies on the day that Cage is auditioning for his first national morning show shot and instead of breaking down on the set Cage nails his audition. Nice cameo by Bryant Gumbel btw.And that is where the films ends. Cage's life remains disturbing. He's deleted his halffinished novel. He doesn't get his wife back. He moves away from his children. His father is dead and Cage will never match what he was. But he comes to a certain peace. He understands that the time in his life for trying to be something is over. He is something. It's not the storybook ending but for 99.9 percent of us this is how it goes. We want a lot of things for ourselves we don't get all of them and we learn to accept the things that we have. We grow up.The only movie I've seen that compares to this film is Mickey Rourke's The Wrestler and I think The Weather Man is the better of the two. I like The Wrestler but its message comes at you like an elbow piledriver from the top rope. The Weather Man is more like a cold wind from Lake Michigan. Really stupid marketing though.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am very disappointed that I wasted 10 and 2 hours of my life watching this movie. Has our society really reached the point where we can constantly accept mediocre garbage as a substitute for thoughtprovoking entertainment? Everything in this movie seemed flawed...from the writing to the casting. Can someone please explain to me how an American husband and wife raise two children...but one has a British accent? Oh and while I am complaining about the logistics of the movie why was a plot point of Nicholas Cage's daughter being a smoker introduced? She buys cigarettes the father sees them in her bag and the point is never touched on again. No resolution? Not even confrontation? Ohhhh I know what you avantgarde cinema heads are thinking...maybe that is the point right? Maybe it isn't all about the resolution? Well I think it is pointless and boring. Back to logistics how exactly do these people throwing things at the weatherman have such great accuracy? Not only can these villains recognize Dave Spritz by the back of his head and nail him with food in a shameless effort to divert eyes away from looking at our watches these villains are superhuman enough to see Spritz sitting in his car with the window down and accurately throw a big gulp through the window and hit him. Oh and here's something else that ticked me off...how can you cast someone as brilliant as Michael Caine into the role of a genius father figure and give him such horrible dialogue. This worldrenowned author and genius father of David Spritz sits in the weatherman's car picks up a cup and gives the line What's this? ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! It is a cup that is most likely filled with residue from soda and it has the words BIG GULP printed so large on the side that Stevie Wonder could read it! The dialogue in this movie is just like the plot. It is weak thin very dry and most of the time it DOES NOT MAKE SENSE! Gore Verbinski I hope you read this because the cut to a 12 year old girl's cameltoe and then the superimposed real life camel toe was absolutely ridiculous. It was just sooooo stupid! And Nick if you ever read this...just because Adaptation was a good movie doesn't mean you have to keep using voiceover in every movie you take! When a movie is driven by the main character being hit with food and a 12 year old girl's cameltoe you should definitely save your time and money and STEER CLEAR OF THIS MOVIE.".
