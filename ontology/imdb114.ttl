But when the young woman Carey Mulligan who's carrying Bennett's unborn baby arrives at their doorstep with nowhere else to go the tension and pain of Bennett's death is brought forward in a way that will either destroy the family or finally push them towards dealing with their grief. Scenes of Rose and Bennett's relationship before his death are also woven throughout the movie and provide a nice way to better know the two characters.The Greatest started off pretty well. The scenario of a family struggling with the loss of a child isn't an uncommon one but the cast seemed well on their way to delivering a solid story about loss and healing. Mulligan was excellent and Brosnan and Sarandon were solid even though they occasionally didn't quite deliver the emotion that they were reaching for in a few scenes. No my problem with The Greatest wasn't the actors or the premise it was the writing.The story takes the oddest detours at times often with little relevance to well...the actual story. This really seemed apparent with the character of Ryan whose entire subplot with the girl he meets has little relevance on his character arc and made his resolution feel artificial as a result. And Rose and Allen's trip to a teenage party seemed completely out of place and I was left wondering what it was supposed to add to the story. The characters also didn't appear to have a truly solid identity and as a result some of their decisions and interactions didn't come off as genuine. It's like writer and director Shana Feste had ideas about what she wanted to see happen in the movie but didn't bother to build those ideas around relatable and believable characters. A movie like this depends on making a connection between the audience and the characters and at times that connection felt very hollow for me.The Greatest is an okay movie but I'm convinced that it could have been much better with a script written by someone with a better grasp on creating solid characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Greatest starring Pierce Brosnan Susan Sarandon and Carey Mulligan An Education is a relatively unknown movie by a first time director Shana Feste that is nevertheless quite good.Brosnan and Sarandon are married and play the grief stricken parents of two teenage boys one of whom dies suddenly in a horrific traffic accident at the very beginning of the film. Sarandon is excellent and demonstrates she is a superior actress in her portrayal of a mother grieving I would almost say to the extreme. She is haunted by what happened to her son by the fact that he stayed alive for 17 minutes and that she was not there to help him. She simply cannot get over the loss and resents her husband for moving on so quickly. A very poignant scene occurs when he offers her a bell a sort of tool to help her with her grief and tells her to ring it each time she thinks of their deceased son. She takes the bell from him and starts ringing it nonstop. This and many other moments were extremely sad showing how people cope with loss in very different ways.Things get even more complicated with the early appearance of Carey Mulligan's character the girlfriend of the late young man and her surprise announcement. This leads to even more sadness and hurtful reminders for the mother but also a certain easing of the pain for the father which inevitably results in great tension between the couple. Sarandon gets especially furious distressed and jealous when trying to reach her husband during a break down she finds his phone turned off and learns subsequently that he had gone to the movies with the young girl. The scene escalates so much with an almost silent force that Brosnan picks her up and throws her fully clothed into the ocean to awaken her and make her see that her anguish is unreasonable and causing pain to the rest of the living members of their family.The younger brother appearing almost indifferent at first succumbs to his emotions in the second half of the movie. The father who keeps a cool demeanor and tries to hold the family together through his strength also finally collapses and interestingly Sarandon picks up where he left off and comforts him telling him that their son did not suffer. The whole family and their links are very credible and Brosnan astonished me by being particularly realistic.Even if this movie is almost painful to watch due to the difficult subject matter it is very well acted and written making it extremely emotional and powerful. It ends well so do not be too afraid but if you are a crier a tear or two will definitely be shed.My rating 7.5 For more reviews please check out httppaulinasmovies.blogspot.com!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "THE GREATEST is a small film quietly made in 28 days by firsttime writerdirector Shana Feste. The storyscript is so unusual and touching that she was able to gather a rather extraordinary cast to bring this delicate story to life. It remains amazing to many of us that while the audiences flock to the gigantic CGI big noisy flicks little jewels such as this film go completely unnoticed. The only hope is that enough people see this film now on DVD that that both the message of the movie and the quality of the acting and production gain the attention THE GREATEST so justly deserves. Without introductory remarks the film opens with a brief prelude of the love between two just graduated from high school youngsters who after their first encounter with love pause on the drive home to attempt to make their feelings into words and BAM  a truck plunges into them and the boy Bennett Aaron Johnson is killed while the girl Rose Carey Mulligan is spared. The camera takes us rather abruptly to the graveside where the grieving parents Grace Susan Sarandon and Allen Pierce Brosnan and their young drug addicted son Ryan Johnny Simmons stare blankly into the hole that has been placed in the middle of their lives. None of the family copes with the death well Grace can't stop talking and crying about Bennett and searches for a way to find out how Bennett spent the last 17 minutes of his life that time between the accident and his death to the point of attending to the truck driver Michael Shannon in coma at the local hospital awaiting his recovery to learn about those 17 minutes Allen is unable to sleep and tries to cope with the tragedy by not allowing mention of it in his home Ryan now on frequent tests to see if he is drug free attempts to relate to a group therapy session of kids whose siblings have died. Into this dysfunctional crumbling decimated family comes Rose three months later pregnant with Bennett's child seeking refuge from a mother who is an addict. She is invited to move in despite the fact that Grace loathes the idea and thinks Allen is merely trying to resolve the grief he has ever faced by attaching to Bennett's only girlfriend. The remainder of the story reveals how each of these injured four characters gradually interact and by bearing their personal grief with their own life problems manage to find a place where they can recover together. The acting is superb as one would expect from such a talented cast Carey Mulligan again shows us that she is an important emerging actress Susan Sarandon allows us to see and understand the degrees of near insanity that grief for loss of a child can distort a life and Pierce Brosnan proves he is a firstrate actor managing a difficult role with great sensitivity. The rest of the cast is also excellent in very minor roles  Jennifer Ehle as an exlover of Allen Aaron Johnson and Johnny Simmons as the brothers and Michael Shannon as the driver of the truck who gradually awakens form his come to make Grace face some truths. As for Shana Feste she is a strong artist and we should be seeing more beautifully crafted stories from her. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about a family who grief over the loss of their son in a traffic accident. This process is complicated by the unexpected arrival of a teenage girl who claims to have their son's unborn child.The Greatest is powerful and touching. The mother played by the amazing Susan Sarandon is relentless in knowing the truth about her son's final moments. She gives such a moving performance that anyone gets saddened by her tragic loss. Carey Mulligan also deserves mention as she displays a spectrum of convincing emotions effortlessly. Judging by the stream of great movies she is in she will be a big star and Hollywood knows it.The Greatest is a powerful story that moves anyone easily. As Susan Sarandon's character says once your child is born a woman knows that her child is the greatest. It is easy to relate to this statement and yet everyone seems to be forgetting to celebrate this fact. As this film shows you never know what you have got until its gone. The Greatest is a powerful reminder that you should treasure your family before its too late.".

	schema:headline " Great substance clumsy movie but a tearjerker anyway...yeah a confused mess actually";
	schema:reviewBody "The Greatest 2009A crisis of youth becomes a crisis for a whole family and it's serious stuff. There's an attempt very conspicuous in gesture and angst filled expressions to be gritty and real and it's a believable scenario. It's a tearjerker surely an intimate psychodrama dripping in sentiment. However the movie depends almost purely on this terrible crisis to succeed and that's actually slightly backwards in movie terms. That is it should be the writing and acting that sweeps us in and makes us share the grief of the main characters. You end up wanting to empathize but it's sometimes despite the movie which pushes very hard like a friend who wants to make you feel bad about something. It has such touching moments it's hard to quite accept that a lot of it is clumsily written almost like a high budget beginner's film which sounds worse than I mean it. But you'll see I think even if you love it thoroughly that it works modestly. So accept its flaws ignore the obvious flashbacks to the good times skip the dining room table where people are sitting all on one side so we can see them all from the camera ignore the patter that is meant to make life ordinary and doesn't and so on. Be forgiving or give it a pass.What saves the movie somewhat from its excesses is the performance of the lead girl Rose Carey Mulligan and the father Mr. Brewer played by Pierce Brosnan who is a nuanced dad whatever his James Bond pedigree though neither one is given decent lines to work with. Brosnan was also a producer go figure. The mother is meant to be disturbed in her grief and she sure is. The sexy grad assistant is too too obvious even for the movies. And the brother well what is his role actually just to add a second improbable plot? And there is surveillance video of the crash which is beyond even reasonable openmindedness given the isolation implied by the first several minutes of the movie. The sensationalism of that alone will warn you of what's to come.Okay one last confession. It gets so emotionally atomic at times with the throbbing cellos coming in the background I had to laugh out loud. I swear. And yet I see how it deals with some truly believably gorgeous stuff.".

There is one shot on the beach with Brosnan and Sarandon which is particularly lovely.To see a film that wrings the tears out of your heart 5 minutes into it  only to succumb again and again  AND compel you to laugh out loud is getting your money's worth. I saw it at the Nashville Film Festival and though I was into the movie I could not tune out the audible emotional gamut of the audience  gentle sobbing shock chuckles and laughter. So it wasn't just me! I expected perfection from Sarandon anticipated good things from Carey Mulligan and Aaron Johnson and was pleased with Johnny Simmons. What surprised me was Pierce Brosnan  not only that he played a sympathetic complex character but also that he exec produced it. I liked him fine as a Bondsman but I admit I sold him short subscribing to an eye candy should be seen not heard mentality. I appreciated his packaging but never gave much thought to him having any interesting cerebral activity other than walk smile and stun. Good turn for him! I was impressed and he should be proud.Again I am afraid that it will not be seen by many folks unless Marketing makes it happen. I expected an honest effort but did not really believe I would like it this much. I am glad I saw it.

There is an excellent soundtrack to the movie  a lot of great bands  some that I actually wrote down and plan to check out. It was a lot more polished than anything I had seen in Sundance  it looked and felt like a real movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the excellent cast and an interesting idea this movie was difficult to sit through. Many have mentioned the problem of a camera on a remote road that provided a security tape for the mother to watch but that was just one problem in a movie full of them. One small problem was the buttondown father as a math professor. While there may be someone out there who teaches math and pays so much attention to his grooming I certainly never met them while I was in school. This professor is also somehow able to afford not just a 4500 sf house in NY with a maid but also a beach house right on the beach. Maybe he made some good investments and maybe he had some huge inheritance but most professors just aren't that welltodo. Ryan the brother and his drug problem seemed a little too easy. He was addicted suddenly decided to get clean with no help except his mother's drug tests. This while his mother is so out of it that she can't even shop without having a meltdown. And he keeps a stash hidden under his bed while getting clean on his own. Just a little unlikely. Where I really had trouble was the seasonality. The movie was set in New York with a baby due in February. Yet 119 days before the baby is due which would be October the family is at the beach house on a weekend and they swim. In bikinis and swim trunks. When the baby is born in February in New York the heaviest outerwear worn is a trench coat. No hats scarves mittens sweaters. Just a trench coat. With very brilliant green leaves on all the trees. We are also expected to believe that two teens who make it to 18 without sex have sex with each other the first day they talk to one another. They were both in love with each other for 4 years before talking and fell right into bed. All the great acting in the world isn't good enough to overcome the discrepancies that kept popping up in this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone that has ever lost a child has plumbed the depths of grief. And while numerous movies have tried to depict that paralyzing depression most fall well short of the mark. I recall In the Bedroom from Sundance 2001 starring Sissy Spacek Tom Wilkinson and Marissa Tomeiit was good but couldn't fully expose the raw nerve laid bare with the passing of a child. The Greatest provides a powerful glimpse into the depths of a family's grief. WriterDirector Shana Feste delivers a finelyhoned script and very capable direction to give the actors plenty of room to deal with their emotional burdens while still keeping the story moving along. One reason is the deft interlacing of the backstory that led to 18yearold Bennett Brewer's deatha violent collision while his car sat in the middle of the road and he spoke fervently to Rose British actress Carey Mulligan. Bennett's parents played by Pierce Brosnan and Susan Sarandon find Rose thrust into their lives and along with brother Sean Miles Robbinsson of Sarandon and Tim Robbins they all deal with their loss.While the script is tight the acting is even better. Brosnan gives the performance of his life as the mathematics professor who is emotionally devastated but can't let it out. And Sarandon is equally impressive as the obsessive mother whose grief is pushing the borders of her sanity. But the real find may be Mulligan who has an Audrey Tautou Amelie innocent vibrancy that declares a star is born.As one might expect this is an emotionally wrenching movie but not an entirely depressing one. There is a message of hope even though it might come in a package too conveniently wrapped and delivered. And while its theme may be a problem at the box office those that take it in will be rewarded for their investment.Sundance Moment Director Feste told the audience she wrote the script while she was a nanny. Sarandon said she didn't like seeing the movie but never revealed why. Perhaps because it dealt so vividly with a painful subject. But maybe because the movie made her look old haggard and an emotional wreck. Props to her for taking the role.".

	schema:reviewBody "The death of Bennett Brewer a popular teenager is at the center of this story. We watch as he and his girlfriend Rose are making love. Taking her back home Bennett makes a tactical mistake in stopping in the middle of a road to declare how much he loves her and how deeply he has fallen in love for her. Unfortunately it is at this moment when a truck comes out of nowhere crashing against the car. Bennett is killed after staying alive for seventeen minutes.We watch the distraught parents at the grave site. Rose with an arm on a sling comes to the funeral but she stays out of the picture. Going home in the limo we see Grace and Allen Brewer with their other son Ryan sitting in stone silence. Never do we see these people comforting one another much less talk about the tragedy that is changing their lives forever.Speed forward to three months after Bennett's death when a pregnant Rose shows up at the Brewers. Mysteriously this teenager has no one in the world or so it appears. Later on we learn she has a mother somewhere. Allen is sympathetic to what Rose is experiencing. Grace on the other hand wishes this intruder could be the one that had died not her beloved Bennett.The problem with The Greatest lays in the way the screenplay by Shana Feste who also directed does not make too much sense. One can make excuses for certain liberties most filmmakers take but it is inconceivable the situation caused when Rose decide to crash with her would be inlaws and better yet that they went along with taking this stranger they knew nothing about into their midst. There are things that have been presented in a better way in films on this subject.Susan Sarandon is asked to do another one of her bereaved mothers trying to cope with a big loss something we have already seen her do to much better results one must add. Pierce Brosnan whose company produced the film and is listed as one of the people responsible for the film shows a much vulnerable side. His Allen is carrying a lot of guilt inside him because of his involvement with a colleague. Carry Mulligan impressive in other films where she has appeared does not elicit the viewer's sympathy perhaps because of the way Ms. Feste conceived her character or the direction given to her. Michael Shannon an interesting actor shows up in a small role toward the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am housepet sitting for my parents and since there is absolutely nothing else to do way out here in the boondocks I usually rent PayPerView movies when I am here. They have quite a selection with Time Warner much better than what we get with Dish. Anyway I had the hardest time deciding on what to watch. I don't watch many movies anymore either because I do not have the attention span when around the kids andor because just about everything out of Hollywood has been crap for the past few years. Tonight I chose a movie which was not crap. It was actually remarkably good. It is called The Greatest.Starring Susan Sarandon Pierce Brosnan and Carey Mulligan The Greatest is the exact kind of drama I was looking for. I had never heard of it before today but my gut told me to rent it...and rent it I did. I felt like watching a good crier. Boy was it. I teared up countless times throughout the entire movie. It was heartbreaking yet endearing...it was so very real but a reality one never wants to endure...and the acting I forgot who I was watching. Just fantastic.It is difficult to write a review when you desperately do not want to reveal any spoilers. I will say this movie's basic plot is about a grieving family. A couple and their son must go through the horrible tragedy of losing their 18 year old son and brother. The boy also leaves behind a young woman he has deeply loved from afar for years. After his death the family learns of her being pregnant and they take her in during the deepest moments of their grief. The roller coaster of emotion the differences in reactions...it is all so natural. The entire film flowed beautifully. Just pure human.In the beginning Susan Sarandon's character as the mother wakes from a seemingly peaceful sleep only to wake to the sound of the alarm having to remember all over again that her heart is broken. As soon as her mind is aware of her reality she breaks down in gut wrenching agony. I always felt that one of the worst parts of loss is that whole part of having to remember it each and every time you wake up. It makes you not want to fall asleep at all. The father played brilliantly by Pierce Brosnan avoided these bursts of emotion by not sleeping not feeling not talking  very pragmatic and simply going through the motions of his daily life. The son feeling invisible has his own struggles in coming to terms with a brother who he wished he had hated...then maybe it wouldn't hurt as badly.The young woman Carey Mulligan  she is just gorgeous comes into their lives completely unexpectedly. And her presence and the soon to be presence of the grandchild forces one parent to finally grieve and the other to finally begin to live again.The words and the emotions displayed on screen were almost tangible and even recognizable. It was a reminder of not only how short life can be but also how many different forms of love there are in this journey through life. We can love from miles away without a spoken word. We can love our children as though we need them to breathe. We can love our spouse like no one else can understand...through troubles and errors with age and tragedy that one person can still be your right arm. There are no two loves a like. And because of that there are no two deaths alike. We will each grieve a loss in a different way. But we all experience these phases in life and there truly is no way around it. We will all have a loss which will leave us empty and hollow. We will all love another person more than what feels safe. And we will all have to pick ourselves up again regardless of what knocked us down.The Greatest was a great surprise. I liked it so much more than I expected. From now on...my gut gets to pick the flick.".

While in this case it is about the kind of grief most people should not have to experience it touches upon emotions that everyone has either had or knows that that they can have tomorrow. The writer and first time director Shana Feste shared with us that she probably wrote this because her father had such a loss many years ago and only spoke once to her about it. She researched the subject and her own emotions quite well. She was able to get Pierce Brosnan and Susan Sarandon to buy into this project and bring their maturity and great acting to this film. Then Ms. Fester and her duo of women producers Lynette Howell and Beau Marie St. Clair were able to find young Carey Mulligan before she received her Oscar nomination for An Education to play the centerpiece of the young woman who carried within her the essence of this film. All three stars brought to the screen a very palpable realism in their different but yet very appealing characters each of whom drew you in as you felt their pain. A trio of three young talented actors rounded out the outstanding cast. The movie has the haunting presence of what we recall from the 1980 Oscar winning film Ordinary People which incidentally had the same Director of Photography John Bailey. Whereas the older classic showed the disintegration of a family this one leaves you with the possibility of a rebirth. The experience is definitely worth going through.".

Newcomer Carey Mulligan surprises as the warm epicenter of this otherwise realistically grim journey into familial grief. The Greatest is the most recent film after 2002's Far From Heaven to carry on the tradition of teary family dramas from Imitation of Life through Ordinary People and Terms of Endearment. Feste isn't afraid to let the camera linger on the Brewer family including spoton performances by Susan Sarandon and Johnny Simmons as well as the aforementioned tourde force by Brosnan as they struggle to cope with the death of their allaround good guy son. What results is a film with a maturity and patience that is far beyond what should be coming from a first time director. I was impressed. I welcome Feste reclaiming the tearjerker. I didn't realize how sorely I missed movies about actual people dealing with actual problems fighting against and submitting to actual emotions.

	schema:reviewBody "Why does everyone knock the Legend of Billie Jean so much? For me it's one of my favorite 80s teen movies. And it's a good exploration into the concept of vigilante justice as a natural response to not only a cumbersome justice system but also a discriminatory one.Helen Slater is teenager Billie Jean a nice girl from the trailers of Corpus Christi Texas. When Hubie Pyat Barry Tubbs and some other local pranksters trash her brother Binx's Christian Slater motor scooter she demands compensation. But Hubie refuses to pay and his father uses the opportunity to offer that Billie Jean trade some sexual favors to him for the cash. In the midst of her flight from the pervert there's scuffle and Mr. Pyat is accidentally shot. So Billie Jean her brother and two friends involved in the accident suddenly finds themselves on the run from the police. Rather than surrendering they use their new teenage fugitive status to stage something of a protest fair is fair and Billie Jean becomes their hero and icon for teenage rebellion as well as feminism. They become the martyrs of teenagers while the adults dismiss the entire thing as a bunch of rambunctious teenagers gone out of control. So there is political significance in the story of Billie Jean in looking at the criminal justice system although some of the discrimination against Billie Jean such as denying her any sort of expedited compensation occurs as a result of the system not intervening at all. If Billie Jean was an adult would she have been taken seriously? What if Billie Jean were a male? Would that change the situation. Indeed this movie suggests that it would.In a decade filled with themes of teen angst this one offers one story of the possibility of teen and female empowerment in a way that Pump Up the Volume or other movies like that did. I always thought it was a pretty good 80s movie and one that judging by the message boards still caters to a loyal audience as many of those longlasting 80s movies do. Plus as far as important 80s movie characteristic go it's got good actors Helen Slater Christian Slater Peter Cyote and Kieth Gordon and a good soundtrack featuring Pat Benetar's Invincible and the Divinyls.".

When the motor bike is trashed and vandalized she goes to the future criminal's father for the repair fee but the guy is worst than his son. He blames her for a crime that never happened and even profits from the media coverage of her pursuit. Peter Coyote is the police investigator who believes her and sticks by her side even when a rich kid Keith Gordon fakes his kidnapping to follow her and irk his father Dean Stockwell. It's a great movie and great script excelled even more by the voice of Pat Benatar. Ten stars !".

He calls to others who share his anger at injustice to follow him to the hills where they will lead the outlaw life stealing only from those whose wealth comes from oppressing the poor respecting the peasants and righting wrongs on their behalf and seeking to restore a former condition when the great and powerful behaved decently and treated the poor equitably. This equitable treatment is also close to what E.P. Thompson called the moral economy of the poor the Honest Loaf the Fair Day's Wage for a Fair Day's Worka slogan of early labor unionsetc.The social bandit isn't a revolutionaryhe has no vision of a transformed society because his horizons are too narrow. He wants the Good Old Days back. He doesn't have a social or political theory he wants simple decency and justice. He isn't Joan of Arc fighting to restore a legitimate King he's much closer to Robin Hood resisting the oppression of a King who's forfeited the loyalty of the people by not acting as a good King should.Billie Jean is a social bandit. The events that launch her career the actions she performs and above all her simple watchword Fair is Fair clearly put her in the category that includes the Brazilian Lampiao the Sicilian Salvatore Giuliano and others. Hardly surprising since this teenage cult script was written by a formerly blacklisted old Lefty in his seventies Walter Bernstein who surely had read Hobsbawm and Thompson and found I think a very ingenious way to illustrate their ideas in a 1980's US setting.".

When Billie Jean watches Otto Preminger 's Saint Joan at Lloyd's television she cuts her hair short and makes a video with her explanation and demands becoming and icon worshiped by the teenagers. Meanwhile Detective Ringwald finds the mess he realizes that he should have listened to Billie Jean and tries to fix the situation.The Legend of Billie Jean is a supercult movie from the 80's and maybe Helen Slater's best film in her career. The plot entwines action and drama and it is delightful to watch. In the 80's many viewers believed that Helen Slater and Christian Slater were siblings since they have the same last name. The story of a wronged teenager that cuts her hair in Joan of Arc's style and becomes an idol of the youth has not aged and is still wonderful to watch.

It's just as laughable and ridiculous as ever.  The movie is full of onedimensional characters.  The cop with a heart.  The parents who beat their children.  The spoiled rich kid actually two of them.  Throw in dozens of teenagers who run an Underground Railroad cheering on the poor kids from the trailer park while driving brand new cars and wearing expensive clothes for good measure ridiculous dialogue allusions to Joan of Arc for going on the lam? and mostly uninspired acting and you get LBJ. There are only two reasons for whatever attraction this movie had Christian Slater and a good soundtrack.Besides Christian Slater in rare preJack Nicholsonobsession mode the rest of the cast is ordinary or worse.  Helen Slater is beautiful but not terribly compelling.  Peter Coyote decided to use one facial expression during the entire film.  Keith Gordon is boring as the nice rich kid. Billie Jean's two friends are parodies of deepsouth trailer park denizens and why are they the only two with backwoods accents? Helen Slater's accent is mild and Christian Slater didn't even attempt one.   Their stereotyped performances and their parents undercut the film's egalitarian theme.Even the source of conflict between Binx and the bad rich kid is silly he's attracted to Binx's sister and he trashes the brother's bike?  Does that make sense?  I guess it makes as much sense as a cottage industry springing up overnight for a teenager accused of shooting someone and on the run. The funniest scene for me was when she shows up in the sewer or some type of damp dank warehouse and there's about a hundred or more teenagers there to give her a standing ovation.  Yeah that's where I hung out when I was a teenager in the early 80s.  Hopefully she enjoyed the ovation  it was the only one she got in connection with this film.If you want to see teenage rebellion movies '80s style I'd recommend Footloose.  The conflict is less contrived and far more believable than this movie and the characters are more complex and interesting.".

Does that make sense?  I guess it makes as much sense as a cottage industry springing up overnight for a teenager accused of shooting someone and on the run. The funniest scene for me was when she shows up in the sewer or some type of damp dank warehouse and there's about a hundred or more teenagers there to give her a standing ovation.  Yeah that's where I hung out when I was a teenager in the early 80s.  Hopefully she enjoyed the ovation  it was the only one she got in connection with this film.If you want to see teenage rebellion movies '80s style I'd recommend Footloose.  The conflict is less contrived and far more believable than this movie and the characters are more complex and interesting.";

This film is not a total waste but it is pretty close.  The screenplay is not very smart and the direction is never clear.

This was Yeardley Smith's biggest actual performance before she became the voice of Lisa Simpson and did that cameo in As Good As It Gets. Here she plays a mousy young girl who finds her own independence and her own short rebellious haircut through her admiration of tortured teenturnedmedia goddess Billie Jean Slater.

Keith Gordon who played the guy who had the demonpossessed car in Christine and the guy with the demonpossessed father in Back to School gave up on acting shortly after this and became a pretty good director.My biggest problem with this movie is that it loses its message in the course of showcasing misunderstood youth. By the time Billie Jean starts throwing money at people and they burn theme Tshirts of her in effigy I was confused. Was the point that Billie Jean wasn't a heroine? Was the point that all she wanted was fair treatment and didn't get it? Are we to believe that this is the only way kids can be understood if they go on some rampage and fake a kidnapping? What does the film say about kids in general?

I remember enjoying it enormously and enjoyed it enormously again last night but the reasons for the enjoyment have changed. The film as a film has remained solidly planted in 1983 specially the score but what will lead this film into the forever ever are the writing of course and the performances. Shirley MacLaine's truthfulness warts an all is a work of art. She is present one hundred per cent of the time and let's remember Shirley MacLaine didn't start as an actress she was a dancer who became a star thanks to a twist of fate and she has remained there as an example of honesty and courage ever since. Her Aurora in Terms Of Endearment is a monumental treat. Debra Winger's performance is a revolution of sorts. Every detail confirms andor challenges our feelings for her but she's never less that one hundred per cent truthful. It's impossible not to love her even if she doesn't make it easy for you. Jack Nicholson is a terrific interference and every one of his moments have a pleasure of their own. So a 35 year old movie with a teenager's heart.".

'Terms of Endearment' is a slice of life that centres around a mother her daughter and their respective lives. The film looks very authentic. The sets makeup costumes and art direction look genuine.This is very much a character driven film. The dialogues are full of humour and wit but what's also striking is how deeply layered the words are. While the visuals are quite simplistic it's the characters that shine especially through the actors' natural performances. Their excellent nonverbal gestures spot on line delivery and restrained performances are superb.A sassy Shirley Maclaine and bubbly Debra Winger are spellbinding. Both actresses beautifully carry the film and they are brilliantly supported by fine actors like Danny DeVito Jack Nicholson John Lithgow and Jeff Daniels.What particularly appealed to me about 'Terms of Endearment' is the depiction of the motherdaughter relationship and the dynamic of it. It definitely has its ups and downs and it does not involve the use of clichd lines like 'I love you' etc but at the same time the unconditional love between them is wonderfully conveyed.".

But it's definitely more of a character study than a weepy mushy movie. In fact it's anything but mushy. Where it could of been oversentimental it was poignant. Where it could of been boring it was insightful. And where it could of been corny it was tongueincheek.Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger give career performances as mother and daughter. Both characters are polar opposites and in real life the actresses despised each other but on screen their chemistry sizzles. Jack Nicholson is his usual suave self and John Lithgow is perfect as the wimpy banker. Danny Devito also has a quirky cameo.James L. Brooks is definitely an actor's director. To him the performances are clearly more important than set pieces or flashy camera work. Each of the three main performances are brilliant especially MacLaine's. It has been decades since a movie about illness has been made like this that is so achingly real. Two scenes to look for Aurora walking across a seedy hotel heatbreaking and Emma telling her mother that she's pregnant hilarious.Terms of Endearment is a triumph!".

Considering that she lost the Oscar to her costar Shirley MacLaine who is reasonably good but far more onenote I'd say we had a major Academy Award injustice there. Jack Nicholson is fun to watch and has some amusing lines and most supporting roles like those played by John Lithgow and Danny De Vito are also firstrate and completely believable.

This film follows the complicated relationship between an icy Texan widow named Aurora Greenway Shirley MacLaineand her slightlyoffthewall daughter Emma Debra Winger who at the beginning of the film is marrying a man named Flap Horton Jeff Daniels whom her mother clearly hates seemingly just to get away from her. The film follows Emma's marriage through three children infidelity and unexpected tragedy but it never lets go of the unspoken bond between Aurora and Emma...a bond so strong that it transcends telephone lines geography and even dialogue at times...there are moments in the story where you see Aurora and Emma communicate without saying a word to each other. Writerdirector James L. Brooks won a pair of Oscars for writing and directing this funny and heartbreaking story that stretches over a long period of time but never fails to hold interest and trust me the last 2030 minutes of this film will have you weeping. Shirley MacLaine finally won her longoverdue Best Actress Oscar for her controlled performance as Aurora and Jack Nicholson won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as a retired astronaut who moves in next door to Aurora after Emma moves out and begins a hilarious and touching relationship with Aurora. Debra Winger is explosive and unpredictable as Emma and Jeff Daniels is fully invested in the unsympathetic role of Flap. A truly unique motion picture experience that will leave you limp.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie came out before I was born but I finally caught it on TV last night and couldn't believe THIS won the Oscar!! I'm usually the biggest sap there is I love sentimental movies but this movie made me HATE every character. Where is the development of the relationships between mother and daughter? We meet Aurora as a very overprotective neurotic mother and before we know it the daughter is getting married to...someone. And the mother doesn't like him....why? Apparently he's an unmotivated louse but the movie never lets us get to KNOW Flap. We see the couple become parents and struggle and fight for some reason. i still don't know why i'm supposed to care about these people but then we learn the husband is a cheater...maybe. So what does Emma do? Why have her own affair of course! Except um that relationship comes out of the blue as well. this guy pops out of nowhere and offers to pay for her groceries and in the next scene she's going off to have sex with him? I couldn't believe what I was watching. Then when Emma SEES Flip with another woman she becomes enraged!! Because HE shouldn't be potentially cheating on her!! Poor Emma...she then goes off with her supposed best friend who we only saw in one scene in the beginning of the movie but decides to go home and uproot her kids and stay with her husband....because that makes sense. then the tears come...Emma has cancer!! but it is the shortest most unemotional illness i've ever seen in a movie. Her best friend is there for her but only offers to take care of the daughter not the two older sons. So the natural decision Emma makes is to take her children away from their FATHER and give them to her mother. Because that makes sense. I barely noticed when she died until Aurora starts crying. I couldn't believe I spent two hours watching this people and didn't care about them at all. How could I when the movie never lets the audience gets to know these people? Classic case of telling not showing us these people. Absolutely ridiculous movie that is truly one of the worst I have ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Terms of Endearment stands the test of time. This film was released in 1983 and is defiantly a classic. Shirley MacLaine as Aurora Greenway and Debra Winger as Emma Horton are two of the best actresses of this generation. Not to mention Jack Nicholson as the Astronaut Garrett Breedlove his characters are always memorable no matter how big or small his role in a film.This film is about the lifelong relationship between a daughter Emma her slightly neurotic mother Aurora and the men in their lives. From the beginning of the film you see Aurora's dependence on Emma even though Aurora is slightly cold towards her at first. You also see that Emma as a daughter doesn't care she loves her mother unconditionally for who she is as a child does. The film goes on to tell a realistic tale about how life is funny exciting disappointing and just plain sad.Very few films have the ability to tell such a heart warming yet heart wrenching tale so realistically. The director's focus in this film is on the emotional effect he wants to make you feel as if you are living life with these women. The use of natural lighting and the use of a subjective view point keep you sitting next to these woman as they experience dating the astronaut and having children with a spouse who is not always there for you.I have to say my favorite part of the film was being transported back in time to the place where I grew up. A place of Laura Ashley furniture and phones that had a cords. The setting to this movie was so authentic that it made me wish for a simpler time before all the technology came along and children used to play outside. You really do feel that you are widowed housewife in Texas trying to figure out that astronaut next door and what you may want from him. Maybe you're also the mother of three trying to figure out where your husband is of course he is probably trying to figure out where you are.One of the nicest things in life is being able to share your whole self with someone who will love you anyway. That is what this story conveys. It may not always be happy and rosy but it is funny and real. It reminds me of the movie Steel Magnolias which Shirley MacLaine also does a terrific job. This is a must see movie for anyone.".

Terms of Endearment is one of those insufferable movies aimed for women even though it is clearly written by men who clearly don't know anything about real women. It's also a disjointed plot less excruciatingly dull story with some of the most poorly written characters to ever disgrace the screen.I didn't know which female protagonist I found more insufferable Aurora Shirley McClaine an overbearing mother who clings to her daughter Emma Debra Winger like a leach but doesn't appear to actually love her. Aurora is one of those people who refuse to let go and let God as evidenced where she happily wakes her sleeping baby daughter up because she's convinced that Emma has suffered crib death. Emma is so sick of her mother's nagging ways she marries the first loser who shows interest much to her mother's chagrin You are not special enough to overcome a bad marriage Aurora bluntly tells her.Then there's Emma herself who I desperately wanted to root for having an overprotective mom myself. Emma could have been written with a certain amount of dignity passion and endearing insecurities and intelligence that emerge in spite of Aurora's crappy parenting. Instead Emma is an immature petulant flighty ninny who goes from having a backbone of steel one moment to being a complete pushover the next. She firmly calls her ne'erdowell husband Flap Jeff Daniels on his infidelity and yet stays with the cheating bastard for no clear reason whatsoever. Not to mention Winger plays Emma the way one would a mentally unstable 3yearold and who sounds she doing the world's worst Joan Cusack impression. I got the feeling her children would be like the type of kids who have to raise and clean up after their alcoholic parents.I knew something was wrong when the only character I even remotely liked was Jack Nicholson's aging womanizer character. Considering that I don't even like Jack Nicholson that's really something.Worst of all Terms of Endearment is responsible for starting the trend of manipulative tearjerkers that involve families coming closer because of death Stepmom The Family Stone One True Thing. Not only is it reprehensible to treat death so lightly but it is unfair to the audience. It's as if filmmakers are punishing them for not being emotionally invested enough in the characters by creating latent feelings of guilt by killing them off. And it's always with Hollywood Cancer the type of cancer where vomiting and chemotherapy somehow never come into play.I have nothing against chick flicks I really don't. Just this one.".

	schema:headline " As comedic and dramatic as life can get ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I surprise myself by being sad during a happy family occasion like a wedding or a birthday party when it makes me realize how old someone who's very dear to me is getting or how fast life can go. And some other times as we're mourning the passing of a beloved family member I find myself sitting at a table laughing at the jokes of my uncle or remembering some funny anecdotes involving the one who's not with us anymore. Go figure why but we humans have this strange tendency to lean over a feeling that is opposite to the situation we endure like a sort of defensive reaction. Happiness reminds us how we must seize the day and death how great it is to live. So that's it we laugh when we should be sad and cry when we should laugh. Actually life teaches us that there's no 'should' when it comes to feelings and its beauty is to make us swing back and forth between happy and sad memories. And to a certain extent faithful to this very comedic aspect that can't go without a few tears Terms of Endearment embodies the passing of life as this big joke with a sad punch line we all laugh have great time but every once in a while a sad event comes to remind us what is waiting for us. It follows a streak of successful Best Picture winning family dramas such as Kramer vs. Kramer and Ordinary People but Terms of Endearment is slightly superior in the way it dares to approach life with an intelligent mix of detachment and irony but never without a profound and inspiring humanism.Still what a strange film! No wait I shouldn't even use the word 'film' because by no chances does it try to exploit some cinematic conventions in order to extract the right feelings from its audience. Albert Brooks not only trusts our intelligence but also our patience as the story plunges us in the world of Aurora and Emma Shirley MecLaine and Debra Winger mother and daughter. I say 'strange' film because it has the curious feel of a TV movie without the archetypes of a vulgar soap opera it's made with a modest tone of pastel colors and following an episodic structure like so many slices of people's lives people no worse or better than you and I but the flow is so fluid and perfect that we let ourselves guided by the story never really expecting for something to happen we're just put here as witnesses of a story which exemplifies our own vision of life.And that's the remarkable exploit of the film the key that forged its success. Terms of Endearment which is unlike any film made before was one of the highest grossing of 1983 and although I found The Right Stuff to be a much more extraordinary experience and most deserving of the Best Picture award Terms of Endearment possesses an endearing quality which relies on its faithful approach to life something made of laughs anger sadness and fears simply put the four main emotions that drive our feelings. Terms of Endearment finds the perfect tone and balance between laughs and sadness comic and pathos. In a way the film can remind of Love Story without an hyperbolic classicism that could have ruined it.Emma the daughter has this burning passion in her heart just like Ali McGraw's character and her mother works as the total opposite she seems cold and distant criticizing all her daughter's choices above them all the decision to marry a teacher named Flap Jeff Daniels. But Emma never decides she just lives while Aurora uses her maturity and status as a courted widow to better not to look at her own issues. The interactions between Emma and Aurora seems so genuine that I wondered if the two actresses were really mother and daughter. You could tell that these two women were the best friends in the world with this unique complicity that couldn't only be translated into awkward reactions. One of the biggest issues that undermine the characters' interactions is the impossible communication of true feelings and the way it's handled provides the comedic spice of the film.At a pivotal moment Aurora finally decides to invite Garrett Breedlove the exastronaut neighbor since years and infamous for his lust for younger women just to see her 'Renoir' referring to a very precious painting a second reading at these lines makes the whole situation subtly hilarious. And not only this role was so tailormade for Nicholson that it earned him his second Oscar win but Mac Laine is the perfect match for him and Brooks knew how to build a believable chemistry between them. At one point Garrett makes a whole rhapsody about the way he feels things are getting too serious for his taste to be interrupted by Aurora's reactions it's funny but it also shows that not only she's no fool but she doesn't even feel hurt. The film avoids two opposite clichs turning them into derision to better show the futility of all that stuff. Another crucial scene is Emma's monologue in New York City on the way she feels about people's problems an extraordinary moment I don't want to spoil. The film evolves beautifully with a last act that is forever rooted in our memories thanks to the remarkable performances of both Debra Winger and Shirley MacLaine surrounded by great supporting performances. The film doesn't feature iconic moments isn't renowned for a particular quote but it has a level of emotionality that has often been copied but never equaled. And to give you an idea if you haven't seen it yet just listen to Michael Gore's magnificent theme and it will give you an idea.".

I was incredibly disappointed as there was not one thing redeemable about this film whether it be the directing the acting the script and even the music playing throughout all of this making the film feel like a made for TV movie or soap opera rather than a feature film. I can't accurately judge other films from this year but it seems like a weak year for films 1983 and this about tops it. Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger are totally unconvincing as mother and daughter Jack Nicholson has been in far better form  A Few Good Men Batman The Departed as a supporting actor in particular John Lithgow didn't get enough screen time as was the case also with Jeff Daniels. Probably the worst film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and I think I need a few days to recover not from supposed tears rolling down my cheeks but from the absurdity of a melodramatic pile of bile such as this.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films not made for me yet since it appears on my television now and then I feel compelled to comment on it. Terms of Endearment is basically a big glossy soap opera with a strong cast and clichd script. This production doesn't disguise the fact that it is exactly that. The central character is an overbearing and domineering matriarch played by Shirley McLaine and the story deals with her daughter's problems and her own awkward relationship with the astronaut next door. Yep you heard that right. Jack Nicholson plays an astronaut living next door in her Houston neighborhood. His name.... please hold your laughter Garret Breedlove! What a name! What a guy! Of course he is this womanizing loner when he isn't out in space. Do you think he and Shirley will be able to find common ground?? It really doesn't matter since the more interesting parts deal with the daughter Debra Winger and her disastrous marriage to a conniving English professor Jeff Daniels. The marriage is a joke from the start and things only get worse for Winger as she later develops a Hollywoodtype cancer later that we learn little about. All we know is that the ladies in the audience better get their tissues ready. There seems no way for her to be cured. At least she gets to see New York for a few days before the cancer finishes her off.Not a lot more to say about it. This was originally based on a novel by Larry McMurtry but there likely isn't a lot of his original ideas left in this script. Apparently the Nicholson character wasn't even in his book! Could it be that an astronaut was added to sponge off the popularity of The Right Stuff which also came out that year and was also nominated for an Oscar?? Hmmmm. Anyway the acting is generally good. Nicholson adds testosterone to the estrogenrich script even though his character seems contrived. Jeff Daniels plays a paper scarecrow character but he does what he can with it. Winger is pretty good. McLaine is overthetop and maybe thats what won her the Oscar. She's the type of person in real life that you could maybe stand to be around for oh... five minutes at a time. Look for John Lithgow and Danny Devito in small and amusing cameos. Some of this was filmed around my old college in Lincoln so that's interesting enough. The scene where Winger confronts Daniels while he's talking to a mistress with their baby strapped to his chest was filmed right in the middle of campus. Winger was also romantically involved with our governor Bob Kerrey at the time. Other than these little trivial facts there isn't a lot more of interest here. At least this film cleaned up at Oscar time so the people involved can be proud of that. Tender Mercies would seem a more deserving best picture though. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:headline " It has its flaws but to resist this film you'd have to be made of stone";
	schema:reviewBody "A movie's opening scenes are often its most telling and important and so it was with Terms of Endearment. The first few scenes of James L. Brooks' family drama are probably the best in the film. A widow who wants badly for her daughter to need her for comfort accepts her daughter's invitation to share her bed because the daughter knows who is really in need. The sharing of the bed really establishes the relationships between Emma and her mother Aurora early on which is vital because that's the focus of the entire movie. For every scene in which Aurora is interfering or disapproving we can remember the very first scene where Aurora was so desperately protective of her daughter that she would wake her up to ensure she was still alive.Shirley Maclaine is a delight to watch in this movie especially in the opening and closing moments of the film. An unconscious smile comes over Shirley's face when her daughter fights with the husband she so strongly disapproves of. A man familiarly lays his hand on her and she looks at him with pointed indignation of someone whose been through this far too many times. She is sassy but deeply loving of her daughter Emma which becomes a core of the movie. Towards the middle of the film Aurora enters a forgettable and slightly forced romance with the aptly named Garrett Breedlove Nicholson which sidelines a lot of Maclaine's talent. Nicholson is a master class actor but this is definitely not one of the best performances on his resume.Emma also played unforgettably by Debra Winger was just as mesmerising as Maclaine. She is utterly charming and shares great chemistry with her husband mother and children. Winger along with Jeff Daniels and director James L. Brooks is so effective that the mere mention of her mother can kill the mood in a moment which is as authentic as real life can be. Throughout the film Emma's marriage with Flap falls apart because she suspects he is having an affair so she jumps along with Sam a performance that John Lithgow somehow got an Oscar nomination for. This is about where the film lost me because even when Flap's infidelity is confirmed I could hardly sympathise or support her because I knew she cheated on him first. However Lithgow and Winger have one of my favourite scenes in the film  each tries to hold the other's hand and both miss by a few seconds as the other doesn't notice. Its beautifully awkward.Towards the end Terms of Endearment takes is famous turn for the tissues as Emma is diagnosed with terminal cancer. James L. Brooks is at the top of his game in creating beautiful affecting moments fully and ably supported by Winger and Maclaine. Shirley Maclaine wins the Oscar in a single scene where she shrieks for someone to manage her daughter's pain. Winger and the actors playing her children especially Huckleberry Fox delivers one of the saddest movie farewells I have ever seen. You have to be made of stone not to be affected by young Fox's tears as he hugs his mother goodbye.James L. Brooks' script has some great moments of comedy and even more of drama. For example see where Emma's friend Patsy is trying to get around talking about cancer. Emma directly says to Patsy Its OK to talk about the cancer and then Brooks cuts to a new friend saying almost verbatim so Patsy says you have cancer! as if it were a new fishbowl or garage door mechanism. The reaction of Patsy to spit out her food in shock completely mirrored my own. Brooks is also masterful at directing such scenes but throughout the film I couldn't shake the feeling that most of the scenes were strung together without making a cohesive narrative. I also found Patsy's attempt to adopt just Emma's daughter to be a poorly chosen subplot towards the end especially where Patsy tearfully wishes she could take the little girl away. Not tasteful or effective.But for the most part Terms of Endearment sets out to tell a beautiful small scale family story and it does it remarkably well. As I said you'd have to be made of stone not to be affected by the end.".

	onyx:emotionText "A movie's opening scenes are often its most telling and important and so it was with Terms of Endearment. The first few scenes of James L. Brooks' family drama are probably the best in the film. A widow who wants badly for her daughter to need her for comfort accepts her daughter's invitation to share her bed because the daughter knows who is really in need. The sharing of the bed really establishes the relationships between Emma and her mother Aurora early on which is vital because that's the focus of the entire movie. For every scene in which Aurora is interfering or disapproving we can remember the very first scene where Aurora was so desperately protective of her daughter that she would wake her up to ensure she was still alive.Shirley Maclaine is a delight to watch in this movie especially in the opening and closing moments of the film. An unconscious smile comes over Shirley's face when her daughter fights with the husband she so strongly disapproves of. A man familiarly lays his hand on her and she looks at him with pointed indignation of someone whose been through this far too many times. She is sassy but deeply loving of her daughter Emma which becomes a core of the movie. Towards the middle of the film Aurora enters a forgettable and slightly forced romance with the aptly named Garrett Breedlove Nicholson which sidelines a lot of Maclaine's talent. Nicholson is a master class actor but this is definitely not one of the best performances on his resume.Emma also played unforgettably by Debra Winger was just as mesmerising as Maclaine. She is utterly charming and shares great chemistry with her husband mother and children. Winger along with Jeff Daniels and director James L. Brooks is so effective that the mere mention of her mother can kill the mood in a moment which is as authentic as real life can be. Throughout the film Emma's marriage with Flap falls apart because she suspects he is having an affair so she jumps along with Sam a performance that John Lithgow somehow got an Oscar nomination for. This is about where the film lost me because even when Flap's infidelity is confirmed I could hardly sympathise or support her because I knew she cheated on him first. However Lithgow and Winger have one of my favourite scenes in the film  each tries to hold the other's hand and both miss by a few seconds as the other doesn't notice. Its beautifully awkward.Towards the end Terms of Endearment takes is famous turn for the tissues as Emma is diagnosed with terminal cancer. James L. Brooks is at the top of his game in creating beautiful affecting moments fully and ably supported by Winger and Maclaine. Shirley Maclaine wins the Oscar in a single scene where she shrieks for someone to manage her daughter's pain. Winger and the actors playing her children especially Huckleberry Fox delivers one of the saddest movie farewells I have ever seen. You have to be made of stone not to be affected by young Fox's tears as he hugs his mother goodbye.James L. Brooks' script has some great moments of comedy and even more of drama. For example see where Emma's friend Patsy is trying to get around talking about cancer. Emma directly says to Patsy Its OK to talk about the cancer and then Brooks cuts to a new friend saying almost verbatim so Patsy says you have cancer! as if it were a new fishbowl or garage door mechanism.

Its major drawback is a static camera and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is which is a pity for it's a good piece of primitive moviemaking made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker's intention. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films and her entrance is still classic. Her voice is strangely deep almost boyish which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona. As her boyfriend Charles Bickford is appropriately virilehe was apparently born craggyand a perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo. His Irish brogue is not bad at all and he seems always a natural man of the sea very O'Neilllike in his independent brooding nature. As Garbo's very confused father George Marion seems truly from another time. He has the sort of face and voiceopen unmannered totally without guilethat has vanished from the earth. Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill swing of things. Her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis. Poetic license perhaps as this is not in the script but we can forgive Miss Dressler's excesses she is too good at it not to. The story ends with a movement to the next thing as distinct from resolution which isn't the author's cup of tea and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise. In Anna Christie we are in O'Neill country a place of sea storms and fog a feeling of allpervading and damnable uncertainty which we would now call ambivilance or anxiety neurosis. Rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it as weather land ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard.".

	schema:reviewBody "78 years ago...the premiere of Anna Christie advertised by the slogan Garbo Talks! The film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity Greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence into sound a few seconds closing her silent era and at last Greta Garbo says a historic line Gimme a whiskey ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy baby! Anna Christie 1930 is the movie by Clarence Brown that introduced a great silent star Greta Garbo to talkies. Nowadays we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses. The careers of many were bound to end  something we hardly or not at all see at present. And it was no coincidence that it was Clarence Brown who directed the first talkie with the Swedish beauty. Garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions FLESH AND THE DEVIL 1926 and A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS 1928 movies that achieved a smashing success at the box office both with Garbo in the lead. But we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie now purely historical appears to be of minor importance. The question for today's viewer is not what Garbo's voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these 78 years. In other words we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time. Has it?When I recently watched it I came into conclusion that except for some minor technical aspects including static camera Anna Christie is still very entertaining. It's on the one hand a wonderful story of a life of a reality that the young woman faces being based on Eugene ONeill's play and on the other hand an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs.CONTENT Chris Christopherson George F Marion a heavy drinker lives a life of a sailor on a barge. Although his days are filled with sorrows he is consoled by a letter from his daughter Anna Garbo whom he hasn't seen for 15 years. She says that she will come back to him. He starts to change everything for better however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 yearold woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in Minnessota where she lived and worked. Moreover he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life... This brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than Anna her father Chris makes you realize how universal it is. Simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been erased after all these years. Cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid...PERFORMANCES. There are not many characters in the movie but there are two that really shine in the roles. It is of course Greta Garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 yearlong phenomenon the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema something I have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films. But here Garbo is slightly different. I admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role. That seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in English however her performance is as always genuine and unique. But that is what everyone has expected from Garbo. The true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is Marie Dressler as Marthy. She is excellent in her facial expressions in her accent in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of hitting the bottle. Her best moments include the conversation with Anna Christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious talk with Chris. The rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever here the German version makes up for it. Particularly Dressler except for Garbo herself constitutes an absolutely flawless choice.If you asked me what I like about Anna Christie nowadays that's what I would tell you it's a classic movie. However there is one more thing that I must mention at the end. It is humor wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout. Although the content is quite serious and Anna Christie in no way carries a comedian spirit the only Garbo's comedy was NINOTCHKA there are such moments when you will split your sides. Don't skip for instance Anna and Matt's visit in the fun park particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how virtuous and innocent she is beer for himself and where suddenly Marthy joins them by chance...Anna Christie is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance. If you are fed up with many of those modern starlets seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied. Very worth your search! Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie! Skaal after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense...".

	schema:reviewBody "For Greta Garbo's first talking picture MGM wisely chose Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Prize winning 1921 play ANNA Christie. Also wisely the producers backed Garbo up with not one but two members of the Original Broadway Cast George Marion as Anna's father Chris and James T. Mack as Johnny the Priest  transmuted to Johnny the Harp for films so as not to offend. This little change is interesting. Like too many films accused by those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins of being little more than filmed stage plays the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn't be more faithful to the property. By diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn't offend anyone or opening it up because they COULD too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place. Fortunately the respect the studio had for both O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in Frances Marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation. Wonder of wonders Marion even allows the POINT of the scene where Garbo's Anna reveals her past on the farm to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! What the League of Decency must have thought of that! The source play's greatest problem has always been that Chris's friend Marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take stage  the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don't always recognize. The perfectly cast Marie Dressler who had cut her teeth on the Broadway stage as well before going to Hollywood is the perfect balance for Garbo's Anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes doesn't allow us too much time to miss her  one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original  AND screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from O'Neill to bring Dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of Julie Laverne's second act appearance in SHOW BOAT. Anna and Marthy's early scene together on screen 16 minutes into the film taking each other's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece. Not to be missed. ANNA Christie is great tragic play and a good film drama. It's hard to imagine that a latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake it was first filmed without sound in 1923  also with George Marion's original Broadway Chris could improve on this excellent filming. The internal scenes hew closest to the play but the exteriors shouldn't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere. While the background screen work is not to modern technical standards the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set especially in the New York harbor.Nearly all Garbo's naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly only the too often parodied death scene from CAMILLE 7 years later will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies but this ANNA Christie together with the variety of her 1932 films MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy NINOTCHKA Garbo laughs! surely stand as her best.O'Neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded sea plays should track down the fine World War II shaped film released in the year before the U.S. entered the conflict THE LONG VOYAGE HOME 1940. It is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from ANNA Christie and features a youngish John Wayne in one of his rare nonWesterns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.".

	schema:headline " OK Overall Garbo Makes It More Than Worthwhile";
	schema:reviewBody "This early sound era adaptation of O'Neill's Anna Christie would be a decent movie worth seeing on its own but it is Greta Garbo that makes it particularly worthwhile. The rest of the production is solid and for the most part its limitations are common to many other sound movies made in 1930. Garbo herself rises well above the level of the rest of the production and Marie Dressler is also memorable and effective in her smaller role.It's easy enough to see why a story like this was chosen for Garbo's first talking role. It provides a female central character who offers a readymade opportunity for an actress like Garbo to demonstrate a good range of abilities from strength to tenderness from coarseness to elegance. She has good scenes with several of the other characters. Dressler's raucous performance works well and she has some very good moments. George Marion is very believable as Garbo's father.The story itself is an interesting one with some worthwhile themes though it does not necessarily lend itself that well to cinema. There are a few times when it might as well just be a filmed stage play but then there are also a number of times when the camera picks up some good atmospheric details such as the dockside setting or the New York skyline that make a good complement to the emotional story.".

Marion receives a letter from his estranged twenty year old daughter Anna Christie Christofferson Greta Garbo telling that she will leave Minnesota to stay with him. Chris left Anna fifteen years ago to the countryside to be raised by relatives in a farm in St. Paul and he has never visited his daughter.Anna Christie arrives and she is a wounded woman with a hidden dishonorable past since she had worked for two years in a brothel to survive. She moves to the barge to live with her father and one night Chris rescues the sailor Matt Charles Bickford and two other fainted sailors from the sea. Soon Anna and Matt fall in love with each other and Anna has the best days of her life. But when Matt proposes to marry her she is reluctant and also haunted by her past. Matt insists and Anna opens her heart to Matt and to her father disclosing the darks secrets of her past. Anna Christie is the first talkie of Greta Garbo and a heartbreaking story of a young woman that finds redemption through love. I bought the DVD with both versions of 1930 and 1931 and the version in English is restored and has additional scenes in the beginning and in the ending however Jacques Feyder's version in German is better than Clarence Brown's. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Anna Christie".

	schema:reviewBody "Anna Christie MetroGoldwynMayer 1930 directed by Clarence Brown was the motion picture event of the season where Garbo talks! Naturally she talked but was never heard during her days 19261929 on the silent screen. With other silent film stars having already made the transition by 1929 the selection in what Garbo was to appear had to be a sound one. Considering Lon Chaney's talking debut being a remake to his 1925 success THE UNHOLY THREE 1930 the possibilities of Garbo doing the same for any one of her silent screen successes. FLESH AND THE DEVIL 1927 or that of Anna Karenina from LOVE 1927 immediately come to mind. Garbo did play Anna Karenina again but in 1935. Another Anna did get selected one that was already filmed in 1923 starring Blanche Sweet. Taken from Eugene O'Neil's Pulitzer Prize winning play that originated on stage in 1921 starring Pauline Lord considering the title character of Swedish heritage it seemed natural for the Swedish born Garbo to tackle tat role herself. And so she did earning an Academy Award nomination in the process. With her accent authentic George Marion who originated his role of Chris Christophersen on both stage and silent screen was not or didn't appear to be. Whether faithful to O'Neill's writing or not really didn't matter for that Anna Christie proved to be a critical success.The story gets underway as Old Chris George Marion a Swedish captain of the fishing boat living on the barge with Marty Owens Marie Dressler his drunken waterfront mistress. After coming to the nearby bar for some drinks Chris receives a letter with news that his daughter Anna is coming from St. Paul Minnesota for a visit. Chris who hasn't seen Anna since she was a fiveyearold child in Sweden is a concerned how to handle their meeting after a 15year separation. While in the next room Anna who calls herself Anna Christie Greta Garbo enters the waterfront bar where her first encounter being Marty the woman Anna claims to be herself forty years from now. As both women drink some whiskeys and Anna smoking cigarettes she reveals her troubled past to Marty being raised by cruel relatives on the farm turning to prostitution in order to survive and hating all men in the process. Having been released from jail and a two week hospital stay Anna finally meets with her father as Marty secretly moves from the barge where Anna is to stay. As the two venture out to sea they meet with a terrible storm later rescuing Matt Burke Charles Bickford a tough talking Irish seaman from a drifting raft where he and others had spent five days. When Matt shows interest in Anna Chris objects causing the two stubborn men to become rivals forcing Anna to come between them.For its initial 34 minutes Anna Christie is virtually stagebound set mostly in a bar. Garbo's star entrance takes its toll 16 minutes into the story. From there she recites these spoken words to the barman in deep throat manner Gimme a vhiskey. Ginger ale on the side  and don't be stingy baby with occasional end of sentence catch phrases of Alright alright. With this the long wait ends. GARBO talks! And does she ever. The voice not only fits her personality but her character as well. How the story develops in early sound technique is another matter.During its 88 minute time frame director Clarence Brown breaks away from its staginess with outdoor scenery of the Brooklyn Bridge the sea as well as time away at Coney Island Amusement Park before resorting to stagebound manner on the barge. There is no underscoring to set the mood but intertitles The next morning  the waterfront of the East River  New York City. Two days later in town off New England. At anchor in an outer harbor along the Massachusetts coast.in the silent film tradition placed between extended scenes. With the supporting cast a limited few only four take precedent. Charles Bickford proved way different from the usual Garbo costars. Definitely not the John Gilbert romantic type but that of a roughneck Irishman a vivid reminder of Victor McLaglen caricature found in John Ford directorial features reciting such typical lines as I can lick any man with one hand tied behind me back. The opposites attract combination of Garbo and Bickford gives equal balance to the nature of the story. George Marion at times bears a slight resemblance of character actor Donald Meek. No doubt Meek might have been an interesting prospect to play Old Chris had a remake of ANNA Christie been considered in the 1940s with Ingrid Bergman in the lead. Marie Dressler's performance leaves a lasting impact enough to have earned a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination had that category been around back then. In fact her waterfront floozy in second hand clothing was no doubt a dress rehearsal for her upcoming role in MIN AND BILL 1930 for which won Dressler a Best Actress award by the Academy. Seldom revived until its 1985 distribution to home video by MGMUA followed by occasional public television showings Anna Christie along with Garbo's Germanlanguage version can be found on cable TV's Turner Classic Movies. While the English version of 'Anna Christie now available on DVD is better known many claim the German edition to be better and much more forthright. Though this Anna Christie may not hold up as well as Garbo's most notable assignments as CAMILLE 1936 or NINOTCHKA 1939 it's noteworthy if nothing else as the one where that term Garbo talks! started.  vhiskeys".

	schema:headline " I really enjoyed Garbo's first talkie";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd read all the negative reviews for Anna Christie. You know the gripes about the static camera outdated acting and wordiness of the screenplay. But when I viewed it yesterday I found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable. Yep Clarence Brown's camera remains stationary for the most part and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ship's light. Yep there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. It's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. But... then there's Garbo Marie Dressler George F. Marion and Charles Bickford all proving that great acting is timeless.I believe Anna Christie is still one of Garbo's most iconic performances. And it's a wonderful performance from the Divine One in a role that is really quite atypical for her. Yes we've seen Garbo weary and almost beaten yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey. Garbo played so many delightful costume roles that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. She's not weighed down by heavy dresses or makeup. This performance seems quite raw from Garbo.The plot from the O'Neill play follows weary Swedish exprostitute Anna and her reunion with her boozy seaman father. Anna's had enough trouble for any girl of twenty as she tells drunken slovenly Marthy Dresslerin a bar. She finds solace in a life at sea and romance with a roughhewn but goodhearted fisherman Charles Bickford. But her past threatens to ruin it all.Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbo's long line of largely inferior leading men. He's one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence. The pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another. Dressler can never be accused of underplaying and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks but she's terrific and convincing in her role never annoying as in the dreadful Dinner At Eight. I've never really heard of George F. Marion before but he was wonderful as Garbo's father.This is PreCode and rather gritty and dark by MGM's standards. I really enjoyed it and while it may creak in some places it's still wonderful.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'd read all the negative reviews for Anna Christie. You know the gripes about the static camera outdated acting and wordiness of the screenplay. But when I viewed it yesterday I found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable. Yep Clarence Brown's camera remains stationary for the most part and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ship's light. Yep there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. It's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. But... then there's Garbo Marie Dressler George F. Marion and Charles Bickford all proving that great acting is timeless.I believe Anna Christie is still one of Garbo's most iconic performances. And it's a wonderful performance from the Divine One in a role that is really quite atypical for her. Yes we've seen Garbo weary and almost beaten yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey. Garbo played so many delightful costume roles that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. She's not weighed down by heavy dresses or makeup. This performance seems quite raw from Garbo.The plot from the O'Neill play follows weary Swedish exprostitute Anna and her reunion with her boozy seaman father. Anna's had enough trouble for any girl of twenty as she tells drunken slovenly Marthy Dresslerin a bar. She finds solace in a life at sea and romance with a roughhewn but goodhearted fisherman Charles Bickford. But her past threatens to ruin it all.Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbo's long line of largely inferior leading men.

It is an amazing performance. She is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice. You can actually smell the alcohol when she is done. Amazing. And Greta of course speaks her first lines on film and shes great. The Eugene O'Neill story is solid and like most O'Neill stories very deep and intense. This is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30's and 40's you will like it. Some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile.".

The old guy who plays Garbo's dad George F. Marion in the film is incredibly annoying. All he does is stumble around drunkenly in a totally fake way and yell about dat old dahveel sea. He blames Garbo's past his whole life and everything on the sea! He comes across as stupid x 10. Charles Bickford is Matt the rough 'n' tumble sailor Garbo falls in love with and he's fine in his role but nothing really outstanding.The best part is when Garbo unleashes her terrible secret on Bickford and her dad. Finally Marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats his head and fists on the table in perfect time with Bickford. Then soon he goes on a tirade about the sea.I had to practically force myself to finish Anna Christie. It's too melodramatic in many parts and creaky. There are many good early talkies but this is not one of them. If you haven't seen Garbo before try something else before Anna Christie like Camille or Grand Hotel".

'Garbo Talks' and she spoke those words in her first sound film an adaption of the Eugene O'Neil play Anna Christie. Unlike with some other players and some other studios MGM took great care in finding the proper vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players who were fine in the universal medium of silent film would lose their careers because of talkies. Their heavy native accents would get in the way some didn't know any English. It was no accident that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. First of all it being authored by one of America's leading playwrights it was the kind of literary property that would have appealed to her. Secondly since the title role was someone who was Swedish the accent could be explained. Finally a lot of the kinks from early talkies had been worked out even though Anna Christie still made use of title cards.Like most of O'Neil's work it's short on action but long and deep on characterization. The story takes place on the New York waterfront where Garbo as Anna has come to live with her father George Marion. Marion ran away to sea years ago when Anna was a baby and Marion abandoned his wife. Anna has had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and that includes prostitution.Marion of course is glad to see her he even kicks out Marie Dressler the old waterfront crone he's been living with for years to make room for his flesh and blood. Of course both Marion and Garbo have their problems adjusting to each other not made easy when they give shelter to a sailor played by Charles Bickford who takes a fancy to Garbo.Marion is repeating his role from the original Broadway production. The role of Anna on stage was done by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie ran for 177 performances in the 192122 season on Broadway. It's one of O'Neil's best known works and one that's revived frequently. Of course Garbo's performance with perfect diction even with a Swedish accent was acclaimed and her future in sound films was assured. Greta Garbo received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and the film also got nominations for Clarence Brown as Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Daniels should especially get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the waterfront scenes. And Brown created the mood around the waterfront where the film is set.Eugene O'Neil's work is timeless so Anna Christie even with a lot of the trappings of early sound films does not date the way many films of that era do. Garbo also shows she mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium. Anna Christie is a classic all the way around.".

	schema:headline " Transitional Film for Both Garbo and MGM";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a Eugene O'Neill play Anna Christie was filmed at a time of transition in Hollywood from the silent era to sound. Because of the technical limitations imposed by the new sound process the film is static visually and harsh aurally. Despite some atmospheric shots director Clarence Brown rarely moved the camera and rarely framed his actors in anything but a medium shot. Contemporary viewers unaccustomed to films of the late 20s and early 30s will likely fidget at the monotonous visuals and scratchy soundtrack.Anna Christie was also a transitional film for Greta Garbo. In her first sound feature Garbo at times reverts to the mannerisms of the silent era. However her voice meshed perfectly with her established image and her performance was effective if not among her best. The film's scene stealer was Marie Dressler who walked off with the movie whenever she was on screen. While not a subtle performance Dressler created a colorful character with substantial depth in her few scenes. Charles Bickford and George Marion provided able support to what was certainly a major production effort by MGM to transition one of their most valuable stars from the silents to the talkies.For the period the film presents a a strong female character at its core. Anna resists the efforts of both her father and her boyfriend to control her life. When she reveals to both men what she had been required to do in the past in order to survive she is prepared for whatever reaction she may get. Although Garbo makes it apparent what she wants the men to say her character is strong enough to get on with her life with or without men involved. Anna Christie certainly matches some of the other strong characters in the Garbo gallery such as Queen Christina who may want the love of a man and may be willing to sacrifice for it but are strong and independent enough to survive without it and not suffer the fate of the Marie Dressler character. While Anna Christie creaks today and at times requires an effort to watch the film is a valuable historical work. Certainly anything with Garbo is worth watching and when Garbo talks the audience still listens despite the clumsy technical production.".

Her father who is a captain on a barge is happy to see her even though she's acting a bit cagey. She soon falls in love with a grizzled seaman who also notices that something a barrier if you will is holding her back.Anyways the two fellows don't particularly like each other and soon come to blows over Garbo when she diffuses the situation by revealing her Big Secret which is no surprise to us if you've read the video box damn you MGM!! Garbo is nothing but arms in this movie she acts and acts flailing her arms about and gets grating quickly. The two male leads are alright. Probably the best performance comes from the classic silent actress Marie Dressler who plays the drunken captain's even drunker girlfriend. What a performance! It's too bad the tagline couldn't have read Dressler Talks!".

Her father takes her on his barge and she comes to love the sea. One day they rescue a young man Charles Bickford and he and Anna fall in love.

You can tell that she understands every word she is saying just as you can tell when some actors have learned their role by rote. She acquits herself very well.Marie Dressler as Marthy a friend of her father's whom Anna meets in a bar is marvelous playing each scene as a drunk. And you really think she is. As someone wrote you can smell the alcohol on her breath.That's the good news. The bad news is that this is a very difficult film to watch. Sound and dealing with the camera when you have sound was all very new. The camera didn't move around so it is a very static movie. The actors have several scenes where they all talk at once. An acting teacher once said Eugene O'Neill was our greatest novelist. The actors don't just talk at once they talk incessantly. There is no action to be had. I love Eugene O'Neill I have seen his plays on stage. This film is 85 years old and it shows.Definitely worth seeing however. After all Garbo talks!".

While I haven't seen the American version which was filmed at the same time I have a hard time believing the subject matter would be treated more seriously or openly as what's on display here. The only problem I had with the film is that some of the direction is weak in terms of the camera just standing still and not adding too much to the film. Other than that this is a very open and hard hitting little love story that works wonders and packs a terrific punch due to the three leads performances. Garbo brings her typical beauty to the screen and perfectly captures her character's tortured soul. The love scenes with Shall are very good and you can't help but cheer for things to work out well.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is Garbo's first ever talking role but she acts as if she has done nothing else before.What makes the movie however hard and also sort of unpleasant to watch is it's storytelling. The movie is set up like a stageplay so most of the time the characters just sit around and talk. All we see in the first 30 minutes for instance are characters being drunk and complaining a lot about life. The movie is of course also based on a stageplay so no great wonder that the storytelling in this movie also feels like one. But if I want to watch something like this I would to to the theater. There are of course some good stageplay to movies translations but I guess that back in 1930 they didn't had a real good idea yet or the experience to translate a stageplay well to the silverscreen. The movie is now instead a sort of a bore in parts since its obviously dragging at moments. The movie is also of course very limited in its settings and the movie often jumps from the one setting to the other as if the curtain had dropped and a new set had been buildup during the break. The movie just never really feels as one big whole and it instead feels as if it consists out of different acts. It's a very static movie.It's not just only a hard movie to follow because of its storytelling and settings but also because of all of the heavy accents of the actors. On top of that the sound recording quality of course wasn't that good yet back in 1930 so not everything that is being said is understandable.Also the picture quality of the movie isn't that good anymore. Time hasn't been kind on it. The image is sort of fuzzy in parts and the movie is perhaps more gray than truly black  white.It is definitely true that the movie gets better and better when it heads toward its ending but it didn't made me forget it's way weaker first 30 minutes and disjointed storytelling in the movie overall.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This version of Anna Christie is better than the earlier silent version starring Blanche Sweet though it is not a huge improvement. Unlike the earlier film this one has expanded the father's mistress' role into a larger and comedic one starring Marie Dressler and the production values are a bit better overall. This isn't to say that I loved this moviemostly because the story just seems very oldfashioned and corny but also because Dressler's comedic performance in some ways detracts from the focus of the film. However in 1930 this sort of melodrama starring Greta Garbo in her first sound film played very well but by today's standards the acting at times just seemed overthetop from time to time. Despite this the story still is pretty compelling and the film is quite watchable.This film by the way was a preCode film. This means that the film was very racy by standards imposed just a few years laterwith plot elements such as prostitution and some minor cursing. Those not used to the preCode films might be surprised by all this but films made up until about 1935 or so often had nudity violence and plot elements that NEVER would have been allowed in later years.Oddly the DVD version of this film offers BOTH the original American version and the German version that was made concurrently starring a Germanspeaking cast. In the early days of talkies some studios such as MGM and Universal often made duplicate movies by using the same sets at night after filming wrapped for the day! In some cases they had Hollywood actors phonetically speak the lines in different languages Laurel and Hardy made some of thesein which they spoke in Spanish along with Spanish costars. And in others an entirely new cast was used such as with the Spanish language version of Dracula. In the case of Anna Christie Greta Garbo made a German language version with all new costars that is supposedly better than the American version. HOWEVER the DVD did include this German version but with absolutely no subtitles or dubbing! So as long as you are willing to watch an entire movie in a language you don't understand or know German it's a waste having it on the DVD. Why didn't they include English language captions?!? I would have loved to have seen it in this case but am not willing to try to guess at what they are sayingmy knowledge of the language just isn't good enough to understand everything that's being said!".

An excellent performance from Ms. Garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era I wanted to see some of her silent work but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them. How odd. One thing I noticed over and over was the way the Swedish accent sounds like replacing the letter J with a Y sound. Anna ends up being the only character I liked I didn't really care for her estranged father or her wouldbe suitor. It looks like the soundrecording systems are getting better nobody leaning in to talk into the mysterycan but the camera still isn't moving. We'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues.KEVIN Our first film of the 1930's is the first sound film of silent starlet Greta Garbo Anna Christie. This is a very simple movie with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's 89 minute running time often with a static camera. It was great to see Marie Dressler in sound as well and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt yet inebriated slurs. I very much enjoyed Garbo's performance as she sustains the film through even the most meandering moments. I didn't really like George Marion or Charles Bickford maybe because I wasn't sympathetic to either of them so I was relieved and excited when Anna finally stands up for herself and shows them that she doesn't belong to either her estranged father or her musclebound Irish boyfriend. It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.Last film viewed Speedy 1928. Last film chronologically The Love Parade 1929. Next film The Blue Angel 1930.".

Other things that differs from the majority of the created movies nowadays are the ways that characters express their emotions and the believes  principles they have.On the negative side there are moments with poor computer graphic effects and impossible physics which has had a negative influence on my vote.Overall this movie managed to keep me watching till the end. I can't say the same for other movies that seem to have higher ratings.";

Only Chernaya Molniya is actually better but I can't really pin down exactly why. Is it the Russian music the Russian humor or just the overall exotic nature of a big budget comic style movie taking place in the heart of Moscow with Russian actors and spoken in Russian?I don't know or care really. All I can say is that I enjoyed this movie in spite of its very clich plot its very clich action scenes and its strangely familiar Hollywood style atmosphere. For those who're in the mood for some light entertainment but are tired of the same old Hollywood crap this film is something like a subtle breath of fresh air. It has all the familiar plot twists all the clichs and the same atmosphere of a comic style Hollywood blockbuster movie but it's served by a Russian cast and a Russian director... that in some way makes it not just bearable but even enjoyable to a guy like me who's tired of the same old Hollywood crap.But maybe that's just me. Hate it or like it... but this is a movie I'm sure you'll remember.".

Some spoilers here  The hero survived some transformations that did not seem very logical Quick switch from being a normal person to someone obsessed with making money just to show off in front of a girl? A very fast transformation from someone who caused his fathers death with total luck of interest in people to being a super hero? Then some laws of the physics were crashed like stopping a van through hitting it from behind being able to fly on a Mercedes in space without freezing starting a Volga after it has been drowned etc. Not to mention shameless advertising of apple cell phones who ring under water. At last I think I miss the feeling as a whole in the movie. They tried to tell a story and to touch some sensitive topics but they failed. On the whole its worth watching as it is fun but I think something is missing and the screenplay should have been rewritten with more attention to detail. Still my favorite is when the sign of Mercedes and Volga were opposed when flying to the stratosphere its quite amusing ".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Lightning was a long way from perfect. The story is very derivative and does get rather predictable while the ending is a little rushed and overcomplicatedperhaps too much going on in the script and the action and a lot of the special effects are rather hokey and more at home in the late 80searly 90s. The script while having some great ironic humour can feel empty and awkwardsounding at times too. Black Lightning is slickly shot though with a convincing setting. The Russian heavymetal soundtrack pulsates through the film with great energy and is quite catchy as well and the pacing is fine. The action is fun and exciting to watch if occasionally a little cheesy and the ironic humour in the script is funny and endearing. The characters are derivative and clichd like the story but still quite engaging the hero and his love interest are likable and the villainthough his motivation does come across as rather silly does give an aura of creepiness. The acting is good especially from Grigory Dobrygin and Viktor Verzhbitsky though Ekaterina Vilkova is visually gorgeous and at least adequate. All in all derivative with some hokey effects and a rushed solution but fun slick and well played. Partially recommended but try not to overthink too much. 610 Bethany Cox".

I'd also be 11 years younger and perhaps a little less cynical and forgiving of schmaltzy clichd stuff. So in this imaginary world where we have a time traveling De Lorean or equivalent I would have walked out of Black Lightning and thought Man what a cool movie. Those Russians really are breakthrough...how awesome was that!. Yes it's a bit back to the future but who cares...that was FUN!!...Except it's not 1999 and I am 11 years older. I've seen Spiderman where he discovers his gee whiz powers where his gr amps gets killed with great power comes great responsibility etc. I've seen transformers where a beat up old car becomes something awesome. And i've heard the brooding music from Nolan's Batman. I've seen Iron Man take his enemy up in the sky until they both froze up and he ran out of fuel and dropped back to earth...should i go on?So why the heck did they make this movie? Did they just assume that no one in Russia watched all of the above and they could put together a greatest hits compilation of some of the better super hero American fare? Probably. But for those of us who have seen these movies Black Lightning the name makes me cringe! is a Frankenstein cut and paste in many cases scene by scene steal of far better movies. It's b grade schlock made for an uneducated audience. Yes I'm being harsh. I enjoyed the movie for the first 30 or so Min's. It seemed fresh and interesting. Then at about the point where the car first takes off I felt this sense of dread. Oh oh...that bit looks like America's Greatest Hero...and that bit is Transformers...and that bit is Spiderman why am I watching this again?...never mind...it'll get better...and that bit is just like well you get the idea...And the flying Volga is actually more ridiculous than a flying De Lorean...I should say some kind things about the film...let's give this a go. The heavy metal Russian soundtrack is pretty cool. The girl in the movie is rather lovely but her flipping between the boys got old real quick. The special effects are not too bad considering it's a low budget film although they are cheesy and the surround mix is typically over the top for a 5.1 modern Russian film.At the end of the movie I felt disappointed and embarrassed for all concerned with this production. And Bekmambetov really should have known better!So if all the above disclaimers don't concern you go ahead and watch it. But you have been warned...".

A hero is a student then he gets some special abilities and uses it for his own gain until a member of his family is killed resulting in him fighting crime thereafter. There is also a rich friend a girl who goes for a friend first and falls for hero later... Not a single bit of originality in the plot. Even the famous scene of spiderman in front of US flag is remade. We see Black Lightning flying besides a star of Kreml. The CGI is very fake all the laws of physics are simply forgotten beyond the usual Hollywood standards. I can not understand HOW this film got so many positive reviews in Russia. Yes of course it has a love story and teaches people to care for each other rather than just themselves. But it doesn't make this movie worth watching. Personally I just couldn't help but wanting to rather watch Spiderman again instead... P.S. the flying Mercedes looks pretty much like flying DeLorian from Back to the future... Just a notice... P.P.S. the sequels have been announced... Batman and Superman movies BEWARE...".

	schema:reviewBody "I was absolutely amazed by this movie. It's spectacular it's funny it's exciting it's extremely fastpaced the main actors are cute and goodlooking and they really can act the special effects are excellent and the sound blows you outoff your chair. And guess what...?! It's Russian!!! Yip I didn't even notice it at first when I bought the DVD. The title was in English and so was the story on the cover. It sounded like an average lowbudget scifi that could be fun so I didn't look any further. The first 5 minutes I even thought that they were speaking Russian to give it some authentic feel and that the story soon would turn to the US or England. But when they kept on speaking Russian I checked the cover once again and it dawned at last. It IS Russian! Wow was I wrong with all my unfounded prejudices about Russian movies that they were probably all bleak and boring and that the special effects would still date from the stone age and that Russian actors would probably all look plain and talk incomprehensible dribble. I'm deeply ashamed and with this movie I stand terribly corrected it's simply great on every account. Okay the premise may be farfetched and a bit childish a young student accidentally gets hold of a terribly old car that's dug up from a ditch to find that it contains some extraordinary topsecret fuel that makes it fly like a starfighter the Very Bad Guy hunts him down to get hold of it while the student decides to use his car as some superherodevice to rescue people. But isn't that the same with movies like Transformers or Percy Jackson? In movies like this the story is just the frame it's the spectacular special effects that count. And in that department you will most certainly not be disappointed the CGI is absolutely topofthebill!Considering the story you would expect such a movie to be rather onedimensional just lots of action and maybe some humor to counterbalance. I know many movies where this is the case like the aforementioned Percy Jackson  amazing how so much action could end up as such a tedious bore! but here in Black Lightning there are actually more layers albeit  thank god!  not rammed in our face but nicely dispersed through the movie in a pleasantly subtle way. Like when our antihero Dima has to compete for the love of a girl and painfully learns that there are limits as to how far you can go. Or when he tries to accomplish a fortune by working so hard that he neglects his caring little family and has to pay for this with the knowledge that he was too late to save his dying father. Or the way he handles his suddenly becoming a hailed but anonymous superhero should he comeout in the open to impress and win his beloved? There are many moments of insight and warmth that give the movie something extra besides being a slick actionmovie. Grigoriy Dobrygin as Dima is perfect he is cute and handsome in a boynextdoor kind of way he's adorable as he stumbles through his infatuation with Nastya he can be serious and funny but he is equally convincing in his role as a vengeful superhero. Ekaterina Vilkova as Nastya is just adorable in every aspect and radiantly beautiful to boot. Come to think of it almost all the other supporting roles are played flawlessly the parents the cute little sister the arrogant best friend and the Bad Guy and the whole movie is filled with a fine sense of irony that makes you smile all of the time.Well just go and watch it and enjoy! And by the way don't put the DVD on the English sound which gives Dima an annoyingly highpitched voice. Stick to the authentic Russian track it only heightens the pleasure!".

An old Volga found long lost under ground makes the whole difference. This is pure entertainment Hollywood style. Rusdia has become a very large and important market for Hollywood movies and thus is a Paramount movie.Young student Dima which is infatuated with Mercedes cars. On his birthday he gets a really old Volga with the message that even president Putin has one. It looks like any other old Volga Gaz21. A strange nano catalyst is hidden inside the car something which changes Dima's life. His starts off as a flowers delivery guy but not for long.With some bad guys after him he discover the car's flying abilities coincidentally.In a way this film is much more charming than its American Hollywood counterparts. The film I was reminded most about when watching this was about a flying VW Beetle and I wouldn't call that a classic Chatty Chitty Bang Bang. Filmed in Moscow which is also nice presented I enjoyed his though it's not any kind if film art. More in the genre of Iron man and Superman. And very Hollywood clichd this is it's still more for the Russian market than for the rest of the world.".

Truly in few parts I actually felt my intelligence was in serious danger. Flying into space and not burning up nor obvious visible lack of air. Immediate control of flying cars on level which can possibly be achieved by advanced computer in a distant future. Sheep like behavior of people during ENTIRE movie that is just the bad acting. The hero had a lot of time to climb out of car climb into the car destroy walls and all without a scratch. Finally flying with device of power much greater than nuclear and nothing  this one made me laugh for some reason. I can go on for a long time...

I think this movie was incredibly influenced by Sam Rami's Spiderman trilogy which is a good thing.No idea what is wrong with movie watchers and some IMDb reviewers. This movie is fantastic. We now live in a generation where movies must either be Dark Knightish or Marvel Cinema Universe to be good and if not everything else is wrong. This movie is fun fun fun....Don't listen to the prissy little snot nosed know it all Millennials listen to a man who enjoyed Adam West's and Burt Ward's Batman listen to the guy that thinks Superman 2 and Spiderman 2 were the best hero movies ever. Listen to the guy who thinks Amazing Spiderman 2 was a very good hero movie.Black Lightning is worth a watch for the cheesiness for the fun for the story and plot. Very fun watch. The acting is pretty okay as the actors play their parts very well. It is different from American films due to the budget but once you understand that it is an enjoyable film.I gave it a 9 out of 10...bust easily a 10 as it hits all my superhero points.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film made an impression on me before I even saw it. I was in a theater and a trailer for Dirty Rotten Scoundrels came on. While a voiceover talked about the value of movies promoting morality and civility you saw Martin and Caine strolling along a beachfront smiling beneficently as they greet passersby. Then Caine shoved cotton candy into a kids face while Martin pushed a woman off a ledge.It's a great sequence and is featured on the DVD with its own commentary from director Frank Oz when has that ever happened before? but a little misleading. Actually while both men are scoundrels neither is quite that vile. Caine's Lawrence Jamieson is actually a bit of an altruist as we find out with a code of only taking in people who can afford to be taken and finding ways of spending the money that are not entirely selfserving. Martin's Freddy Benson is less disciplined and more smalltime in his cons he'll steal candy from a baby and tell you it's for his poor sick GramGram if caught but he is likeable too an underdog with little idea how the game is played at the highest levels but eager to learn.The fact you can like these characters is a compliment to Martin and Caine as well as director Oz and the team of writers. Tone is everything with a film like this and as Oz says in his commentary so important in making the comedy work. He notes he was going for a 1950s feel in the picture I'm guessing with Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief in mind. The great score by Miles Goodman is solid enough to deserve its own CD reissue with an air of light sophistication that buoys the proceedings on screen. Most importantly since much of the comedy involves people taking advantage of one another having everything put forward in such a gossamer manner helps you digest the story without leaving a bad taste.Martin shines in many scenes especially when playing Ruprecht the idiot manchild and when stuck in jail trying to remember the name of the only man he thinks can bail him out James Lawrenceton...no wait James Jesterton....no no it's definitely um... I knew Martin could be funny and with the exception of All Of Me this is probably his best comedic performance but Caine is a revelation. A straight man yes but with delicate timing and some clever characterizations that he pulls out of a bag like an Germanic psychiatrist with some unusual ideas about curing lameness. You forget how good Caine is in comedy despite his performances in films like this Blame It On Rio and Without A Clue. Glenne Headly is a revelation as the woman caught in the middle of Jamieson and Benson's scheming every bit as good as her male counterparts but say no more.Great actors great tone but the plot is the best thing this film has. It's a remake of a 1964 film Bedtime Story which teamed Marlon Brando and David Niven for what should have been a dream team but went flat instead. This time the script is helped by actors who can not only deliver funny lines but make them funnier and by an ending according to Oz in his commentary one worked out over several long dinner meetings with Martin that is simply perfect.Finally Oz needs to be recognized. He was only making his second nonMuppet film here but the result in my view is one of the best comedies anyone has ever done. He manages to get the best from everyone including the actors and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus some amazing night shots of the French Rivera waterfront you never tire of looking at and delivers a rare jewel of a film a laughoutloud comedy that leaves you with a warm feeling inside.Ian McDairmid plays Arthur the butler in this teaming him with Oz yet again. Almost titled this review Yoda And Palpatine On The French Riviera it's interesting McDairmid plays the one guy in Scoundrels who's really on the level.".

Martin's Freddy Benson is less disciplined and more smalltime in his cons he'll steal candy from a baby and tell you it's for his poor sick GramGram if caught but he is likeable too an underdog with little idea how the game is played at the highest levels but eager to learn.The fact you can like these characters is a compliment to Martin and Caine as well as director Oz and the team of writers. Tone is everything with a film like this and as Oz says in his commentary so important in making the comedy work. He notes he was going for a 1950s feel in the picture I'm guessing with Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief in mind. The great score by Miles Goodman is solid enough to deserve its own CD reissue with an air of light sophistication that buoys the proceedings on screen. Most importantly since much of the comedy involves people taking advantage of one another having everything put forward in such a gossamer manner helps you digest the story without leaving a bad taste.Martin shines in many scenes especially when playing Ruprecht the idiot manchild and when stuck in jail trying to remember the name of the only man he thinks can bail him out James Lawrenceton...no wait James Jesterton....no no it's definitely um... I knew Martin could be funny and with the exception of All Of Me this is probably his best comedic performance but Caine is a revelation. A straight man yes but with delicate timing and some clever characterizations that he pulls out of a bag like an Germanic psychiatrist with some unusual ideas about curing lameness. You forget how good Caine is in comedy despite his performances in films like this Blame It On Rio and Without A Clue. Glenne Headly is a revelation as the woman caught in the middle of Jamieson and Benson's scheming every bit as good as her male counterparts but say no more.Great actors great tone but the plot is the best thing this film has. It's a remake of a 1964 film Bedtime Story which teamed Marlon Brando and David Niven for what should have been a dream team but went flat instead. This time the script is helped by actors who can not only deliver funny lines but make them funnier and by an ending according to Oz in his commentary one worked out over several long dinner meetings with Martin that is simply perfect.Finally Oz needs to be recognized. He was only making his second nonMuppet film here but the result in my view is one of the best comedies anyone has ever done. He manages to get the best from everyone including the actors and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus some amazing night shots of the French Rivera waterfront you never tire of looking at and delivers a rare jewel of a film a laughoutloud comedy that leaves you with a warm feeling inside.Ian McDairmid plays Arthur the butler in this teaming him with Oz yet again. Almost titled this review Yoda And Palpatine On The French Riviera it's interesting McDairmid plays the one guy in Scoundrels who's really on the level.";

Headley as Janet Colgate meanwhile is a joy to watch and to listen to with that sweet voice of hers. I can't say more about her without giving away too much but she is not only the objection of attention in the movie but the key character. These three combine for almost a laughaminute.This also is a good example of how to make a modernday comedy without all the sleaze and profanity. There is some in here but not much.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Frank Oz landed the dream team from comedic heaven when Steve Martin and Michael Caine signed on to star in this hilarious comedy of manners and mannerisms Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' a film that manages to be entertaining without being offensive in any way and features some terrific performances and filmed on location in the French Riviera some beautiful cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.  Made in 1988 this film not only holds up well but seems so refreshing after a decade of American Pies' and other such fare featuring one witless forgettable talent' after another.  It's a reminder that true comedy can have sophistication without necessarily being sophisticated and that real humor is timeless.  This is stuff that was good when it was made is even better today and will have you laughing even harder at it twenty thirty or fifty years from now.Freddy Benson Martin is a small time American con manaspiring gigolo traveling abroad with his sights set on the Riviera specifically Beaumont Sur Mer which he understands is easy pickings for a talent such as his. Why on the train into town alone he bilks a compassionate young woman out of dinner and twenty dollars using the old I'msavingupformydearoldgrandmother'soperation ploy.  On that same train however observing Freddy's operation from across the aisle is Lawrence Jamieson Caine a big time con artistgigolo who as it happens lives in Beaumont Sur Mer.  And instantly Jamieson looks upon Freddy with disdain after all this is a man who has perfected the art of bilking rich young women for sums that fall into five and six digits by successfully masquerading as a Prince or some such Nobility who needs vast sums of money in order to save' his country from the Communists an unspecified opposition or whatever else will work.  Furthermore it's taken a lot of time and effort to get to where he's at and he's not about to let the unseemly Freddy Benson cut into his act.So with the help of his associate  a local policeman Inspector Andre Anton Rodgers Jamieson sets out to discourage' Freddy from attempting to get a foothold in Beaumont Sur Mer.  But Freddy it turns out may not be the unwitting amateur Jamieson presumed him to be Andre has just received word that an elusive con artist has arrived in the area a professional known only as The Jackal.'  And so the game is afoot a game that will ultimately bring Jamieson and Freddy closer together and involve them with a wealthy American named Janet Colgate Glenne Headly who will become the focus of more than just a little attention before it's all over.  it becomes a contest between the suave Lawrence Jamieson and the unruly Freddy Benson. And the winner?  Well by the end it's clear who the real winner is here and without a doubt it's the audience.Oz must have had a good time making this movie because he had all the tools available to him from the best of both worlds.  There's the broad physical humor employed and perfectly delivered by Martin and the subtle studied approach that Caine uses.  Their styles contrast wonderfully and Oz certainly makes the most of it.  He's put together some scenes that are beyond hilarious like the one in which Lawrence attempts tutoring Freddy in the art of being suave and sophisticated or when as part of a scam Freddy takes on the role of Ruprecht' Lawrence's incorrigible moronic brother.  It's in these scenes that Oz seems to give Martin especially some free reign and the rewards are substantial.  And it's definitely a joint effort on the part of the two stars Martin is funny but it's Caine's response to him that really makes it work.  It also demonstrates that Oz knows his territory and proceeds accordingly.Caine gives a performance that presents Jamieson as the epitome of charm and experience in the grand tradition of the likes of David Niven and Cary Grant.  This is one smooth operator and the fact that he lives by a personal code' that only allows him to bilk the very rich and only if they deserve' it enables you to like him for who and what he is.  He's not a guy who's going to let a mark sell the family furniture and car to invest in one of his schemes call him a con man with scruples.  And Caine plays him to perfection.Martin however is the one who really gets to cut loose in the role of Freddy and without question he does physical comedy better than anyone since Buster Keaton or Chaplin.  Martin can get a laugh just by walking into a room.  He invests Freddy with a less than retiring manner and takes it over the top in his guise as Ruprecht using his entire body as a vehicle through which he expresses this particular bit of lunacy.  And seeing him in action is an absolute riot.  As he did so successfully in his standup days Martin parlays a facial expression combined with the most erratic movements of his arms and legs into a visual image that can be indescribably funny. He's one of the select few actorcomedians with a true and innate sense of real comedy and moreover he knows how to sell it to his audience.As the seemingly hapless Janet Headly does a good job but it's a role that may have been more conducive to the likes of Melanie Griffith or even Diane Keaton either of whom would've given the character a decidedly different spin.The supporting cast includes Barbara Harris Fanny Ian McDiarmid Arthur and Dana Ivey Mrs. Reed.  Funny and thoroughly entertaining Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' with it's contrasting comedic styles and polished presentation is a minor classic in it's own right.  A winner from the Land of Oz wherein Caine and Martin are the reigning Royalty this is one comedy that will definitely continue to withstand the test of time.  810.".

	schema:reviewBody "American conning women for free meals and small change. Worried that this small poacher will frighten off the bigger game Lawrence tries to get rid of Freddy but like a bad penny he keeps coming back. A chance encounter with one of Lawrence's marks means Freddy catches on that Lawrence is just like him albeit on a bigger scale and he returns to the Riviera to confront him. With neither man willing to back off they settle on a gentleman's bet to fleece the first woman they see  with the one to pull off a successful con winning the right to stay and live well off rich women.With a twisty plot that is ultimately predictable this film is less about the destination of the story but more about the comedy of each scene. On this level the film works pretty well because it manages to keep producing consistent amusement from start to shortly before the finish. I say shortly before the ending because near the end the predictable becomes very obvious and I felt like I was waiting for the film to just catch me up. This is more or less the main problem with the film that the story is not that great but generally this is covered by the solid chuckles that it produced for the majority.The cast are a major part of this success and the film benefits from two good turns from the leads. Caine is perfectly suited to the role and does the comic aspect very well. Martin seems to be working harder which is funny considering how much like his other work this character is. He mugs frantically but it works because it is a fine piece of oddcouple comedy that works by contrast. Headley is enjoyable even if she is never on the same level as the stars. Support from Rogers and McDiarmid is solid and they both add to the film in the detail.Overall this is an enjoyable and light film that maybe doesn't catch fire that often but did generally make me chuckle along with its individual scenes. The cast are all good and the story conveniently doesn't get in the way that often producing a slick if unsophisticated film that will please many viewers by doing what it does.".

Worried that this small poacher will frighten off the bigger game Lawrence tries to get rid of Freddy but like a bad penny he keeps coming back. A chance encounter with one of Lawrence's marks means Freddy catches on that Lawrence is just like him albeit on a bigger scale and he returns to the Riviera to confront him. With neither man willing to back off they settle on a gentleman's bet to fleece the first woman they see  with the one to pull off a successful con winning the right to stay and live well off rich women.With a twisty plot that is ultimately predictable this film is less about the destination of the story but more about the comedy of each scene.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1964 Marlon Brando made the film BEDTIME STORY with David Niven and Shirley Jones about the battle between two rival conartists on the Riviera to determine who was going to be the local king of the racket in running the town. It was a good comedy but while it demonstrated as TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON had that Brando was an accomplished comic when he wanted to be somehow it was not as good as it could have been. Yet Brando Niven and Jones did excellent work in it.The film was remade in 1988 as DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS with the leads played by Steve Martin Michael Caine and Glenne Headley. The general feeling is that if the original was a good comedy the remake was allaround an excellent one.Brando's Freddy Benson ran a small congame racket pretending to be a soldier trying to get money for his grandmother's operation in the U.S. Brando would target young American ladies who were traveling on trains on the Italian  French border and take them for small sums. But he hoped to go after richer game. The richer game were targeted by Niven's Lawrence Jamieson who got large sums from wealthy women who were willing to finance a counterrevolution in a fictitious country he is exiled king of. Niven of course does not want competition. He tries to work with Brando for awhile but Brando strains at the restraint of his distinctly junior partner position. So they agree to a conartist test on the first subject that comes along whoever takes her for 10000.00 will be the winner. Along comes Jones' who they think is the heiress to a soap fortune and they go after her. In the end she is not an heiress and Brando and she go back to America as husband and wife. Niven resigns himself to the sad lonely life of the elite on the Riviera.SPOILERS COMING UP The 1988 version changed the characterizations a bit. Niven sees himself as a patron of the arts because he was not very good in any of them but now has the money to help support people. Caine does too but his interest is more controlled  more of a hobby really. He is an organized conman and he has set up a first rate system with his valet and the local police chief. Martin's Freddie is far dumber and sloppier than Brando's. He practices the same congames and tries to rise above that nonsense but he lacks any grace to do so. In fact he blackmails his way into Caine's establishment to become a gentleman conman and is kept only as an idiot. So was Brando but Brando was intelligent to see he was being wasted. Martin is just demanding.Certain things were improved by the changes. Shirley Jones was a total innocent who was brought into the Caine  Martin rivalry as a dupe. Glenne Headley's character is more devious as it turns out and improves the atmosphere of plot counterplot counter  counterplot that runs the script. It also enables the conclusion of the story to involve all three principals instead of just one Caine in place of Niven. And as it turns out Headley has as low an opinion of Martin's intelligence as Caine does even if they will be working together.".

Picture this it's not a blockbuster of the epoch like Titanic that everyone remembers well.The second surprise is that it should be in the late 80's or early 90's that it was televised once only by a local English TV channel. Thanks and praises be to God for giving us an amazingly created brain. Vaguely I just could remember a small part of the plot and some English words shown on the screen. With the great help of the awesome invention named internet yesterday I keyed in solely conmen card jackal and movie on the searching engine and swiftly I found its trail! Bravo.The third surprise comes to its popularity. From 1999 to 2004 people keep on writing comments on this movie. Its DVD release in 1997 and 2001 should have helped a lot.The fourth surprise is the sterling male cast. Steve Martin and Michael Caine! But how come I have forgotten them totally but Glenne Headly's acting not her name or face sorry sorry. The two men were not in my memory repository. I only remember their clumsy and ridiculous actions but not their names or faces.What I remember is an older dapper man of regal air poses himself as a man of nobility or of a certain European royal house. He manipulates the Americans' European royal family complex and cajoles a blond American lady woman into giving him a large sum of money by majestically telling her that he is going to get back his lost country and much money is needed for a coup d'tat. As for the younger chap in my memory he is nothing but a silly guy in many ways.It is true that some Caucasian Americans especially those living at East Coast where Europeans influence still has its way fall for Europe obsessively. The evidence is obvious. In Disney world many cartoon motion pictures are derived from European fairy tales or children literature where there are numerous goodlooking princes and princesses living in magnificent castles. Mermaid Cinderella Snow White Sleeping Beauty etc are all typical choices. When they are still young kids most Americans read about these stories day after day like cronies. In real world they cannot find these glamorous characters in their own hometown but the original lands of their ancestors Europe. Therefore it is normal that some Americans has a high liking for Europe they dream about it they fantasize about it.Talking about the relationship between the USA and each country in Europe the AngloAmerican AmerigoBritish? friendship cum rivalry is the most treacherous. The British envy Americans' money troops and technology while across the Atlantic the Americans desire the Brits' class tradition and customs. One dialogue in The Parents Trap where younger Lindsay Lohan plays the separatedsincebirth twins elucidates the theory. Hallie Parker the USA twin asks the neverseen Annie James the UK twin 'You wanna know the real difference between us?' Annie hurriedly retorts 'Let me see... I have class and you don't...' That's why Michael Caine can be such a successful conman.It is exactly Glenne Headly's acting makes the day and makes the surprising twist at the end. GH is endowed with great thespian flair but strangely she still hasn't had her day yet. She appears to be a goodnatured and innocentlooking rich American heiress who wins the hearts of both the young and the old conmen. Viewers may think Oh poor girl another victim of the scoundrels. Later the two guys find her downandout in deep distress because she is cheated by an unknown conman and helped him with all her money. She even tells her father's teaching that trying hard to help people is a virtue.Even the seasoned and very experienced Michael Caine is trapped by her perfect scheme and gives her monetary help. The ending is the most unforgettable. Oh! 'Diamond cuts diamond' what a game! is what MC's face tells when he meets GH again in their hangout a French Mediterranean coastal town. Leading a group of her potential victims tourists she is dressed in a nice suit sunglassed speaking Aussie English to the two men when they approach her Fellas last year I made three million dollars but your fifty thousand was the most fun.

	schema:headline " Not as consistently funny as I expected but mostly amusing and it eventually gets better";
	schema:reviewBody "This crime comedy released when I was only two years old didn't catch my attention until VERY recently around the time I watched Bowfinger for the first time in years this month. That film was directed by Frank Oz and features Steve Martin as one of the two costars just like this one. That was how I discovered Dirty Rotten Scoundrels a remake of a 1964 film called Bedtime Story which I've never seen. In fact I watched this 1988 film not knowing it was based on any picture that was made before it. I was expecting this movie to be at least slightly better than Bowfinger even though that 1999 comedy is pretty funny but my expectations may have been a little too high. For a while I was getting disappointed but fortunately this didn't last.Freddy Benson and Lawrence Jamieson are two con artists who make a living out of swindling rich women. After a successful operation Lawrence is on a train on his way back to BeaumontsurMer France where he currently resides. It is during this train ride when he first meets Freddy after watching him bilking a woman by making up a story about having a very sick grandmother. Freddy happens to be on his way to BeaumontsurMer and Lawrence thinks he might have competition if the two of them are in the same town together so at the station he tricks Freddy into staying on the train. However it isn't long at all before Lawrence sees his rival in town again and Freddy soon learns that the two of them have the same profession. He gets Lawrence to agree to teach him his conning skills by threatening to expose him if he doesn't. Their rivalry continues to the point where they make a bet. They will see which one of them will be to first to cheat a certain woman out of 50000 and the loser will leave town.Freddy is the character Steve Martin plays and Lawrence is played by Michael Caine. Lawrence is the first of the two leads to appear in the film. The beginning showing this character just before he meets the other con artist is not hilarious but sometimes mildly amusing and Caine already shows his acting talent. Freddy then makes his first appearance on the train and the first really funny part is here with the character telling the story of his sick grandmother and then making a massive order of food which his victim has promised to pay for. After this the movie is not always that funny but often is especially with the antics of Martin in scenes such as the jail cell one in which his character struggles to try and remember Lawrence's name. I didn't care much for the scene showing Lawrence talking to one of his victims before he introduces her to Freddy posing as Ruprecht though I did find the part where Freddy's mentally challenged alter ego is introduced funny even if some are bound to find it offensive. There also might be a lot of subtle humour which I didn't get. Still there are lots of funny parts and it gets better later on with Freddy posing as a traumatized soldier and Lawrence posing as a psychiatrist. At this point it gets funnier and also a bit more exciting.I already mentioned that I haven't seen Bedtime Story the 1964 comedy starring Marlon Brando and David Niven which this 1988 film is based on. Even though remakes are often inferior to originals I obviously don't know how these two in particular compare but I guess I'm not the only one who has seen Dirty Rotten Scoundrels but not Bedtime Story since this film seems to be more widely recognized today. I'm sure I will see the original someday but in the meantime I will say that overall this remake is a funny crime comedy and the two leads actors Steve Martin and Michael Caine are both very impressive in their roles even if Martin is the one who provides most of the humour. The supporting cast is mostly good as well. A lot of people probably like this movie better than Bowfinger and I can't say I'm one of them but I would say both of them are pretty funny and worth watching if you're a fan of the costars.".

	onyx:emotionText "This crime comedy released when I was only two years old didn't catch my attention until VERY recently around the time I watched Bowfinger for the first time in years this month. That film was directed by Frank Oz and features Steve Martin as one of the two costars just like this one. That was how I discovered Dirty Rotten Scoundrels a remake of a 1964 film called Bedtime Story which I've never seen. In fact I watched this 1988 film not knowing it was based on any picture that was made before it. I was expecting this movie to be at least slightly better than Bowfinger even though that 1999 comedy is pretty funny but my expectations may have been a little too high. For a while I was getting disappointed but fortunately this didn't last.Freddy Benson and Lawrence Jamieson are two con artists who make a living out of swindling rich women. After a successful operation Lawrence is on a train on his way back to BeaumontsurMer France where he currently resides. It is during this train ride when he first meets Freddy after watching him bilking a woman by making up a story about having a very sick grandmother. Freddy happens to be on his way to BeaumontsurMer and Lawrence thinks he might have competition if the two of them are in the same town together so at the station he tricks Freddy into staying on the train. However it isn't long at all before Lawrence sees his rival in town again and Freddy soon learns that the two of them have the same profession. He gets Lawrence to agree to teach him his conning skills by threatening to expose him if he doesn't. Their rivalry continues to the point where they make a bet. They will see which one of them will be to first to cheat a certain woman out of 50000 and the loser will leave town.Freddy is the character Steve Martin plays and Lawrence is played by Michael Caine. Lawrence is the first of the two leads to appear in the film. The beginning showing this character just before he meets the other con artist is not hilarious but sometimes mildly amusing and Caine already shows his acting talent. Freddy then makes his first appearance on the train and the first really funny part is here with the character telling the story of his sick grandmother and then making a massive order of food which his victim has promised to pay for. After this the movie is not always that funny but often is especially with the antics of Martin in scenes such as the jail cell one in which his character struggles to try and remember Lawrence's name. I didn't care much for the scene showing Lawrence talking to one of his victims before he introduces her to Freddy posing as Ruprecht though I did find the part where Freddy's mentally challenged alter ego is introduced funny even if some are bound to find it offensive. There also might be a lot of subtle humour which I didn't get. Still there are lots of funny parts and it gets better later on with Freddy posing as a traumatized soldier and Lawrence posing as a psychiatrist. At this point it gets funnier and also a bit more exciting.I already mentioned that I haven't seen Bedtime Story the 1964 comedy starring Marlon Brando and David Niven which this 1988 film is based on. Even though remakes are often inferior to originals I obviously don't know how these two in particular compare but I guess I'm not the only one who has seen Dirty Rotten Scoundrels but not Bedtime Story since this film seems to be more widely recognized today. I'm sure I will see the original someday but in the meantime I will say that overall this remake is a funny crime comedy and the two leads actors Steve Martin and Michael Caine are both very impressive in their roles even if Martin is the one who provides most of the humour. The supporting cast is mostly good as well. A lot of people probably like this movie better than Bowfinger and I can't say I'm one of them but I would say both of them are pretty funny and worth watching if you're a fan of the costars.";

I thoroughly enjoy this movie but I think I watch it solely for the scene in which Ruprect asks to use the bathroom first. That scene is so appalling as to make me laugh out loud every time I see it.

	schema:reviewBody "You can pick up two things from reading other IMDb users' comments about this movie 1 It's not for everyone so chances are you'll either love it or hate it and 2 The frequency with which someone adds a comment is slowly increasing over time.  Both these things lead me to imagine that Major Payne has all the makings of a great cult comedy in the truest meaning of that term.If I were to offer anyone advice it would be to watch the first ten minutes of the film next time it's on TV.  If the style of humour seems amusing to you settle in for the ride and you'll probably be laughing out loud a LOT. If it seems dumb and you don't get it cut your losses switch right off and do something more productive with your time that way you'll be spared an experience you won't enjoy.  It's really that simple in this case.Me?  I had thought from the trailers it was going to be dumb but it came on TV and I started watching.  Straightaway I was laughing at the narration Payne's excessively 'warey' attitude The sweet smell of mustard gas !! and his voice which you will also either love or hate.  The Apocalypse Now spoof had me hooked... I suspected it was going to be another one of those parody flicks like Scary Movie or Hot Shots but was pleasantly surprised at the way it panned out.  The story is bythenumbers cliched stuff but it is essentially played with a straight face  there are no winks to the camera. Yet it still works because even though they don't let on that they know you still know that the filmmakers are aware how cheesy it all is and in fact I think they are gently sending up all those inspirational feelgood movies without being offensive towards them.  This is achieved in part through Wayans' stand out performance and the blend of realistic Payne's behaviour towards his charges is apparently mirrored in some real drill instructors with ridiculous a 6 year old military cadet??!!  Also the director's use of music is inspired  consistently over the top at the right moment eg Respect to heighten the humour.Standout moments for me were the 'Little Engine Who Could' scene and Payne's vision whilst waiting at the station.  Already I would like to get a copy of this movie as there were many many quotable one liners I would like to see again  as I said it has the makings of a cult classic.  I would recommend it unreservedly to someone if I knew they liked this kind of humour to everyone else... 10 minutes is the cut off point!I should just add that although I was in the R.A.F cadets at school and have a brother in the British army a Major no less!!! I have not been through the 'boot camp experience' yet still found the movie to be very funny.  Bottom line though I can see it's not for everyone so use your discretion.810 for me ? 10 for you".

Payne's 'tough love' motivates the children and helps them to grow...but he also grows as a person through his concern for the children as well as a love interest. The children at first despise Payne for his tough methods but they learn to respect him. Payne sees emotion and caring as weaknesses early in the film but he learns to value those. We see that the kids can have discipline yet still be kids and the adults can be strong role models and be sensitive.Wayans's voice and high strung nature may turn some off but they truly accentuate his character.The film has a happy ending where all has turned out for the best.This is a film you can watch over and over. Very few of the jokes get old and you find yourself repeating many of the lines back. A fun movie that has appeal for both young and old.".

This movie isn't about a bunch of unruly kids making Major Payne's life hell but more like the other way around. The children try hard to get rid of him but their attempts are all futile. It takes a good three quarters of the movie before the kids warm up to the Major. It really is a bit too formulaic near the end but i still think that this is a top notch movie mostly due to Daman Wayans. This guy should be in more stuff. A really funny movie that is for everyone and just when you think it's going to turn sickly sweet in a couple of the scenes....well you'd better watch it to find out. 910".

Damon Wayans did an excellent job as Major Payne. He could have done spinoffs from that character alone. Then you add the kids and it wasn't so much the kids as it was how he treated them. You come to expect a certain level of delicacy when handling kids even if they are the most spoiled bratty destructive kids alive. Major Payne took an unexpected approach by putting those kids through hell as though they were in boot camp with Sargent Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He berated them verbally and physically... he even insulted the only deaf kid. There was no political correctness employed at all in this movie. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly only if the other Wayans brothers could make movies as good.".

You come to expect a certain level of delicacy when handling kids even if they are the most spoiled bratty destructive kids alive. Major Payne took an unexpected approach by putting those kids through hell as though they were in boot camp with Sargent Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He berated them verbally and physically... he even insulted the only deaf kid. There was no political correctness employed at all in this movie. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly only if the other Wayans brothers could make movies as good.";

There is no political correctness here just fun and humor that kids of all ages and my wife and I enjoyed.

W.C Fields hated to work with kids because he feared they would upstage him. Damon Wayans has NO problem here. I wish more movies were funny on so many levels. Have introduced my youngest who was not alive when the movie came out to the Major. He still talks about Mr Peebody. This is truly an under rated gem of a movie and fun for the whole family. Come on loosen up there is a place for Citizen Kane but there is also a need for irreverent humor and triumph over adversity. Be advised there is some foul language here but nothing that most kids don't hear on the playground or these days even at home. Laugh and enjoy time for reflection later.".

But I have to admit within a few minutes I was smiling and laughing despite this predisposition. I think the problem with the Wayans is when they get together they aren't funny anymore. But individually they have the potential to add to a movie greatly.So it is with Major Payne. Wayans' nasal speech pattern could have been intensely aggravating yet somehow it came across as just right. Neither too strong nor too whiney. The kids all give great supporting roles and nobody lets the film down.Another plus for this movie at least as far as I was concerned was its absolute failure to be anything like politically correct in regard to Payne's treatment of the kids under his charge. Too often these days we see movies that are soppy wet and dripping with syrupy goodness. It makes a pleasant change to see a film where that doesn't go on. Well at least for the most part. Payne does mellow somewhat as the film progresses but not to the point of a complete character reversal thank god.Highlight of the movie for me was Payne's version of the Little Engine that Could as recited to a six year old. The story starts off normally but steadily involves less and less Little Engine and more and more 'Nam tales! The way that Payne throws out the horrors of war during the telling is just hysterical.Of course it is a feelgood movie so you know everything will work out in the end. That doesn't stop you smiling the whole way through or of hanging on Payne's every utterance which are nearly always hilarious.I guess the movie is not for everyone but take it from me as an avowed Wayans hater! that this movie is worth your time. If you don't like it by the time Payne does his Failure to communicate! line then maybe it isn't for you. As for me well it's forced me to reevaluate my opinion of the Wayans clan somewhat.".

And the kids in the film do a remarkable job in their supporting roles. The kids in fact steal the show especially the younger ones.

I guess the first time I didn't mind the crudeness kids' swearing and predictable ending. I guess I didn't feel that this would be poor examples for other kids to see. Well I was wrong.Nonetheless to point out the good parts Damon Wayans was funny as Major Payne dishing out some genuinely funny insult lines to the kids. The strange way he talks was pretty humorous too. While the language is crude at times there are no fwords or Lord's name in vain.

I guess the first time I didn't mind the crudeness kids' swearing and predictable ending. I guess I didn't feel that this would be poor examples for other kids to see. Well I was wrong.Nonetheless to point out the good parts Damon Wayans was funny as Major Payne dishing out some genuinely funny insult lines to the kids. The strange way he talks was pretty humorous too. While the language is crude at times there are no fwords or Lord's name in vain.

Charlotte is a young middleclass married woman having an affair with an actor. She has promised her lover she'll divorce her husband but an unplanned pregnancy makes her question that decision. The film follows her as she attempts to decide between them.Like other Godard films that followed it MasculinFeminin 2 or 3 Things Made in USA one of the primary themes here is the extent to which a modern individual's life is manipulated by commercial culture and how it influences the choices we make. Perhaps because he had yet to fully mature as a filmmaker this theme is much less subtle here than in those later films. Charlotte is barraged with nonsensical beauty ads and Cosmotype articles about achieving the perfect breast size and in one famous shot is literally dwarfed by a billboard of the perfect woman in a bra. The height of social control is reached in the form of an absurd device her lover gives her that hooks around her waist like a belt and sounds an alarm every time her posture slackens. The effect of this visual overstimulation on her is pernicious. Like the magazine ads we're shown her thoughts heard in voiceover are fragmented and incoherent indecisive and ultimately meaningless.The other recurring Godardian theme appearing here is the commodification of the female body. To her bourgeois husband who represents the patriarchal tradition and middleclass status quo she's more an object to be protected like the records he brings back from Germany and exploited he rapes her when she won't make love than a human being to be understood. Ironically his unwillingness to forgive a past infidelity and his possessive jealousy only compels her more to see freedom in a lover. But unlike her husband who treats her like a commercial object her lover treats her as a sex object Is it still love when it's from behind? she wonders early in the film and seems interested only in her body. Her scenes with him are composed of tightlyframed shots of his hand stroking her naked body shots resembling the photographs selling stockings and bras in her magazines. Her lover literally sees her as a whole person only once when she goes up on the roof naked. Accordingly he gets angry out of possessiveness. Godard's dim view of the condition of modern woman sees her as unable to break free of her past her husband due to the selfsufficiency and humanity she's denied in the present. As she ages a woman's role goes from sex object to statusbased commodity and society teaches her that to think otherwise is wrong. This is a concept still ahead of its time today when violent oversexualized junk like the Tomb Raider movies are sold as female empowerment.As with most of Godard's films there are always several things going on at once and this capsule review barely scratches the surface. In the context of his career the film is best understood as an early version of 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her which he made three years later and is unquestionably better. By that film Godard had learned to synthesize his social emotional and political themes into one seamless whole discarding the artificial narrative conventions that serve him no purpose. This one while no classic is essential viewing for anyone interested in Godard's progression from brilliant filmmaker to serious artist.".

It's from here that we see a succession of images all of the body but never anything explicit a leg a bellybutton hands a back a nude front but covered breasts. Godard is inquiring about the form of a body in and of itself while also trying to find new ways of photographing it. In these shots which also happen again in this sort of physical poetry a couple of other times in the film illustrate something both absorbing and elusive about the film in general. It's about form and 'lifestyle of the married life and the affair of a bad husband and a tricky squeeze on the side... but then we also have scenes that puncture through the infidelity drama there's a scene where Robert the lover and Charlotte the main femme of the movie are sitting in a movie theater at an airport discreetly and one wonders what they're about to watch just before this an image of Hitchcock appears as if Charlotte sees it in the lobby and it turns out to be some kind of holocaust documentary ala Night  Fog. They leave right away. Too much of a shock or too much reality? How does the outside world affect these people?We get a lot of scenes of characters just talking to one another asking questions sometimes in documentary form. Whether it's really Godard off camera asking the questions and turning it into a docunarrative of some sort the old Bazinian logic taken to an extreme that an actor in front of a camera is still in a documentary of the actor acting on camera perhaps or the characters themselves is kept a little unclear. But this doesn't distract from the dialog and monologues being generally genuinely intriguing and moving even. There's one scene in particular that I shall not forget easily no pun intended when Pierre the husband espouses about memory and how impossible it is for him to forget and how rotten it can be for someone who has dealt with real horror he recalls a story as his character is a pilot of talking to Roberto Rossellini about a concentration camp victim and memory and that it made him laugh  again a very harsh contrast of Dachau and Auschwitz mentioned for interpretation. This and a few other times when characters just go off on something has a lasting impact. Une femme Mariee is filled with the sort of cinematic rhythm that would immediately say to someone unfamiliar with foreignarthouse film let alone Godard oh that's an 'arty' movie. It certainly is everything from its themes of alienated characters to its lyrical and original cinematography to the repetition of the Beethoven music later used in Prenom Carmen to image itself becomes an issue like when Charlotte obsesses over ladies wearing bras in a magazine it's all from an artist who expresses his concerns in a mywayorthe highway attitude to the audience. And you want to go along with him if curious enough to see where he'll take his trio of characters in the Parisian settings. Sometimes there's even weird dark humor like when Charlotte finds a random record of some woman in agony and it's the sound of a woman just laughing  something that Charlotte and Pierre listen to in silence until Charlotte wants to put on another record and she becomes like a little kid trying to put it on without Pierre getting in her way. What looks disjointed and without a plot is deceptive when looking at it in pieces. But somehow Godard's film works as a whole piece and it's part of the point to find this character Charlotte not easy to figure out. The men in her life barely know themselves. And by the end when it should be about the melodrama of a baby on the way Godard side steps this already dealing with it comically in A Woman is a Woman by making it about something else on the surface and underneath full of tension. Notice how demanding Charlotte is of answers from Robert about what it means to be an actor. He answers well and stands his ground but it becomes noticeable that it's not about getting answers on acting or real love but about this woman's tortured selfmade life. It's not emotionally gripping but it gets one to think and it's this that makes Godard's film special in his cannon of great 1960's works.".

As it opens we meet Charlotte Macha Meril at a tryst with her lover Robert Bernard Nol. Though Robert tries to convince her to divorce her husband the pilot Pierre Philippe Leroy Charlotte's loyalties remain divided.Godard labeled UNE FEMME MARIE not a film but rather a collection of fragments from a film shot in 1964. However this is much less avantgarde disjointed than one might expect. Godard chooses a fragmentbased means of storytelling for the moments between Charlotte and her lover presenting a sequence of brief dialogues between the lovers in rapid succession. Each of these selfencapsulated moments serves as another brick in the wall of what we know about the relationship. Such compressed storytelling manages to distill otherwise ineffable interpersonal dramas and feelings. The framing in the scenes between Charlotte and her lover is remarkable closeup shots of their faces or limbs against featureless backgrounds. Generally the face of the person speaking is not shown and we hear only the words.But while there had already been myriad such tales of love triangles through the ages this film offers something fresh by combining it with a critique of 1960s consumer society. The characters pepper their conversation with commercial jingles parrot whole advertising texts or recite factoids. In shots of home life the latest fancy namebrand cleaning products and electronics are placed prominently in the frame. Charlotte and her maid read women's magazines and see whether they live up to the standards of beauty that the media prescribes. The Auschwitz trials were going on at the same time as shooting and Godard chose to work references to this into the characters' conversations. In this way he underscores how consumer society emphasizes thinking about the present buying whatever is called musthave now and thus discourages selfreflection and critically gazing on the past. The film's message remains perennially fresh and I think many viewers will enjoy UNE FEMME MARIEE.Godard would take up the housewife and consumerism theme again three years later in 2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D'ELLE where this time the housewife prostitutes herself during the day to buy all the nice things that her husband can't. As a critique of consumerism that later film is more successful inasmuch as it was shot in colour and thus shows how commercial brands were using brash designs to draw the eye of shoppers. If you can't afford LSD Godard says in a voiceover there buy a colour television. However UNE FEMME MARIEE is not just a rough sketch for the later film and I'd even call it a better film inasmuch as it tells a coherent story while the elements of the later one don't entirely come together for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "To call JeanLuc Godard's Une Femme Marie a ponderous film is nothing short of the truth the film even at ninetyone minutes is a lengthy patienttesting endeavor. Yet the film captures remarkable essences of mood and emotion that are nothing shy of poetic and quietly moving. Godard once again resorts back to classic blackandwhite film in order to accurately and wisely capture the sensual moods of the 1960's rather than become wrapped up in petty detail.This is yet another Godard film that will likely be appreciated by many after the film is over. When enduring the film it becomes quite the challenge to stay intuned with it since the prolific titlecards frequent narrations and sometimes uneventful instances seem to do everything they can in alienating and turningoff a viewer. However after several hours or admittedly days contemplating a Godard film or keeping it in your head makes you warm up to its sensibilities and its techniques as if you just cracked or found yourself closer to cracking the film's code.The film's plot is a sentence long following the relationship between Charlotte Macha Mril and her lover Robert Bernard Nol despite having a relationship with Pierre Philippe Leroy as well with having a child with him in the process. Despite this setback Charlotte still spends much of her time with Robert doing typical things you'd find in a Godard movie whispering softly discussing philosophy getting romantic and simply enjoying the presence of each other.Once you get past the fact that the film is stripping everything you'd expect it to include down to very minimalistic ingredients is when your response to Une Femme Marie may be a bit stronger or perhaps simply unfazed. The film is a film of essences atmosphere tone and emotion captured in black and white to only affirm its details are shifted out in favor of a lessdistracting experience. Throughout the film we see Robert and Charlotte show affection for one another and also admire their own bodies. Of Godard's French New Wave films that I have seen up until this point Une Femme Marie is the one that contains the most controversial imagery by American standards in terms of nudity.Yet Godard's film is certainly not graphic by any means by American censorship standards even in the present day it's incredibly tame mostly using lengthy closeups to depict pastywhite skin. By doing this Godard creates a very intimate and sexual mood a common characteristic of the 1960's in France again catering to the idea that he favors capturing an essence or a mood rather than focusing on plotprogression and intense character development. This sexual atmosphere is surprisingly not arousing but more tender and appreciative of human anatomy something we're sometimes believed we are not supposed to be proud of.In the regard of being a meditative moody little drama with some raw feelings of emotion and intimacy Une Femme Marie does succeed and meshes nicely with Godard's other New Wave films. However the picture does become watery and difficult to sit through especially during the third act when things seem to take a more ambiguous road. Expect Godard receive Godard what you do and think after may vary.Starring Bernard Nol and Macha Mril. Directed by JeanLuc Godard.".

	schema:headline " A fragmented defining image";
	schema:reviewBody "What defines us? Or what defines anything for that matter? Is it a dictionary definition or our composite understanding that defines? A Married Woman Une Femme Marie is perhaps better understood with reference to its original title The Married Woman. Our opening scene is merely two lovers. A Man. A Woman. Photographed with immaculate perfection shorn of erotic or personal overtones each shot encapsulates the beauty and symmetry of an exquisite fashion ad  say maybe Chanel. Only after a few moments do we find out who these two individuals  impeccably framed by Raoul Coutard  are in real life. Assuming they are lovers yes but we find that Charlotte is a married woman. Her lover is Robert an actor.Just as 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her viewed the world through the eyes of commodification so does Une Femme Marie view it through the superficiality of advertising. The usual love triangle of a man and two women is turned on its head by giving Charlotte Macha Mril two men between whom she cannot choose. Her aspiration to be perfect is measured in terms of messages sent by 60's women's magazines and other media defining the 'ideal woman'  whose main aim it seems should be to please her husband. Charlotte measures the position of her breasts listens to a record on how a woman can improve her marriage it consists of vacuous female laughter and is expert at seeming light while keeping both men on the back foot. She sees herself as an object of desire by both Robert and husband Pierre and practices superficiality to perfection. She also however seems far from dimwitted when giving either of them a grilling.It is easy to become divided over this film. One can view it as trite a Godard castoff or one can admire the cinematic poetry the precision with which it delivers its point and its critique of the institution of marriage. It almost goes as far as to suggest that such emptiness is the lot of 'The Married Woman.' The title was changed at the censor's insistence who found the definite article disparaging to French women generally. A topless scene was also chopped. I love you too Pierre. Often not the way you believe but it's sincere. While men's underwear adverts are just plain photos adverts for women's lingerie are accompanied by unrealistic promises of what they will deliver in a woman's love life mostly of course in terms of a man's pleasure. At one point Charlotte is standing next to a gigantic brassiere advert and it is touchingly clear that society made the image more important than the individual.Each of our main characters has a monologue but we additionally hear Charlotte's internal monologue. When she has had sad thoughts she repeats to herself I'm happy . . . I'm happy . . . I'm happy as if the mantra will translate into reality. When she learns from the doctor that she is three months' pregnant to whom? her internal voice tells her Find a solution . . .. Save appearances. She continues to rely quite effectively on the character she has become now telling each man how much she loves him all the while skilfully testing him. It is almost as if primitive instinct to secure a hunterprovider takes over. Although Charlotte admits to the doctor she is scared she doesn't lose her inner composure even once in the whole movie. She might even be shouting but we can believe it is part of her dexterous womanish wiles  quite ironic given that she presses Robert to define acting and say exactly how it is different to real life. Only once does she falter tripping and falling in the road as she leaves the doctor's surgery. When I look back on a film that is almost devoid of real emotion it is a heartrending moment.Apart from intertitles and jumpcuts to juxtapose intertextual media with narrative other cinematic tricks include switching between positive and negative photographic images and superimposing summaries. Charlotte eavesdrops on two teenagers as they discuss what a man does during the loss of one's virginity. Salient point appear in small grey letters over the image for instance Je dors avec un garon perhaps showing how Charlotte reduces everything to its minimalist formula. For those that find the film itself as empty as the subject matter one need only to look at the extended references to Racine in Berenice where Racine similarly makes something out of nothing for a similarly helpless protagonist or Moliere who answered critics by saying that to prevent sin theatre purifies love.Perhaps Cahiers critic JeanLouis Cornolli summed it up best when he described Une Femme Marie as a film about a woman's beauty and the ugliness of her world. Macha Mril credits it with striking a blow for women's rights at a time when the pill was still illegal in France.".

To achieve this the scenes with the actors abruptly cuts to fashion photos make up ads and text. It's a stylish movie with a brisk pace but just like a magazine story it doesn't take long for it to leave the mind or heart either. Yes Godard's creativity may soar higher here than ever before.

Perhaps audiences are tired of 'boxing movies' 'Million Dollar Baby' sort of usurped that position for a while but this is not a typical boxing movie Fighting Tommy Riley takes risks all over the place and that is what helps make it so fine.Written by J.P. Davis who also plays the title role the story is less about Tommy Riley than it is about his trainer Marty Goldberg longestablished fine character actor Eddie Jones this is not a self promoting RockySylvester Stallone story fine as that films series was. For a first time writer and actor and directed by first time director Eddie O'Flaherty and cast with unknowns except for Eddie Jones this film is a 'knockout' pardon the pun.Tommy Riley is a young and gifted boxer on the skids disillusioned by his loss at an attempt at the Olympic trials an unfortunate lapse of selfconfidence that has destroyed his relationship with his girl Stephanie Christina Chambers and forced him to do menial labor just to survive. Concurrently we meet Marty Goldberg an obese has been trainer who left the ring because of a dark demon he harbors and has turned to teaching high school English. Marty lives with his dog Lucy in squalor surrounded by the many books he reads and quotes memorabilia of a ruined career and sleeping pills. His one friend is feisty Diane Stone Diane Taylor who Marty salvaged some time ago from her own downward plunge. Diane is a boxing promoter looking for a client. When Marty and Diane and Tommy collide the beginning of a vigorous training life begins and each of the three gains a resurgence of selfrespect.Both Tommy and Marty carry a load of baggage demons that eventually surface and as Tommy slowly builds as a fighter ready for competition Marty's devotion to the kid's career becomes more than professional and an unfortunate but inevitable encounter changes their path toward glory. With Diane's promotion Tommy gains the recognition of big time promoter Riley Scot Belsky and Tommy is torn between the promise of fame and wealth and his emotional commitment to Marty his initial impulse to go with Riley which is contingent on leaving Marty as a trainer is met with resistance until Marty humbly encourages Tommy to go for his career rather than his obligation to Marty. The result of Tommy's decision tells the story of the film and to reveal it would be unfair.Eddie Jones and JP Davis are absolutely superb is these very demanding roles. Rarely as a film about sports been influenced by the presence of sexual preferences and Eddie Jones handles this enigmatic characteristic with extreme sensitivity and makes us all feel his anguish at the slings that life has thrown his way. And the manner in which Davis finesses both the initial advances from Jones and then gradually alters his response in understanding Jones' behavior is nothing short of miraculous acting. Director O'Flaherty has created a brilliant little film from Davis' fine script and one can only hope there will be more collaborations as excellent as this.The cinematography Michael Fimognari and musical score Lee Sanders and Tim Simonec keep the mood of the film flowing. Bravo to all concerned not only for a fine story well done but also for the courage to focus on sub rosa sexual themes with all the sensitivity this film represents. Highly Recommended.Grady Harp".

In addition to playing the title character he wrote the screenplay and produced the movie as well. And he can act! On the surface he looks like an underwear model like so many up and coming 20's actors but this guy has a complete emotional vocabulary. Mainstream Hollywood should be at his doorstep. He completely inhabits Tommy Riley in a way that very few actors with the right look could ever hope to achieve. Casting veteran actor Eddie Jones was a coup. Jones meets Davis's intensity on every level and the two of them create a complicated and wonderful rapport. Jones in fact is heart breaking a character that so often slumps into empty sentimentality is rendered with honest reality.The film is directed superbly. The story is told clearly and directly. The gay subtext of trainer lusting after fighter is handled frankly sincerely and with a bittersweet truth. It exposes a sad case in our society straight or gay that older people are denied physical love at every level.This is a far more engrossing film than Hollywood hype favorites Cinderella Man and Million Dollar Baby. Director O'Flaherty has more talent in his pinkie than does Ron Howard and Clint Eastwood in their collective big buck bodies.".

I would dub this a MUST SEE film. Another fact that makes this movie a complete success is that JP Davis wrote produced and acted the movie. ALL of the performances were outstanding! And I do think that we will be seeing more of JP Davis as his career will soar very soon. This movie was absolutely a great film and I recommend it to everyone that asks me to tell them the name of a movie I think to be good. This is a for sure classic movie and I could see it being remade and rereleased in the future however I doubt it will be as good.

Therefore it should surprise no one that Fighting Tommy Riley which was all of the above made me sob.The backcover story is not what one would call original  in fact it sounds like a ripoff of the wonderful Million Dollar Baby. Old washedup secondclass hasbeen meets young wideeyed unstoppable readytotakeontheworld talent and together they make the perfect team which eventually carries them both to some kind of championship. It even has all the usual heartofgold character twists that we know from movies like MB  young talent is pursued by steelhearted bigwigs but displays unwavering loyalty to trainer trainer becomes the parent young talent never had and eventually unspeakable tragedy strikes. But this old washedup plot has found its way to a young unstoppable talent  writer and star J.P. Davis  and he has done some beautiful things with it.The performances of Davis and costar Eddie Jones are electrifying. Jones's monologue delivered by his character Marty Goldberg to the frank temperamental Tommy about why it's wrong to judge is a gem on the level of Ellen Burstyn's monologue from Requiem for a Dream. The cabininthewoods scene those who have seen the film know exactly what I'm talking about and those who haven't are in for a cinematic treat is also a thing of beauty put together in just the right way to wrench at the viewer's heart. Yet the movie manages not to preach and this in itself is a thing of wonder  when something is told from the heart it's hard not to get on the soapbox.This should be the point where I say that this disturbing and at times extremely adult movie is not for everyone and I agree that it will probably be lost on young children. It is for everyone else. You will fall in love with these characters and when it turns out that they aren't are? I actually figured out what was going on early in the movie exactly what they seem you like Tommy Riley will find it very hard to abandon them.The gentle upcloseandpersonal style of cinematography was welldeserving of this award it's already won and Eddie O'Flaherty's direction is the work of a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. The ending is a little hokey but not so much that it ruins what has already come.I once heard someone say that all boxing movies are great. Excluding all of the ridiculous Rocky sequels I have to agree with him though I'm not sure this is so much a boxing movie as a movie about men  REAL men not great epichero conquerers.

	schema:headline " Superb Drama with Excellent FilmingDirecting Techniques";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a superlative movie and I'll try to put any spoilage at the end. There are multiple themes interwoven in the script. The first and most important theme is that of redemption and of course the second chance. Eddie Jones is the trainer who is an educator and to some extent a rescuer of damaged souls. One of the surprises is that he needs rescuing himself. While set in a framework of a traditional fight movie it does have something extra. If you haven't yet had the privilege of seeing this flick stop reading here. I would say any spoiler begins here I don't generally go in for the gay experience in movies as it doesn't interest me as a dramatic theme or personally. Just a matter of personal taste. I don't give a damn about orientation except as it relates to fairness and decency to other people. It does here. There is a strong theme of love and trust here with the gay's place in a manly sport. It is this tension that provides so much drama and is so important to us all when we consider how we treat each other.Jones' character has an almost Christlike ability to repair another's broken spirit and it is his hubris for the purpose of the drama that his orientation has interfered with both his career as boxer and trainer as well as his own sense of worth. His selfsacrifice for his protg elevates this drama and gives it much of its specialness.The theme of love and selfworth are masterfully handled here. The secondary theme that love transcends orientation  that it should not matter  is illustrated well here. One's human obligations trump one's personal tastes somehow. I loved the trainer's sense of caring and him personally and it is one of the triumphs of this flick that Tommy Riley does too in his own hetero way. More importantly trust character and humane values are validated here as well.I was also intrigued by the art and techniques of using facial aspect to show different stages and struggles in character development. The ways the director and cinematographer use the visual effects of contrast in facial definition are notable. From the somewhat maniacal face of lust and personal struggle in the face of the trainer at one point to the final difference we see in Tommy's face itself at the end more mature seasoned and somehow stronger for the sense of love loss and yet redemption seen in his visage. A most striking way of making one's point. I give this film both my thumbs up.".

It is this tension that provides so much drama and is so important to us all when we consider how we treat each other.Jones' character has an almost Christlike ability to repair another's broken spirit and it is his hubris for the purpose of the drama that his orientation has interfered with both his career as boxer and trainer as well as his own sense of worth. His selfsacrifice for his protg elevates this drama and gives it much of its specialness.The theme of love and selfworth are masterfully handled here. The secondary theme that love transcends orientation  that it should not matter  is illustrated well here. One's human obligations trump one's personal tastes somehow. I loved the trainer's sense of caring and him personally and it is one of the triumphs of this flick that Tommy Riley does too in his own hetero way. More importantly trust character and humane values are validated here as well.I was also intrigued by the art and techniques of using facial aspect to show different stages and struggles in character development. The ways the director and cinematographer use the visual effects of contrast in facial definition are notable. From the somewhat maniacal face of lust and personal struggle in the face of the trainer at one point to the final difference we see in Tommy's face itself at the end more mature seasoned and somehow stronger for the sense of love loss and yet redemption seen in his visage. A most striking way of making one's point. I give this film both my thumbs up.";

Yes this is a boxing movie but it's also a movie about a personal struggle to remain professional and go beyond one's desires to do the right thing.At the start of the film we're introduced to the two main characters as each of them are struggling to find their place in the world. It's when the two are brought together that they find themselves improving their situations. Tommy becomes a boxer again and begins winning. Marty finds someone to focus on something to get himself out of bed for.Now here's the spoiler. Marty's got a past with another boxer who he made a pass at. That boxer outed Marty and Marty's reputation in the boxing world was shot. That's why he went off to become a teacher. Throughout this film Marty's struggling against his desires for Tommy which culminates in an incident that reveals Marty's tortured side to Tommy who tries to put it behind him but is never able to until the end of the film.Other reviewers are glossing over this key plot point of the film and saying that it never achieves anything similar to a Rocky or Cinderella Man. Those reviewers are missing the point. The film isn't about Tommy Riley becoming a fighter. It's about fighting the desire for Tommy Riley even if it means you have to force him to hate you so that he can truly achieve that which he deserves.This is strong material and Eddie Jones steps up to the plate and delivers without going over the top. JP Davis proved himself capable as both a writer and an actor. And the supporting actresses Christina Chambers and Diane M. Taylor made the most of the limited scenes and dialogue they were given.".

The second mistake was naming it Fighting Tommy Riley. This whole subject is tired and hackneyed. The element of succeeding against odds is a worthy principle but there must be a better way to do it instead of yet another Irish boxing story.The story is set in LA I think  how many Irish boxers are there here? Why couldn't the story have been about 'Fighting Juan Gonzalez' or 'Battling Hector Lopez'? At least then there would have been an element of authenticity. I guess it just doesn't have the same ring. So we're treated to an ahistorical account of Tommy Riley and his fabulous boxing skills with no accounting for his prowess or prominently displayed physique.After being found at a local gym by an agent and a washed up trainer and now highschool teacher with a penchant for quoting Melville Tommy agrees to be trained by the rotund Marty. Why and how Marty is such an expert is glossed over yet Tommy accepts his wisdom and becomes his disciple. Unfortunately it seems that Marty's weakness is not limited to selfdiscipline at the donut shop. His selfloathing is evident in the debris littered around his living room empty Chinese food boxes donut crumbs sleeping pills...The film tries to create a bond between trainer and boxer as all boxing films do. But Tommy has no past at least we don't get much insight into his past. And yet he seems troubled. He has a very attractive girlfriend who occasionally deigns to reprimand him for not opening up and not knowing where she stands. Poor Tommy grinds out his days on the loading dock and his nights at the gym. So Marty becomes the father figure and a jealous one at that. But he does get Tommy some fights and victories.When Marty offers to cook for Tommy you can sense that something is not quite right in his intentions. This is fairly early in the film yet I found myself wishing the inevitable would not happen. Marty's protective instincts for Tommy lead them to an isolated cabin in the woods for a weeklong training session. Ah yes father and son bonding in the woods sparring shadow boxing rubdowns quivering hands and... The ride back to LA is quiet.Tommy's wins in the ring attract the attention of a promoter with selfaggrandizing intentions as usual. But he can get Tommy a title shot. On the condition that Marty is removed from the picture. The wholesome and principled Tommy will indignantly have none of that but after a ride in a limo with his chick the writing is on the wall. Marty slumps home to beat himself up and hit the bottle. Of sleeping pills.Ultimately Marty's sacrifice was for Tommy's gain a notunmoving theme. But for weak dialog and onedimensional characters Tommy Riley might have had a shot. For me the boxing film Irish or notneeds to be grittier the way Rocky Balboa started out in a Philadelphia Catholic hall. Otherwise the whole theme can hung up like a pair of wornout Everlast gloves.".

And in this world the mix is as harmonious as oil and water. The problem with FIGHTING TOMMY RILEY is that it offers no resolution to the way the relation between Riley and Marty has until then progressed and the implausibility of Tommy not being aware of a speck of gay interest coming from Marty especially in the scene where Marty decides to massage Tommy is ridiculous. Even more implausible is how Marty later comes off as a male and portly version of Martha Dobie but the crowning achievement is how Tommy sheds not a tear at learning of Marty's fate and moves on.

Marty Goldberg is a fiftysomething exmarine schoolteacher who gave up HIS boxing aspirations due to some incident in his past. Together they are more than that.J.P Davis both wrote and starred in this hearty mulligan stew of a movie that's one part Rocky one part On the Waterfront  one part Gods  Monsters and one part Cock  Bull Story. As with any good stew there are also other flavors that we almost recognize but enjoy all the more for their ambiguity.It's unclear by the end of the movie who loves whom more but it is clear to see that straight Tommy Riley has a special place in his heart for the closeted homosexual that's taught him about boxing and about life.This is an easy film to be critical of. It seems to draw from many great films and yet is not entirely comfortable in it's own skin. Yet I think it's a success as a movie. It has a clear story line characters that we care about and the young boxer is very easy on the eye. Some will criticize the decisions that the characters make but they pretty much left me wanting to know more. Who was Marty's earlier protg and exactly why did THEY part company? What was it that Tommy's stepfather did that REALLY caused him to lose that earlier fight? Overall It's worth the time we invest in watching and pondering this film.".

As with any good stew there are also other flavors that we almost recognize but enjoy all the more for their ambiguity.It's unclear by the end of the movie who loves whom more but it is clear to see that straight Tommy Riley has a special place in his heart for the closeted homosexual that's taught him about boxing and about life.This is an easy film to be critical of. It seems to draw from many great films and yet is not entirely comfortable in it's own skin. Yet I think it's a success as a movie. It has a clear story line characters that we care about and the young boxer is very easy on the eye. Some will criticize the decisions that the characters make but they pretty much left me wanting to know more. Who was Marty's earlier protg and exactly why did THEY part company? What was it that Tommy's stepfather did that REALLY caused him to lose that earlier fight? Overall It's worth the time we invest in watching and pondering this film.";

What a bargain find and what a surprise. By the cover you think that it is just another so so boxing film with a muscular stud on it. The big surprise was the excellent acting of the cast the sensitive and deep script written by J.P. Davis and the top flight direction of Eddie O'Flaherty who managed to top off this film with only a 200000 budget. Unfortunately this film was overlooked by the Academy and fell between the cracks since it did not have any big bankable commercial names in it. The soundtrack and photography was also top notch. Apparently there was not enough money left to include any kind of Bonuses or Subtitles on the DVD. As said by another reviewer Hollywood should be waiting on the doorstep of J.P. Davis who still hasn't done much in films. Don't miss this film even if you are not a boxing fan which I am not.Claudio von Fresin".

Usually they suffer from that other variation of the indie 'rule of three'the one that says you'll get two of the following but never all three high production value a good story quality performances. Well this film to my surprise and pleasure does have all three. I was hooked almost from the outset by the look and feel of the filma tale of gritty survival on the mean streets of the prizefighting circuitand the performance of the main character who managed to take the stereotypical boxer against the world and add a measure of depth and emotion that was different from other similar genre constructed characters. The direction was stellar both in the technical aspects of camera movement and in the subtle emotional cues that sent the story spinning in an unexpected and refreshing direction. The writing and acting are very solid and Eddie O'Flaherty is a director with a very bright future. I had the pleasure to meet him in a directing class which is how I came to see his film in the first place and I was taken not only with his natural ability to paint pictures with words and description but his charming humble personality. If you stumble across this film in the video store do yourself a favor rent it and sit down and watch it. You will be impressed with the production value I have an idea of the actual budget but if you told me this cost over 1 million I wouldn't doubt it for a second the cinematography and the lush feel of a big budget film. The only reason you don't already know of this film is because of the unfortunate timing of it's releasesandwiched between Cinderella Man and that little film about female boxers starring Clint Eastwood. Sadly those two films covered much of the ground this film does though the story contained here is quite original and will take you on a second act turn of events you do not expect. The filmmakers should be very proud of the work done here and I look forward to seeing what is next on the horizon for Mr. O'Flaherty.".

Everything from the beginning to end just fall into the right places and especially I was impressed with the fact that dealing with a theme like this you can easily fall into common places situations dialog's and characters. J.P. Davis wrote a compelling human script much more beyond that any other boxing movie that I ever saw with the exception of the brilliant Million Dollar Baby. In fact boxing sequences you have few they exist but on a far dimension. The true battle here it's other loneliness redemption forbidden love shattered dreams commitment and honor are themes that J.P. unbelievable well explores on his own script. The performances are amazing and Eddie Jones just throws a show. In my opinion the fact that it's a very low budget production less than half of million helps a lot on the way that the movie portraits reality and also the way that he gets under your skin. Shoot on digital the rudeness and cruelty of the video make you smell the pictures on the screen and other factor is the absence of spectacular shoots crowds watching the fights technical sequences which makes you only care about the main characters and the way that they fight and act between themselves.

Washed up boxermanager turned English teacher discovers angry washedup boxer and former Olympic hopeful. Each has their demons. Each needs each other. Both start to blossom until circumstances test them both professionally and emotionally. Sound familiar? Adding a few doses of character study and melodrama to an old mix does not make it any less familiar and yellowing with age.I'm waiting truth be told for a new kind of boxing movie to emerge. The variations on Stallone have so little left to tweak out and even though I liked both this movie and Clint Eastwood's recent foray into the genre the attempt of each to manipulate and personalize the genre feels contrived often forced and derivative. Even the one part of this movie that seems significantly different that the manager is highly literate and even poetic somehow seems a bit stilted in the overall course of the film.Still the movie has some real power and even some real surprise. JP Davis and maybe I am saying this because he is exceptionally sexy has a real smoldering star quality about his performance as well as a few beautifully touching choices as an actor. His reaction to some darker developments in the story both as character and as actor seem just subtle and nuanced enough to be believable wrenching and even quietly surprising. After viewing the film I also realized that one part of the usual formula had a bit of a shift in this film while the main character certainly has his clichd meteoric rise in rank there are moments where he actually wins fights but shows bad form and is anything but coveted in the mainstream boxing circles. Most boxing films seem to make greatness in the sport all about winning knocking people out regardless of form and execution while this one makes a few very small steps to point out that a win is not all that is being looked at in championship fighting.Overall I had a good feeling from the movie and would recommend it. It left me thinking ad I always appreciate that in a film. I wish the manager had been less about pretty words and trite mantras however. I wish that there had been an ending that was a little less manipulative. I still cannot deny that I was moved and even quite thrown back by the writerstar whom I had never heard of and whom I believe may be a force to reckon with if the right people find him.".

However Garcia's role is pitiful and Cassel's role is ridiculous and this has to be his worst film since 'Agents Secrets'.. I'm guessing they thought the film would work as there is regular baring of flesh see reference to Mlanie Bernier and the odd pseudointellectual repartee about power and lust. The film tries to portray a message but unfortunately it was lost on me and the other dozen or so cinemagoers of which many didn't stay longer 30 minutes before walking out and it was the first night the film was out!!! This film deserves a place in the IMDb Bottom 100.".

JJ Annaud too could have make this story take off instead of sealing off narration in and around the almost Gallic village. Moreover I think the narration titles are ugly they do not make up for the lack of a comic chorus that would have bound the story together.In a nutshell let's say Minor is a nice character nice to a fault since the movie aims to keep the same comic pace all along while the story seems to require a change in rhythm.".

	schema:headline " A historical document about cultural socialism";
	schema:reviewBody "Kuhle Wampe is a classic German film. It was made in 1932 in the middle of the Great Depression and narrates an episode of the life in a workers family. The story was written by the famous German writer Bertold Brecht who at the time was part of the European labor movement since 1933 he temporarily move to the USA in order to escape from fascism. Therefore the film takes a critical perspective on the contemporary society. One of the main character is the wellknown socialist singer Ernst Busch. The film even contains several of his songs for instance the Solidatitaets Lied. So Kuhle Wampe may definitely be praised as a historical document. There are many shots of the mass activities by workers organizations such as the contemporary sport associations the theater societies and the political branches newspapers etc.. Their aim was to provide the unemployed workers with useful activities in order to prevent their moral decay. Personally I like the camera work which uses an attitude of social realism. At first the film was banned by the German board of film censors. Later a shorter version was allowed to be released but this decision was again reversed a few months later when the fascists gained control. The DVD contains the shortened version so apparently the original has been lost. Which is a shame. The actual story appears to be instrumental to the political message. Kuhle Wampe is a camping place for the expelled families. First we see the suicide of a young worker being desperate because of a lasting unemployment and his lethargic parents. It portrays the waste of resources in capitalism. Then the family is expelled from their apartment. Subsequently the young working daughter gets involved in a failing relation with another worker. She resorts to abortion. Here the message is unclear. If one wishes to criticize the film perhaps the abundance of artistic quality should be mentioned. Brecht wrote for intellectuals and his stories are never easy. Actually he had his greatest successes and achievements in operas for instance The Three Penny Opera! Also Rise and Fall of the City of Mahoganny located in the USA The Yessayer etc.. This is mirrored in the film where the dialogs are somewhat pompous or at least make an artificial impression. This classifies the film as a cultural milestone giving a profound insight into the life style within the labor movement of the thirties. This era has often been described as cultural socialism using mass plays chants etc. The greatest happiness was being a part of the harmonious crowd. This idea has become obsolete in our present culture which gives room to personal happiness. The DVD of Suhrkamp Verlag also contains the Dudow documentary Wie der Berliner Arbeiter wohnt The lives of Berlin workers and the play Feigenblatt fuer Kuhle Wampe. Have a look to see my review. If you are interested in social films you may want to look at all my reviews.".

	schema:headline " One Unemployed Less!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Kuhle Wampe was shown in America under the title Wither Germany? and was one of the last German films which embraced a utilitarian viewpoint. It was a true free lance film with thousands of members of such leftist groups as Labor Sports Union Worker's Theatre Unit and Worker's Chorus of Greater Berlin volunteering for the crowd scenes. Bertolt Brecht did the script Hans Eisler composed the music but the filming Slatan Dudow directed was forever running into difficulties because of the overt Communistic grounds the film took. It was banned because of it's negative depiction of the law religion and morals and was a very bleak film.Unemployment is rife and Anni Hertha Thiele is the only person in her family who has a job. Father is embittered and remembering a time when jobs were plentiful clings to the belief that hard work and politeness are the things employers are looking for. Mother has only old fashioned proverbs which adorn her kitchen. The son commits suicide taking care to remove his wristwatch which the family could probably sell and an elderly neighbour comments one unemployed less!!  but the family are too despondent to care.They are then evicted and move to Kuhle Wampe Germany's oldest weekend colony which as the title said in 1931 had 100s of people living there in tents and shacks. Anni had been told of it by her lover Fritz but when she becomes pregnant and her family insist on an engagement  Fritz's selfish nature is revealed. He doesn't want to be tied down so Anni moves back into town with her friend Gerda. There are some symbolic scenes  Anni's parents are discussing Mata Hari in all her lurid detail the high fees she commanded for her favours while in the background are pictures of bread milk and meat for sale at the same price as an evening with Mata Hari.The last part of the film shows Gerda and Anni's involvement with the Red Games  this has a very hopeful look. It is the young and the strong who are going to bring about change the people who will fix the world are those who don't like it. It doesn't have a lot of hope in workers as a whole  the older people are shown as set in their ways clinging to old fashioned ideals. The engagement party where did the money come from for all that food and beer shows the drunken carousing of the older generation  when Anni asks her parents to go back with her to the city they refuse and actually give solace to Fritz!!

	onyx:emotionText "Kuhle Wampe was shown in America under the title Wither Germany? and was one of the last German films which embraced a utilitarian viewpoint. It was a true free lance film with thousands of members of such leftist groups as Labor Sports Union Worker's Theatre Unit and Worker's Chorus of Greater Berlin volunteering for the crowd scenes. Bertolt Brecht did the script Hans Eisler composed the music but the filming Slatan Dudow directed was forever running into difficulties because of the overt Communistic grounds the film took. It was banned because of it's negative depiction of the law religion and morals and was a very bleak film.Unemployment is rife and Anni Hertha Thiele is the only person in her family who has a job. Father is embittered and remembering a time when jobs were plentiful clings to the belief that hard work and politeness are the things employers are looking for. Mother has only old fashioned proverbs which adorn her kitchen. The son commits suicide taking care to remove his wristwatch which the family could probably sell and an elderly neighbour comments one unemployed less!!  but the family are too despondent to care.They are then evicted and move to Kuhle Wampe Germany's oldest weekend colony which as the title said in 1931 had 100s of people living there in tents and shacks. Anni had been told of it by her lover Fritz but when she becomes pregnant and her family insist on an engagement  Fritz's selfish nature is revealed. He doesn't want to be tied down so Anni moves back into town with her friend Gerda. There are some symbolic scenes  Anni's parents are discussing Mata Hari in all her lurid detail the high fees she commanded for her favours while in the background are pictures of bread milk and meat for sale at the same price as an evening with Mata Hari.The last part of the film shows Gerda and Anni's involvement with the Red Games  this has a very hopeful look. It is the young and the strong who are going to bring about change the people who will fix the world are those who don't like it. It doesn't have a lot of hope in workers as a whole  the older people are shown as set in their ways clinging to old fashioned ideals. The engagement party where did the money come from for all that food and beer shows the drunken carousing of the older generation  when Anni asks her parents to go back with her to the city they refuse and actually give solace to Fritz!! Later when Anni is reunited with Fritz during the games she finds he has lost his job and the final sequence takes place on a train with an indepth economic discussion between the youthful workers and the bourgeois. Whenever Anni's group try to talk up the revolution  think hard forward never relax their opponents turn nationalistic and talk generalities.

The strongly leftwing messages from this movie make it no surprise that it got banned right away then. It is a blackandwhite film still but it has sound which was not a given by 1932 but fairly common already. Pretty much all the Nazi films afterward have sound many of them color as well. It is a bit tough for me to properly evaluate this film. First of all Kuhle Wampe is an area here in Berlin but I must say the term is really unknown today and people talking about a Wampe are mostly referring to a big belly somebody has. In general looking at the title this film is not half as impactful in terms of the Berlin areas it depicts and is about as I hoped it would be. Other than that I had problems with the film starting as a drama with a main character committing suicide but then the longer it goes it moves more and more into documentary territory and especially the last scene with the talk about coffee could be seen as 100 documentarystyle if the line delivery by some had not been that bad. This development also takes away from the emotional impact. It was really difficult to care for Herta Thiele's character or anybody from the supporting cast. Luckily the film only runs for slightly over an hour so it does not drag that much. Still this does not make it a good film either. I do not recommend the watch.".

In this film he plays Joe Kidda decent sort of guy but not exactly as superhuman as the man with no name in his Spaghetti Westerns. He's a lot like Eastwood in UNFORGIVEN because he seems not so superhuman except that he is a fundamentally decent person in JOE KIDD whereas in UNFORGIVEN he's almost like a multiple personality one nice and the other evil. The character Joe Kidd shows off his abilities here and there but he isn't the amazing man with a 6shooter as you'd expect from Eastwood eitherthough he sure does pretty well with a rifle or train you'll have to see what I mean by seeing the picture. So overall this film is very good but a bit subdued and more realistic than most of Eastwood's Westernsplus at under 90 minutes it's pretty short as well. One way I knew this was a pretty good flick was that my wife sat and watched the film with meand she hates Westerns.".

He's a bit of a lout himself especially in the way he treats his girl friend Stella Garcia.

Still he's one of the good guys for better or worse.I don't think Joe Kidd measures up to Clint Eastwood westerns like The Unforgiven or Pale Rider or The Outlaw Josey Wales.

Who's upset about the treatment his people have received in the land reform policies and he goes into town to show he and his group mean business.

After the highly significant cop thriller Dirty Harry he returned to the western foray with notso forcible results. Joe Kidd is what you can call one of Eastwood's lesser westerns but I actually enjoyed it. Maybe that's because I knew very little about it and I wasn't expecting anything revolutionary but I found this little slambang western to be an earnest vehicle for Eastwood which has a capable supporting cast in Robert Duvall Don Stroud and John Saxon and in the director's chair is John Sturges. With those names involved it could have been much more but it's not all a waste. I thought that it started off unusually and far from your typical Eastwood western. It's quite unpredictable and it's laced with a lot quickwitted humour but when it gets into its groove with the journey part of the story. Then it falls into a systematic pattern. There's nothing overly dynamic about it but since it's quite a short flick it goes by quick enough without any meandering sequences. We get an even amount of humorous wisecracks sturdy action set pieces and a steamrolling climax for the undemanding. The performances are extremely good as the main characters are very egotistical. Eastwood provides his causal persona in the lead role although this character seems to have a little more spruce and morality in his actions than that cynical edge we come to love. Duvall is influentially striking as the snaky villain Frank Harlan. Saxon is a superb character actor and that translates into his minor performance of Louis Chama. Don Stroud Paul Koslo and Stella Garcia were more than decent too.The consciousness story by Elmore Leonard is rather weakly drawnup with very little in the way development and little to pushy in it's unjustifiable moral high ground. Although I loved the ironic judge jury and executioner symbolism that fate has instored for the main villain. Sturges' direction won't blow you away but it was a competent display and he manages to incorporate the sublime backdrop of the High Sierras with on spot open location photography. There are many wellplaced angle shots and leeway in its execution. Another facet that was surprising was Lalo Schifrin's distinctively pulsating score that's never overpowering but it was always there.You might forget all about this western after a day or two but with these class people involved in this production just expect some captivating light entertainment. I found it satisfying enough but Eastwood would go onto better things a year later with the cruel spellbinding High Plains Drifter.".

	schema:headline " Not The Usual Eastwood Bloodbath . . .";
	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood scenarist Elmore Leonard and director John Sturges teamed up to make this traditional actionpacked horse opera about racial injustice in the old West. Joe Kidd ranks as Eastwood's least appreciated western. Nevertheless it is a solid wellmade shoot'em up with spectacular scenery enhanced by Bruce Surtees' pictorially elegant widescreen cinematography and a wellrounded firstclass supporting cast including Robert Duvall John Saxon Don Stroud Paul Koslo and Gregory Walcott. Mission Impossible composer Lalo Schifrin's orchestral score delivers atmosphere and ramps up suspense without calling attention to itself. Schifrin is the flip side of the coin to Sturges' traditional composer Elmer Bernstein who always brought a thunderous largerthanlife Aaron Copland quality to his westerns chiefly The Magnificent Seven and The Hallelujah Trail. Indeed Bad Day at Black Rock helmer John Sturges has crafted a modest little dustraiser that gives Clint Eastwood his least pretentious but most masculine role while Duvall makes a worthy adversary with Saxon as the victimized Hispanic caught in the crossfire. Elmore Leonard of Hombre and 310 to Yuma delivers his usual brand of quirky dialogue that has an improvisational spontaneity. Joe Kidd isn't the kind of oater that makes a big impression. It lacks the offbeat imagination of High Plains Drifter the stolidity of Hang'em High the abrasive violence of Leone's Spaghetti western trilogy the epic grandeur of Eastwood's own Outlaw Josey Wales or the funereal Bergmanesquire histrionics of Eastwood's Pale Rider and Unforgiven. Watching Joe Kidd is like eating ham on rye and washing it down with a light beer. You'll enjoy it but you'll probably forget it until somebody prompts you to comment about it and because it is so fluid you'll dismiss as adequate but less than memorable. If you do remember Joe Kidd you'll remember it as the western where Clint Eastwood wields an automatic German Mauser pistol and crashes a locomotive through a saloon.Joe Kidd unfolds with a long shot of a Mexican woman Helen Stella Garcia driving a buckboard across a rockstrewn landscape. Schifrin's music is lowkey and ominous. As the introductory credits appear several Mexican horsemen drift into Sinola from various directions dismount and casually loiter here and there. Unarmed they seem initially unremarkable. As several more Mexican riders appear and the music mounts insistently all these Mexicans converge on Helen's wagon in a back lot. They uncover a pile of guns and arm themselves. Meanwhile Sheriff Bob Mitchell Gregory Walcott of Midway leaves the courthouse as the judge explains to the mostly Hispanic audience why their land claims cannot be recognized as valid. At the jail the deputies bring coffee and a pot of stew to the prisoners for breakfast. Ramon Ron Soble of True Grit and Naco Pepe Callahan of Mackenna's Gold share the cell with Joe Clint Eastwood who wears city duds and a derby. Mitchell arrested Joe for drunk and disorderly and handcuffed him to the bed. Naco slides Joe's coffee out of reach. Later Joe slings the pot of slew in Naco's villainous face and then clobbers him with pot.Luis Chama John Saxon of Enter the Dragon invades the courthouse with his men seizes land property deeds from the records and sets them ablaze because his forefathers were treated similarly. Chama wants to take the judge as a hostage but Joe thwarts him. Another amusing scene takes place when Joe waits in a bar for Naco. Naco enters and Joe raises a doublebarreled shotgun with one hand. Naco turns to leave but then bursts back into the saloon as Joe triggers the shotgun. This is a signature scene that Leonard used in his novel Valdez Is Coming. Chama hightails it out of Sinola and Joe winds up serving 10 days because he refused to pay the 10 fine for poaching a mule deer on Indian reservation lands. He also resisted arrest because The day after the ruckus Harlan Robert Duvall of The Godfather and his entourage including Elma Lynne Marta Roy Gannon Paul Koslo Lamarr Simms Don Stroud of Coogan's Bluff and Olin Mingo James Wainwright step off the train and settle into the hotel run by Dick Van Patten.Not long after Kidd hires on to guide Harlan and company into rough country in pursuit of Chama he discovers that Harlan has no qualms about killing Chama. At one point Harlan takes an entire village hostage and threatens to five people if Chama doesn't give himself up. Harlan fires Kidd and packs him into the church with the rest of the hostages. The village priest smuggles a revolver to Kidd and he escapes with Helen and they find Chama. Kidd defies the odds and takes Chama back to Sinola but Harlan doesn't give up so easily and Joe Kidd concludes with a gunfight. The last scene when Kidd guns down Harlan in the same courtroom epitomizes Kidd's character. He is seated in the judge's chair so he amounts to judge jury and executioner.Characterization is integrated into the action so that the entire film becomes a fastmoving tightlyknit story without one extraneous character or event. Every action that Kidd performs in the opening sequence foreshadows his later behavior. Rescuing the judge from Chama's men compares with Kidd's decision to bring in Chama before Harlan's men kill innocent Mexicans. The remorse that Kidd displayed in the courtroom or tried to conceal with his admission later that he made a poor judgment with which he must live. This philosophy reveals Kidd's character. He accepts life in terms of good and poor judgments and lives with them. He is not proud of his mistakes but he wastes no sentiment on them. Throughout the opening scenes Sturges strongly characterizes Kidd as a man of unruffled nonchalance. Sturges wrote me in a 1978 letter There are a lot of holes in Joe Kidd. Some in the script that were never fixed and some resulting from cuts made because scenes just didn't play.Altogether Joe Kidd qualifies as an underrated oater.".

There are two sides in the argument the Mexican side are led by charismatic Luis Chama John Saxon and the US side are led by wealthy landowner Frank Harlan Robert Duvall.

Also starring Don Stroud as Lamarr Simms Stella Garcia as Helen Sanchez James Wainwright as Olin Mingo Paul Koslo as Roy Gannon and Gregory Walcott as Sinola County Sheriff Bob Mitchell.

It just lacked certain elements that made some of Clint's other western films great. The part that I liked was how it's difficult to choose a side for a while. Sometimes the movie seemed to try a bit too hard to show how short tempered and badass the main protagonist is while also having some moral ethics. Although it can sometimes be cool to see the effects of his short temper. Some aspects of this film just seemed a bit forced and although it's a decent western not much really stood out. In fact it seemed more like a western TV show episode than a actual movie. Besides the fact that this movie has two great actors Clint Eastwood and Robert Duvall.6.410".

This time round Clint plays the title role  an individualist of course and one with a sense of justice not unlike Dirty Harry where Joe Kidd differs is that he has no truck with the law and prefers the hunter's life on the range.Which in turn causes him to wind up in jail because in the opener we find Joe in jail having been charged with hunting deer on reservation land. After being summarily fined 10 and deciding to work out the fine in jail instead the court proceedings are interrupted by a large band of Mexicans desperately seeking justice about land claims in the area.During the subsequent shooting melee when the Mexicans attempt to kidnap the county judge Joe takes the initiative and gets the judge safely away and out of harm. After the bandits run Joe settles down to work off his jail term of ten days  only to be hauled out of that predicament by Robert Duvall's nasty business tycoon Frank Harlan who wants to hunt down with his own band of killers the leader of the Mexican band Luis Chama as portrayed by John Saxon.Thereafter follows an inventive narrative and denouement as written by one of America's best writers Elmore Leonard involving a hunt to the high sierras and a Mexican standoff  and a Mexican standoff  between the Mexican bandits the American bounty hunters and finally Joe who escapes the clutches of the bounty hunters to try to persuade Chama to plead his case in a court of law.To say more would ruin the plot for you. Clint does his usual laconic ironfisted turn with revolver rifle and now pistol  an automatic German C96 Mauser no less the setting is in 1897 or so and that pistol began production in 1896. Robert Duvall is suitably slimy and duplicitous hell bent on killing whomever he wishes to get his way perhaps a bit of a parody of bad guy but what the hey! The real parody however is Don Stroud as Lamarr the gunman who just can't behave while Joe Kidd is around. While John Saxon's Mexican bandit Luis Chama is sympathetically done.The setting is simply and starkly beautiful  snow capped peaks in the sierra the undulating plain a frontier town rocky outcrops a small village with the inevitable church and bell tower which plays an important and somewhat comedic part in the battle between the competing bands. Director Sturges certainly took advantage of the natural splendor to make this film all that more enjoyable.As always though my criticism with Hollywood Westerns made from the fifties to the seventies generally is that the characters are way too clean these were rough conditions dirty times filthy streets. I know there were exceptions but that just proved the rule. Eastwood's Unforgiven 1995 Jamurschs' Dead Man 1996 or Cimino's Heaven's Gate 1992 redressed that aspect very nicely however.For 84 minutes you'll enjoy a good story well acted and with appropriate action. See it if you can. Recommended for all.".

Eastwood's Unforgiven 1995 Jamurschs' Dead Man 1996 or Cimino's Heaven's Gate 1992 redressed that aspect very nicely however.For 84 minutes you'll enjoy a good story well acted and with appropriate action. See it if you can. Recommended for all.";

Even good visually interesting directors a company Eastwood did not join until much later in his career have been able to do nothing with Bruce Surtees.

Twisted loyalties abound too who will he support... Some Mexican revolutionaries who have been cheated out of land or a tycoon and his men who are willing to shoot innocent people to get their hands on them? Hmm... I don't think I'll need Ask The Audience for this one...Clint's screen presence is as palpable as ever even when the rest of the plot is just going through the motions. The highlight is the hijacking of a train which crashes through some suspiciously thin wood so Eastwood can get at some evil guys in a saloon aside from that it's all rather generic. That's not to say it's bad but it's hardly going to join his pantheon of Western classics like The Good The Bad And The Ugly or Unforgiven. Still perfect for a Sunday afternoon. After a full roast of course. 610".

You can't hurt him and you can't outsmart him. In this one he doesn't play unnamed stranger . His Joe Kidd is an exbounty hunter caught in the war about property. The villain is played by Robert Duvall. It's a fine performance. Lalo Schiffrin  famous for Mission impossible theme  gives this movie some really cool music. There is some nice dialogue here. The movie isn't boring  because it's short not even full 1hour and half and well paced. There is some action and two memorable scenes  with the train and the pot of stew.Overall  it's nothing spectacular . If you're a fan of Eastwood or westerns you probably will be happy . The rest might skip this one. I give it 610.".

Quite distinctly different from his Boss Spearman character in Open Range which I enjoyed a lot and one of my favorite Westerns. I'd have to say he's one of my favorite modern day actors along with Eastwood and between them they have over a century of staying power in film.So it's not one of the best Westerns ever made but fans of the principals should come away fairly satisfied with this one. Some of the situations defy credibility like Joe knocking out a henchman with a swinging cauldron but you have to admit it was pretty creative. As was driving a train smack through a saloon.

His documentaries always have a way of moving me be it in the passion and determination in the people he studies like Dr Graham Dorrington and Timothy Treadwell or in the sense of awe inspired by the environments he focuses on like in Encounters at The End of The World and this one was no different right from the start I was overcome with the beauty of the caves and the drawings on the walls.The context and hypotheses given by the interviewees only helps to deepen the sense of wonder as each section of the cave is discussed in turn by everyone from the chief scientist to art historians to a master perfumer and in typical Herzog fashion many of them are quite eccentric and add some humorous touches along the way. Throughout the film these specialists along with Herzog's narration really set your mind racing and I went to bed last night still thinking about the cave's mysteries.The sign of a good film is never wanting it to end and during his last visit to the cave the film fades to black a number of times each time left me praying that we were going to be allowed to see just a bit more. Films like this help to open your eyes and remind you that outside the boring drudgery of our 95 existence there is a whole world of beauty and mystery for us to explore and by leaving us with the allegorical example of crocodiles living in a nearby artificial tropical habitat Herzog leaves you asking questions about the way we lead our modern life that will last long after you've left the cinema.".

There is not much science here or much information about the people that left these paintings. What did they look like? What were their habits? Have similar paintings been found? This documentary should've been half as long given the sparse information provided.Instead you get Werner Herzog the writerdirector talking pretentious dribble about spirits and how the scientists supposedly want to leave the cave after a few hours because they feel they're being watched by the original inhabitants. I highly doubt the scientists said that. At one point he tells all the scientists to stop talking so that we can listen to the sound of the cave and maybe hear our own heartbeats. Yeah Werner why don't we all hold hands and say a prayer too? Anyway instead of hearing a couple water droplets if anything he instead plays grating violincello music on the film for two minutes over the top of images from the cave. So much for listening to the silence. Oh and then he inserts a sound effect of a heartbeat facepalm.Not only that but Werner Herzog's film direction is awkward and embarrassing for the people he interviews he does this in his other documentaries as well. You know that awkward moment after everyone has laughed at a joke and there's a lull in the conversation? Or after someone is done talking to the camera they get this look on their face like So are you done filming?  Well Werner makes sure you see those sorts of moments. Or he'll have his subjects just stare at the camera while holding a photo or something. It's extremely unflattering to the people interviewed.Oh yeah and he interviews some perfumer yes that's right a guy that makes perfume and this guy goes around smelling cracks in rocks to see if he can smell other parts of the cave. Here I am begging for some genuine science and he's interviewing fruitcakes.Seriously you will wish NOVA History or NatGeo got the rights to film this cave instead. A documentary by those groups would've been far more informative.The only reason to watch this is to see images of the cave.

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie  I mean I was just enchanted. It was everything I'd hoped it would be and more. My friends whined about this and that  the music was discordant the camerawork was too shaky what was the deal with the albino crocodiles etc. etc. and so forth. Bleh. What do they know? Werner Herzog has filmed a 3D documentary at Chauvet Cave in southern France location of the oldest known artwork on the planet. Surely you've seen pictures? The cave walls are covered with prehistoric renderings of bison and bears and lions and horses and woolly rhinoceroses and more  all drawn in a similar style over 30000 years ago with the sure hand of accomplished artists skilled in techniques of shading and placement and composition. Astonishingly while these days we seem to move from realism to impressionism to cubism to whateverism at the drop of a decade scientists seem certain that some of the stylistically identical Chauvet Cave images were created as much as 5000 years apart.And what wonderful images they are! Even on the pages of the National Geographic the lions roar ferociously and the horses neigh in terror and the rhinoceroses battle to the death while the bison gallop away in a prehistoric stampede.

My friends whined about this and that  the music was discordant the camerawork was too shaky what was the deal with the albino crocodiles etc. etc. and so forth. Bleh. What do they know? Werner Herzog has filmed a 3D documentary at Chauvet Cave in southern France location of the oldest known artwork on the planet. Surely you've seen pictures? The cave walls are covered with prehistoric renderings of bison and bears and lions and horses and woolly rhinoceroses and more  all drawn in a similar style over 30000 years ago with the sure hand of accomplished artists skilled in techniques of shading and placement and composition. Astonishingly while these days we seem to move from realism to impressionism to cubism to whateverism at the drop of a decade scientists seem certain that some of the stylistically identical Chauvet Cave images were created as much as 5000 years apart.And what wonderful images they are! Even on the pages of the National Geographic the lions roar ferociously and the horses neigh in terror and the rhinoceroses battle to the death while the bison gallop away in a prehistoric stampede.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie over the weekend and it was really one of the most amazing and bizarre things I've ever seen. Werner Herzog takes a tiny camera crew into the famous Chauvet caves in France giving us a glimpse of the amazingly preserved cave paintings I've only seen in text books up 'til now. Audiences get to view en masse a very famous location that they will almost certainly never be able to see in person because of the tight restrictions put in place by the French government to protect its pristine condition. And better yet if you see it in the theater like I did you can see it in 3D. This sounds like a really cheesy gimmick but I assure you that the effect really enhances the experience allowing us to really appreciate how the painters incorporated the natural curves of the wall into their drawings.All this is pretty cool. But then we have to endure Werner Herzog's own particularly zany presentation of the material. He's got a pretty big reputation as a director but I get the feeling he's getting a bit more eccentric as he ages. First of all the film is about fifty percent too long. Everyone in the audience was squirming in their seats at about the sixtyminute mark. I understand that one's film needs to be a certain length in order for it to be taken seriously as a feature film and Herzog achieves this length in one of the most amusing and tedious ways possible. There's only so much footage you can show of the actual cave and the art inside before the footage starts to become a bit redundant. So Herzog calls in a fleet of various experts to weigh in and comment on various aspects of the cave. He's tracked down an assortment of the most delightfully odd local crackpots. There's an experimental archaeologist who gets into the sciency mood by dressing up in anachronistic and geographically inaccurate fur pelts. There's the master perfumerspelologer who looks for new caves by sniffing cracks in the ground for that cavey smell. The vintneranthropologist who enjoys speculating on Paleolithic behavior and mythology and favors historical reenactments. And all these experts are pretty visibly pleased with themselves grinning into the camera after giving us little demonstrations of their science. It's all pretty endearing. And these characters are all so very French.The images of the cave are all pretty amazing. We really get to appreciate how perfectly the artwork has been preserved with the cave being sealed off for so many thousands of years. We can almost ignore all the strange authorities Herzog has marching through the film at such regular intervals. But the tone of the movie was finally set in my mind by Herzog's wonderfully insane postscript. It's a meditation on humanity and culture nuclear power and albino alligators. The moral conclusions he draws are pretty questionable and the science is pure quackery. All you can really do is sit there with that wideeyed stare wondering if this guy is really serious or if he's playing some big joke. Either would kind of be wonderful but of course for very different reasons.".

I'd urge you to see this somewhere with top quality projection and sound.This is a film about some French caves that contain paintings and markings made up to 32000 years ago. Herzog documents the difficulties in viewing these astonishing sights and the further problems in filming them. As he seems to be able to do in any situation Werner finds the most interesting possibly obsessed and eccentric people to help illustrate the remarkable nature of this cave network.The film is in 3D. A special 3D camera was made due to the constricted nature of the caves and the early part of the film was shot on a nonprofessional camera. A few reviews have complained of noise from low light dancing in 3D before their eyes. I saw none of this at all  in fact the 3D was really well handled and didn't detract from the subject matter at all. The undulation in the rocks are part of the paintings  the people that painted them used the contours as the shape of the things they drew. All that said I don't know how well the 3D will translate to the small screen.The sound is entrancing. The score is haunting and majestic much like the French scenery we see and swoop over. A few people have complained of the heartbeat noise that is heard over the silence that we're told to experience but I felt it worked well even on the second occurrence.There are some odd moments keeping to Herzog's style including a crocodileinfested biosphere on the Rhone which Herzog uses to describe the human impact on the environment in the area around the caves. A few of the caveinvestigating scientists are odd too but I imagine the Bavarian director's questions often create an impression of abnormality in the sanest of subjects. Some of the interviews reminded me of The White Diamond or the friends of Tim Treadwell in Grizzly Man.I'm delighted to have seen a Herzog film on the big screen and felt that this was the equal of Encounters or Grizzly Man. It doesn't have the edgy feel of La Soufriere but that's to its credit. Go see it if you can but make sure it's at the best screen you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've had really high hopes for 3D since Avatar impressed me last year but have only ever been disappointed since. All this retro fitting remakes and flickering action sequences has really started to bug me. So when a few months back I heard Herzog was working on a 3D documentary film I couldn't help but grin. Finally I thought a 3D film that isn't going to be a bloated blockbuster. This films subject The Chauvet Cave in southern France was only discovered in 1994. It contains perhaps the most extraordinary array of cave paintings dated from between 23000 to 30000 years ago as well as extraordinary calcite formations stalagmitesstalactites and ancient bones of creatures long migrated from the continent. The cave was apparently sealed by a landslide many millennia ago which has preserved everything perfectly. It's really something special to see and the sense of great privilege is conveyed by Werner early on in his very proud introduction. He is the only filmmaker to ever have been allowed access to the cave and throughout I couldn't help picturing everyone at the BBC and Discovery Channel shrugging jealously. The picture starts with some really beautiful shots of the French vinyards and mountains near the cave. It's presentation is what we've come to expect and it's instantly engaging. Long roving shots from a remote flying camera handheld POV's up mountain paths. The problems only start when we get inside the cave. Werner explains that the equipment that they could take in has to be very limited and they use nonprofessional camera gear. This isn't necessarily the problem though we can take it with a pinch of salt. The real problem is in the 3D. First of all there is little light in the cave and so the gain is pushed into the camera signal and there's a lot of digital noise especially in the dark areas of which there are a lot. Now noisegrain is always forgivable until it starts dancing around in 3D then it gives you a terrible headache. A lot of the shots are lit solely by a moving torch light and the constant refocusing of your eyes only strains them further. However. the cave is quite amazing and we get to see it in detail. Later in the film some much better lit 3d shots are shown that really should have been used throughout. Footage of the cave is interspersed with interviews with various characters. The decision to use a rather generic voice over in place of subtitles for these interviews was certainly a small misstep and dilutes it a touch but the film is not without it's moments. There are a couple of hilarious exchanges where Werner has typically cut someone off too early or left them hanging when they have finished. I do get the sense that he has become self aware and when chuckles are raised as Werner describes a cave painting as Protocinema I detected at least a hint of self parody which I don't mind at all. The film winds up with the most spectacularly detailed shots of all they do linger on a bit too long and I think the back half of the film would benefit from a cut of about 10 minutes. Having said all this despite the technical distractions the film is a semitriumph in the way Encounters at the end of the world was. Some really great personal touches and a fascinating subject but for god's sake see it in glorious 2D. 710".

	onyx:emotionText "I've had really high hopes for 3D since Avatar impressed me last year but have only ever been disappointed since. All this retro fitting remakes and flickering action sequences has really started to bug me. So when a few months back I heard Herzog was working on a 3D documentary film I couldn't help but grin. Finally I thought a 3D film that isn't going to be a bloated blockbuster. This films subject The Chauvet Cave in southern France was only discovered in 1994. It contains perhaps the most extraordinary array of cave paintings dated from between 23000 to 30000 years ago as well as extraordinary calcite formations stalagmitesstalactites and ancient bones of creatures long migrated from the continent. The cave was apparently sealed by a landslide many millennia ago which has preserved everything perfectly. It's really something special to see and the sense of great privilege is conveyed by Werner early on in his very proud introduction. He is the only filmmaker to ever have been allowed access to the cave and throughout I couldn't help picturing everyone at the BBC and Discovery Channel shrugging jealously. The picture starts with some really beautiful shots of the French vinyards and mountains near the cave. It's presentation is what we've come to expect and it's instantly engaging. Long roving shots from a remote flying camera handheld POV's up mountain paths. The problems only start when we get inside the cave. Werner explains that the equipment that they could take in has to be very limited and they use nonprofessional camera gear. This isn't necessarily the problem though we can take it with a pinch of salt. The real problem is in the 3D. First of all there is little light in the cave and so the gain is pushed into the camera signal and there's a lot of digital noise especially in the dark areas of which there are a lot. Now noisegrain is always forgivable until it starts dancing around in 3D then it gives you a terrible headache. A lot of the shots are lit solely by a moving torch light and the constant refocusing of your eyes only strains them further. However. the cave is quite amazing and we get to see it in detail. Later in the film some much better lit 3d shots are shown that really should have been used throughout. Footage of the cave is interspersed with interviews with various characters. The decision to use a rather generic voice over in place of subtitles for these interviews was certainly a small misstep and dilutes it a touch but the film is not without it's moments. There are a couple of hilarious exchanges where Werner has typically cut someone off too early or left them hanging when they have finished. I do get the sense that he has become self aware and when chuckles are raised as Werner describes a cave painting as Protocinema I detected at least a hint of self parody which I don't mind at all.

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary managed to take a subject that is wondrous and thoughtprovoking seem completely and utterly boring. The film spends entirely too much time explaining how limited the access to the very delicate caves are and provides almost no content for ones mind to grab hold of and explore. There is nowhere near enough information that puts the paintings in context. If I were a layperson viewing the film with absolutely no knowledge about prehistoric humans the only information I would gather from the film is that it was much colder 30000 years ago than it is today and that there is currently a nuclear power plant not too far away from the site of the cave. Nothing about what may have inspired the prehistoric artists what his or her motives may have been or what techniques they may have used are present in the film. And don't get me started on the long drawn out sweeps of the paintings themselves. I get it Werner it was an aweinspiring experience to physically be in the caves but panning slowly over the same painting for 2 minutes straight without saying much about it won't get me to understand your sense of wonder. Here comes a paraphrase... Do these paintings perhaps represent the birth of the human spirit? No Werner you silly goose they just offer an opportunity for someone very obviously ignorant of the subject to make vague poetic phrasings in a very weak attempt to invoke a sense of wonder about how far back our human heritage goes. The experimental archaeologist seemed like a pretty cool guy. He played the starspangled banner on a DIY flute made of bone in what was probably a homemade pair of deer pants fur boots and a very snazzy long sleeve fur tunic. Overall this documentary would have been satisfactory if it were 1 hour shorter i.e. roughly 30 minutes long. It offers very little information repetitive footage and an aimless narrative at best. I've read many of the reviews written about the film on this illustrious IMDb website and most of the authors make more inspiring extrapolations about the content than Mr. Herzog was able to. Somewhere deep in an undiscovered cave a caveman is turning in his grave.".

	schema:reviewBody "Werner Herzog can do no wrong at the moment in my eyes and with this documentary about the Chauvet caves of Southern France the oldest known artwork on the earth he is continuing this trend. Filmed mostly on nonprofessional cameras due to the lack of moving room in the caves it charts Herzog's limited access to the heavily restricted cave system that was discovered by mountaineers in 1994 and is a fascinating look at the cave drawings that are 30000 years old. They are a amazing insight into what life was like then for humans as they are quite detailed in the types of animals roaming lions woolly rhinos mammoth and buffalo remember that this is France! and the drawings themselves are of amazing quality and have a strange animated feel to them in the way they are drawn. With the restrictions put in place he is quite limited in where he can go and how much time he has but he has managed to capture the feel of the cave well with only torches and fairly basic cameras and i'm sure if saw in 3d as intended damn my local cinema! it would make it a even better experience. What the rest of the film entails is Herzog interviewing the many sometimes unintentionally hilarious people involved from historians artists perfume smeller's and archaeologists and him doing his unique and often brilliantly blunt narrating over all of this. Then comes the albino crocodiles in a artificial tropical enclosure at the end that have some sort of radiation mutation from a close by nuclear generator and you have another amazing film from the main man Werner Herzog.".

I watch a lot of 3D films but this one was really hard to watch. I was shocked that a director with Herzogs standing made a lot of stupid mistakes in the field of 3D. Didn't the had a stereographer? The best scene is in the beginning when the camera move towards the cave... But right when they entered the cave it's start to get awful. It's embarrassing that Herzog apologize himself in the documentation for the bad quality. And you can feel that they didn't shot any test sequences in similar conditions. Don't watch this film in 3D! Maybe I give it a try in 2D sometimes. Sorry for my bad English".

Worse it is as if he drags us through this as a sequence of motivational posters.In previous comments I have noted that often worthwhile artists should just shut up.

The problem here is that Herzog knew that he would not be surprised had a very narrow set of options so far as what to show and so retreats to telling us of his own discovery. He gives us a story that is dull articulated through what he thinks are engaging souls and using often discredited anthropological notions.At the end  I am not joking  he warns that nuclearmutated albino alligators may threaten the cave and their unique dreams and that perhaps we are those very beasts.For those who might not know the cave is thousands of years earlier than others. It is not revolutionary if it is as old as claimed there is some controversy there is remarkable art from the same period and locale  just not cave paintings. But the paintings carry mysteries... and some seem amazingly modern and engaging on terms we can reach.Who made them and why? Who was the audience and is that even the right question? Where did these masters practice so that the small moments of drawing yielded such accomplishment? What was erased so that the paintings we see could be made? What do the child's footprints mean? Was it really 5000 years of creation and how did that change? Where were the entrances really? Light what about the light?I spent a lot of time working to understand the Dead Sea Scrolls. The problem is that there are so many presumptions brought by loud thinkers that they have possibly plowed the truth into oblivion. Israelis want to validate a certain history  fundamentalists want to hide certain legacies  everybody with a skill or insight wants that insight to dominate. I recognize that here.I believe that we are quite different than the souls who made these paintings radically so. Radically so. The magic is not in discovering ancient artists like me who speak to me as they intended. Rather the magic is that our reach is so vast it can swallow artifacts of an intent we cannot fathom. No logic can help. Science drifts us away melting truth rather than freezing it.There is no logic at all and surely not Bavarian that can clarify.The beauty in this film comes to me indirectly. On the DVD is a film about the film score written by a Dutch cellist. The cave inspires Herzog. Herzog inspires this cellistcomposer. The composer inspires his wife who we briefly see with their child the celestially named Ea. Looking at these two mother and child gave me more about the cave than images of the cave did.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three stars for the 3D visual experience zero stars for the content. It is a truly amazing experience to have the brief glimpse into some of what was going on in the human mind some 30  40 thousand years ago. The 3D experience is as close we will ever get since these caves are accessed only by a privileged few. Herzog and his crew had that privilege for a few hours or so. Conveniently for them an elaborate metal pathway was already constructed so elaborate in fact that the workers went into the trouble of shaping the pathway around some of the stalagmites and so one has to assume that these workers had a greater privilege yet as this sure must had taken days to construct. The cave paintings not only leave us in awe but they also leave us with questions questions about our own nature and how it all began. This is where we get to the disappointing part of the movie. Not that we should expect any of these questions to be answered but one would hope for some interesting information something that the lucky scientist and historians have figured out already. But all we really get is just a parade of circus scientists. I choose the word circus not only because one of the scientisthistorian had circus training but it really wasn't much more than that. Herzog's seemingly Attenboroughlike narrative is disappointingly short on the Attenboroughlike informative power. His choice of selecting imperial measurements units miles feet in his narrative also reminds us who helped to finance this project  US History Channel. Beyond the awe expressed by everyone participating in the production what kind of interesting information do we get ? Well we have our circus scientist who leaves us with a magical conclusion that we are best to interpret these painting as the work of the spirits. Another scientist is so taken aback that he even proposes to rename our species from homo sapiens to homo religious. The evidence for that ? Well I did not see it  they showed it to us from a limited angle and it required a lot of imagination but apparently among all the paintings of animals they also found one that kinda resembles a half Venus figurine half bison. Then we have a guyscientist dressed in deer skin who whistles for us through a replica of a caveman's flute the Star Spangled Banner tune wow. I'm saying whistles because the melody seemed to have been produced before it entered the flute. We also have another scientist who throws a spear several times in fact and then himself concludes he would have no chance in life of killing anything. And to amaze us even more we have a perfume maker who goes around these caves and smells them. From his acute sense of smell he is well in his 60s he then recreates in his mind what it would have been like to be one of the cave painters 30 thousand years ago in the time of the last Ice Age. Mr. Herzog then concludes this circus parade with a global warming commentary looking at the cave paintings through the eyes of an albino crocodile  this is not a joke. One might laugh about it but it left me seriously worried about my human heritage and the people I have to rely on to access it and to study it. What a shame.".

	schema:headline " Could have been an excellent short film";
	schema:reviewBody "The paintings on the walls of the Chauvet Cave in southern France are what makes this film interesting. This cave was discovered only in 1994 and the paintings are dated to about 30000 years ago. Not shown are the early paintings in the Lascaux Cave also in southern France discovered in 1940. The paintings in the Chauvet Cave predate those in the Lascaux by about 10000 years. Lessons were learned from the Lascaux cave about how allowing lighting and large numbers of human visitors changed the cave climate causing significant problems like lichens mold and fungus blemishes on the walls. Lessons learned from the Lascaux cave have been applied to the Chauvet Cave resulting in severely limited access and the use of special portable batterypowered lighting. Human traffic in Chauvet is restricted to a series of metal walkways. While it is admirable that a high level of care is being taken to preserve the Chauvet Cave it is unfortunate that so few people can have the privilege of seeing the original artwork. So we can be thankful that this film offers a wide audience the opportunity to see the treasures of the cave. Given all the restrictions Herzog must have been persistent in his being allowed into the cave with a small crew in order to film the paintings and other items of interest. In general I have little use for 3D but it is of value in viewing the paintings since the contours of the walls play a role in the effect the paintings create. However I am not sure that viewing in 2D would not be almost as impressive. One can only stand in awe of the beauty of the artwork. I am sure that one thing that fascinated Herzog was evidence of great artistry dating back to such an early time indicating that such an impulse has been in the history of man for a long time. It's in our DNA.Outside of the filming of the interior of the cave I found the 3D effects to be quite distracting. Camera movement often resulted in visual artifacts. I can understand that the lighting could be a bit dark in the interior of the cave but even the scenes filmed outside the cave seemed dark. This may have been a projection problem in the theater I went to but I came away with eyestrain and the conviction that 3D is more of a gimmick than an innovation.I wish there had been some discussion of how the paintings might have been done no matter how speculative. There was not much pigmentation in the painting but there was some. What was used for the paint? It looked like mostly charcoal but there was no evidence of fires having existed in the cave. Was the charcoal brought in from exterior fires? What was the means of application? Interesting that there were no human remains in the cave wonder why that was? Herzog seems happy to simply dwell on the mystery but I think it would have been fun to hear speculations from experts on details.The elements of the movie outside the filming of the paintings I did not find added much. A lot of it struck me as filler so that this could be made into a feature length film. In particular the postscript filmed in an interior biosphere that attached some meaning to albino alligators left me totally perplexed and wondering if a segment from some other movie had been spliced in.I found the musical accompaniment added to the appreciation of the mystery of the paintings.

	onyx:emotionText "The paintings on the walls of the Chauvet Cave in southern France are what makes this film interesting. This cave was discovered only in 1994 and the paintings are dated to about 30000 years ago. Not shown are the early paintings in the Lascaux Cave also in southern France discovered in 1940. The paintings in the Chauvet Cave predate those in the Lascaux by about 10000 years. Lessons were learned from the Lascaux cave about how allowing lighting and large numbers of human visitors changed the cave climate causing significant problems like lichens mold and fungus blemishes on the walls. Lessons learned from the Lascaux cave have been applied to the Chauvet Cave resulting in severely limited access and the use of special portable batterypowered lighting. Human traffic in Chauvet is restricted to a series of metal walkways. While it is admirable that a high level of care is being taken to preserve the Chauvet Cave it is unfortunate that so few people can have the privilege of seeing the original artwork. So we can be thankful that this film offers a wide audience the opportunity to see the treasures of the cave. Given all the restrictions Herzog must have been persistent in his being allowed into the cave with a small crew in order to film the paintings and other items of interest. In general I have little use for 3D but it is of value in viewing the paintings since the contours of the walls play a role in the effect the paintings create. However I am not sure that viewing in 2D would not be almost as impressive. One can only stand in awe of the beauty of the artwork. I am sure that one thing that fascinated Herzog was evidence of great artistry dating back to such an early time indicating that such an impulse has been in the history of man for a long time. It's in our DNA.Outside of the filming of the interior of the cave I found the 3D effects to be quite distracting. Camera movement often resulted in visual artifacts.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1994 a cave was excavated after being buried under a rockslide for 15000 years. During the exploration of the cave they found what is now considered the oldest cave drawings ever discovered many of them dating back 32000 years ago.Cauvet Cave is located in Southern France. Once it was discovered the French government sealed it off with an air tight metal door and strictly limited access to the cave in order to keep the drawings from fading. This was a good idea considering the rockslide limited the air flow and as a result the drawings still almost look fresh. One can see the great detail in many of these paintings.What struck this reviewer was how well done the paintings and drawings were. Keep in mind these are the oldest paintings any human has ever drawn and they are not simply stick figure men. In fact there are no drawings of humans at all only animals lions bears horses rhinos. And while they lack certain 3 dimensional aspects the drawings are all very detailed. It seems that artistic creation was not something that slowly evolved in humans but rather burst onto the scene quite drastically.Some of the drawings are more recent from 26000 years ago including some people adding on to drawings that were made 5000 years prior to them. It is almost impossible to imagine adding one's own ideas to a painting made five thousand years ago but these humans were not locked into history.Director Werner Herzog gives the audience breathtaking images of the drawings and of the caveswhich after being sealed off for so long have developed some beautiful and bizarre cave growth. Herzog was only allowed 3 other men for his film crew while in the caves and their time in them is severely limited. The only other people allowed in the cave are a team of scientists studying the artwork in order to understand early man. No one is allowed to touch anything and they cannot step off of the 2foot wide metal walkway that has been built. Herzog ventures outside the cave at points and asks these researchers about life for early man around the area of the cave. The cave was never lived in but rather served as some type of gathering place. Perhaps for festivals or religious ceremonies. These early humans walked with mammoths and Neanderthals during the ice age hunted with spears and wore very warm clothes.The film was shot in 3D in order for the audience to see just how these ancient artists used the cave walls to create the illusion of movement and give several of the drawings a flowing quality.Herzog's documentary is fascinating and beautiful. Perhaps some may think a documentary about cave drawings boring but the artwork is so beautiful the discussions so interesting and the researchers such colorful characters that one must go out of their way to be bored by this film. A marvelous and wonderful documentary this should not be missed.httpthatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com".

You can't help but sympathize however with the characters of ROURKE and ROBERTS. They leave a lasting impression with the viewer conveying how life can be brutal in all aspects whether emotional or tangible. And how good guys really do finish last. It was nice to see a measure of revenge for the two in the last scene at the hands of crime boss BURT YOUNG. DARRYL HANNAH adds a great supporting role as ROURKE'S girlfriend who quickly loses patience with him. The one person I was most impressed with was MICKEY ROURKE. He showed such great promise as an actor in this filmhis best hands down.  I still can't believe how he allowed himself to deteriorate through the years in the way he has. He truly could have been one of the greats in the industry. That is far from an overstatement. Anyhow this is a can't miss filma sleeper. In my opinion as good or better then some of my other favorites like Goodfellas The Godfather etc. Enjoy it over and over.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village' almost twenty years after it was released you can't but help think awhat a great movie it is and bwhat the hell happened to Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts two of the most exciting actors of the 1980s? Rourke drifted off into boxing and bgrade action movies and apart from some great cameos in movies by Sean Penn Steve Buscemi and Vincent Gallo 'The Pledge' 'The Animal Factory' 'Buffalo '66' respectively has almost been forgotten by the current generation of movie fans and Roberts has also made way too many bad straight to video action films and is regarded as a joke by most people. It's so sad what happened to their careers but this movie sees them both at their peak and boy they were both GREAT actors! The movie is directed by Stuart Rosenberg who made my all time favourite movie 'Cool Hand Luke' back in the 1960s and Michael Cimino 'The Deerhunter' also worked on it uncredited. I don't know if this means it was a troubled shoot I don't know the background details but if that's the case it certainly doesn't show on screen.  Some people find this movie too rambling and anecdotal but I loved it. It's a superior character driven buddy movie which reminds me in places of Cimino's earlier overlooked 'Thunderbolt And Lightfoot'. Rourke and Roberts are dynamite together and I would recommend this movie for them alone but the supporting cast includes a credible turn from Daryl Hannah and a whole bunch of great character actors  M. Emmett Walsh Burt Young Val Avery Jack Kehoe and especially Kenneth McMillan who later appeared with Roberts in another great forgotten 1980s movie 'Runaway Train' who plays a heartbreaking role as the poor guy who gets enmeshed in Roberts and Rourke's doomed robbery plan. 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village' deserves to be rediscovered. Any film buff who appreciates good acting will enjoy it and youngsters who aren't aware of Mickey Rourke or who regard Eric Roberts as little more than a figure of fun should check it out and be amazed.".

One of Eric Roberts best movies his acting is second to none as the fast talking fast walking and scared out of his mind side kick  cousin to Mickey Rourke. The thumb scene alone is timeless. It is both scary and funny most movies can't produce a scene with as much realism as Charlie....they took my thumb. Overall the Pope of Greenwich Village is a comedy but at times it is dramatic and as serious as a heart attack.

I felt that he almost stole the show.. not because I thought his acting was amazing. because it was almost like a parody  I found it strange at times.Rourke was cool calm and focused  his acting was great.. and I LOVED his come over here.. line.. almost seemed sexual to me.. I wondered what he was going to do.I think everyone who commented on this film is right in saying how incredibly sad it is how Rourke's and Robert's career went down the tubes the way it did. We all have our demons I guess. The focus is to overcome them. Roberts is a B movie actor. Rourke was never a Bmovie actor  he was always a great actor with enormous potential who still has a shot of living up to his potentialhe has recently been making a great comeback  ...my best work is still ahead of me he commented. he came out of the grave. Amen to that!! The special things about this film are the Acting and the nostalgic feeling one gets when looking at scenes of New York back in 84 if you are from the east coast and live close to the city or are from the city  you know what I'm talking aboutAmen to the Pope  great little film one in which I will buy to my collection.".

It sure wasn't. Indeed this film is a story of character and it is done so well!!!The story is well written with great understanding of the characters and I feel that the same goes for the actors. They seem to understand their characters and really carry them out. With that I'd have to give just a little more praise to Eric Roberts than to Mickey Rourke. Both have before and since then proven that they are capable enough despite their disappointing careers and truth be told some less performances. But the character of Charlie is really a likable guy. He is the voice of reason of the film the one we would all like to think we recognize in ourselves. While Paulie on the other hand is a different story. Portrayed any differently he could very well be an ass. I mean if you knew anybody that set you up cost you your job didn't ever listen to you rat you out lied to you... Would you like that person? Probably not. But Charlie likes Paulie and the only thing that makes that believable is the fact that WE like Paulie. Roberts somehow accomplishes to create this totally unreliable character that you just can't help but adore and sometimes feel sorry for. He's a moron but he's sweet and he means well kinda. He looks up to Charlie who really hasn't accomplished much more in his life he just carries it better.And poor Paulie is so annoying that he is endearing. I almost felt his pain when he was being 'interrogated'. Hilarious hairdo by the way. For Rourke this was not any new territory he played this type of character more often. That doesn't mean he didn't do it fabulously though he did. Nothing new but still good. Indeed one of the best performances of his career. That shows you that award shows mean nothing.Page is also very good and rightly recognized for it and Daryl Hannah can't act but you can't really blame her for trying anyway since she seems to be getting away with it. And the poor girl really tries.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pope Of Greenwich Village is an excellentunderrated and overlooked Crime Drama that combines great directionamazing performances from Mickey RourkeEric Roberts and a terrific supporting casta fantastic script and a outstanding film score that make The Pope Of Greenwich an entertaining and memorable film that is Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts at their best.Based on the novel of the same name by Vincent Patrick and set in the Greenwich Village section of New YorkThe Pope Of Greenwich Village tells the story of cousins CharlieMickey Rourkeand PaulieEric Robertstwo guys who have big ambitions Charlie wants to have his own restaurant and Paulie a schemer that wants to make money but the two have financial troubles. With no other optionsCharlie and Paulie with the help of clock repairman and locksmith BarneyKenneth McMilliandecide to rob a safe at a local business. When the robbery goes wrong Charlie and Paulie have to deal Italian Mob Boss Bed Bug EddieBurt Youngas well as the cops in order to get out of danger.Released in 1984The Pope Of Greenwich Village is a brilliant Crime Drama while earning decent reviews from critics and receiving an Oscar nomination wasn't a hit at the Box Office and didn't get much attention from movie audiences at the time. Butthankfully overtime The Pope Of Greenwich Village has found Cult status throughout the years and is not only seen as a great Crime Drama but is also seen as one of the most underrated movies of the 1980s. I think that one of the reasons The Pope Of Greenwich Village has found Cult status and is an entertaining film is because the film gives viewers a different kind of Crime Drama that combines Crime DramaGangster Film and a Buddy Movie and gives the movie not only a incredible energy that keeps you glued to the screen for 121 minutes. What I also like about The Pope Of Greenwich Village is that despite having all of the trademark elements of Crime Dramas such as vicious CriminalsGangstersCops as well as common elements including violence and betrayalthe story in POGV is handled with a great balance of dark and light elements with the dark elements being the DramaGangsters and violence and the light elements being the Comedy and Humor showing the friendship and antics of Charlie and Paulie or Paulie by himself which is funny and at times over the top. Another thing that I like about POGV is the authentic feel of the film whether it's the New York locations throughout the city or neighborhoods or the characters and their streetwise attitudes that don't feel forced or fake but real and accurate. The New York locations and attitudes of the characters at times reminded me of Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster Films such as Goodfellas and Mean Streetsa film that The Pope Of Greenwich Village is often compared toand like Scorsese's New York City Crime DramasPOGV brings you into a world that is dangerousviolent and at times funny and you are absorbed and mesmerized. The screenplay by Vincent Patrickadapted from his own novelis terrific and wellwritten with Patrick giving the characters dialog that is tough and gritty as well as rich and amazing with most of the characters having depth and power. Patrick also has great scenes in the film that are memorable and truly unforgettable and match the world and tone that The Pope Of Greenwich Village is showing. Like I said before POGV is a buddy movie and it is very true with the main characters Charlie and Paulie because even if the characters aren't always likable we relate to the two because like a lot of people in the world they are both dreamers and have big aspirations to get what they want whether it's owning a restaurant or making money. While Charlie and Paulie have problems with each other they are still family and care about one another even when bad things are happening all around them and it is the relationship between Charlie and Paulie is one of the things that drives the film and is the film because it's funnyreal and true to life. The ending of The Pope Of Greenwich Village is amazingfunny and surprising and leaves with a smile feeling like everything will be alright for Charlie and Paulie in the long run. A great ending.The whole cast is outstanding. Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts are excellent and at their best as Charlie and Pauliewith Rourke bringing a coolness and charisma and Roberts being funny and over the top and the two have great scenes and chemistry together. Daryl Hannah does a wonderful job as DianeCharlie's girlfriend. Geraldine Page earned a best supporting Actress Oscar Nomination for her small but terrific performance as Mrs. RitterBunky's Mother. Kenneth McMillan is outstanding as Barneya locksmith that helps Charlie and Paulie. Burt Young is fantastic and menacing as Bed Bug Eddiea vicious Gangster. M. Emmett Walsh is great as always in his small role as Burnsa New York cop. Tony Mustaine is effective as Uncle PetePaulie's Uncle. Jack Kehoe is sensational as Bunkya New York Cop.The direction by Stuart Rosenberg is greatwith Rosenberg with Rosenberg doing a simple but effective job and sometimes moving the camera and giving the movie a great style and pace. Wonderful jobRosenberg.The score by Dave Grusin is fantasticmoodydramatic and light and matches the tone of the film perfectly. Great scoreGrusin. There is also a memorable use of Frank Sinatra's classic song Summer Wind which is used a few times in the film.In final wordif you love Crime DramasGangster FilmsMickey Rourke or Eric RobertsI highly suggest you see The Pope Of Greenwich Villagean excellentunderrated and overlooked Crime Drama that is Rourke and Roberts at their best. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke make an unforgettable pair in Stuart Rosenberg's film by way in part I've read of Michael Cimino because they both take skills they've picked up as actors and applied them wonderfully to two roles that bring out their best. They play essentially a version of the Mean Streets characters ten years later one wants to go straight in the Little Italy world they've grown up in have a legitimate business like a restaurant maybe start a family or settle down with his girl and is a good guy  except of course for the 'black sheep' in his cousin who's a waiter sometimes and also has other schemes going on like owning part of a racing horse and gets himself into some very deep hot water with local gangsters.The story may sound familiar but the performances make a very big difference in fact this is essential viewing for those intense male actors looking to break into theater or independent films. Some have criticized Eric Roberts for going over the top as Paulie but he imbues this character with a complete and unnerving or just nerving sense of desperation. Paulie wants to be good too and one can sense that but being on the streets have messed with his head past the point of no return he isn't quite as Idon'tgiveableep like Johnny Boy in Scorsese's picture but the same tendency to tick off the wrong people is right there. And watching Roberts go to town in some really big scenes like when he comes back from losing his thumb or a more subtle and intense scene like when he's getting questioned by Burt Young's mob boss he shows why for a short while he was a star maybe not his sister but close enough.And yet one can't help but feel that for all of Roberts excellent work for all of the superior supporting performances from Darryl Hannah and Geraldine Page the scene where she tells the cops to get out of her apartment holy hell is that fantastic Young the actor playing the locksmith it's Mickey Rourke's time to shine. He had that quiet voice that one could tell could just crack at any second and here he makes his tough guy in Rumble Fish look like a wuss here one knows he could just erupt and go to town on someone and does sometimes like on Paulie when the time comes which is relatively often but Rourke's power is in what he holds back or appears to be holding back. He came out of the same school of acting as De Niro and Pacino and it shows as if he were or rather still is one of the most gifted of the pupils of the method and even as he gives that smirk or has a deceptive twinkle in his eye you just know he's got this character so damn down. He could wrestle with Keitel no pun intended and it would be hard to say who would win for pure onscreen chops.The story I should add is also very good one of those very tightly constructed morality plays in the guise of a filmnoir that operates so strongly because it doesn't make anyone too black or white even the detective who meets his sad end down an elevator shaft by accident has a whole history that is developed perfectly in just one scene with his mother and so he's no more or less unsympathetic than Paulie. It also ends in a peculiar way after the volcanic climax which comes as something of a surprise it just shows Paulie and Charlie walking down the street and the camera rises on a note of uncertainty. It is not quite as open and shut as Mean Streets might be but it has its own level of doom these two guys probably wont be able to rid each other of one another unless there's death or worse.Some slightly dated 80s music notwithstanding some of it weird synth Irish music The Pope of Greenwich Village is exciting occasionally funny and gives all in the audience a taste of delicious New York style film acting. Everyone's on their Agame and for a brief moment it looked as though the two stars could go anywhere with their careers...".

	schema:headline " Allegorical joke with no punch line";
	schema:reviewBody "Two smartalec losers in the Village want to be big shots and so get messed up with some obnoxious loudmouth local crime boss. All of the actors you'll see in this thing have done much better and even seem to be approaching their roles here zealously. Problem is the script really offers nothing and the director's approach exudes an air of selfimportant wannabe artistry.The soundtrack features some old Sinatra tunes so if you like his music you'll at least get a tidbit of entertainment value. Beyond that though there is little to see. The story trudges along as the two underdogs try to turn the tables on the crime lord guy. One has some brains the other is a goof ball who spends his time mumbling or screaming and the contrast is meant to be amusingkind of a cross between the Abbott  Costello and and Bill  Ted approaches. The action is both metaphorical and improbable in the real world meaning the director's intent apparently was for an offbeat allegory. It does not accomplish this since there really is no ultimate point even if the viewer tries to insert one on their own.One scene for example which is meant to have deep inferences makes a big deal out of a guy drinking coffee. Hitchcockian tecniques such as closeups and numerous different camera shots are used. But this director is no Hitchcock it's awkwardly done and drags on forever. Worst of all no substance to it.A movie that is noteworthy for its level of failure only.".

	onyx:emotionText "Two smartalec losers in the Village want to be big shots and so get messed up with some obnoxious loudmouth local crime boss. All of the actors you'll see in this thing have done much better and even seem to be approaching their roles here zealously. Problem is the script really offers nothing and the director's approach exudes an air of selfimportant wannabe artistry.The soundtrack features some old Sinatra tunes so if you like his music you'll at least get a tidbit of entertainment value. Beyond that though there is little to see. The story trudges along as the two underdogs try to turn the tables on the crime lord guy. One has some brains the other is a goof ball who spends his time mumbling or screaming and the contrast is meant to be amusingkind of a cross between the Abbott  Costello and and Bill  Ted approaches. The action is both metaphorical and improbable in the real world meaning the director's intent apparently was for an offbeat allegory. It does not accomplish this since there really is no ultimate point even if the viewer tries to insert one on their own.One scene for example which is meant to have deep inferences makes a big deal out of a guy drinking coffee. Hitchcockian tecniques such as closeups and numerous different camera shots are used. But this director is no Hitchcock it's awkwardly done and drags on forever. Worst of all no substance to it.A movie that is noteworthy for its level of failure only.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nobody would accuse this tale of being taut. It meanders around sufficiently that we get to know the characters their families their values  and therein lies its charm. Eric Roberts is Pauli the reckless Italian optimist and Mickey Rourke is his more sensible principled Irish cousin. The milieu is New York City and it is captured most impressively. These two street proletarians  waiters and busboys  ooze with the desire to own a Coupe deVille. Roberts brags that he never ordered a brandy that wasn't Courvoisier VSOP. Their ambition and their taste are palpable. I say this despite having grown up in the area without the slightest desire to live their life styles and lacking any intense affection for Frank Sinatra.Basically the plot is a crosscousin of Mean Streets with Rourke in the Harvey Keitel role and Roberts as the maniacal DeNiro. Not to suggest that this is an imitation of anything else. The writer Vincent Patrick has street lingo down pat even to the smallest parts and Stuart Rosemberg has executed it flawlessly. Even mozarella comes out properly as moozarell. The two cousins alternately joke and fight with one another depending on their position on the regression line between Robert's wild schemes and Rourke's more banal impulses. Roberts puts a horse physic in the drink of a ruthless cop. He engineers a lucrative burglary with the help of Rourke and a locksmith Kenneth MacMillan that results in the accidental death of a corrupt police officer Jack Kehoe whose only motive for being corrupt was to make enough money to move him and his sickly mother Geraldine Page to Phoenix in order to improve her health. As I said the script meanders but meaningfully. Geraldine Page gives a fine performance by the way as the selfdestructive toughasnails streetsavvy Mom.The money from the burglary belonged to the neighborhood Mr. Big a villainous and revengeful Burt Young who forces MacMillan to leave his family and blow town. He also removes one of Eric Roberts' digits. And just as he is having a duel of wits with the third party to the crime Rourke Roberts feeds Burt Young a cup of espresso filled with lye. The poisoned Young leaps through the storefront window and runs off down the street. The last shot has Roberts and Rourke strolling off carefree down the street arguing about whether it would be better to live in Miami. That's a bit of a weak ending. Given Burt Young's vengeful nature and his position in the organization I wouldn't give two cents for either of their wellclad behinds. If they wind up as lowly waiters again they'll be lucky.Well I suppose I've made the film sounds like a terrible tragedy but it's not. The street lingo and many of the incidents make it as much comic as anything else. One of Roberts' schemes has to do with betting a bundle on a horse that absolutely cannot lose. But Roberts' knows as little about racing as he does about keeping out of trouble. He's confused about which part of a stallion must be removed to turn it into a gelding. He's concerned about the colors of the jockey because it makes him look like a fairy. Roberts bets the whole shebang on a win and the horse loses in a photo finish. The more prudent Rourke has made twenty large by betting on the horse across the board.It's a pretty good movie full of welldrawn colorful characters and considerable suspense and humor.".

Pauly was a weasel and Roberts delivered a weasel. That pretty much goes right on down the line. the story flowed seamlessly from scene to scene and came together as one beautiful whole with a few minor exceptions. One of these exceptions being how upset Bedbug Eddie became when he learned of the tapes. It seem to me that the existence of these tapes would have been a MUCH bigger problem for the police than they would have been for him. They were TAKING the bribes. The other 'weakness' if you will was the ending. A little too Hollywood. They had just poisoned the most notorious dude in the Village and they are walking away arguing about how it should have been done instead of running for their lives. Only these few things kept this from being a perfect ten and I highly recommend it. Even if you DO know all of the actors.".

Paulies' schemes get Charlie fired from his job and when Paulie draws Charlie into a plan to steal some money he doesn't tell him from whom they're stealing.

Emmet Walsh Jack Kehoe Philip Bosco Val Avery Joe Grifasi Tony DiBenedetto John Finn Ed O'Ross Frank Vincent Anna Levine and William Duell. They're all entertaining to watch but Geraldine Page is especially riveting as the mother of a corrupt detective.

Rourke overall more restrained is quite likable Daryl Hannah isn't bad as Rourkes' frustrated girlfriend.Director Stuart Rosenberg Cool Hand Luke has a great feel for the neighbourhood in his handling of the material. And Patrick injects some amusing comedy bits  such as Paulies' revenge against a portly parking patrol officer  into the story that provide some counterpoint to the drama.

The script and direction of Joseph Mankiewicz were perfect. But it flopped possibly because the times did not call for a literate murder mystery film.It's lineage is impeccable since it begins with Ben Jonson's classic Jacobean comedy Volpone. But actually it is not Volpone. The film is based on Thomas Sterling's The Evil of the Day. The story has been changed in one way. Sterling's novel brings together three wouldbe heirs too but two are men and one is Fox's wife as in the movie  Susan Hayward's role. But the same plot switches go on in the novel as in this film.I enjoyed the movie in particular one moment that was rare to see in any film of that period. Harrison has invited his three wouldbe heirs to come to dinner. Hayward accompanied by her secretary Smith comes in first. While they are talking to Harrison and Robertson both Adams and Capucine show up at the doorway. Neither is willing to let the other go in first. They end up pushing into each other through the door frame into the dining room thoroughly uncomfortable  but at least neither was forced to wait for the other to make the first move.".

The Money Pot is a delightfully witty film of the great director Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The sophisticated and theatrical screenplay has wonderful lines and many plot points that surprises many times and a mystery that recalls the novels of Agatha Christie. The direction and the performances are superb highlighting Rex Harrison Cliff Robertson Maggie Smith and Adolfo Celi the Venetian inspector that watches Perry Mason at home.

	schema:reviewBody "The Honey Pot 1967An odd film historicallyit falls in the year of the New Hollywood breakouts like The Graduate and Bonnie and Clyde yet it is made in the style of those earlier 1960s slick and effete capers like The Pink Panther. The movie can't be seen in quite contemporary terms because it's just too slick and clever and yet it doesn't have the panache and glorious success of the best of the earlier color films glamour besides.Technically this is an American production though it's thoroughly British in feel and the production company also handled the embarrassing Casino Royale which is equally British at its core. The story is basically a romanticized version of Ben Jonson's Volpone a play from the same year 1606 as Shakespeare's MacBeth. There is a small part of Volpone performed in the movie for the indulgence of the filthy rich scheming main character. This would seem a promising starting point.And the director and coscreenwriter is one of Hollywood's classic greats Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Like many of the old guard still working in the late 1960s there is a slight sense of displacement here or even of weariness mixed with selfsatisfaction. Maybe it shows that this is his last film. The theatrical style of acting is also teetering into the functional dialog and delivery of televisionit depends not on atmosphere t.v. had none back then but on a development of ideas. In fact it is something of a play expanded and made colorful for the wide screen. Its drama depends on a sequence of events rather than cinematic visual elements.If you are looking for a Susan Hayward performance there isn't much to watch forit's quirky and brief. Rex Harrison as the lead is forceful and uncomplicated. And convincing enough. The many side characters are strong and will do though there is a sad lack of momentum to it all. The combination never quite stumbles combining a light wit and sophisticated air and lacking the seeming selfish cruelty of Jonson's original. Even the camerawork ever smooth and perfectly balanced gives a sense of well made if slightly too well lit television again moviemaking. Yes I am all hesitance here. It's so nice and smart all the time without great effect. It twists and twists and you have no way to really anticipate merely respond by saying oh another twist. You don't give a hoot about the characters or the murdered woman or whether the inheritance is real or not or much of anything. So all the back and forth all the hiding of secrets and playing of parts even the voiceover from the dead at the end is slim entertainment.".

Sure enough the back story of this film is that United Artists then an independent film company that was a haven for great independent film makers such as Stanley Kramer Robert Wise Billy Wilder William Wyler made serious cuts to the finished film that reportedly upset both Joseph Mankiewicz and star Susan Hayward. I do not know if Susan's long absences from Production tending to her dying husband in the USA resulted in her role being cut or what. The cinematographer died during production too. Years later Joseph Mankiewicz restored all of his cuts and it is said to be a brilliant film. Mankiewicz films are noted for great dialogue and this film is missing some of the usual quips made so famous in Mankiewicz films. However the DVD version is the UA version not the Mankiewicz version.Susan Hayward always an exciting woman to watch on the screen has little to do but makes every scene she is in worth watching however Hawyard's character Lone Star ends up dead early in the movie. There is not even one Hayward scene where the usually fiery star would dominate a sequence. Capucine Edie Adams Maggie Smith and Cliff Robertson give fine support to Rex Harrison and Ms. Hayward. This movie has 4 Oscar winners Hayward Harrison Smith and Robertson.This is the last Susan Hayward movie that allowed Hayward to be considered a superstar what would follow would be cameos in Valley Of The Dolls and The Revengers and two TV movies Heat of Anger and Say Goodbye Maggie Cole before dying of brain cancer at a relatively early age of 57. Years later Rex Harrison would be quoted as saying He and the rest of the Company respected Ms. Hayward who dealt with the loss of her hsuband and carried on so professionally in her role.".

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on Volpone a play by Ben Johnson Joseph L. Mankiewicz's literate yet complex film The Honey Pot is an often overlooked gem from the 1960's. Ensconced in his lavish Venetian palazzo Cecil Fox devises an elaborately staged game to play on three of his former paramours. Hiring a handsome stage manager named McFly he writes a letter to each woman telling her that he is on his death bed and she could be heiress to his estate. Needless to say each arrives in Venice with an expensive gift and a desire to rekindle the fire with Fox. Each woman brings a time piece and the theme of passing time is woven throughout the film.The film was the second successful collaboration between Mankiewicz and Rex Harrison the first producing Harrison's Oscarnominated performance in Cleopatra. Harrison is a sly delight as Fox a devious manipulative schemer whose dreams of being a dancer send him flitting flamboyantly around his bed chamber in keeping with the film's theme he even cavorts to The Dance of the Hours. Cliff Robertson is McFly a man with a checkered past who stages the deception with ambiguous motives of his own. The three objects of Fox's deceit are played by Susan Hayward Capucine and Edie Adams. Hayward's Mrs. Lone Star Crockett Sheridan is the most colorful and her toughtalking Texan character is missed when she is offscreen. Capucine's Princess Dominque is properly cool and regal and Adams's Merle McGill is crass and common. In a role that resembles her work in The V.I.P's Maggie Smith is the underestimated brains among the group as Sarah Watkins nursecompanion to Mrs. Sheridan Smith is described by Fox as the bouncy one and she is indeed.The Honey Pot may be too slow and wordy for those nursed on Marvel Comics super heroes but patient viewers have much to relish. Mankiewicz won Oscars for his biting screenplays for All About Eve and A Letter to Three Wives and also won nominations for writing Skippy No Way Out and The Barefoot Contessa. His sharp and witty dialog is deliciously delivered by Harrison and Hayward in particular who have the best lines however the entire cast which includes four Oscar winners does well and each has his or her moments. Gianni Di Venanzo's well rendered cinematography of Venice and of the rich interiors of Fox's palace is colorful and John Addison's score enhances the proceedings. Boasting excellent technical credits a sterling cast and a script and direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz The Honey Pot offers solid entertainment for discerning viewers and a few twists and surprises to keep everyone attentive until the end.".

For me I wish it had stuck with the comedy throughoutit would have been a better film.The film is about a very rich man Rex Harrison who has decided to enact his own reallife version of the Ben Johnson play Valpone. It's a play in which a man pretends to be dying and does this to fool his friends. Like Valpone which literally means 'the fox' Harrison's name is Fox. However in this case Fox has invited his three exwives to his hometelling them through his secretary Cliff Robertson that he's dying. However instead of this complicated plan being seen through to the end folks start dying. What gives?! The film has a nice cast. In addition to Harrison and Robertson there are the wives Capucine Edie Adams and Susan Haywardwho is quite entertaining. Also Adolfo Celi and Maggie Smith are along for support. However despite the story being directed by the brilliant Joseph L. Mankiewicz it just didn't work. It wasn't just that the film was two different films but the ending was VERY talky and had to explain everything to the audiencewhich was very awkward. Overall the film is also a bit overlong.

This time around he recruits Cliff Robertson into his master plan he's going to pretend he's dying to see which of the many women in his circle really care about him. The women Susan Hayward Capucine Edie Adams and Maggie Smith. They're each very different from English spinster to penniless princess and they all try to make their case about who should inherit his fortune when he dies. It's supposed to be a comedy akin to Unfaithfully Yours but Rex Harrison ruins it for me just as he did in the 1948 film. I preferred Dudley Moore's version of Unfaithfully Yours. Rex just isn't likable and his ego oozes off the screen in every film I've seen him in. Why would these women waste their time with himI don't care how much money they stand to inherit! There are a few 1960s sex jokes that Hollywood liked to throw around at the time after the demise of the Hays code but it's hardly the best 60s sex romp out there.".

The film interviews people who are experts actors in some cases and we find how politicians covered up the lack of vaccine etc to give us a realistic picture.  The film also uses video diaries of a UK family who are living with the realities of fearing to leave their house and being taken' when it is found that they have been exposed  it doesn't work well as the actors doing it are very soapy but some bits hit the mark the reaction of the estate residents when one family gets the disease is realistic.It may be seen as opportunistic film making but it is well done for the most part and uses chilling statistics and facts to make it's case.  With lots of white powder showing up in envelopes and the weakness of governments to react to biological warfare of this type this is even more chilling. Very enjoyable.if that's the right word!".

I'm also former military  an NBC specialist  so I know way too much about this stuff in real life.After watching about half an hour of this movie on FX the first comment we made to each other was that this is entirely too realistic. The second comment after about an hour was that this movie is scarier than any slasher flick that we've seen.The premise behind the movie is simple  a terrorist infects a small population in New York City with smallpox which with modern travel is able to go around the world during the incubation period and eventually kill millions around the world.We did not particularly care for the ending  it is possible that a terrorist might have not had his identity discovered. It is highly unlikely that the nationality of the terrorist would not have been found though. One thing that we both found to be incorrect was in the burying of the bodies. That may have been the only thing to do in third world countries. However the only real way to insure that the bodies do not continue to be breeding colonies would be cremation. So in this case the film makers missed the mark.By not using well known actors the film makers made this look just like real documentaries that play on the History Channel. The voice actor that impersonated President Bush was very good as well and including Al Sharpton in a cameo made for a nice touch as well.I did find it interesting that there were no comments in the film about infections in the middle east. Perhaps this was a deliberate attempt not to mention Iran Libya North Korea or any other country where such biological weapons have been known to be made. Another note is that such an event was covered quite nicely by Tom Clancy years ago as a prelude to a military action.One comment by the Russian scientist  these are not weapons of mass destruction just mass casualties  is true to a certain extent. The film makers did not cover  perhaps wisely  that if this had been found to be the result of action by a nation state that the response of the U.S. is to respond in kind. And the U.S. considers gas to be a bug to be a nuke  so while we don't have massive stocks of nerve gas or bioweapons we do have plenty of nukes available.The last few minutes of the movie seemed quite rushed. I think this one could have lasted about another hour and been fleshed out MUCH more  instead of going from day 31 to day 91 so quickly.All in all a 10 for realism a 5 for being rushed and an 8 overall. Very scary stuff when you really think about it. It would have only taken a bit more for the pandemic to have killed many many more people around the world  and that should have been covered.".

Stock footage of civil disruption and disasters are woven into the new footage that gives the movie a realistic look.

I don't see why people say the terrorist has created the smallpox himself it is provably possible to do so but I didn't hear it in the movie and it would not have been exactly the India1. And I think the his skin was blackened and he was covered in bleeding sores about the first black pox case is some factual goof. Blisters filling with blood are possible of course they can leak through the central navel or just burst too. But if a person is totally hemorrhagic blackened and plainly dying after only three days of disease it's early hemorrhagic smallpox. In such cases there are no pox as such. They have no time to develop. But I am willing to forgive it because it is a kind of illustration for the common audience  I know that blackened skin is subcutaneous hemorrhage but not everybody does. Otherwise I think it is really well made and I feel safe to give the movie an 8.Oh and one thing I initially forgot In reality there could be even more dead... The movie takes the former natural lethality of smallpox abut 30 as a premise.

Those BW agents kill extremely fast and very dramatically but they aren't as unpredictably and explosively contagious.The bottom line is that despite the anthrax letters I am much more scared of an organized group like alQaeda sprinkling a couple of kilograms of weaponized inhalational anthraw over New York City than the scenario described in this movie.That being said I do hope that the civil defense planners here and around the world watch it and take note.I think that it would have been much more likely ending to find a Koran with a verse from it underlined given the manifest terrorist threat that we face than a Bible.

That cycle already over 20 years old was near exhaustion too many of its repertory company were looking and feeling their years to remain funny in saucily physical capers. Bless This House guides them into middle aged domesticity without forfeiting all the Carry On spirit of mischief and misrule.Behind the camera the producer director and composer were Carry On veterans too though screenplay duties passed from the incomparably lewd Talbot Rothwell to Dave Freeman. The TV concept is intact Sid James too long in the tooth to chase girls is now a modestly prosperous semidetached suburban salesman. His taste for football and booze is constrained by his duties to a wife who wants more independence a disheveled art student son and a naive schoolgirl daughter. The arrival of a stuffy nextdoor neighbour gives Sid more headaches but after mild pratfalls and back chat all ends well at the altar. Animal House it isn't.James now pipe smoking and cardigan retains the most suggestive laugh on screen. Diana Coupland a band singer turned actress is a nicely supportive sometimes indignant foil. As the simian son Robin Askwith gives his buttocks less of a rhythmical workout than in the contemporary Confessions films. Sally Geeson sister of Judy squeaks and flaps as the idealistic daughter. A ripe selection of character comedians surrounds the family led by Terry Scott and June Whitfield as the new neighbors. They almost make the production a spinoff of their longrunning marital sitcom as well albeit Scott's film character is more pompous.Allusions to hippiedom Women's Lib and ecological doommongering Geeson devours an Ehrlichlike tract called Mankind is Doomed and leads the Junior AntiPollution League place the film firmly in the glamrock Seventies but its core is pretty timeless domestic humour. Sid looks weary and too much under the cosh of domesticity at times but his timing and delivery are crisp as ever. The move from TV allows more expansive slapstick and quicker storytelling the spirit of the original which ran till James's death four years later is preserved. Like the Carry Ons these sitcom spinoffs were critically derided when released. They look far better now. Porridge and Dad's Army are the cream as on television Bless This House is not in their league but it remains a mildly funny and endearing time killer 30 years on like On the Buses and For the Love of Ada. It seemed this domestic kind of sitcom had been banished for ever by the pseudosophisticates and neophilias who run British television but the success of BBC1's My Family created by an American abroad echoes the Abbotts in their treelined ITV avenue.".

A year later a spinoff feature film hit cinemas following the route taken by 'Till Death Us Do Part' and 'On The Buses'. With Peter Rogers and Gerald Thomas in charge it was bound to wind up looking like a 'Carry On' and did. The first and most sensible thing they did was replace boring Robin Stewart with cheeky Robin Askwith as Sid's son 'Mike'. Secondly they brought in Peter Butterworth to play Sid's friend and nextdoor neighbour 'Trevor Lewis'. While I liked Anthony Jackson's 'Trevor' Butterworth and Sid are a far more natural comedy team. Thirdly they had Terry Scott and June Whitfield as the Abbott's new neighbours 'Ronald' and 'Vera Baines'. Scott's character is not the lovable 'Terry' of 'Happy Ever AfterTerry  June' but a pompous snob. These changes benefited the movie enormously though I wish the Geoff Love theme tune had been retained. Eric Rogers provided the new music.Dave Freeman's script lacks a central binding plot consisting mainly of subplots such as Mike bringing home a right banger of a car Jean and Betty running an old junk stall in a local market Sid's attempts to make wine in a homemade distillery in his shed Mike getting a job in a fastfood restaurant  where he meets and falls in love with 'Kate' played by Carol Hawkins of 'The Fenn Street Gang'  Sid and Jean attempting to conceal the damage they have made to the Baines' lounge whilst attempting to remove an overmantle and Sid and Ronald engaging in open warfare of the 'Love Thy Neighbour' sort. Interesting to hear 'Sally'  Sally Geeson  expressing concerns for the environment. We could laugh at her in those days. She was dead right though wasn't she? And she looks great in a bikini! Some sterling performers in small roles including George A.Cooper as the owner of the restaurant where Mike works Bill Maynard as the market owner who has a roving eye Wendy Richard as a waitress Johnny Briggs as a lorry driver Janet Brown  who was Peter Butterworth's wife  as their soontoleave neighbour with Julian Orchard as her husband.Funniest moment  Sid and Ronald turning up late at the church for Mike and Kate's wedding in a fire engine! Some reviewers have said the film is a useful time capsule of '70's Britain. It is not  Britain was never this nice a place to live. It hardly matters though. 'House' is a pleasant way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon.".

There's a lack of imagination about the whole thing  but it's gentle and inoffensive. The cast including the minor roles such as the waitress played by Wendy Richards are familiar British situation comedy actors. It's that cosy familiarity that is the making or breaking of the piece. Making a film based on a TV series is rarely a good idea. What may be a pleasant halfhour spent at home while chatting to friends and family can become stretched and dull over three times that length. There are plenty of better ways of passing the time than watching this damp squid.".

	schema:reviewBody "With 'Bless This House' proving a hit on ITV it was inevitable that a feature film spinoff would eventually appear. This 1972 film was written by Dave Freeman and produced by Gerald Thomas both of which worked with Sid James on the 'Carry On' films. With those credits it is perhaps unsurprising that 'Bless This House' turned out like one of Gerald Thomas' seaside romps. Not especially a bad thing but all the same it contradicts the television counterpart which was a family show.Most of the cast are present and correct. Diana Coupland reprises her role as Sid's wife Jean as do Sally Geeson as Sid and Jean's scatty daughter Sally and Patsy Rowlands as their nagging neighbour Betty. Peter Butterworth replaces Anthony Jackson as Trevor while Robin Askwith replaces Robin Stewart as Sid and Jean's hippie like son Mike. Terry Scott and June Whitfield play Sid and Jean's new neighbours Ronald and Vera Baines. Unlike Terry from 'Happy Ever After' and 'Terry  June' Baines is an unlikeable toffeenosed twit who takes great delight in winding up Sid.The film while not bad is slightly messy. There is no real plot as such. Mike buys a scrappile of a car which doesn't even have the road credibility of a lawn mower Sally attempts to fight against those who pollute the planet Jean and Betty attempt to set up a jumble sale stall to sell junk given to them by their neighbours Sid tries to repair damage he made to his neighbours house by trying to remove a hideous overmantle.The main part of the movie focuses on Mike's relationship with Kate the Baines' beautiful daughter who ends up getting a job at the same caf where Mike is working.The supporting cast is made up of the likes of Tommy Godfrey Wendy Richard George A. Cooper Janet Brown Julian Orchard and Frank Thornton. Carol Hawkins plays Kate who during the '70's was one of the hottest women on the small and big screen. Robin Askwith at this time was to be seen starring in the saucy 'Confessions' movies.The year after this film went on television 'Bless This House' was back on television for another series with Robin Stewart and Anthony Jackson reprising their respective roles. 'Bless This House' at its best was good saucy unassuming fun which helps wile away a pleasant hour and a half though as I pretty much covered before it is in an entirely different league to the series.Funniest moment  the 'panama hat' fiasco! I can't do it justice here but it is a hilarious scene and it cracks me up each time.".

This spin off movie is not too bad but it is nothing exceptional.The good things It is nicely filmed the cinematography is very nice and the scenery lush and the music is beautiful it has a nice whimsical feel to it. The costumes are also nice to look at by today's standards perhaps the fashion may be outdated and perhaps naff but in a glorious way. The best thing though is the casting. Sidney James who I have loved since the Carry On franchisewhich I admit I still enjoy is incomparable as Sid. He just has a warm and fun presence whenever he is on screen as the grouchy father and it is this presence that saves the film. The remainder of the cast are good too Sally Geeson is rather soso in the acting department though it was nice to see her in a bikini but Peter Butterworth Wendy Richard Diana Coupland and June Whitfield are great value.The not so good things The film does feel a little too short at only 85 or so minutes. If it was made 5 minutes longer some scenes could have been expanded on. The script does have some funny exchanges such as Has his steering gone? I don't know whether it is his steering or him! but some of the material doesn't quite make the most of the running time. The humour here is amusing but nothing quotable or sidesplittingly funny and there were times when the slapstick was a little too much.Overall not bad but unexceptional. 710 Bethany Cox".

There aren't really any standout gags to mention but most of the cast are quite charming and there's plenty of mileage in the illegaldistillery antics in the garden shed.With Gerald Thomas directing and Peter Rogers producing not to mention Sid James starring this feels very much like a late CARRY ON film and it has an easygoing edge over some of the lacklustre entries in that series.

The contrast between eerie cop shop and stark beautiful prairies is a stylish treat for the eyes. The performances are believable and compelling. Well cast without exception. The little girl is surprisingly good. Her even performance made me wonder about what had happened to her and drew me into the story. When she wasn't on screen I worried about her safety. The ending is a clever eerie choice. I was taken completely by surprise and I usually predict a telegraphed ending a mile away. In this case any other choice would be a copout pardon the pun. I was glad that the director resisted the temptation for a bloodfest. It could have gone much further in that vein. Instead the tension relied upon intelligent visual storytelling. Kudos to everyone involved. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jennifer Chambers Lynch one would assume had been nursing her pride from the dreadful reception of her debut Boxing Helena. Fifteen years later she releases Surveillance. This one a murder mystery is a major improvement but it still has problems. It is a wellcrafted seventy minute movie with a remaining twenty minutes of clumsiness bad writing and a twist which unfortunately is predictable. The movie comes apart when it needs to come together and the result is medium good when it could have been very good.FBI agents Anderson and Halloway for months have been investigating a series of interstate serial killings. The latest chapter in their investigation brings the stories of two oddball cops a discommunal family on a road trip and a couple of cokesnorting kids together in Rashomon fashion. I like the way Surveillance plays out. Lynch keeps everything slow and mannered unlike Boxing Helena which is overblown from the beginning. Lynch is able to keep the film under control but unfortunately is unable to pull the wool over the viewer's eyes. The answers we are looking for become obvious too quickly making one question whether her intention was to have the viewer fooled or not. Survaillance is not designed to be conventional thriller. It is too deep and psychological for that but it sort of ends like one.If I was gonna label Surveillance in a word it would be 'bitter'. When it's over you come to realize that none of the characters save one or two small roles are all that respectable. Lynch's screenplay breaks them down into those who mistreat and those who get mistreated sometimes both. On a positive note it contributes significantly to the drama or tension of the picture. There is a major lack of heart to the film although at the same time there is a certain lack of credibility as a side effect. Any attempt to explain may be a spoiler so I wont go that far but that raises another question...If I don't intend to spoil it does that mean I am recommending it? Well truth be told I didn't dislike Surveillance. It is eerie and grim which is certain a plus for a thriller but the outcome is kind of disappointing. My advice watch it only if you are curious but it is not a movie that needs to be seen.".

	schema:headline " This is what happens when you try to look smarter than you are";
	schema:reviewBody "Surveillance starts so promising... its a pretty raw movie and from the obscure opening on to the landscape shots introduction of the characters until the unfolding of the stories begins its interesting while not using any music or effects or whatever. Basically the movie is about a couple of FBI agents who are interrogating three survivors of a bloody crime and trying to find out what happened. The way the story is told through the eyes of the different survivors who all got something to hide and therefore all tell different stories while the real occurrences are shown is really interesting and tense. The characters especially the twisted corrupt cops the little girl and the drugaddict are also great and everyone in that backwoods police station where the interrogations take place delivers. Funny thing is... to me the 2 FBI agents are the least interesting although they are the main characters.So the whole story is unfolding interweaving different points of views and everyone being suspicious the crime is even shown in a pretty brutal way and the movie has a strange nihilistic feeling to it right until the bleak closing shot. Especially the way how the corrupt cops act out somehow really got to me.But then in its most important part the final resolution of the story they go for a twist of the most idiotic kind...SPOILER ALERTThe FBI agents are the killers and the whole movie was just a kind of sick mind game. Yeah pretty smart... problem is that nothing makes any sense at all. You don't get explanations to why they make such a big hassle of interrogating everyone for hours just to kill them in the end and having some strange sexual pleasure of it. Sure the real FBI agents are found dead in a hotel room and identified by their badges but how the hell our 2 smartasses identified themselves as FBI agents?

	onyx:emotionText "Surveillance starts so promising... its a pretty raw movie and from the obscure opening on to the landscape shots introduction of the characters until the unfolding of the stories begins its interesting while not using any music or effects or whatever. Basically the movie is about a couple of FBI agents who are interrogating three survivors of a bloody crime and trying to find out what happened. The way the story is told through the eyes of the different survivors who all got something to hide and therefore all tell different stories while the real occurrences are shown is really interesting and tense. The characters especially the twisted corrupt cops the little girl and the drugaddict are also great and everyone in that backwoods police station where the interrogations take place delivers. Funny thing is... to me the 2 FBI agents are the least interesting although they are the main characters.So the whole story is unfolding interweaving different points of views and everyone being suspicious the crime is even shown in a pretty brutal way and the movie has a strange nihilistic feeling to it right until the bleak closing shot. Especially the way how the corrupt cops act out somehow really got to me.But then in its most important part the final resolution of the story they go for a twist of the most idiotic kind...SPOILER ALERTThe FBI agents are the killers and the whole movie was just a kind of sick mind game. Yeah pretty smart... problem is that nothing makes any sense at all. You don't get explanations to why they make such a big hassle of interrogating everyone for hours just to kill them in the end and having some strange sexual pleasure of it. Sure the real FBI agents are found dead in a hotel room and identified by their badges but how the hell our 2 smartasses identified themselves as FBI agents? How did they learn to set up and operate their interrogation surveillance equipment and why does the little girl only tell her secrets to the most demented people around... first the cops after harassing her family then the killer who killed her family. No explanation in any of the actions of her or her family.

	schema:reviewBody "This must be the worst thriller I have seen in a long long time. The directing the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time. Within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery. I guessed this within the first few minutes and I kept hoping I was wrong and much to my dismay I was not.The film starts off with two FBI agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses a young girl a drug addict and a cop. They are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account of the day. Each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts. This part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better.Spoiler The whole story ends in the FBI agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left unhurt by them.Why do they go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place? How did they get away with pretending to be FBI agents when you discover that real FBI agents had been killed and their badges were found on them? How did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras?Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end. Maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end. Come on they both look ridiculous stupid and not sinister in the least. The character of the young girl is also wasted potential. There is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal. She does not appear distressed but rather detached which again is not explained. Awful film on the whole.".

	onyx:emotionText "This must be the worst thriller I have seen in a long long time. The directing the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time. Within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery. I guessed this within the first few minutes and I kept hoping I was wrong and much to my dismay I was not.The film starts off with two FBI agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses a young girl a drug addict and a cop. They are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account of the day. Each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts. This part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better.Spoiler The whole story ends in the FBI agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left unhurt by them.Why do they go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place? How did they get away with pretending to be FBI agents when you discover that real FBI agents had been killed and their badges were found on them? How did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras?Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end. Maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end. Come on they both look ridiculous stupid and not sinister in the least. The character of the young girl is also wasted potential. There is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal. She does not appear distressed but rather detached which again is not explained. Awful film on the whole.";

Several reviews warned that the first 20 minutes or so could be interpreted as comical and indeed they were. When the plot finally got kicking I was intrigued for a good five minutes but was mislead into caring about the characters by the surprisingly wonderful cinematography. While that may seem like a good thing for the movie it wasn't. As the movie plays out and you find yourself not caring in the slightest when characters are killed off you realize you have zero connection with any of the characters. With the exception of the older and younger blond that's how forgettable the characters are I don't even know their names or remember if they even had names the acting is on par with a 5th grade production. All the characters are extremely exaggerated to the point of detachment from anyone you can relate to. The twist was unpredictable yet unsatisfying as there is no explanation or reason for their tirade. The final scene is ridiculously stupid. It's as if the writers couldn't take a risk in dealing with a certain character so instead they just leave you stranded.This movie is NOT recommended.".

Which means they are also investigating themselves. Jennifer is not David but she tries to be. The problem is she doesn't have his talent or his ability to create a real identifiable world into which darkness can be threaded. This is all darkness and all misery. Lynch opts for a cynical boring pandering thriller with no thrills. The violence is graphic at times but it has no context. Worse there is not one character we care about. That this sorry nonsense just won top prize at Sitges over the way superior Martyrs and the fresh Let The Right One In is a disgrace and undermines that fine festival's credibility.

It has to be the most cringeworthy embarrassing episode of his career. But the rest of the cast also do their best to follow his lead.

At any rate I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange I doubt I've ever called a movie stupid but that was the first word that came to mind about onethird in and stayed in my mind until the end.Where to begin? Unbelievable premise and reactions incredibly braindead characters could blame the writing or the actors or I'll just blame both and enormously bad acting. I'd sooner believe Bill Pullman as President of the USA than a FBI agent here. Of course there's a reason for that and I'll partially go into that. And to top it off if you can't figure the socalled shocking twist in the first 5 minutes then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late. Don't worry they'll tell you the twist every five minutes thereafter.There's been some serial killers on the loose in the most depressing town in the county or world. But there's more to the story! Some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement. Could there possibly be more? Oh yeah there's a family well maybe not but there are four humans one boy one girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole sees dead people in The Sixth Sense. There's gotta be more to this than what I mentioned! That's what makes a movie interesting! Adding as many subplots that maymay not be developed is the way to go! Okay then I'll continue. We have goofy FBI agents that made me laugh. A pair of giggling druggies who's shocked at first their dealer OD's but then resorts to robbery. A goshtooting greatguy cop who must've been put in for comic relief who's always battling an angrysuspicious cop. And finally poor poor Michael Ironside who didn't just phone his performance in he barely text it in.None of these work. They're all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks and believe me you'll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin. In addition the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all. I guess I'm referring mostly to the cops but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks.This stupid stupid movie stinks. It's barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was unless his exposure has been limited to Goosebumps stories. And what's with the title? Surveillance? Oh I get it it's because it was used in 150 subplots just to film interviews. Since that's so random it might as well been called COP CAR BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrid mess.".

Robert Montgomery is able to switch between Farnsworth and Joe Pendelton in a split second  When he switches to Murdoch you have a slight difference in speech and walk between Murdoch and Joe. The James Gleason scene in the gym with Montgomery is perfection.  I love Claude Rains facial expressions and Edward Everett Horton's bumbling.  The dectective's line I believe he is William McBride a great comic actor of the 1940's Where's the body is one that I use as a joke with my husband often.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is my favorite film because of the comic and dramatic acting. Robert Montgomery is able to switch between Farnsworth and Joe Pendelton in a split second  When he switches to Murdoch you have a slight difference in speech and walk between Murdoch and Joe. The James Gleason scene in the gym with Montgomery is perfection.  I love Claude Rains facial expressions and Edward Everett Horton's bumbling.  The dectective's line I believe he is William McBride a great comic actor of the 1940's Where's the body is one that I use as a joke with my husband often.

Of course when you've got a new heavenly retriever on the job like Edward Everett Horton anything is possible.He snatches prize fighter Robert Montgomery from a private plane that's about to crash. Only problem is that Montgomery wasn't supposed to die in the crash. What to do send for Claude Rains in the title role as the heavenly fixer Mr. Jordan.Montgomery goes through two different bodies after that in an effort to give him the life span that the heavenly records are supposed to have for him. In one of those guises he meets Evelyn Keyes for whom he falls big time and she him. Of course there's a problem because Montgomery is a millionaire married to Rita Johnson who with his private secretary John Emery is trying to kill him.Through all of this lending his confused elfin charm is James Gleason as Montgomery's fight manager. Seems as though Gleason had a destiny also to manage a heavyweight champion. Gleason got his career role in Here Comes Mr. Jordan as he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor but lost to Donald Crisp for How Green Was My Valley. The film itself was Columbia's entry in the Best Picture category but also lost to How Green Was My Valley.This was Robert Montgomery's second Oscar nomination and the movie going public accepted him as good natured saxophone playing pug Joe Pendleton a lot better than the homicidal maniac in Night Must Fall his first and other Oscar nomination. This time Montgomery lost to Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.My favorite in this film however is the wise and patient Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan. One thing the film does do is that the end will have you wondering whether the whole thing really was Montgomery's destiny. Some of Rains's expressions will keep you guessing.".

Montgomery who for years did light comedy as an elegant leading man is wonderful as a streetwise prizefighter. James Gleason as Joe's manager Corkle has some great comic moments when he meets up with Farnsworth and Farnsworth claims to be the dead Joe. Evelyn Keyes is lovely in the ingnue role and Rita Johnson makes an excellent murderous wife. Claude Rains played the devil in another film and as Mr. Jordan apparently works with the Head Honcho on the other side.

The fascination with death angels destiny and souls was understandably rampant as reflected by Hollywood from 19411948 as people sought to understand what happened to their loved ones.Here Comes Mr. Jordan is one of the really fine examples of this genre with beautiful performances and story.

Joe's body is promptly cremated so his new friend Mr. Jordan promises Joe a new form and they begin a search for a replacement. The 1941 film centers around Joe Pendleton an affable man and a capable boxer who is on his way to a fight whenever he meets his untimely death. With the help of Mr. Jordan Joe attempts to reverse his misfortune with a new body and a fresh opportunity to enter the title fight. Along the way however he meets the unexpected a beautiful independent and charmingly belligerent woman that he falls hopelessly in love with. The film centers around Joe's struggle to realize his dream of winning a title fight however it is truly a romantic comedy with themes that tend to focus on love and the fulfillment of our dreams. The makers of the film use Joe's different forms to impart their view that love is a connection between two people while the body is simply a shell and love is a faceless awareness that sees through physical realities. Don't be turned off by this seemingly heavy theme because Joe's constant wisecracks and frequent squabbles with the man who took him from his body keep the film light and enjoyable. Despite the occasional sluggish scene this timeless film offers enough cleancut comedy and bearable romanticism to warrant a viewing. It deals with an important subject without taking any importance away from keeping the film light and fun to watch.".

Robert Montgomery is very good as the saxaphoneplaying boxer who outwardly seems rough but inwardly has a heart of goldokay it gave me cliches too.  The cast in this film excels. Montgomery is ably assisted by Claude Rains James Gleason Evelyn Keyes and my personal favourite Edward Everett Horton.  Rains plays the heavenly Mr. Jordan trying to fix Horton's heavenly blunder.  Rains is as always very good and his scenes in particular bring a warm glow to the screen.  My favourite moments however are the scenes with rains and Horton talking shop and the ones with Horton and Montgomery bantering back and forth. Horton is a forgotten mine of comedic ability.  Many reviewers seem obligated to make comparisons between this film and its most famous remake Heaven Can Wait.  I like them both.  Both films have qualities that exceed the other.  Why we have to say one is better solely because it is olderor newer is beyond me sometime.".

I just saw it again and I still love it!The plot is pretty silly but the whole film is done with a very light touch and the cast pulls it off.  Nobody seems to be taking it too seriously which is good.  Montgomery is very good in his roleif a little too over the top at times.  Keyes is sweet and charmingshe does wonders with the good girl role.  Horton is very funny as one of the collectors and Rains is just fantastic as Mr. Jordana perfectly done performance no surprise coming from Rains.  More screen time with Jordan could have helped.  But as it is it's just very good.  I'm only giving it an 8it's funny...but not enough. The jokes made me smile once in a while but that's about it.  A huge hit in it's day.This understandably won two Academy Awards for Best Story and Screenplay. It was nominated for Best Picture Actor Supporting Actor Director and Cinematography.Worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Harry Segall's play Heaven Can Wait Alexander Hall's 1941 original film adaptation boasts some fine performances although the overall effort is pale in comparison to Warren Beatty's 1978 update. Boxer Joe Pendleton's soul is prematurely pulled from his body by an overeager angel played by Edward Everett Horton who wanted to save him from the pain of impending death in a plane crash. When Mr. Jordan an angelic corporate manager realizes the mistake he tries to compensate with a comparable body to replace Pendleton's which has been cremated.Here Comes Mr. Jordan falls in the supernatural genre that attempts to reassure viewers that the afterlife is comfortingly similar to the physical world. Robert Montgomery gives a fine performance as Pendleton who is choosy about his replacement body because he has aspirations to a boxing championship. When he tries out murdered millionaire Bruce Farnsworth's body he becomes involved with a young woman in trouble a scheming wife and secretary and his incredulous boxing manager from the Pendleton days. Hall keeps the pacing brisk and the film is a tight 94 minutes. Besides Montgomery James Gleason is fine as the manager and Horton plays the discretely coded gay character as well as ever. Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan is right for the role although restrained. Unfortunately for those familiar with Heaven Can Wait the Beatty remake the roles of the wife and secretary are lackluster in comparison to the inspired turns by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin. Evelyn Keyes as Betty also suffers when compared to Julie Christie.The general tone of Here Comes Mr. Jordan is more serious than that of its remake and viewers may prefer the hilarity of Grodin and Cannon to the straight performances by Rita Johnson and John Emery in the original. However the film's mood shift may owe to the differing historical periods. Perhaps a world on the verge of World War II was looking for reassurance that lost loved ones would live on while viewers in the late 1970's approached the same subject matter as escapist romantic fancy. Either way the story remains durable and entertaining and both versions were showered with Oscar nominations. Take your pick or better yet watch them both and judge for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every decade has had a film or two made about the afterlife or some aspect of it. The 1940s spurred a rash of such films. It's a Wonderful Life of 1946 is perhaps the best known. Heaven Can Wait and A Guy Named Joe were two such films released in 1943. The Ghost and Mrs. Muir came out in 1947. Another 1946 film was A Matter of Life and Death. Between Two Worlds was released in 1944. Here Comes Mr. Jordan of 1941 may have started the surge. The idea for the plot is a catchy one and the movie won two Oscars for the original story and screenplay. While billed as a comedyromance and fantasy this film also has crime and corruption including murder. The plot is focused on Robert Montgomery who plays Joe Pendleton with his metaphysical changes into other bodies and characters. The story keeps a light and humorous air even with a subplot within the main story of a woman and boyfriend killing her wealthy husband. It includes some crime and corruption in the fight game. Then it toys with adultery in the form of Joe's newest incarnation in the body of a married man. So the plot is a little shaky in places with the humor seeming out of place. The writing may be good but the comedic atmosphere with these scenes just doesn't feel right. The acting is soso for most of the players. Claude Rains is Mr. Jordan and Edward Everett Horton is Messenger 7013. They are Joe's contacts in the afterlife. The only other notable role is by James Gleason as Max Corkle. He was Joe's trainer when Joe was a clean cut boxer on his way to the top. The best humor involves scenes with Max talking to Joe who no one could see or hear. Max finally learns that Joe has come back in other bodies when Joe in those bodies tells him the story and gives him details that no one else could possibly know. The romance is quite a stretch and some of the cast are wooden in their roles. It's an OK story and lightly entertaining for adults. Most of the afterlife movies noted above from the 1940s are better films than this one. But none of them are comedies. Then again how really funny is this one? A fight is fixed a married couple step out on each other a guy is drowned and then shot when he reappears alive. Great humor huh? Maybe some other reviewers and I watched different films.".

Claude Rains is Mr. Jordan and Edward Everett Horton is Messenger 7013. They are Joe's contacts in the afterlife. The only other notable role is by James Gleason as Max Corkle. He was Joe's trainer when Joe was a clean cut boxer on his way to the top. The best humor involves scenes with Max talking to Joe who no one could see or hear. Max finally learns that Joe has come back in other bodies when Joe in those bodies tells him the story and gives him details that no one else could possibly know. The romance is quite a stretch and some of the cast are wooden in their roles. It's an OK story and lightly entertaining for adults. Most of the afterlife movies noted above from the 1940s are better films than this one. But none of them are comedies. Then again how really funny is this one? A fight is fixed a married couple step out on each other a guy is drowned and then shot when he reappears alive. Great humor huh? Maybe some other reviewers and I watched different films.";

Plot sees Montgomery as boxer Joe Pendleton who during a journey in a small plane finds himself crashing towards the earth but then suddenly finds that he is in heaven. Turns out that his soul was saved before the crash impact by angel 7013 Horton who assumed that he wouldn't have survived the crash. Bad call tho because it wasn't Pendleton's time he's not due to die for another 50 years! So superior angel Mr. Jordan Rains escorts him back to Earth but the trouble is is that Joe's body has been cremated by his boxing manager Max Gleason so the search is on for a new body for Joe to exist in. First stop a murder victim!Fun and appealing comedy that offers up dry observations on the afterlife and keeps its romantic plot strand on the warm side of the bed. It's that the makers can marry up the comedy to the romance so well that makes the film so utterly beguiling. The characters are easily to warm too so as the plot delightfully twists and turns we are happy to run with them into each well written corner. The film is also very well casted with Montgomery bullish without over doing it and Rains elegant and enjoying his role. But the joys come in the support cast with Horton all prissy as the over zealous 7013 and Gleason playing it spot on as the bemused and incredulous manager. Bonus too is that the ending offers up a two fold resolution that shows a better hand than many other comedies of the era.Uncynical if a touch routine Here Comes Mr. Jordan is heartily recommended fare to the classic comedy seeker. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The several published criticisms linked by IMDB are all over the map about this movie not only as to their reactions to the artfilm mood a negative reaction to which although I can't say I really understand one must admit clearly reflects many people's values and expectations in cinematic entertainment these days but even as to Brandauer's acting a craft about which one would think one could be objective.Well I'm here to say I liked it all.  So art films like this give art films a bad name?  And what Hollywood is now serving up as standard fare everlouder explosions flashier collisions and interminable series of action scenes so frenetic as to make the whole idea of suspension of disbelief a moot issue doesn't give anything whatsoever a bad name? Sorry beside that I'll be a sucker for woozy art films if that's what they are any day. We need a few more.About a film like this one is able to ponder to wonder what might be implied and to ask questions even about what might not have been implied.So the acting is poor by giving the impression that the Baron and Mrs. Tuchman even as they were becoming lovers loathed each other?  This is a reallife possibility you know.  To give just one example suppose that I have such low selfesteem as to feel unattractive even a freak and to take it for granted that no one would take any initiative towards me.  Then someone does. What might I feel?  Perhaps I'd feel that the other person must be weird too has a fetish for the kind of freak I am.  Furthermore since I am not worth loving the other person cannot possibly want to love me but wants something less worthy from me.  Because I loathe myself I must loathe anyone who gets close to me.If there is a subtle loathing between these two characters in this film it is not a flaw because it is perfectly in order to ponder how or why that might be beneath the surface there are things beneath the surface.  Not a lot of movies made today would support such a complicated sentiment.  One critic evidently was too used to them.Another point to ponder what did Edmund tell his father?  The usual assumption is that although he intended to reveal his mother's unfaithfulness at the last minute he drew back and concealed it.  I'm not so sure about that.  Everything indicates that Mr. Tuchman is a very wise and gentle man with exceptional insight into the labyrinths of the human heart and Edmund is a boy who expresses his feelings with a touching forthrightness and sincerity and who despises lying. Just maybe he told the truth the whole truth his mother was very lonely so much that she was taken in and seduced by a very deceitful man and the incident left her sorry and even more miserable than before. It seems to me that when the father met her again he knew everything.  Diplomat that he was he realized then that his professional burdens had caused him to neglect his wife and he was quietly going to make amends.  There is nothing more to say about this.  Would such a man be unaware if his own son had just concocted a tissue of lies?  It would be quite ironic if he of all people congratulated his son for becoming a man due to a successful coverup.  Or is he congratulating him for developing diplomacy to know the truth but not necessarily to tell the truth in so many words.  However it happened Edmund's father knew and Edmund was the messenger. They had an understanding.To know all is to forgive all.  Is this what the film suggests?  And if so is it true?  These are the questions which perceptive critics should be debating.One might ponder the echoes of World War I reverberating around the plot. The baron had been wounded by an American soldier.  Edmund was an American. Edmund's father was an American. Edmund's mother was not.  Perhaps revenge was part of his motives.  I hasten to say that I caught no such overtones in Zweig's short story and would expect none because he was very much an internationalist.  Perhaps we have a subtle innovation on the part of the moviemakers here but it only increases the interest.Finally the baron's behavior towards Edmund after developing such a blissful friendship with romantic suggestions was so callous that it could not have done this boy who was also lonely any emotional good.  And all this to chalk up one more casual female conquest.  How much better a man might he have been were he truly interested in Edmund the way he at first appeared to be.".

	onyx:emotionText "The several published criticisms linked by IMDB are all over the map about this movie not only as to their reactions to the artfilm mood a negative reaction to which although I can't say I really understand one must admit clearly reflects many people's values and expectations in cinematic entertainment these days but even as to Brandauer's acting a craft about which one would think one could be objective.Well I'm here to say I liked it all.  So art films like this give art films a bad name?  And what Hollywood is now serving up as standard fare everlouder explosions flashier collisions and interminable series of action scenes so frenetic as to make the whole idea of suspension of disbelief a moot issue doesn't give anything whatsoever a bad name? Sorry beside that I'll be a sucker for woozy art films if that's what they are any day. We need a few more.About a film like this one is able to ponder to wonder what might be implied and to ask questions even about what might not have been implied.So the acting is poor by giving the impression that the Baron and Mrs. Tuchman even as they were becoming lovers loathed each other?  This is a reallife possibility you know.  To give just one example suppose that I have such low selfesteem as to feel unattractive even a freak and to take it for granted that no one would take any initiative towards me.  Then someone does. What might I feel?  Perhaps I'd feel that the other person must be weird too has a fetish for the kind of freak I am.  Furthermore since I am not worth loving the other person cannot possibly want to love me but wants something less worthy from me.  Because I loathe myself I must loathe anyone who gets close to me.If there is a subtle loathing between these two characters in this film it is not a flaw because it is perfectly in order to ponder how or why that might be beneath the surface there are things beneath the surface.  Not a lot of movies made today would support such a complicated sentiment.  One critic evidently was too used to them.Another point to ponder what did Edmund tell his father?  The usual assumption is that although he intended to reveal his mother's unfaithfulness at the last minute he drew back and concealed it.  I'm not so sure about that.  Everything indicates that Mr. Tuchman is a very wise and gentle man with exceptional insight into the labyrinths of the human heart and Edmund is a boy who expresses his feelings with a touching forthrightness and sincerity and who despises lying. Just maybe he told the truth the whole truth his mother was very lonely so much that she was taken in and seduced by a very deceitful man and the incident left her sorry and even more miserable than before. It seems to me that when the father met her again he knew everything.  Diplomat that he was he realized then that his professional burdens had caused him to neglect his wife and he was quietly going to make amends.  There is nothing more to say about this.  Would such a man be unaware if his own son had just concocted a tissue of lies?  It would be quite ironic if he of all people congratulated his son for becoming a man due to a successful coverup.  Or is he congratulating him for developing diplomacy to know the truth but not necessarily to tell the truth in so many words.  However it happened Edmund's father knew and Edmund was the messenger. They had an understanding.To know all is to forgive all.  Is this what the film suggests?  And if so is it true?  These are the questions which perceptive critics should be debating.One might ponder the echoes of World War I reverberating around the plot. The baron had been wounded by an American soldier.  Edmund was an American. Edmund's father was an American. Edmund's mother was not.  Perhaps revenge was part of his motives.  I hasten to say that I caught no such overtones in Zweig's short story and would expect none because he was very much an internationalist.  Perhaps we have a subtle innovation on the part of the moviemakers here but it only increases the interest.Finally the baron's behavior towards Edmund after developing such a blissful friendship with romantic suggestions was so callous that it could not have done this boy who was also lonely any emotional good.  And all this to chalk up one more casual female conquest.  How much better a man might he have been were he truly interested in Edmund the way he at first appeared to be.";

The sometimes uneven Dunaway is just wonderful here and still very beautiful when this was made. David Eberts as her son is also very fine and believable.

THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is also an emotionally disturbing film which demonstrates the pain and distress of having to cope with the loss of a love one.  It serves as a chilling reminder of how human beings can easily succumb to the power of suffering.  THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is a tautly made film dealing with the psychological mind but most importantly of all it is a thriller that leaves you on the edgeofyourseat from the first frame to the finish.Duke Togo a.k.a. Golgo 13 is an assassin for hire.  He does not care about his clients at all he only cares about himself and his money.  Devoid of emotion Golgo's life is predominated by violence and sex.  Golgo's latest mission is to terminate Mr. Robert Dawson the son of a wealthy oilbusiness baron Leonard Dawson.  With just a single bullet Golgo 13 has successfully accomplished this task.  Meanwhile Mr. Leonard Dawson understandably aggravated with the death of his only son has vowed to terminate this assassin once and for all.  Leonard Dawson is usually use to getting what he wants' but this entrepreneur does not realize what a formidable foe Golgo 13 might be...Desperate Leonard Dawson has hired a number of professional mercenaries and agencies to assist him in tracking and eliminating his loose cannon.  Along the way Dawson has employed a ruthless coldblooded killer named Snake' to personally make sure that Golgo 13 suffer a violent and painful demise...However Golgo 13 always manages to be ahead of the game.  Whenever danger strikes this elusive hitman always succeeds in escaping with his life.  He is quick agile and intuitive but consequently he is a man with little sentiment...Golgo 13 is constantly on the run from the menacing villains of every color. Will Golgo 13 be able to save his own skin...or will he truly meet his match with a professional adversary?THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is certainly an adultoriented tale.  This is an extremely sickening film with grotesque deaths being shown in explicit detail second by second.  The color red tends to literally predominate the screen at times.  Typical of the Japanese animation style is also the gratuitous use of frontal female nudity especially since virtually every female in this movie removes her clothes at least once during the film's duration.  Indeed as shown by the abundance of sanguinary violence softcore sex scenes Golgo's lovemaking scene with Cindy' is particularly steamy. and unclothed females THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is animation made strictly for mature audiences.It would be unfair to dismiss THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  just because of its excessive violence and nudity.  Unlike most films of this caliber what is admiring about this movie is that though it is full of sex and violence it does not let those two qualities overshadow the film's technical and also rather profound attributes.  First the technical accomplishments in this movie are plentiful.  The camerawork and editing are stylishly done. They often shift from the use of freeze frames to slow motion sequences to split screen features.  The animation too is marvelous the use of different colors and lighting effects are utilized to the first degree in order to symbolize a certain character's behavior such as pleasure or anger.  As well the computer generated action scenes near the end are themselves a masterfully created piece of work.  THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  contains some of the best artwork and details of a modern animated feature.THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is also a trenchant character study.  This movie shows the mental anguish and vulnerability in the human soul as demonstrated by the erratic behavior Leonard Dawson displays.  THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  spares no punches as it illustrates that human misery does not only affect the individual himself it could also affect his loved ones just as sharply.  This motion picture shows as well how an obsession with revenge will leave a person devastated even more deeply.  It is a very sad movie indeed but this movie dares you to actually show sorrow for many of the characters involved in the predicament...What makes THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  even more remarkable is the film's diversely outrageous cast of characters.  They range from the sick and bizarre lunatic Snake' to the deformed twins Gold' and Silver' and then to the sexy lascivious lady Cindy.'  The breakthrough character sketches in this movie plus the stateoftheart animation make the viewer believe that instead of watching a lame cartoon heshe is experiencing an actual feature presentation.  THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is truly number one...with a bullet.'Overall THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is a unique experience.  Unlike most superficial onedimensional cartoon presentations THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is a realistic albeit still an animated feature film that is rather plaintive bleak and depressing.  At the same time though THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  will leave you breathless as the amazing action and gritty visuals will keep you addicted for more excitement.  The animation especially is notably conceived.  THE PROFESSIONAL GOLGO 13  is a destined cult hit in the making.  Though this is an animated film the spellbinding plot assured direction plus the three dimensional characters and strong themes help give this motion picture a potently authentic quality.  There are more than enough plot twists to keep you enthralled even after the denouncement. Plus a powerful subtext amongst many about how the letting of one's emotions cloud hisher thoughts can easily cripple one's life forever will keep the viewer suitably mesmerized.  This is a film that will leave you contemplating about how delicate the human soul really is...If you are looking for a near perfect thriller then search no further.RATING 12 out of .".

Shot like a noir detective film with all the action and speed of a spy thriller this film set a new benchmark for the sniperhitman genre. Duke Togo while devoid of most emotion captivates as a steely and ruthless assassin bent on survival as well as completion of his tasks. The stylish and dark film has conspiracies presidential assassinations serial killers sex guns explosions and insane escape scenes. The story is straight forward someone has paid Golgo 13 to assassinate the son of a wealthy business man and oil magnate. Revenge is to be taken on Golgo 13 at all costs involving crooked cops serial killers generals CIA FBI Army Navy Air Force Marines and Special Forces. Basically Leonard Dawson is taking his son's death a bit hard and feels just a little raw toward Duke.The American translation is passable with pretty good over all emotional tone and great music setting for mood. One of my favorite anime and overall examples of noir style in graphic arts of the 80s if you can ignore that very dated helicopter scene that makes everyone so angry... Personally I didn't think it was bad just out of place in a film with a perfect fever pitch already. Great ending great film overall.

There's a good deal of that in the movie and it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the plot but that's the standard bug about most anime movies I've seen.  Oh well the kiddos should get a good thrill out of it anyway.  The action is intense!  This guy is an amazing shot with either his modified M 16 or his revolver.  My favorite scene is when he goes head to head with Snake a repulsive toothless villain who uses bladed yoyos to kill his victims.  I'm not making this up in an elevator.  The final brawl he had with the twin killers Silver and Gold was cool too but given how much they hyped up the two characters beforehand I frankly expected them to put up more of a fight.

Killing Golgo 13 though is no easy task at all. The story here is solid with some great moments like the ending cool subplots twisted characters and plenty of bloody action. The execution of this classic 1983 anime is in a word stylish. Freeze frames split screens and other such techniques are prevalent throughout. There's also a noirish feel to much of the film often accompanied by soft bluesytype music. Of course being made so many years ago much of it seems dated especially the very early CGI helicopters but for me it's a minor complaintthe movie still rocks hard. Check it out. Now.

Golgo 13 demonstrated this way before Akira came into the public domain. Many of the anime today are drawn sharp and unimaginatively e.g. Pokemon but it's always the old sckool anime that retain high standards in the artwork.

The man who killed him is Golgo 13 who is a mysterious hitman who loves the ladies as he scores with them and goes out for some killing as being his choice of sport. Dawson vows revenge as he hires assassins and the FBI to go after Golgo 13 but can the unstoppable assassin live through all this ordeal? Very underrated cult Japanese animated action thriller based on the popular Japanese comics is a sensational one. This one isn't for the kids due to graphic bloody violence scenes of sex with nudity and language but the film is very well animated and stylish. Sure the CGI in the climax is kind of laughable by today even though back then it was a little cheap and the storyline is very compelling as well as the old school type of animation here. The score is very good here that ranges from jazzy to more heartfelt even during the dramatic powerful climax.If your looking for an underrated Japanese animated diamond in the rough check this one out.".

The Professional is a gun for hire. If he accepts a contract then he always hits his target. He takes all the best parts of Bond being as hard as a coffin nail and bedding various beauties and detaches all the cheesy dialogue.Duke Togo is a cold blooded killer. We never feel for him but we do root against the baddies. He never smiles isn't ever nice but lives by a marginal code of honour which we sort of respect. Like I said its hard to empathise with Duke Togo but we do sort of understand him.The story itself is pretty good and amazingly coherent for a title of this genre. It deals with deception double crossing revenge hate and violence. We soon come to realise that Duke is a pawn in the middle of things. Albeit a pawn with the ability to shoot the head off a match.Being an early 80's production the animation isnt that impressive although the realistic approach is very good and gives the film some authenticity. We also get to see some rudimentary CGI which shows the ambition of the project in the form a helicopter gunship.All in all The Professional is a very entertaining watch. Girls guns and a whole lot of maiming. It looks a shade dated now 20 years on but still packs quite a punch.".

Will Golgo 13 be able to survive all the bloody violence enough to even meet the evil Snake Gold and Silver later in the movie...?Together with the 1988 masterpiece Akira I highly loved this pretty violent animefilm. Various people die during the course of the movie often with gory result. It has plenty of action and violence to keep the fans entertained. The animation style is great very mangalike as if it was made in the late 70s. As I have the original Japanese version of the film on a French DVD I can so say the opening theme Pray for you by Cindy Wood totally rocks as well as the dated CGI intro sequence itself with skeletons and bullets!Speaking about the scenes itself I have at least two favorite scenes it be the Bernard Mueller hitsequence which results in a car chase as well as the ending sequence beginning with the Atarilike CGIhelicopter scene which I honestly love. I even like the actionscenes itself. This is why I confirm this film as my second favorite Anime movie of all time right behind my alltimefavorite anime AKIRA.If you menage to find the Japanese version of this film not the Streamline or the Urban Visionversion I suggest you to take this film amongst them because of the above mentioned Pray for you song.".

It's pretty easy to tell that this was modeled after James Bond. I think the worst part is how it does take awhile to really get good. When it does get good it just keeps getting better and better! This is the first animated film to use CGI in some way. The helicopter at the end looks very bad. The opening sequence however does it a lot better if only because it's not meant to be part of the story.It's weird to see an animated movie of any kind that has swearing and nudity. Keep in the mind that it wasn't really until the 1980's that the Japanese started making feature length anime movies and this was one of the first to be based on a manga. Makes sense seeing as how it's the longest running one. The villain in the film is probably the best part. He really is set up very well and you could even argue that he might have fewer vices than the actual hero of the story. It's a very gracefully done film but due to its content is probably not for all tastes. Still nice. ".

I want cool characters cool story and above all cool visuals.

Freezeframes are used far more often than would have been effective and are infuriating during action sequences. The final sequence lacks so much dynamism that it becomes neither tense nor exciting it's just a chore to sit through and only real Mangaheads would.The movie's got all the ingredients too the star is one cool Mofo 'Indestructible to his enemies and irresistible to his women' and there's more guns and fast cars than you could shake a stick at but then why would you want to shake a stick at them in the first place?. It's just the way these ingredients are prepared that doesn't do the recipe justice.The standout sequence is easily the Hughes assassination we're given an early example of the bulletfollowing camera tomfoolery that's all over the big American movies of the modern day. There are a few other great visuals too like GOLGO's dead informant spinning in his chair while our hero looks on or Leonard Dawson receiving a midair killshot.These memorable moments and a few surprisingly decent plot twists work in the movie's favour but the overall lack of quality makes this a disappointment and fairly difficult to watch.Also this is one of the few Manga that would have worked much better without a supernatural element but its makers obviously couldn't resist the urge.410  The vast improvements in the quality of animation that have been made since this movie's 1983 release make it unimpressive viewing.

	schema:reviewBody "The greatest writers and filmmakers in the horror genre have one thing in common with their peers in other genres they know that if you do nothing else you have to tell a compelling story with characters you can care about whether you love them or hate them. If the story being told isn't worth crap and you could hardly give a damn about the characters either way then you're wasting your time and that of your audience. And sometimes the best way to tell a horrifying heartbreaking story is to keep it simple and keep it real.Though uncovering its many layers takes you in a downward spiral of disillusion madness and death Simon Rumley's THE LIVING AND THE DEAD pares down a horror tale to its very essence like the best of Stephen King or Poe's deepest darkest imaginings. But what makes this film all the more tragic and terrifying is that there's not a vampire werewolf or banshee in sight. It's simply the story of a family experiencing an increasing series of emotional nuclear implosions that eventually destroys everything in its wake leaving one survivor shattered shaken and stripped of everything especially his sanity.The entire story virtually never leaves its initial setting Longleigh a crumbling mansion located in an almost completely isolated part of the English countryside. The former Lord Donald Brocklebank Roger Lloyd Pack and his family have obviously fallen on hard times with Donald and his wife Nancy Kate Fahy serving as the caretakers to severely mentally handicapped son James Leo Bill who is clinically a paranoid schizophrenic with severe depression amongst other things. Under pressure to somehow resolve the family's dire financial straits James's parents are hardpressed to maintain the fulltime job of taking care of him and therefore have to rely on him to look after himself and his own medications  a surefire recipe for disaster. When Donald has to travel to London to settle financial affairs he has to leave James and Nancy to fend for themselvesand that's where the story takes its most harrowing turns.You're never quite sure where you are as Rumley mixing the most nightmarish and disturbing aspects of King's MISERY Polanski's REPULSION and even just a bit of the surrealism of David Lynch with references to the scarier sequences from Aronofsky's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and Peter Greenaway's films keeps the audience completely offbalance.We're left to try and decipher what version of the story we're watching is it the hellish events that take place completely from James' psychotic pointofview as he tries to take care of Nancy whom he sees as violently ill and dying and wants to prove his worth as the man of the house by making her well while his father's away? Or the 'other' version where he has such free access to his medications that he alternates between overandundermedicating himself to the point of a psychotic break which leads him to murderous acts he would've never considered otherwise? The only thing that is crystal clear by the end is that it doesn't matter which version of reality we've been witnessing really happened. The result is still a family tragedy and it eventually leaves Donald lost and broken to suffer the saddest fate of all.Health care is a major issue that is universal not just a grave concern here in the U.S. and writerdirector Rumley has found a most novel way to present the concerns we all have in a manner that will hopefully disturb everyone enough to begin an extensive discourse about it. We're all worried about our future when it comes to our health as well as our loved ones. Who will take care of our parents when they can no longer look after themselves? For that matter who will look after us? What if there isn't anyone or worst still what if the only person we can rely on is probably the least capable of doing the job? But beyond the bracingly difficult subject matter are three tremendous performances. I seriously doubt that there are many American actors who would commit to their roles on the level that the cast has here. Kate Fahy gives an unbelievably brave performance as the sickly Nancy with scenes that call for the kind of personal humiliation violation and torture we can only hope we never come to experience. And Leo Bill might give the most nervewracking wrenchingly accurate performance of a man falling over the edge into true madness as you're likely to see anywhere in any horror movie or drama to date. Watching him you can't help but wonder how and why he came to the state of affairs he's in by the time we first meet him and what if anything we could do for him that would be better than his stressedout parents can provide.And though James' deteriorating state is at the heart of the film it's Pack's performance I identified with most whether Rumley intended it or not. When Pack's Donald is absent we see and feel the devastating affect it has on both his wife and son and when he's there we can't help but feel for him. Here is a man in his twilight years whose dreams for a life of peaceful retirement have been forever destroyed by Godonlyknows what circumstances and now to make matters worse finds himself in a situation where whatever he does for the good of his disintegrating family is not enough to save them from a cruel fate so that the only peace he can find at last is in the same place where his son knew nothing but the torment of the damned.THE LIVING AND THE DEAD makes a very strong statement and it's not for everybody. So consider yourself forewarned and be prepared for a thoughtful and somber evening afterward.".

This is an extremely unusual film  about a retarded kid who looks after his really ill mom when the dad goes away on business  and incredibly bold an gutsy I think. It starts slowly using locked off wide shots establishing characters etc kind of like a poor man's Merchant Ivory the family in question are on their last legs and so there's next to no furniture etc and then when you think you've got a hold on it Rumley says fk you and takes it in a completely stylistic direction with crazy editing music camera etc. Initially this is quite jarring but it works within the context of the characterisation and the mental breakdown that the retarded kid's going through that in the end I thought it's quite a brilliant device. Ultimately the film is a real emotional grind and deeply tragic but it tackles albeit in an extreme visceral way what most of us at some time I guess will have to go through and that's having to look after ailing parents or relatives. There's no monsters in the closet or serial killers here it's just a very stark consideration of the scariest thing around the reality of death.

Directorwriterproducer Simon Rumley loves the fast motion. Leo Bill as the son spends much of the film at tenfold speed racing through vast expanses of interior arms and face animated in a failed attempt to impart the viewer his perspective. It doesn't work quickly growing tiresome and obvious. Rumley's so committed to the technique that clouds the advancing sun branches vehicles doctors and nurses eventually join the fray. Repeatedly. It's difficult to comprehend why since it has no bearing on the quiet desperation Rumley's grasping at instead evoking the feel of an Eighties music video or a VW commercial.It's symptomatic of the film's jettisoning coherency for atmosphere. The first half contradicts the back with no hint of resolution offered. The son proves more criminally insane than clinically yet no reason offered why he wasn't institutionalized. Early in the film when still portrayed as a happy idiot the father is constantly abusive and stern. Fatherly warmth doesn't appear until unconscionable acts are committed. The son roams free past the point any modern Western nation would have seen him incarcerated. We never know why. Likewise the rest of the plot is so artificial and bent to the requirements of intense moments all believability is lost and with it any concern for the characters. The one bright spot is Kate Fahy's terrific portrayal of the wife. She creates the few and fleeting scenes in which the film works as intended. Not content with these minor successes Rumley brushes them aside to make room for more mindbending plot twists snatching total failure from the jaws of mediocre success.

This is a film that dwells on suffering and knowing first hand what it is like to suffer and be around suffering I can honestly say that the film engages the element of undue pain very well. Sometimes within films it is necessary to linger upon things for longer than some viewers would like and this is one of those cases.

Hell he's not even Werner Klemperer or Richard Lynch.In all fairness to The Living and the Dead the actors do a fine job in portraying their parts. However the film suffers from numerous plot holes because it feels like Rumley has absolutely no knowledge of caring for a terminally ill or disabled person. If someone needs a wheelchair to get around or assistance to go to the toilet you don't put the toilet chair or the wheelchair far from the person that needs them. And what in the hell was the telephone doing on the first floor? In Sorry Wrong Number Barbara Stanwyck had the phone next to her bed and that was during Hollywood's Golden Age. Had I been in Donald's shoes I would have made sure the house was more accessible made it so that there was a phone near my wife's bed and didn't leave for London until Nurse Mary was in the house. However that's just me.Another problem with this film is that various camera tricks and scenes lead the viewer to think that there will be a twist ending. However the only thing we are given is seemingly endless and irritating scenes of James running through the house at speeds similar to John Wesley Shipp in The Flash television series. At least there was a reason for Shipp running fast. There's no reason for James doing this. Perhaps Simon Rumley confused artistic with annoying and redundant.The Living and the Dead tries to pass itself off as a film like Memento or The Usual Suspects but it comes off as something that disappoints the viewer in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unwritten rule in horror 1 ALWAYS remain somewhat skeptical whenever you rent a movie of which the DVD cover is literally bespattered with praising quotes from acclaimed horror magazines andor listings of awards won at Festivals no one ever heard of. This might be an indication that the distributors need extra reasons to convince people into rentingbuying their film because the plot summary and the still images on the back of the box aren't convincing enough. The box of The Living and the Dead features quotes stating Brilliant Disturbing Harrowing and The Greatest Film Ever Made but personally I don't think the film deserves any of those compliments. The tagline on the other hand is very truthful. It says Terror by good intentions and not only does this simple sentence summarize the whole plot it also accurately describes the entire film production! The story revolves on the physical financial and mental downfall of a onceeminent family of three living in a massive mansion in rural Britain. The father is nearly bankrupt the mother is terminally ill and the twentysomething son James is mentally handicapped. When the father is forced to travel to London to solve his financial issues James insists to look after his mother instead of an expensive nurse. Naturally his intentions are good but his lack of realism and intellect make it a long period of pure agony and humiliation for his poor old mother. Ah good intentions Writerdirector Simon Rumley obviously had plenty. The concept of the film is original and fairly engaging but it's too little to revolve a whole movie around. The Living and the Dead suffers from far too many dreadfully dull moments and Rumley only seems to fill those moments up with lame visual gimmicks and pointless padding footage. He particularly seems to be fond of the fastforward filming style. Very often we just see accelerated images of James running up and down the house for no real reason other than to kill a few extra minutes of playtime or to set up the viewers with a dreadful headache. If anything The Living and the Dead is the type of film that can make even the calmest person nervous and irritated. The pointlessness of this film is really frustrating good intentions or no good intentions. The finale is highly implausible the film honestly isn't that shocking as it thinks it is and Rumley's atypical directing skills almost feel pretentious and arrogant. Seriously you're not Werner Herzog or David Lynch mister.".

I really can't remember the last time I saw such an infuriatingly stupid bad film. The only reason I came across this film was because it was likened to haunting in Connecticut which I found to be a relatively entertaining nobrainerhere on IMDb! I am in no rush to check out any of the director's other masterpieces. This was SO unrealistic. If it would have gone for a magic realism approach from a director like Julio Madem or Kim Ki Duk or a surreal approach from someone like David Lynch then maybe just maybe it could have got away with the unacceptable events taking place in this film. I mean come on. Setting up theatre IN THE HOUSE ! performing some serious kind of operation therethere would be some serious scarring and everything and then just putting her back to bed and leaving? Apparently she was all better though. And leaving the schizophrenic son to hide out in his room after nearly poisoning his mother to death... no one not even his father seem to check up on him or even know exactly where he had got to. Then both incidents involving the knife... Jesus! As already mentioned Julian Donkeyboy Memento and The Machinist have all dealt with mental illness disorientation and guilt in much better ways. They should not even be a comparison. And then there was the film making itself. The terrible house music speeding up of cameras to depict the characters crazy outlook on things the dream sequences scared scarred!and dialogue from earlier in the film overlapping inside someone's head with extra reverb all just stank of midnineties college movie to me. The whole thing left me seething. Hence the review. I never normally write them I tend to hate critics cause they don't usually get where the creator is coming from and they don't create themselves they just complain about how they could never do it better themselves. I am certainly no film maker but I think even I could have done a better job of this one which would include re plotting re writing re scripting and re shooting. And being a musician I'd redo all the music. The score was actually OK though just not the boom boom stuff and the acting was all fine sometimes quite impressive. I was pleased to see Trigger from only fools and horses pop up. But had this film contained Johnny Depp Robert Deniro and Mickey Rourke as the mother it would have played no better than it would with Keanu Reeves George Bush and Gerry Halliwell under this director and writer. Sorry mate. Try harder.".

I actually had to start this movie twice because I stopped it at the first try after 15 minutes not being able to concentrate on the storylinethere actually is not really much of a storyline to begin with.What I am trying to get across is that this is just not a movie that captures you in the first couple of minutes and also this is definitely not a horror movie. The horror is supposedly rooted in the fact that there are two very sick people one mentally and one physically that are locked in together and try to care for each other.The deranged or mentally ill son might be portrayed in a realistic fashion but that does not make it less annoying to watch his character rummage through this movie. What I found most annoying is the overuse of fast paced pictures combined with nasty techno music. I do get it that this is meant to emphasize his progressing madness but I would say that the audience would have understood this without using this stylistic device 5 times in a row. Another maddening element are certain jumps in the time line that make it even harder to follow the already chaotic storyline I found also utterly unrealistic that a concerned father would leave his terminally ill wive and his deranged son who as he notes earlier is not very good with strange people.Altogether a very unpleasant movie not only because of its content but because it is very hard to follow and even harder to connect to any of the characters portrayed in it!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is possibly the worst film i have ever seen. I actually saw the premiere in Rotterdam Film Festival and whilst many people walked out I stayed to the bitter end. But that was mainly because I didn't want to lose my friends. Self indulgent is a word often overused in the arts and some of the best music and film is incredibly self indulgent but behind that indulgence there is often genius. Unfortunately here there is nothing not even a plot. The mistake the director Simon Rumley makes is to dwell on the suffering of the characters all in a kind of 'gross out' adolescent way without any insight or any freshness. All the best films now tend not to be so mawkish making The Living and The Dead seem like a bad student project from the 1970s. There's no lightness of touch here and no humour. Perhaps we're supposed to laugh at mentalist James in the same way we laugh at Julian Donkey Boy. But he's just not that funny and he has none of the demented hilarity of Donkey Boy. Like the rest of the cast he's just a stereotype an extremely annoying stereotype. All you'll learn from The Living and The Dead is that some people clearly have much more money than sense. And I'm not talking about any of the characters in the film here.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the list of superlatives and awards on the DVD cover I figured that this would be a pretty safe watch. In order to keep from spoiling my enjoyment of movies I often try to walk into them without knowing much of anything which seems to frustrate other people sometimes when they ask what I'm watching so when I started watching this movie I figured it was probably about vampires or zombies or something. Wow was I totally wrong! It's actually more of a tragedy about mental illness than anything else though it's also got some surrealist and absurdist elements. That might put off some people. As a huge fan of David Lynch I recognized that the surreal scenes were kind of homagesripoffs of his work but really it didn't bother me nearly as much as it apparently did some other Lynch fans and of course surrealism will always have its detractors calling it pretentious or stupid. In particular one dream sequence where a character has a strange symbolismladen conversation with a nightmare version of Zippy the Pinhead reminded me VERY strongly of Lost Highway. I'm sure fellow Lynch fans know the scene that I'm talking about That's fing crazy man.. Regardless I liked the scene and I thought it was done well. It's always nice to see people being influenced by Lynch even if they're taking the influence a bit too far into territory that might involve lawyers if it were a different form of media.Moving on...The acting was stellar. I totally bought each and every character. The directing was a bit shall we say stylistic. I suppose it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Again while it was slightly derivative of the style of other directors someone is apparently a Darren Aronofsky fanboy I liked it. The plot was told from a combination Memento and Repulsion viewpoint mixing the outoforder scenes of Memento with the unreliable narrator from Repulsion. In fact the whole movie seems to take some major hints from Repulsion while not being nearly so much of a outright homage instead individual scenes and the overall theme remind me of that movie.So what are we left with? A rather strange potpourri of Lynch Aronofsky Polanksi Nolan and perhaps even a bit of Kubrick thrown in. Does it work? Yes. Is it highly derivative of other directors? Yes. Are there strange plot holes that are never really explained why is there only one phone in such a huge house and why doesn't the wife have a cell phone? Why did the father leave before the arrival of the nurse? Why did... and so on? Oh yes definitely. Perhaps you'll be able to forgive all these issues. Perhaps not. If you can then I think you'll like this movie. It's powerful and intriguing.If the director can make a movie that is more original in his own style and work on reducing the number of bizarre plot holes that make no sense I will become a fan. He could really have a strong future.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it would be fair to say The Living and the Dead had me held in some sort of blind terror for more often than not. The film is so outrageous in the places it goes and the manner in which it acts when it gets there that it's impossible to merely put aside the watching experience having seen it. The film is a freakshow yes of characters visual tricks and constructed scares but a calculated and carefully constructed one one that I think will tap into a nerve within whether you're a veteran of manya horror films or not. The film is something like a little under an hour and half long but when it had ended felt as if it had clocked in at something like three hours such is the grip of terror and unease I was in. Like a hypnosis session in which you're out for the count for all of about thirty minutes but the deeprooted places you may have been to during that time unearthing such discomfort and a sense of feeling that the whole process feels like half a day's gone by.The film's premise sees it set up a perilous exchange between a middle aged mother and her twentysomething son in a large premodern and isolated house in the country. She's physically unwell suffering from some sort of extreme form of M.E. whilst he's a scatty eccentric schizophrenic whose mannerism movements and vocal tone is wildly inconsistent and unnerving. The mother is Nancy Fahy the son is James Bill and the family name is Brocklebank something that I think instills a certain amount of pride into the household as father and husband of the piece Donald LloydPack seems to furiously defend them and their right to house there by way of a number of conversations over the phone with someone. It's this someone Donald must leave the property to venture out and see and it's from here that most of the trouble unfolds.The film's tone is unbearably downbeat beginning in the present tense with a greyed out Donald covered in injuries as he observes an ambulance advance down his property's long lonely driveway towards him. His face is glum rueful and regretful and a perfect teeing up for the events the film covers in instilling a sense that something's up he's thinking that leaving that final time was a big mistake. In flashing back to better times certainly the best times either of these characters find themselves in throughout the film it's revealed Donald cared for both his wife and son accordingly with the early exchanges coming across as calm and methodical in their feeling and construction what with static camera work and long takes. This is in stark contrast to when James takes over as the self proclaimed man of the house a title actor Leo Bill does well in his character's mixture of pleading and exclaiming in what is a desperate attempt to try and prove to his parents that he's able to take on responsibility. The danger signs in this lie within the fact his strict medication diet of various pills and vaccine shots sit uneasily with the fact he's commanded by his father to hide from visitors and avoid the newspaper instilling a certain childlike sensibility to him and acting as triggers to stoke a fire of warning.Leo Bill plays James as a sort of pastiche of Rik Mayall's character from popular 1990's British TV show 'Bottom' only rendered schizophrenic and far more mentally ill. Early on I wondered if the man had an agenda whether or not he was at all homicidal and indeed hated his mother which added to an intense element of unease. As the film switches perspectives in carer a gradual shift in emphasis onto James becomes apparent in the conventions writerdirector Simon Rumley applies. In switching from a mainly static camera complete with long takes which took prior precedence Rumley then throws spedup footage bizarre angles editing as well as distorted sound effects which amalgamate to form odd music into the mix getting across a sense of chaos and somebody seriously illsuited for the task. Rumley's tactics of applying a disorientating and off the wall aesthetic to most of the scenes James' acts as carer beautifully but disturbingly conflicts in a highly effective manner with this large decrepit centuries old manor house with which you do not associate the given conventions.There are killings in the film somebody gets knifed and there's a fair degree of blood running on a premise that sees it bed down in one place as terror and uncanniness plays out but don't let that lead you to think this is a Halloween sequel or some similarly underwhelming slasher film. One sequence which goes a long way in highlighting this odd combination of techniques and conventions to actually form something halfdecent occurs nearer the end when isolated and on their own a young female supporting character creeps through the dark passages and corridors of the home unaware of what lurks around them but knowledgeable that there's a male lead somewhere who could very well react negatively if he sees or finds her. The whole thing is constructed like an ageold sequence in a slashersub genre flick but the film sets a bar far higher. Roger LloydPack does a superb job banishing any lingering memory you might have of him in a prior comedic role as we observe his envisaging of what might very well have gone on during his absence. Rumley's film is not all about shocks and scares a sequence later on in which many family members have gathered in the house's main area is shot from high on up in the rafters the camera just too embarrassed or ashamed to go to ground level and capture these people's expressions and reactions. I found The Living and the Dead to be a smart and affecting film.".

A simple psychological horrordrama that was brilliant and did exactly what it set out to do. So why the low score? Because as brilliant and disturbing as it was there was nothing really special about it. It was short film turned into a fulllength movie. It fit more into the that's cute category than the I got my entire money's worth here category. That was the major problem I had with it it wasn't anything that deserved a fulllength movie necessarily. If the runtime and price were both cut in half this would have gotten a much higher score for me.I guess I'll just start out with saying that this was one of the few movies I've ever seen that genuinely disturbed me. There was little to no blood but the subject matter gripped me emotionally and hit home and it disturbed me. Will it disturb everyone? No. Will it disturb most? Maybe but I doubt it. It's an acquired taste. The movie banks on you being emotionally affected and if you're not there really is no point in watching it because you'll be bored out of your mind. The Living and the Dead is relative in every aspect of the word and I can't give it a definitive this sucks or this was good because it varies person to person. That isn't true about most movies unlike what people want to believe but that does apply here. It's your call.As for the aspects of the film that aren't relative The acting is pretty good. The story isn't entirely original but it isn't typical either. The camerawork is welldone for the kind of movie it is. The pacing gets a little bloated but nowhere near as bad as it could have been. Everything was welldone in the technical stance. The story was borderline brilliant though I can see why people would disagree.Overall if you're looking for a psychological movie that will disturb you this is worth a shot. I haven't seen a truly disturbing movie in years but this was almost a little too much for me to handle. Almost. But that was based on my emotional engagement and that is relative. Just watch it and make up your own opinion.210".

	schema:reviewBody "OK... this movie so far has been slated by critics and boardposters alike although playing devil's advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn't make it for themselves as filmmakers and board posters are often people who didn't make it for themselves as critics so I wanted to sit in Guy's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it.The film's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is. This has been described many times as as making the film inaccessible to the viewer. The film's chronology is relatively nonlinear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle or not so subtle hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory IE. Ray Liotta's character brandishing a gun saying the words fear me is portrayed as both tragically pathetic from Statham's POV or interrogating and bold from Liotta's POV. This is but one example of Ritchie's far more mature approach he has taken to filmmaking with Revolver we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal the strong but silent gritty antihero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption... I mean it's paint by numbers film noir here guys all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voiceovers but then Guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points.Take the scene where Jason Statham's character runs afoul of a car. This throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever... but Ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death.So the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling I'd be taking the pss if I said I didn't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going uh... wtf?... but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art. It is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand. And even easier to say well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film!. In my humble opinion Revolver is a stylish complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the Saatchi Brothers. If we choose this opportunity to collectively say Ah sht I wanted a film about a load of bleeding' cockney gangsters innit loll... Guy Ritchie is a tit! then the day will come when filmmakers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow crappy people. Just because Guy made a name for himself with funny cheeky cockney romps doesn't mean he can't be deep without being pretentious. Funny people can be thoughtful too.".

However this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. The majority of reviews that i had read said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow. And whilst some parts do leave you confused the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much. It's not like Lock Stock... or Snatch in the sense that it isn't that funny in fact it's pretty dark and it is a lot more intelligent in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints and in one of the best scenes of the film Jason Statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself. The way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters specifically Statham who gives a fantastic performance as the lead and Ray Liotta who spends most of the film in Speedos but gives a great performance none the less. If you've got time and have time afterwards to think about the film and even watch it again you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film. I think it's fantastic and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game.".

It's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking WHAT was that? That was awful and the other half will leave thinking WHAT was that? That was cool. Personally i like films that i don't understand i.e.Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects so i enjoyed Revolver. It definitely wasn't perfect though. I saw the big twist coming a mile away at least part of it and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good Revolver leaves A LOT of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed. Also some scenes like the animation and the scene where Sorter goes on a killing spreeactually one of my favourites although awesome scenes to watch seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch not because they fit in with the movie.However there were many good things too. I thought the acting was superb from all the main actors Jason stratham Ray Liotta Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjaminwho was a pleasant surprise. This movie definitely kept my interest with one great suspenseful action packed scene after another. When Ray Liotta was being held under the table wow....well you have to see it. The script was extremely well done and the soundtrack as with most Guy Ritchie films was great.Though a step below such movies asFight Club Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects it was still an awesome fast paced psychological action movie with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over.".

And it's quite a storyline with all the symbolism and metaphors about chess and human sins squeezed into it. The problem is that the production doesn't hold all the bulky storyline together in a satisfying way. It's like Guy tries too hard and ends up making mess of it all.Many of those that watch this movie and understands the detail and intricacies of it like to point out that they do get it and therefore feels good about themselves and automatically gives the movie a high score. It's like in the movie They are being fed pieces and feel intelligent when they knock them down.But seriously the movie just make you feel sick when it tries to display it's twisted view of a inner psychological battle. It's full of clichs and rough edges to the camera work and effects. It picks up bits from all other films with twists in it and it doesn't hold up. He mixes up The usual suspects David Lynch in general and his previous films in one big bad camera mess.So to wrap this up here's my conclusion and opinion the storyline is kinda cute but the production of it isn't. To you who liked it I can only say Good for you. You got something out of it and I didn't. To you who didn't like it It's not always easy to understand if you're not used to think the movies through for hidden meanings. That will make even good movies seem like crap.

	schema:reviewBody "What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money  revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that. Guy Ritchie a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre bites off more than he can chew with this one.His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride being nice to his enemy  giving away all his money falls flat on it's face. When Jason Statham's character no longer fears Ray Liotta it apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. Why? Basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Statham's character.Before anyone starts to say I'm missing the point... I'm not. I get it OK? Opt out of the quest for riches  you'll find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into selfdestruction. This seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story although hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realises this he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert redherrings The scene when Statham gets knocked over by a car  Why? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel comic animations... again why?There are so many loose threads  unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001ish about it and try figuring them out or simply accept that there are no answers  each viewer will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that I simply didn't care.

	schema:headline " It isn't style without substance  it is style with poor substance";
	schema:reviewBody "After seven years in solitary confinement between a cell containing a chess master and a cell containing a con artist Jake leaves to seek revenge on Macha with the vast amount of money he has gotten from gambling. He starts his revenge with humiliation but soon blacks out only to be told by a doctor that he has mere days to live. Mysterious loan sharks Zack and Avi offer him protection from death in return for all his money. Meanwhile Macha puts a hit out on Jake. With death and betrayal everywhere somebody is playing the ultimate highstakes game  but are all the players known and who will emerge victorious?I had someone ask me recently if I'd seen this because they wanted a second opinion. The reason for this they said was that they thought it was good one minute then terrible the next then maybe it is good again then not then it ended. Of course being asked for an opinion peaked my interest and boosted my ego and I was planning to watch it anyway just to see for myself what about it deserved such a slating from the critics. In answer to the latter statement it must be said that unsurprisingly the film did not deserve the universal condemnation it received in the press and in truth it was just another time to lay into someone who had gotten too big for his boots and perhaps needed taking down a peg or two  and a weak project was the perfect reason. It happens every year  critics have so many mediocre films to write about that a good one sees loving reviews in the same way as a bad one is the chance to write a really memorable scathing review  whether either it is truly deserved or not.So this leaves me with my colleague's statement and on that I found him to be accurate because at times it does SEEM to be a really cool film that is going somewhere interesting. This impression is built around a good start and pace to the film with plenty of tough posturing mystery and style. In fact to deny that the film is delivered with style would be bad form indeed because the film does look very cool and very interesting. Problem is that at some point that isn't enough and once you get beyond the halfway mark you get the increasing feeling that this isn't going anywhere nearly as interesting or clever as you would like to think. By the ending that feeling will be confirmed as correct as the film stumbles into a pretentious and poorly delivered conclusion to the story and characters. Ritchie had been quite unreasonably arrogant about people who don't get his film but to me not only is it his fault for the hamfisted delivery of his twist but as writer he also has come up with an idea for a twist that reads like a poor copy of other better films. It just doesn't play and the cold if stylish approach keeps the audience at a distance so we care less than we should and are given more opportunity to see the twists as pretentious and halfcooked.Within this messy and slightly nonsensical affair the cast actually do pretty well by playing to the style rather than the content. Statham makes the best of his situation with another tough presence on screen even if ultimately I don't think he buys his character himself and thus cannot be part of the sale to the audience. Liotta I quite liked even though the unhinged violent criminal thing is pretty much the equivalent of him staring out the window with everything set to cruise control. Pastore and Benjamin are a cool presence who drive the film early on with the mystery of their characters but gradually become less engaging as the plot unravels. The rest of the cast pretty much provide solid enough tough men without fortunately sinking into the easy apples and pears type performances that Ritchie seems to like in his films generally. The only performance of real note though is from Ritchie as director because he pulls everything together with a lot of visual style and imagination shame then that the worst performance is also from him as a writer because he has produced a script so full of its own cleverness that it cannot be bothered to aim for engaging the audience and sits back arrogantly while the delivery is fudged and incoherent.Revolver is not the screaming disaster that everyone would have you believe but this is as close to a recommendation as I can give it. Visually it is stylish and early on this sense of tough coolness does draw you into the plot to see where it goes. Sadly though the answer is that it doesn't go anywhere worth being and it goes there with a slow pace that suggests it is being very clever and worthy when really the plot is not anywhere as clever or as developed as it needed to be. It isn't style without substance  it is style with poor substance.".

	onyx:emotionText "After seven years in solitary confinement between a cell containing a chess master and a cell containing a con artist Jake leaves to seek revenge on Macha with the vast amount of money he has gotten from gambling. He starts his revenge with humiliation but soon blacks out only to be told by a doctor that he has mere days to live. Mysterious loan sharks Zack and Avi offer him protection from death in return for all his money. Meanwhile Macha puts a hit out on Jake. With death and betrayal everywhere somebody is playing the ultimate highstakes game  but are all the players known and who will emerge victorious?I had someone ask me recently if I'd seen this because they wanted a second opinion. The reason for this they said was that they thought it was good one minute then terrible the next then maybe it is good again then not then it ended. Of course being asked for an opinion peaked my interest and boosted my ego and I was planning to watch it anyway just to see for myself what about it deserved such a slating from the critics. In answer to the latter statement it must be said that unsurprisingly the film did not deserve the universal condemnation it received in the press and in truth it was just another time to lay into someone who had gotten too big for his boots and perhaps needed taking down a peg or two  and a weak project was the perfect reason. It happens every year  critics have so many mediocre films to write about that a good one sees loving reviews in the same way as a bad one is the chance to write a really memorable scathing review  whether either it is truly deserved or not.So this leaves me with my colleague's statement and on that I found him to be accurate because at times it does SEEM to be a really cool film that is going somewhere interesting. This impression is built around a good start and pace to the film with plenty of tough posturing mystery and style. In fact to deny that the film is delivered with style would be bad form indeed because the film does look very cool and very interesting. Problem is that at some point that isn't enough and once you get beyond the halfway mark you get the increasing feeling that this isn't going anywhere nearly as interesting or clever as you would like to think. By the ending that feeling will be confirmed as correct as the film stumbles into a pretentious and poorly delivered conclusion to the story and characters. Ritchie had been quite unreasonably arrogant about people who don't get his film but to me not only is it his fault for the hamfisted delivery of his twist but as writer he also has come up with an idea for a twist that reads like a poor copy of other better films.

	schema:headline " Revolver is mindblowing!";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw Sherlock Holmes a couple of months ago and it was very good. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed that and my friends were raving about Guy Ritchie's style of filmmaking. So now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works  rented out Snatch last week as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. Now I rented out Revolver last night even though it only has a 6.2 rating here. I didn't know anything about it and I think it was a very good effort on the part of Guy Ritchie to not make this into a comedy gangster movie like his other works which are wonderful by the way. I had to see the film two times to completely understand the plot which was confusing at times.Jake Green Jason Statham has been released from prison where he has spent some years because of Dorothy Macha Ray Liotta. But he did solitary in prison and has been released earlier than Dorothy was expecting. And Dorothy knows come will come after him. Green cons Dorothy early in the film and there he meets Zach who works with Avi. Then he finds out he has a rare blood disease which will take his life in three days. Avi says he can help but he would have to bleed Jake Green dry of his money. Green is a great player at chess which he became better at in prison with the two men who lived beside his solitary confinement room. They had taught him how to con how to get better at conning others and loads of advice about life. Now Jake has to save his own life and find out for himself whether Avi and Zach are real con artists or not. And is who is Mr. Gold? Is he the one who is behind all this? The film opens with four or five opening sayings which will tell you the path the movie takes. Well the meaning was gloriously lost upon me as I didn't think it would be anything worth remembering later on in the movie. The scene in the lift at the end was my favorite part. Mr. Gold is an enigma no one really knows what he looks like but everybody is afraid of him. Moving on I think Guy Ritchie is enchanted by the name of Avi as he has used it in Snatch also. Anyway this film is about letting go of your ego your own selfimportance and living without fear in the face of death. In the hindu religion all the 7 sins take the form of humans and wreak havoc in the world. Likewise ego is manifested inside Jake Green's head. Like with all of Ritchie's works the film is highly stylish visually dynamic and the dialogues even though not funny are simply superb. Guy Ritchie just became one of my favourite directors ever. Statham is one of Ritchie's favourite actors as anybody can tell and the man gives a fabulous performance. He is one of my personal favorites also and the hair suits him quite well. Mark Strong as the sharp shooter and Ray Liotta are also amazing. Ritchie is an awesome filmmaker but this film is not everyone's cup of tea. For me this was awesome. My favorite scene is the one in the elevator in the climax in which he battles with his ego for control over his own mind.I have seen quite a few of the users moaning about how they didn't get it and if they did get it they found it to be boring as this isn't Ritchie's brand of film that they are used to. Just because Ritchie made a huge name for himself with funny cockney films doesn't mean he can't be deep without being pretentious. Trust me this will get better with repeated viewings.1010".

Unfortunately as I found out last night this was not the case. Revolver is so monstrously bad I am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it just so I don't feel like I'm the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this. Its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant and I mean CONSTANT voice overs of the main characters with totally inane pretentious nonsense! I was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to Andre Benjamin's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film whilst all the time thinking  what would Turkish have done to this complete joke of gangstercon man whatever he's supposed to be when he made his offer? I'll tell you what. He would have told him to fk off blown his head away and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him. I mean what are we supposed to believe is going through Jake's head when they offer him their solution to his problem? They're con men therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases! I mean ffs. Doesn't he start to wonder why his symptoms aren't getting worse? Doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of Richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from Avi to Jake to let him know he's been conned. Anyway I can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films. bullst! This film doesn't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines oh no. It somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny I genuinely didn't hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the UGC in Sheffield knows how full a main screen can get and not 1 person so much as smiled. Maybe he never wanted the film to be funny and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy but what was he planning on hanging this film on may I ask? The unnecessarily baffling plot!?? I sincerely hope not!By far the most satisfying moment I went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from ALL directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end. It was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over and they were free from their torment!I'll round this off I've got to finish writing this is making me angry again by elaborating on the end. I mean sht! The ending.. no sorry I can't your just going to have to go and see it. It can't be put in words it just can't and after you've seen it you'll know why. Uuhhhhh  shudders ".

I was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to Andre Benjamin's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film whilst all the time thinking  what would Turkish have done to this complete joke of gangstercon man whatever he's supposed to be when he made his offer? I'll tell you what. He would have told him to fk off blown his head away and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him. I mean what are we supposed to believe is going through Jake's head when they offer him their solution to his problem? They're con men therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases! I mean ffs. Doesn't he start to wonder why his symptoms aren't getting worse? Doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of Richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from Avi to Jake to let him know he's been conned. Anyway I can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films. bullst! This film doesn't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines oh no. It somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny I genuinely didn't hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the UGC in Sheffield knows how full a main screen can get and not 1 person so much as smiled. Maybe he never wanted the film to be funny and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy but what was he planning on hanging this film on may I ask? The unnecessarily baffling plot!?? I sincerely hope not!By far the most satisfying moment I went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from ALL directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end. It was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over and they were free from their torment!I'll round this off I've got to finish writing this is making me angry again by elaborating on the end. I mean sht! The ending.. no sorry I can't your just going to have to go and see it. It can't be put in words it just can't and after you've seen it you'll know why. Uuhhhhh  shudders ";

	schema:reviewBody "Let this film serve as the death knell to the big twist films borne out of the 1990s. Known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome this cinematic slight of hand has now been done to death by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. However in REVOLVER director Guy Ritchie known in some circles as Mr. Madonna utilizes the Soze motif in a far more obsequious manner. Jason Statham with a highly questionable head of hair stars as Jack Green known to all as Mr. Green. He may or may not also be criminal mastermind Mr. Gold. Or perhaps Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underworld. I'm not quite certain but I certainly don't care. REVOLVER is one of the most overwrought examples of cinematic excess I've had the displeasure to endure in quite a long time. Witness the fractured time structure the painful jump cuts the ceaseless innermonologues and the painfully pretentious animated sequence. This everything and the kitchen sink directing style makes Quentin Tarantino's oeuvre look sedate. The cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that Ritchie was as bored telling this trite tale as I was watching it.The film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking but they only come as news to Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green as I always enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here though he struggles along like a remedial reader in a University English Literature class. His lack of wit is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis Macha Ray Liotta. Feasting on scenery like a starving man at a smorgasbord Liotta spits cries and fumes through the film in an embarrassing display of overacting and leopard print speedos. There are no redeeming qualities to REVOLVER. It's yet another filmic faux pas from Ritchie and might even outdo his wretched remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst film yet.".

This is not to say however that these films weren't entertaining they just aren't necessarily as memorable as the best Spaghetti Westerns Gialli and Poliziotteschi. Then there's Enzo G.

Full of slow motion and squibs the film centers around the one man army that is reluctant mercenary John Slade Frank Zagarino. Slade is sent on a mission to Nicaragua to save a kidnapped journalist John Phillip Law from the clutches of the evil Russian villain Kariasin played by John Steiner sporting a hideous rat tail like haircut. From there the action rarely lets up as as throughout the film Slade slingshots stabs and machineguns whole platoons with an Uzi. Plot is pretty standard merc film fair complete with countless twists and double crosses. While clearly a very cheap cheesy film STRIKER is highly entertaining and has become one of my favorite 80s Italian Rambo ripoffs.Fun fact the film's screenplay was written by Eurocrime veteran Umberto Lenzi. It also features one of the most intense electric shock torture scenes I've seen outside of THE MINSTREL KILLER.".

The acting in the movie had the same quality as an average porn flick. The cinematography was similar to an early 70's late 60 TV movie. Did they use 8mm film? We never even finished watching the movie. And the music wasn't music at all. Did the director hired a 6 year old kid to push buttons on a keyboard? The reason I ask that is is that that's what is sounded like. My coworker commented that he could play the same notes on his keyboard when he was a kid on an early 80's keyboard you can buy at Toy's R Us.

To describe his acting skills as wooden here would be to praise him unduly Even the foliage he hides behind throughout the film outshines him! The scene in which he tries desperately to wring out some emotion following the death of his wartime buddy is utterly hilarious though. In fact not since that king of Bmovie bad acting the mighty Reb Brown demonstrated a similarly painful to watch sequence in Strike Commando following the death of a small native boy has there been such a rivetingly awful instance of an on screen performance.Overall grade 6.510".

So when I saw this short that continues where the first Kung Fu Panda left off I thought it wouldn't be as good as the film. It turns out that it's a very entertaining short although it doesn't have the same inspiring message that made it very solid.The story while explaining the backstories of the Furious Five really well is a tad predictable in some parts the humor isn't as strong as the movie and I expected it to be a bit longer like say 40 minutes so that it can explain the backstories better. That's all I have to say about the flaws.Everything else is great. The CGI is fine but it's traditional animation sequences of the Furious Five's backstories is what made this worth watching for me. It's so beautiful and the character designs from the movie are nicely detailed here. The voice acting is pretty good and although we only saw Jack Black Dustin Hoffman and David Cross return the voice actors for only four of the Furious Five including Tara Strong Max Koch Jessica DiCicco and James Sie Jackie from Jackie Chan Adventures did a good job. The music score from Hans Zimmer  John Powell along with Henry Jackman does retain the same tunes from the movie while using a lot of different stuff in it which isn't a bad thing. The characters are still as likable as they were especially the young Furious Five warriors.Overall Secrets of the Furious Five isn't as inspiring as the original film but it proved to be a lot more entertaining than I imagined and I think those who haven't seen it should check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kung Fu Panda Secrets of the Furious Five is a short film that runs for slightly over 20 minutes and came out a couple months after the very first Kung Fu Panda back in 2008 probably as a DVD feature. Since then there is a second movie several other short films and even a television series. The third feature movie will come out in 2016. In this short here Po tells us and a class of rabbits 5 little stories about Kung Fu masters. It's really more about morale than comedy although here and there you find some slapstick. It's certainly suitable for children and especially those who enjoy the movies should like it too. My favorite from the stories is the second one about the snakes maybe an 810 as it perfectly illustrates the biological aspects of venomous and constrictor snakes and I quite liked the way they displayed it with all these bands.The director Raman Hui has worked on quite a few animated movies and was the codirector of the third Shrek movie. The animation style in this Kung Fu Panda short is very similar to the full length movies. What I also found interesting were the different animal motives in the sequences such as sheep for helpless and intimidated animals and crocodiles and bulls for antagonists. There's probably more. This one here won 4 Annie Awards animation Oscars and I can see why. I had a good time watching and I recommend it.".

You'll also be let down if you expect all the originals actors to be present. This is something that would be right at home on Saturday morning television. There are a few CG scenes here but the feature mainly uses the stylized 2d technique seen at the beginning of Kung Fu Panda. Nothing's wrong with that. What really sinks this for me is the poor story. Everything about this feature dumbs down the plot of its source material reducing the origins of these important characters to simple morality tales. It takes the easy road on these potentially deep characters and ends up being a bit of a letdown.".

	schema:reviewBody "As Dragon Warrior Po has had to face many challenges but on this day he must face one that would intimidate any great warrior  training the newest recruit of bunnies in the way of kungfu. Left alone to fend for himself by Shifu Po finds his class are only interested in the fighting part of the art and are keen to get down to kicking one another as soon as possible. In order to educate them in the true ways of the art Po tells them of the Furious Five and how they became masters by learning life lessons of patience courage confidence selfcontrol and compassion.As with the animated films from Pixar Dreamworks included this short film on the KungFu Panda DVD and I decided to give it a try. In a way it is a fitting inclusion to the main film because to my mind both the film and the short are enjoyable for what they are but at the same time are not quite up to the quality of the products produced by Pixar. With this film its main problem is that the plot is just too obvious in the moralising compared to some of the brilliant shorts from Pixar that can deliver the same message but are generally very inventive and clever. I didn't really get this here but if you ignore this weakness of comparison then the short is still quite entertaining.It is not really ever hilarious but it does consistently amuse across the twenty minutes and it doesn't really ram the moral down your throat although it does push it into your mouth. The animation is mixed  perhaps for financial reasons but it does work within the context of the short. The bits with Po and his class are of the same quality as in the main film but the stories that make up the majority of the running time are delivered in a more handdrawn style that looks cheaper because by comparison it is. However don't let this take away from how good it looks because it is still stylish  sort of like the animation that opens the main film albeit it not as striking or as well done as that. Each story is relatively straight forward with a moral at the end of each one but they do more or less work.The voice work is a little distracting though  not so much for what they do but more the obvious absences. Black and Hoffman are good each reprising their voices in the main part of the short film  Black in particular puts a lot of energy into it but the Furious Fives themselves not so much. Cross is good as Crane probably having as many words as in the main film but the others are mostly absent. Some of the characters are children in their stories so therefore it would not have been sensible to use adult voices but it is a bit strange why Chan or Rogen couldn't have found a bit of time to record the couple of lines needed for this  especially considering how few lines they had in the main film.Either way the short is solid and entertaining with a solid if obvious moral message for the kids and bunnies. That said it does feel a bit lacking in inspiration and does give the impression that it was made because it had to be rather than made out of a good idea or passion for the project  a cynical view perhaps but it is hard not to feel that at points not due to something the film does but things that similar films do so much better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Winner of the Un Certain Regard award this year at the Cannes Film Festival the fast disappearing world of nomadic sheep herders in Kazakhstan is dramatized in the part fictional part documentary film Tulpan. Directed by Sergei Dvortsevoy Tulpan is the story of an exsailor seeking to marry the only available woman in the area to fulfill his dream of tending his own flock. The narrative however is secondary to the dramatic oncamera birth of a lamb and the spectacular scenery of the steppes. Much of the film takes place in the tent house called a yurt that is shared by Asa Askhat Kuchinchirekov his brotherinlaw Ondas Ondasyn Besikbasov his older sister Samal Samal Yeslyamova and three children.The smallest boy is an absolute delight running and shouting as he plays with sticks and his pet turtle. His older brother has the uncanny knack of repeating the news broadcasts he hears on the radio word for word reciting recites them daily to a curious Ondas. The only shrill note in the film is the constant highpitched singing of Asa's niece Maha Mahabbat Turganbayeva who sings the same dronelike folk song six or seven times. As the film opens Asa his best friend Boni Tulepbergen Baisakalov and Ondas visit the family of Tulpan a young woman whom they want Asa to marry. In southern Kazakhstan the terrain is so forbidding that a herdsman must have a wife to do the chores while he tends his sheep and Ondas considers Asa too irresponsible and immature to be a herdsman without a wife.At the family gathering Tulpan is not present Asa makes up stories about his adventures in the Russian navy and how he fought an octopus in a life and death struggle. Tulpan's parents however are unimpressed and later tell Asa that their daughter who is never seen in the film has rejected him because his ears are too big. How she might have known that is not made clear but it leads to a comic comparison of Asa's ears to a picture of Prince Charles. Discouraged Asa threatens to leave the steppe and move to the city with Boni but is reluctant to give up either his dream of marrying Tulpan or learning about animal husbandry.As Asa tries to prove himself to Ondas whose herd of sheep is plagued by a series of mysterious deaths he assists in the birthing of a lamb and meets his severest test. Tulpan is a natural showcase for the region and Cinematographer Joly Dylewska captures the swirling dust and the stark landscape with striking success. One of the best scenes is that of a bandaged camel placed in a motorcycle sidecar by a veterinarian Esentai Tulendiev while the mother paces in the background. Not a dry National Geographic Special Tulpan has ethnic and pop music adorable children moments of wicked humor and an unforced naturalism that is captivating.".

Tulpan is a natural showcase for the region and Cinematographer Joly Dylewska captures the swirling dust and the stark landscape with striking success. One of the best scenes is that of a bandaged camel placed in a motorcycle sidecar by a veterinarian Esentai Tulendiev while the mother paces in the background. Not a dry National Geographic Special Tulpan has ethnic and pop music adorable children moments of wicked humor and an unforced naturalism that is captivating.";

	schema:reviewBody "Tulpan 2008 was directed and cowritten by Sergei Dvortsevoy. This film was co produced in five different countries but filmed primarily on the Central Asian steppes of Kazakhstan. The movie is basically about unrequited love but it has the feel of a documentary. Tulpan is one of those movies where the first thing you do when you return home is to check out its country of origin in Wikipedia!Boiled down to basics the film is about Asa who has returned home to Kazakhstan after serving in the Russian navy. Now he wants to find a wife and settle down to the nomadic life style that apparently still exists in this harsh and unforgiving landscape.Asa loves the beautiful Tulpan whom he has barely glimpsed and we never see. While he is courting her he lives with his sister her husband and their three children. Asa apparently was a good sailor but he's not really adept at the skills needed for life on the steppes. His brotherinlaw wants him to leave his sister wants him to stay and Asa can't decide what he wants to do or even what he'll be able to do.I know very little about life lived in a yurt on the Asian grasslands. As this life is portrayed in the movie it's not meant for dreamers or amateurs. People speak of the harsh beauty of the landscape but I don't see it. Well I see the harsh part but not the beauty. To me it looks cold dusty dry windy and forbidding. Our species is very adaptable and it's no surprise that a lifestyle has evolved that allows humans to survive in this environment. Whether Asa will choose that lifestyle and whether he will survive it if he does choose it are at the heart of the plot.At the heart of the movie are the images of the Steppes of Central Asia and the few rugged people who live there.".

And yet they never translate it for you...You have to figure it out for yourself! Sometimes unfortunately it seems that particular talent is fast becoming a lost art among U.S. moviegoers. Take a film like TULPAN which is so simple so unpretentious and yet manages to show us things in life that are so delicate and complicated! May Contain a Minor Spoiler or Two! What motivated me to give TULPAN a look? Certainly not the IMDb Blurb it really misses the mark! No my decision was based on a truly accurate quality review. Originality is something to be prized and praised in a movie. You know how rare it is to encounter a film with something totally original to offer. TULPAN has at least 5 elements that I don't recall seeing in any other cinematic work! Without them 6 or 7 more than likely would have been my rating...But I'll add 12 for each original element bringing my rating up to 9. So What are these elements? 1 ALL the actors in TULPAN appear using their REAL names! Maybe you're thinking you've seen a few other films like that. Well in ALL the others I remember like this the production values are horrific and the acting worse. Here the acting is so natural so oblivious to the camera it lends a Slice of life feel to the production.2 Have seen movies in dozens of different languages! Kazak is not one of them. So TULPAN is my first in this language related to Turkish.3Have you ever seen mouthtomouth respiration administered to a newborn calf in a movie? Not just once but several times by two different actors! Elements 4 and 5....? Let's keep the last two elements a surprise. Although my alternate title above should give you a hint. Sheepherding on the Asian Steppe is anything but exciting. TULPAN REALLY drives that point home. If you're not willing to sit through movies where the pacing is at times excruciatingly deliberate but that reward you in the end for your patience...This is not for you. If you like windows into new and exotic cultures check TULPAN out! 9 STARS.....ENJOYDISFRUTELA! Any comments questions or observations in English or Espaol are most welcome!".

He looks for a bride and plans to settle down to a life of herding sheep on the Hungersteppe Betpak Dala of Kazakhstan. The only available bride is Tulpan who he sets out to woo. He resists his friend Boni's attempts to get him to head for the cities.Kazakh documentary maker Sergey Dvortsevoy has brought us the acclaimed feature film Tulpan. Its flat dusty dry plains are reminiscent of parts of outback Australia but are even more remote. The movie was shot 500 km from the nearest city Chimkent. It is harsh and unforgiving with powerful dust storms dominating the environment.Most of the interior scenes take place in traditional tent houses called jurtes. The family is close in every sense of the word. Asa's sister Samal Samal Esljamova and Ondas Ondas Besikbasov and their three children share their home with him. Some of the most touching scenes involve singing within the intimacy of the family group.The tiny domestic space is not the only cause of tension. Ondas is particularly tough on his brotherinlaw Asa perhaps because of the incredibly strong bonds between brother and sister.Like the lives of the local people the making of the film revolved around and evolved with the lives of the sheep. Dvortsevoy explains on the official websiteThe crew spent two weeks just following sheep. In the third week we tried several times on video to understand what camera movements should be used when the sheep is giving birth. Once the camera crew was technically ready we waited for one of the thousands of sheep to give birth. The shepherd had a radio station and would call us as soon as one was ready.When the scenes were shot I understood that they are so unique and powerful that I had to adjust the rest of the film to those scenes rather than adjusting them to the script. From that on we opened the film to the experiences we made in everyday life and let them influence the storybuilding. In the end the film grew like a tree and many things were unpredictable. The karakul sheep from Central Asia have been controversial ... it could refer to the fur of newborn Persian or karakul lambs or it could refer to broadtail fur taken from fetal lambs or generally refer to bothbut whatever its exact definition astrakhan boils down to one thing early death for lambs often even death for fetal lambs and their mothers. 'Astrakhan Hot New Fashion is the Same Old Cruelty'The birth scene is the most gripping moment of the story. The website has a full explanation.One small criticism the shaky handheld camera work was sometimes unnecessarily distracting.It's easy to see why Tulpan has been hot at the film festivals. Superlatives are hard to avoid original raw authentic genuine funny joyous honest.Dvortsevoy has restored respectability to the term reality. In fact it is hard not to think that this is a documentary at times. These people couldn't really be actors.

	schema:headline " Trying to make the steppe your home";
	schema:reviewBody "Another film from Kazakhstan but unlike the NYFF's 'Chouga' far from being set in the newly rich urban part of the country. Dvortsevoy a successful documentary filmmaker chose to make this his first feature in the ethnographic mode among shepherds in the Betpak Dala the steppe a region of scrubby grass dirt flatland whirling wind storms and stormy skies. The technique is to work in nearwilderness among nonactors with nothing but camels or donkeys or rugged trucks to travel by surrounded by a herd of sheep and a few goats living in a yurt. The method and setting resemble those of Dava and Falorni's 'The Weeping Camel' but the focus this time is not as anecdotal and the story raises fewer troubling questions. It's still not certain that the effect of authenticity means the events we're witnessing truthfully depict life in the steppe. But the sense of trying to adapt to a harsh environment and culture is powerful and the landscape is awesome and the sheep births we witness are unquestionably real.The protagonist is Asa Askat Kuchinchirekov. He is a young sailor who's just finished his military service who comes out to the Hunger Steppe to live with the family of his sister Samal Samal Eslyamova headed by her husband an older man Ondas Ondasyn Besikasov. Sailors draw their dreams under the lapels of their uniforms and Asa's sketch shows the plain with a yurt children camels and the sun shining. Apparently he is from somewhere else it's not clear how his sister got to be Ondas' wife but he doesn't want city life he wants to make his paradise out here. He dreams of prospering as a shepherd doing so well he can buy solar panels to put on his yurt so he can have electricity. His pal is the nutty Boni Tulepbergen Baisakalov a transport driver whose truck is plastered with magazine photos of nude babes and who plays loud pop music as he drives madly across the plain.

	onyx:emotionText "Another film from Kazakhstan but unlike the NYFF's 'Chouga' far from being set in the newly rich urban part of the country. Dvortsevoy a successful documentary filmmaker chose to make this his first feature in the ethnographic mode among shepherds in the Betpak Dala the steppe a region of scrubby grass dirt flatland whirling wind storms and stormy skies. The technique is to work in nearwilderness among nonactors with nothing but camels or donkeys or rugged trucks to travel by surrounded by a herd of sheep and a few goats living in a yurt. The method and setting resemble those of Dava and Falorni's 'The Weeping Camel' but the focus this time is not as anecdotal and the story raises fewer troubling questions. It's still not certain that the effect of authenticity means the events we're witnessing truthfully depict life in the steppe. But the sense of trying to adapt to a harsh environment and culture is powerful and the landscape is awesome and the sheep births we witness are unquestionably real.The protagonist is Asa Askat Kuchinchirekov. He is a young sailor who's just finished his military service who comes out to the Hunger Steppe to live with the family of his sister Samal Samal Eslyamova headed by her husband an older man Ondas Ondasyn Besikasov. Sailors draw their dreams under the lapels of their uniforms and Asa's sketch shows the plain with a yurt children camels and the sun shining. Apparently he is from somewhere else it's not clear how his sister got to be Ondas' wife but he doesn't want city life he wants to make his paradise out here. He dreams of prospering as a shepherd doing so well he can buy solar panels to put on his yurt so he can have electricity. His pal is the nutty Boni Tulepbergen Baisakalov a transport driver whose truck is plastered with magazine photos of nude babes and who plays loud pop music as he drives madly across the plain. It's Boni who first brings Asa to the yurt of Ondas and who dreams and schemes with him.Driven by Boni Ondas takes Asa more than once a day's ride to a family who have an eligible daughter the beautiful Tulpan Tulip whom the suitor only glimpses. She watches behind a screen. At these interviews Asa has an unfortunate tendency to dwell on a story about how he successfully fought an octopus.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Tulpan for the second time last night. It seems to me the movie is really about how different people react to wrenching changes mostly by nursing a fantasy of some sort. Among other things Tulpan documents the current way people and sheep use that steppe which under the surface isn't very nice.As the yurt is a touchstone with the past it's commonly retained even though it doesn't actually make much sense any more. These herdsmen move very infrequently if at all and these yurts are typically surrounded by outbuildings that look pretty permanent. What good really is a moving house if you don't move? The person who insists Asa must be married before getting any sheep is Comrade Boss not brotherinlaw Ondas  Asa and Ondas have their differences but the assignment of sheep is not among them. Ondas and his family cannot move without approval from the Boss. The Boss controls the only veterinarian and most of the vehicles. The Boss tells Ondas he's responsible for every stillborn lamb. All this adds up to the current economic pattern in that area herds of sheep belong to nonresident owners who contract their care to the actual herdsmen. The herdsmen live sort of like their ancestors but don't actually own most of the sheep seldom move and don't have all that much freedom.Daughter Beke and also to some extent her mother and Asa's sister Samal appear to cope with the dichotomy between the idealized life and the actual life of a herdsman's family by rather defiantly singing lots of folk songs. Perhaps the folk songs are just the most visible sign of fantasizing the old ways.Tractor driver Boni survives the dichotomy by diving deeply into a fantasy pastiche of music sex and wealth. He's the conduit to the outside and so is more worldly than the herdsmen he serves. But by more objective standards he's woefully uninformed too. At one point he speaks of bypassing the city and going directly to Sakhalin Island. Never mind that Sakhalin Island is in a different country thousands of miles away through several other countries.Asa appears to survive the dichotomy by remaining completely unaware of it. He admires a solar panel in a magazine without ever realizing no herdsman could possibly afford such a thing. He admires a motorcycle in the magazine too but without ever reflecting such a thing would be useless without a reasonably accessible supply of gasoline. He compliments Tulpan on wanting to go to college at the same time he wants her to marry him without any sense that it might be difficult to do both. The scene he draws on his collar is of an idealized herdsman with healthy children not the halfcrazy kids he actually lives with his own herd of sheep more wealth than any real herdsman ever had and the freedom to move wherever he wishes whenever he wishes.Brotherinlaw Ondas clings to the old ways even though they don't quite add up any more. He invests a lot of time and effort in quixotic visits to Tulpan's yurt that are doomed from the start. He doesn't know his neighbors. Although they politely receive him they apparently weren't ever expecting a marriage proposal visit and don't know quite how to deal with one. Ondas's gift looks like an electric light fixture with lots and lots of little pieces to keep clean intended for an elegant room. It wouldn't be of any use in a yurt with dust and a little smoke? and no electricity. And he talks of giving a large number of sheep too never mind that the sheep don't seem to be his to give or that talking of a large number of sheep in the context of marriage seems irrelevant. The scenic views of far away horizons and sparse vegetation portray what I'd call a semidesert. Just try to imagine a tulip sprouting up between those tufts. If you can imagine it at all it will look horribly out of place. Likewise the tulip Asa draws into the scene on his collar is in a different style and colors than the rest. It's added on but not integrated.".

The writerdirector Sergei Dvortsevoy who is 47 is from Kazakhstan where Tulpan is set and has been involved in a half dozen films as writer and director. But I enjoy Russian cinema and Kazakhstan was once part of the Soviet Union so maybe Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country although it does border on the Caspian and Aral Seas. The steppe where the film takes place is the largest dry steppe region in the world and the film offers dramatic vistas of this flat flat plain where people have lived as nomadic herders for centuries and continue to raise sheep goats camels in one of the least densely populated regions on earth.Asa the main character has come home from his duties as a sailor in the navy. He hopes to arrange a marriage for himself with the help of his sister and brotherinlaw with a local girl he's never met Tulpan. There is much delicious dry humor in this set up. Asa hopes to set himself up as nomad living his life in his yurt scratching out an existence from the hardscrabble land. The film beautifully portrays for us in almost documentary fashion the life Asa hopes to achieve.His sister's family is lovingly presented. His sister is beautiful and loves her daughter whose constant singing irritates the stern hard working father and her young son who gallops about pretending the stick he is straddling is like the horse his father rides. But the authenticity of the life presented here is documentary like and I mean that in the best possible way. The young boy appears to not to be aware of the camera at all as do all of the actors camels included. So what we see seems a very authentic look at a fragile way of life.And therein lies another of the beauties of Tulpan. As the attempt at arranging the marriage runs into roadblock after roadblock we see how much Asa loves that existence. His brotherinlaw wonders why Asa would choose such a difficult existence given the choice. But Dvortsevoy while showing the daily life and death struggles a herdsman must endure is also able to demonstrate why someone would do whatever to live a rich life in such a beautiful yet primitive place.I can't recommend Tulpan highly enough.

	schema:headline " Best treated as a documentary on the lives of Kazakh herders as the plot is a skeleton reduced in filming";
	schema:reviewBody "The Russian filmmaker Sergey Dvortsevoy had gained a reputation for documentaries but in the 2008 TULPAN he tries his hand at fiction with this story set in Kazakhstan. After serving in the Russian Navy Asa Askhat Kuchinchirekov returns to the Kazakh steppe living with his sister Samal Yeslyamova and brotherinlaw Ondasyn Besikbasov while he tries to court the only unmarried young woman within hundred of kilometres.As a sort of documentary TULPAN will be an interesting experience for viewers in the West capturing the desolation of the Kazakh steppe and the hard work that herders there must do to eke out a living. Some of the younger characters feel the draw of the big city whose modernity offers them an easier life than the dull steppe. As a linguist I found that the film represented well the RussianKazakh codeswitching common after the Soviet era which only underscores how these people feel torn between two worlds. The arguable climax of the movie comes with Asa assisting the reallife birth of a sheep which is depicted realistically so that the audience learns something but thankfully not too graphically.But as fiction I am less impressed with the film. I get the feeling that Asa's pursuit of Tulpan was the centre of the original script but was mostly set aside after Dvortsevoy decided to improvise much of the film. The result is a lack of substance outside the pure observation of traditional life. All in all it's worth seeing once and you'll learn something but it's no classic.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Russian filmmaker Sergey Dvortsevoy had gained a reputation for documentaries but in the 2008 TULPAN he tries his hand at fiction with this story set in Kazakhstan. After serving in the Russian Navy Asa Askhat Kuchinchirekov returns to the Kazakh steppe living with his sister Samal Yeslyamova and brotherinlaw Ondasyn Besikbasov while he tries to court the only unmarried young woman within hundred of kilometres.As a sort of documentary TULPAN will be an interesting experience for viewers in the West capturing the desolation of the Kazakh steppe and the hard work that herders there must do to eke out a living. Some of the younger characters feel the draw of the big city whose modernity offers them an easier life than the dull steppe.

And add on to that the beautiful songs sang by the kid and her mother deserts have millions of stories to tell. May be its just a particle of sand that got drifted to we viewers through Sergei's lens. Still i believe Tulpan's character could have been introduced with more touch points so that the strength of the plot would have been more touchy. Asa faced very few challenges in the story to signify the importance of Tulpan in his life. It's a beautiful movie its just that i'm still greedy for a lengthier version of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sergei Dvortsevoy's Tulpan is a really mature and really quite fascinating mediation on a young man's angst as well as his apparent unrequited love life as a Kazakh farmer living in rural nowhere contemporary culture clashing with more classical stances and the telling of a great friendship between two young men. The film at once recalls the work of Iranian directors Abbas Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf specifically both the sorts of material combining with the very specific aesthetics applied to two of their films in 1998's Taste of Cherry and 1996's Gabbeh respectively. Similalrly it owes a great deal of debt to some of the Italian neorealist works of the 1940s and 50s the film coming to resemble as much an articulate tale about characters going through transitions and suffering hardships as it is a raw and uncompromising depiction of life in the barren locale in which it's set. Where something like De Sica's The Bicycle Thieves may have used causality plot mechanisms and catalysts to drive its lead through a story set in a world which would eerily double up as echoing its own frightening reality Dvortsevoy here draws on similar approaches and depicts life set amidst a Kazakh locale known as 'Hunger Steppe' as those whom inhabit it just seem to fall in to proceedings.The lead is a certain Asa Kuchencherekov a young man in his twenties recently discharged from the Russian Navy returning to what we presume to be a locale similar to his own roots so as to rendezvous with his sister Samal Esljamova a woman living with her husband Ondas Besikbasov and three children in a small tentlike structure on their farm. Dvortsevoy's film is a bareall look at life upon this locale when particular characters are rounding up cattle and a large whirlwind of sand and dust kicks up nearing itself to the livestock that's a truetolife event captured in its rawest form on film and incorporated into the text going on to not only affect the characters we're identifying with but doubling up to outline life as it is in this exact zone. Tulpan unfolds in a locale in which the sands and outback of the place surrounds the farm in all directions while expansive hills and mountains spreading all the way out to the horizon provide the place with an intimidating and surreal edge as if there is nothing in any direction for several hundred miles and you're cut off in precisely where you're based. That sense of being trapped feels prominent so much so that when one character expresses his wishes to expand one's position in life to broaden out elsewhere that agonising and desperate sense of it having little chance comes about.Asa and his tractordriving all singing all smiling BoneyM loving friend Boni Baisakalov look to elevate their positions in life the film beginning in the small tent of a neighbouring family as Asa pines for the titular Tulpan's hand in marriage she being the daughter of a wealthy landowning unit. The pair of them linger on magazines detailing certain pieces of American iconography such as expensive landcruisers to replace worn out farming vehicles modern apartments to replace minute makeshift tents and the golden gate bridge to replace the searing travelling in a single direction for long stretches of time across sand and nothingness. The two boys are very much a part of a newer more contemporary Kazakh mindset of elevating their positions in the world building to the ownership of more grandeur things and climbing the proverbial ladder you might say formulates something resembling The American Dream. Ondas whom represents a lesser contemporary more classical mindset stands in opposition to this thinking pattern the notion of he being of a generation brought up prior to independence whilst still under Soviet rule feeling prominent.In the mean time Asa wants to own farmland Tulpan's unwillingness to take his hand in marriage the only thing stopping young Asa from living his dream and that notion of whether Asa wants to effectively marry into her family so as to attain this or whether he genuinely loves her as who she is is neatly captured by Dvortsevoy. The severity of the situation is highlighted to the lead during the opening few minutes when following the attempt to come to some arrangement with Tulpan's family Ondan points out that there are no longer any women left for Asa to marry. Not that this deters the man his prolonged attempts at wooing Tulpan whom more often than not is either kept off screen or whose face remains elusive to proceedings veers the film away from its pseudodocumentary roots that are combining with light comedy anyway and into doomed romance and a far bleaker tone. It is revealed Tulpan's family are careful in whom they select to marry their daughter and whilst it is her future being discussed Tulpan is relegated to peering through beaded strings formulating a makeshift door as her father in the business management field instigates a class war into the film by rejecting what is effectively a 'pitch' on behalf of Asa and an extension of his family.All of these ingredients are woven into the film rather spectacularly if one were to stagger away from the film feeling as if it is like nothing one has ever seen before then the chances are it will be because such approaches to such material have rarely been explored within such a locale as the expansive desolate barren terrain of a vast Kazakh steppe. This Kazakh multiple award winner and Foreign Language Oscar representative culminating in a really quite engrossing and rather eyeopening account of dreams trials tribulations clashes of both a generational and class related nature as well as a rarely depicted lifestyle brought to life in the most arresting of fashions.".

If those ewes are malnourished you sure can't tell from their energetic behavior. So don't ask me to believe that's why they're losing their lambs. If they're so malnourished why are the lambs carried to full term and coming out more or less the right size? And how come since much of the action revolves around moving the animals to pasture we never once not once see a sheep or a cow or a camel EAT anything? And what's up with that healthy ewe delivering a healthy baby needing assistance from the idiot? Baloney.One thing that came through so very clearly is the horror of being a woman on that steppe. Stuck with cooking cleaning children. Tulpan wants to go to college and her mother violently chases away the suitor presumably to spare her the life she the mom has endured. Asa's sister and niece are in some kind of cahoots to torment Ondas. I have to believe the filmmaker understands what he is showing so maybe this whole horrible experience was a kind of feminist critique of a dying way of life that can't breathe it's last soon enough.So disappointing! The trailer was so wonderful! ".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I have to say what I liked original Free Willy movie. In fact I fall in love with it. I suppose it is one of the best family movie and best animal movie so far. For some reasons Simon Wincer who directed the first movie didn't return for making this sequel though we can see again all major characters from Free Willy. Our main hero Jesse is now fourteen years old and he finds out that his mother passed away and he has a stepbrother named Elvis. Elvis hasn't got any relatives except Jesse and he arrives to Greenwood's home. The whole family goes to the holiday trip in a camping near an ocean's cove where Jesse again meets his friend Randolph and Willy. Willy found his family and all seems perfect for the friends but suddenly another danger threatens their friendship. But now it's even more serious. The movie was released in 1995 eight years before notorious tanker Prestege shipwrecked near Spanish coast and ruined hundred of miles of coastline not to mention that millions living creatures got killed in the result. It was a real message and it passed absolutely unnoticed because for many people these movies are just cheesy movies for kids only. And in the real life the main reasons of the monstrous disaster was absolutely same  money. The other problem point of the movie is rather difficult and complicated relation between Jesse and his much younger stepbrother Elvis played by Francis Capra. Elvis who has lost his mother also feel himself very uneasy about the situation and now both boys have to decide how to deal with this difficult situation. The story is basically good written and leaves some place for action and excellent scenes in the cove including underwater shots. This time we can see whales in their natural habitat not in the small pool. Whole movie is well shot and locations for shootings are very suitable and good selected. Jason James Richter is as good as in original movie and Francis Capra also did a very good job as rather annoying Jesse's halfbrother. The soundtrack again written by Basil Poleydoris is worth mentioning alone because of its rather good musical themes and songs. A very good movie for whole family and not a brainless laughable family entertainment that very often bring to us Hollywood studios. A nice message for young audience that you must always think about defending the wild nature and what in real life there are more important things than money.My vote 82 out of 10 or between B and A.".

The problem with the oil spill isn't original but it reminds us to always keep a look out for the orcas' safety. This movie differs from the first movie in the fact that it shows willy with his family it shows orcas in a pod and it shows their relationship as a family. How sweet! Willy is a very sociable whale. If you want the excitement and thrilling adventure that you got in the first movie check this one out asap. Safe for the entire family!".

	schema:reviewBody "My Take Preachy ecofriendly sequel but has its moments. Let go of your Save The Whales placards allow FREE WILLY 2 THE ADVENTURE HOME do the job for you. If you thought the original FREE WILLY had enough Free the Whales slogans to match a 3ton Orca's weight FREE WILLY 2 is even bigger with its environmentalist propaganda that is! In its story and characters it lacks that certain oomph of the original which elevated it from its predictable genre origins. FREE WILLY 2 is much more predictable with a bythnumbers storyline that might just entertain the kids and give adults a toothache from all its sweetness. Still for what its worth FREE WILLY 2 is enjoyable family affair. I say it's at least worth a rental. For the record at least its a better bargain than FLIPPER or even not that it has any connection JAWS THE REVENGE.The storyline is more filled of Save the Whales slogans than ever before. After leaving Willy Keiko assisted by an animatronic and CG double from his leap of faith in the original's finale Willy faces a new threat this time outside the confines of a small tank. Jessie Jason James Richter now grownup is out to save the day again. The story also provides him a sortofgirlfriend Mary Kate Schellhardt with a deep concern for the environment Couldn't this movie ever be more naturefriendly? and even a little brother named Elvis Francis Capra who is just so... annoying. Not that the film is crowded with good guys bad guys and beleaguered whales but why did they actually think that this kid annoying and a bit spoiled at some point would deepen the film's emotional level? Why they think a kid as nearly annoying as Elvis who's simply annoying quips are more than enough to drive you to the breaking point would be a good way to stretch Jessie's character I really don't know.Still as family entertainment FREE WILLY 2 does just about enough for a mild recommendation. The photography is adequate capturing on film a lively shot of its environments and of course the whales. I've read a trivia about the film that it uses much more animatronic whales than the first film yet it's really hard to spot in most scenes due to the rather seamless effect. The story is shallow predictable but actually quite believable although the JessieElvis brotherhood is something that can easily be removed without doing any harm to the story. As family entertainment I at least give it a fair and easy recommendation.Rating  out of 5.".

The movie starts with Willy with his family Randolph Now a best friend to Jesse hears willy's whale voice he records the voice and is chuffed to show it to Jesse when ie sees him. Jesse is know grown up by 4 and a half inches. Randolph sets out to collect Jesse to take him to the sea and to see Willy again Jesse can't believe his eyes when he sees willy and is amazed to see him as a bigger whale. Jesse meets Randolph's god daughter Nadean. They both become friendly to each other and get along together very well. Things become worse for the whales as oil is spreaded all over the sea Luna Willy's sister is in danger as the oil gets into her lungs Jesse starts to panic and calls Randolph Jesse alos has a half brother called Elvis who is an 8 year old kid He always wanted to help the whale but jesse's foster parent say that he is too young he then runs away and then comes back. Things become eveen worse when fire spreads with the oil still in the sea nadean and elvis are rescued but jesse loses grip of holding onto the ladders Willy saves him by going under the flames and bringing him to safety. I give this movie 10 out of 10.".

This sequel is not as good but it is decent. I do agree the story isn't as good or as believable this time around the script lacks sparkle and the direction isn't as clever. But it is beautifully filmed with lovely cinematography and scenery and the score is really pleasant. Free Willy 2 mayn't be the most fastpaced movie ever made but it moves briskly and the message is admirable. What makes the movie charming though is the cast Jason James Richter is still very likable and Francis Capra is funny and natural here. Mary Kate Schellhart and Michael Madson also do nice work however it is the orcas that steal the show every scene with them in is utterly riveting. Overall inferior but nice and pleasant. 710 Bethany Cox".

He tries to impress a girl with his whale expertise but she's having none of it. Nothing like a cold hostile female character to make your movie work huh?

Jesse's attempts at rescuing them are ignored by the adults though he eventually takes matters into his own hands when the ocean catches fire making for a far more exciting climax than the original movie.Director Dwight H.

The scenes of the burning ocean at the end look amazing and the story of Jesse bonding with his new brother makes for much better drama than the mucky schmaltz of the original.It ain't perfect and the villains seem shoehorned in there as they appear and disappear within 10 minutes but this really is one of those times when a sequel outdoes the first and it's mad that it barely made back its budget. I guess the summer of 1995 was just too busy for people to care about a whale and his moptopped human pal.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen my comment on the original Free Willy which is not a positive one you might be wondering why I'm reviewing this sequel why I would have bothered watching it. Well the only explanation I can give is that I saw it at school back in 1996 on my last day of Grade 3. While I couldn't seem to remember that much of it from that first viewing I clearly remember that the climax had my heart pounding and it was a memorable way to mark the end of my years as a primary student. So it's another film from my childhood which I decided to revisit and probably wouldn't have ever ended up seeing at all had I not seen it before. Since I didn't like the original 1993 film when I watched it recently it's no surprise I'm not too impressed with this 1995 sequel either.It has been two years since Jesse brought Willy the orca whale back to his natural habitat. The two haven't seen each other since then but Jesse is happy living with his foster parents Glen and Annie Greenwood. However the teenager is not happy when he is informed that his birth mother has just died and his younger halfbrother Elvis is coming to live with them. Jesse and Elvis do not get along and their conflict continues on a camping trip with their foster parents on which they have to share a tent. On this trip Jesse finally sees Willy again and also reunites with his friend Randolph. Randolph introduces his goddaughter Nadine whom Jesse quickly falls in love with. Trouble comes when an oil tanker crashes and spills its contents into the water threatening the lives of the whales! While Jesse and others attempt to save these whales Elvis has problems of his own.I didn't care much for many of the characters in the original film but this sequel introduces Elvis played by Francis Capra and he might be slightly worse than any character featured in the 1993 smash hit family movie. It seems Capra was given some poor lines in this role such as what his character says when he realizes his foster parents aren't rich. Of course not all cheesy lines in the movie come from him. Basically most aspects of this movie weren't done so well including the conflict between Jesse and Elvis which may be a little extreme at times and the teen romance between Jesse and Nadine. Like the original there is some tension and also maybe a few poignant moments but at times it may try too hard or not hard enough. I have to admit I actually found it mildly amusing when Glen and Annie go out looking for Elvis and Michael Jackson's song Childhood suddenly begins. I'm sorry I know it's a deeply personal song of Jackson's about his tragic upbringing and I know he is now dead but in this movie the song seemed to be thrown in as a poor attempt to push the right buttons on the audience. I didn't even know the artist was Michael Jackson when I watched the film.It seems Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home is less popular than the original Free Willy even though some critics considered it superior. Personally I'm pretty much indifferent to both of them. I've explained why I decided to watch and review this sequel but since I've never seen the final installment in the trilogy 1997's Free Willy 3 The Rescue which appears to be even less popular to this day I don't intend to watch it. I don't like what I've seen in the first two so much so I obviously don't want to sit through another hour and a half or so of what is probably pretty much the same thing. Despite how long it's been since the last Free Willy movie was made more than one source tells me that there will be a Free Willy 4 released next year starring Bindi Irwin the daughter of late conservationist Steve Irwin a.k.a. The Crocodile Hunter. Apparently it will be a directtoDVD release. No offence to the Irwins but I will definitely be passing on this one as well.".

	schema:headline " The boy and the whale are back but the warmth and cheerinducing magic have been diminished";
	schema:reviewBody "The boy is back. The whale is back. Most of the supporting cast from the 1993 cult classic Free Willy is back for the sequel which hit theaters before an excited crowd of youngsters and their parents in 1995. But the cheerinducing magic that I loved so much in the original has gone in Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home which isn't quite the adventure that the title seems to hint at. The title just seems more marketable and that's the way the movie feels too. It's got the typical monotonous rushed feeling that I tend to find most sequels have and while it's far from a disaster it is a letdown from the warmness and nostalgiastirring charm that I adored so much in the original film.In the last movie the beloved orca Willy Keiko leaped to safety from greedy marine park owners and escaped to the wild while the little boy he befriended Jesse Jason James Richter finally came to peace with his foster parents. Two years later Willy is still running free in the wild with his kin and the boy is reaching that age. You know. The age where girls send his heart pumping and the news that he has a halfbrother strikes him like a ton of bricks. His estranged mother has passed away and so he and his foster parents have to take the unwanted obnoxious brat from New York Francis Capra on their camping trip. Jesse's not so interested in camping but more in meeting up with his old friend August Schellenberg his pretty goddaughter Mart Kate Shellhardt and of course lovable Willy and his family. But things take a turn for the worse when an oil tanker runs aground in the cove where the whales are living and it's then that I realized Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home should have been titled Free Willy 2 The Escape because that's more of what it's about. Or why not just Free Willy 2? Oh yeah. Marketable.Everything that I loved so much in the first movie has been watered down here. First of all the sheer awe and magic of the killer whales. Whereas I could really feel the majesty and the amazing presence of Willy and the other whales in the first film here it seems more like placid outtakes from a rather cheap documentary as if the cast cheering at the sight of Willy were doing so at pictures and not the real thing. Amazing as it sounds but even though his namesake is the title of the movie Willy has very little to do with the movie at all. He's really just there for more marketing value. It's not until the third act the only energized moment in the picture that he really comes into play and even though just briefly.Furthermore the character dynamics are diminished. The sequel tries to explore the further complications of Jessie's life but it only cracks open the doors of opportunity never exploits them. The dynamic between him and his foster parents is just dimmeddown reruns of the same stuff we saw in the first movie. Even his relationship to the whale is dumbed away. But how about his new cast mates? Well Mr. Capra does what he can but he has one of the most aggravating characters in children movie history to play here. Even when his heart gets put into the right place he's really hard to put up with and as a result becomes hard to care about. And pretty and talented as she is as Jesse's love interest Miss Shellhardt does not have much to do and their romance is contrived tiresome tedious and boring. As most teenage love stories are. Maybe that's just the key. Maybe the reason I've never bought teenage love stories in movies is because I don't believe in them. I don't buy the gimmicks they use here especially considering the age. But that's a subject for another day. The point is their scenes together go on forever but leave about as much impact as a speck of sand on the wing of a plane.The first two acts of Free Willy 2 are really slowgoing. Not until the third act does the movie even pick up a little. The director Dwight H. Little has talent. He knows how to use a camera well and he has skill with working around actors and his crew. The movie is wellshot...most of the time. The whale scenes aren't very wellstaged. But what ultimately founders the movie is the severely diminished screenplay. Now I saw this movie more than ten years ago as a child having fallen in love with the original film. But whereas the first Free Willy stuck in my memory into my adulthood this one did not. I only remembered flashes of it. Looking back on it again I can clearly see why.".

The reason that they made this movie is because warner brothers needed to let people know about what was happening with that whale in person. Because he was going through a tough time and he was in poor health at that aquarium that he was at. and they needed the money to transfer him to oregon so he can improve his health a lot better and be trained to go to the wild. not that i blame them but the wild was not such a good place for him. even though keiko's family was there it was still not a good place for him to be do to the drama most of the orca's were experiencing. the only thing i didn't get is why didn't the free willy foundation sell keiko to anyone that can afford to take care of him in person. someone who will have a tank all prepared for keiko a huge tank and be there to take care of him in person like make sure he's OK and all and to give him his treatments when needed. that would have been better instead of donating money to get some kind of kit. But anyhow the movie itself I have to give it a rating 10 out of 10 after all this movie had a wonderful story and a wonderful point.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original film is a fun family feature with a lovable friendly creature the world fell in love with and this sequel isn't absolutely terrible. Basically its been two years since boy Jesse Jason James Richter helped Willy the killer whale played by Keiko to jump to freedom and when his true mother dies Jesse gains a halfbrother with troublemaker Elvis Francis Capra no relation to director Frank. While on a camping trip Jesse meets Willy again in the open water where he has found his mother and brothers oh and his human Indian friend who looks after the family Randolph August Schellenberg. Jesse also meets and falls for Randolf's goddaughter Nadine Mary Kate Schellhardt and she is astonished to see Willy let Jesse ride his back. Willy and his family hit jeopardy when a large oil tanker crashes spilling its load into the water and there is also a point when the oil catches fire and Jesse is determined to help them. Also starring Michael Madsen as Glen Jayne Atkinson as Annie Forest Gump's Mykelti Williamson as Dwight Elizabeth Pea as Kate Haley M. Emmet Walsh as Bill Wilcox Jon Tenney as John Milner and Paul Tuerpe as Milner's Assistant. It is surprising that most of the whales were models because they looked quite convincing and they are wonderful to watch. So while the story isn't very original it is the whales that keep you hooked and the end credits song Forever Young by The Pretenders. Okay!".

	schema:reviewBody "I need to explain why I gave this movie a rating of one star. It was the advertisement before the film starts for the glorified fish tank that they were building in Seattle to house detain orcas and other marine mammals. These mammals are dependent on their natural habitat for survival and languish under captivity. I find it appalling that the lead actors in Free Willy 2 were paid off to express their support for such a jail for orcas. I find it doubly reprehensible because in the advertisement as in the movie it is acknowledged and repeated that these animals spend their entire lives in the company of their families. Many die in captivity and the state of depression that these whales go into is so profound that even the ones who survive have a dorsal fin that is curled down. The character of the oil company representative in the film said it best in the coffee shop at the dock Just as long as we make it seem like we have the whales' best interest in mind. I would have given this film a sevenstar rating because of the decent acting good direction and potent environmental message. Apparently the actors in this movie are nothing more than actors Their forked tongue disgusts me.".

	schema:headline " Good Sequel But Not as Good as The First";
	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion none of the sequels can stand up to the first though this one is pretty good. I find the acting to be good for the most part. Elvis is portrayed perfectly as the delightfully annoying pest of a little brother though his character development is shown well as the movie progresses. It felt nice to watch Elvis and Jesse grow closer until the ending where it seemed as though they had grown up together and shared a bond. Nadine is a nice addition to the cast of characters providing Jesse with a love interest. It was nice to watch their bond develop and grow as the movie went on as well. The only complaint I have about the acting is the scene at the dock where Jesse is first reunited with Willy aside from having seen him from a distance on Randolph's boat. I felt as though there could have been much more emotion shown from Jesse. He was obviously happy to see Willy again but I expected more excitement and enthusiasm. The storyline is believable and brings attention to the very real problem of oil spills. Some consider it a bit preachy but I'm glad this movie spreads awareness about the damage oil spills do to the environment instead of just the tourism industry. The robots in this movie were phenomenal though in the scenes where Jesse introduces Nadine to Willy and the ending after Willy saves Jesse from the fire some of the paint on the chin spots is visibly missing half of one of the spots is gone and in some scenes it appears as though the spots in Willy's right eyepatch aren't there at all. Minor mistakes compared to how real and believable the robots are though. Overall a good movie with a good message to spread. Recommended.".

His features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim him to be a bad director this time . Everything happens.

But to be fair the film industry does this all the time taking a popular film and its ideas  themes then running them completely into the ground.But who really cares about that crap as long as the film is good.  I do not claim to possess an intricate knowledge of filmmaking I simply like what I like and don't care if other people laugh at me and think I'm stupid for enjoying what they consider bad cinema.When I first watched The St. Francisville Experiment in college with a couple of my friends I was totally drawn into the film.  For the hour that it was on I was completely engrossed in the goings on of the four characters as they try to determine whether or not the house is haunted.  Granted the acting certainly wasn't Oscarcaliber but the cast was believable enough to keep my attention for the duration of the film.  They exuded enough of a naive charm that I found them likeable and wanted them to come out of the house unscathed.Perhaps most important of all involving a haunted house film was that I found the film scary.  It's been quite a while since I've felt fear from watching a film having my skin break out in goosebumps.  And this movie did it for me and I can't thank them enough.Ripoff or not I like this film!  It has believable characters a cool back story based on true events eerie atmosphere and an overall feeling of doom and horror.  I like this film even more than The Blair Witch Project which is itself somewhat of a ripoff of Cannibal Holocaust and I am not ashamed to say that.".

How badly dead is it?This thing is also notable for having what is probably the stupidest cat jump scare I've ever seen. I can't forget the bit towards the end where the group splits up and the guy going into the attic keeps complaining about how scary it looks in there.

The speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. possibly loosely scripted. To me it sounded much more like they were always trying to adlib. which they almost always did poorly. Therefore they knew they were making a 'movie' not just collecting real natural footage. So I'm sure these people knew what was going on knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up...and they were just told to adlib around it all.'Major Spoilers' Okay it's so lame. Every item spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare is magically stumbled upon by these people. Let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that I remember1 Less than 2 minutes of entering the house they turn a light switch on  the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy.2 They happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife in it while exploring the cellar.3 They hear a noise in an armoire so they open the door slowly  BAM  a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking.4 Then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall so let's stick our hand in...wow they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape.5 Let's go to the attic uhoh it feels 'heavy' up here....BOOM  a chair flies across the room.6 Time to eat. Oh no ! The girl that was scared of bugs had a ROACH in her sandwich ! LOL !....ridiculous.7 Let's get out the Ouija board...oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board.

What was that noise in the chimney...CLINK  oh my shackles fell out I think she kept people up here.9 Now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft...oh what's this she sees something...and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is. SWISH  It falls off straight at her. perfect camera shot She moves just in time. It was more chain.10 Now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms  wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now...okayCHICK 1 Wow suddenly her room is shaking...but no one elses does.DUDE 1 Actually says to himself Charles is that you Charles...it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you Charles. Well guess what he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor. Another lucky camera shot.CHICK 2 Hears things..try to communicate ...and is standing there getting abrasions or something.DUDE 2 He was in the attic reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter....I don't remember what else.11 Dude 2 runs gets Chick 2...they hear chick and dude 1 screaming...they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table. They leave. Cut to black. Final text tell us they escaped safely were treated for minor cuts. They have since had nightmares and insomnia we also find out the next day a 911 call was made by they name a someone named Charles.'Major Spoilers' overOkay when I first heard this movie was being made I couldn't wait. I thought it was going to be real. REAL real.  and more professional with more professional type people. I love the idea of this type of thing I'd love to see real haunting footage. Before this movie was released I saw couple reviews of it by people online. They both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were.. time passed I forgot about the film....then I realized It was never released at theaters. So I found out it went straight to video rented it....found that every brutal review was completely true. It's too bad I really wanted this to be good.Random thought The house didn't seem to have TVs radios..kitchen appliances that I recall...which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time. Especially the house is truly known for being haunted...im pretty sure no one lives there. But it looks so clean and tidy...and what was a cat doing there ? The property does not have near by neighbors....Allinall you'll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it...or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you. you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film...or real filmRandom thought I believe the producer says The 'footage' you see is real. Well technically it is real footage isn't it ? Real footage of fake hauntings ? Maybe that was his loop hole.I give this this movie one star  strictly on the fact that they told the story of Madame LaLaurie.

It's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it. Another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should I say it was thrown out to give it effect. This movie was not realistic at all. It's highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the St. Francisville Experiment took place. I believe that the house may be haunted but not on the night this movie was filmed! The ending was amusing when Tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement. Paul and Madison found them and rescued them! I would rather watch the Blair Witch Project again then have to sit through the St. Francisville Experiment movie again. As I said if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events I may have like it more.

You are presented with a group of college students being placed into a horror movie type atmosphere and reacting in as real a way as possible. At first glance yes this seems lie a BWP rip off but there are less nauseating shakey cameras and absolutely NO completely black shots. This means instead of hearing Oh my god what was that! You see what that was and get freaked out just as much as the students in the film. St. Francisville is a legitimately scary film. It had me spooked for several days and it took me up till my fourth time watching it to no longer dread looking into a mirror. The cast is varied. Basically you have a Scooby Doo set of characters. There's the head strong leader who comes off as a jerk way too much Paul there's the semivacant yet cute peppy girl who gets up close with a bug in a great gross out scene Ryan there's the smart know it all who is a psychic and the brunt of the group and house's scorn Madison and then there is the loveable and hilarious goof ball who loves the Ghosts Tim. All that is missing is a dog though there is a cat at one point and a guy in a rubber mask. Most of the shots are taken from the film student of the group Tim's camera. Since he is the film student he has the best control and sets up some really good shots. All the other character's use the cameras at one point or another Ryan by far uses it the worst but Tim actually seems like he knows what he is doing unlike the three film students in BWP. All in all this is a good film it comes off as hookey at some points like the Cat scene but it has real shook scares and a continuous feeling of unease. This is definitely worth watching more than once and not recommended to be watched alone.".

But I loved it... it was a fun kind of scary. My brother thought it was dumb and made fun of me for being so scared...but I don't know how it didn't even phase him. All in all... the movie is well made very believable and entertaining to watch. YES it's very low budget YES it has slow parts  but it isn't such a big deal because once stuff gets going its quick and jumpy and you don't mind the inbetween and YES it may seem like a rip off of Blair Witch Project. So what? Watch this movie in a good mood with an open mind and see what you think. It's worth a shot... make sure you have something to hold onto tho... just in case ".

How is it scripted if there are no screenwriters? its hard to talk normally if you are in a haunted house especially one that almost killed you as soon as you entered. and about that whole Blair witch knock off film theory it is out of the question because every single documentary style film ever made revolving around ghosts or the supernatural before or after Blair witch real or fiction independent or funded by major companies have been disregarded as Blair witch movies.".

During the Mexican Rebellion of 1866  an unsavory group of American adventurers are hired by the forces of Emperor Maximilian to escort a countess to Vera Cruz . Napoleon III emperor of France  creates in Mexico a vassal state governed by Maximilian George Mcready of France . The French troops control the country and the fate of its inhabitants . There soon emerges a rebel leader  Benito Juarez whose supporters took the name of juaristas . Two soldiers of fortune find themselves in different camps  as Benjamin Trane Gary Cooper was 52 at the time of filming although his character was only supposed to be a couple of years older than Burt's role is the good guy and Joe Erin Burt Lancaster is the bad guy  both of whom along with their motley group Ernest Borgnine  Jack Lambert  Jack Elam  Charles Bronson decide serve the Emperor Maximilian . Meanwhile  Benjamin Trane falls in love for a beautiful Mexican rebel Spanish Sara Montiel . During a party celebrated by Marquis Henri de Labordere Cesar Romero they meet the Countess Marie Duvarre Denise Darcel  both gunmen must protect her from possible attacks of the revolutionaries . In fact  they are planning seize a stagecoach filled with valuable gold . The picture was partially based on historical events  as Maximilian was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico on 10 April 1864 with the backing of Napoleon III of France and a group of Mexican monarchists who sought to revive the Mexican monarchy. Many foreign governments including that of the United States refused to recognize his administration. This helped to ensure the success of republican forces led by Benito Jurez and Maximilian was captured and executed in 1867.Interesting as well as actionpacked Western full of thrills emotion  intrigue  shootouts and marvelous outdoors from Mexico . The two giants  Cooper and Lancaster  battle in the biggest spectacle of them all . Anthological performance by Burt Lancaster is fabulous  his character would influence profoundly in Spaghetti Western  he steals every scene as the blackdressed  smiling gunfighter . As the roles are more cynical  selfish and unscrupulous than traditional western . In fact  this film is sometimes called the first spaghetti western due to its reputed influence on the Italian directors such as Sergio Leone who popularized the genre . The screenplay by Roland Kibbee and James R. Webb is pretty basic but holds your interest until the exciting climatic Shotdown . Rousing as well as emotive musical score by the classical Hugo Friedhofer . Gorgeous cinematography by Ernest Laszlo  being the first film to be made in the SuperScope process. Luxurious sets and spectacular production design and one of the first major Hollywood films to be made on location in Mexico . Filmmaking legislation in Mexico meant that a local director had to be involved in the production in some capacity though he wasn't actually used  however  the Mexican authorities were appalled at the way their citizens were depicted in the film so any subsequent Hollywood productions had to conform to some strict rules . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Robert Aldrich and produced by Burt Lancaster's own production company for 1.7 million it went on to become a sizeable hit grossing over 11 million. It was Robert Aldrich's personal favourite  he particularly enjoyed the fact that it had a hero and an antihero. Aldrich directed a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone and violent scenes . He was an expert on warlike Dirty Dozen  The Angry Hills  Attack  Ten seconds to hell and Western The Frisko kid  Ulzana's raid Apache  Veracruz  The last sunset . Raing  Above average  it's a must see and a standout in its genre .".

	schema:headline " A Classic Adventure Mexico's Revolution Gold and Romance";
	schema:reviewBody "This unpretentious and incredibly influential western began as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster with his production company's executives. He was looking for work as the film industry was being murdered by Congress's seat tax and its new hastilycreated TV networks and payments to people to make movies abroad instead of in the U.S. He hired longinthetooth but screenwise Gary Cooper to play opposite him and a script was developed by three veteran writersBorden case Roland Kibbee and James R. Webb. Its storyline featured groups of gunmen heading south to serve for pay as Empreror Maximilian of Mexico tried to put down the native revolution against his corrupt government. There is a bangup opening as Ben Trane Cooper shoots his injured horse and buys another from Joe Erin Lancaster. They are chased by Mexican officers Cooper wonders why and Joe tells him he's riding the Lieutenant's horse which he himself had stolen earlier. Ben leaves Joe behind when there is only one horse unharmed between them he rides into a town where the Erin gang are waiting. They are about to attack him en masse when Joe shows up just as Ben has beaten up Ernest Borgnine. Others in the gang include Charles Bronson in an early role Jack Elam and James McCallion. et al. The next problem is to settle who will lead the Americanos Joe or a rival powerful Jack Lambeert. A gunfight settles that question. The new recruits are take by Cesar Romero and Henry Brandon Maximilian's chief men to meet the Emperor. George Macready plays the frenchborn Maximilian beautifully as always at a grand palace party where the Yankees put on a shooting exhibition and the Emperor tries his hand as well. Meanwhile they have encountered Sarita Montiel stealing Ben's money and General Ramirez beautifully underplayed by Morris Ankrum who asks them not to join the Emperor's army he turns out to be the head of the revolution they escape his wellplanned trap by threatening some children but at least they realize what they are getting into. Their first assignment is to escort Denise Darcel a Countess and her coach to safety. Of course she turns out to be carrying gold to pay Maximilian's forces elsewhere. Joe and Ben want the gold and eventually they get it. But then comes the reckoningbetween a Southerner a man who had lost everything in the Civil War in a lost cause and a man who regards all softness as a weakness and even killed his own mentor years before...Ben wins the shootout and decides to turn the money over to the revolution and keep Sarita Montiel for his own prize. This is a very tight script a favorite film with male and female moviegoers. It has many pluses other than the actors and the strong situational dialogue. Robert Aldrich's direction is clean straightforward and keeps the action moving in between interesting dialogue exchanges. The firstrate cinematography is by Ernest Laszlothe very good costumes by Norma production design by Alfred Ybarra Hugo Friedhofer composed the excellent music. In terms of the acting which dominates half this otherwise outdoor film Cooper succeeds by underplaying Lancaster later said he himself had started the film on toohigh a level and learned lessons that served him for years from Cooper during this feature's filming. Darcel does not seem like a Countess but gives her part energy lovely Montiel has an odd accent but is very strong. Borgnine and Elam do well and Lambert and the rest of the gang all do well. Brandon Romero and Macready as usual steal their scenes. All in all a western that satisfies does not look fifty years old and has no slow points no real defects. This is the sort of film Hollywood youthful corporate types cannot make any more and it inspired a generation of Italian filmmakers including Sergio Leone. It is an adventure that should live long in the minds and hearts of fans of the Western genre.".

The most striking scene is in a plaza  with a great gunfight followed with the meetings with the main players in the plot including a couple of hundred revolutionaries and Cesar Romero  whose character serves the Emperor of Mexico  Maximillian.  This initial sequence of scenes are very well done have a tough and cynical feel about them  and seem a little ahead of their time.  After this point the movie becomes a more typical 1950s big budget adventure film.  It remains entertaining  but looses the sharpness that these first striking minutes had.  Only at the very end of the film does it regain it's edge.  It could have been an excellent film  but is still entertaining and well worth watching.Cooper and Lancaster are good as always and their usual onscreen personas compliment each other well. The Mexican locations were great.This film was very influential on the Italian filmmakers that would go on to create the spaghetti western.  Stylistically the influence can be scene most in plaza scene.  The plot filled with multiple double crosses and betrayals will also seem familiar to fans of the eurowestern  as does the primary character motivation  greed.  Also  this film may explain the large number of SW that involve Maximillian  Jaurez  and soldiers of fortune manipulating them.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the American Civil War ended another war was just beginning. The Mexican people were struggling to rid themselves of their foreign EmperorMaximilian. Into this fight rode a handful of Americansex soldiers adventurers criminalsall bent on gain. They drifted South in small groups AND SOME CAME ALONE Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster head the cast as two polar opposite American adventurers who get involved with Maximilian's royal house and Juarez's revolutionaries in 1860s Mexico. Cooper plays Benjamin Trane basically a good man tho one tainted by much cynicism and Lancaster plays Joe Erin gunman and an untrustworthy crook. Vera Cruz was the first release in SuperScope beautifully shot by Ernest Laszlo on location in Mexico and with director Robert Aldrich at the helm the film brilliantly captures the violence and danger that was brought about during Mexico's revolutionary period. Adapted by Roland Kibbee and James R. Webb from a Borden Chase story Vera Cruz very much feels like is a precursor to Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. With its blend of comedy and outright action the film is essentially a buddy buddy Western with a cynical amoral kicker. It's a blend that may not be to everyone's tastes but with Lancaster grinning for all he is worth and Cooper laconic supreme in the leads the film rises above its oddity status. The professionalism on show both from the obvious big stature of its stars and Aldrich's astute choreography of the action sequences ensures this is a polished piece. There's much machismo of course one only has to see that Charles Bronson Ernest Borgnine and Jack Elam are in the support gallery of thugs to know this fact but it should be noted that the picture is interested in showing a fair reflection of the Mexican conflict. The Mexican government of the time were outraged at the film but on reflection now it's evident the film doesn't take sides. That to my mind has to be applauded. Some problems exist notably some of the dialogue is a touch too corn based now. While as the main female character Denise Darcel is out of her depth. One could think that she is maybe swamped by all the testosterone around her but when you notice that Sara Montiel is coping fine in a secondary role it shows Darcel to be limited. Vera Cruz held its own on release neither busting the box office nor sinking without a trace. It would take over ten years before the true value of the film would start to be noticed. With that it now shows to be very influential within the genre. Explosive important and darn good fun that's a mixture you just can't ignore. 810".

Only a slight similar comment is brought up in the film ANOTHER PART OF THE FORREST where John Dahl plans to leave the south and fight in the Brazilian Army. It is 1870 and Dahl an exConfederate officer decides to fight for an army from the one large nation that still practices slavery. Many Confederates at the end of the Civil War sought employment outside the United States where their military skills would be appreciated and they did not have to live under the U.S. Flag. George Pickett of the famous charge at Gettysburg was offered the job of CommanderinChief of the the army of the Khedive of Egypt but he did not take the offer.Many of the exConfederates decided to go to Mexico because during the Civil War Maximillian was proSouthern as Juarez was proNorthern and the French who supported Maximillian were proConfederate unofficially as well. Napoleon III of France saw the Confederates as one of those nationalities he championed in the name of his uncle's socalled revolutionary principles. He also had a belief that the United States was growing too potentially powerful. Throughout the first two years of the war while Lee and Jackson were doing so well in the East Napoleon III did all he could to get the British and himself to coordinate mediating a peaceful i.e. proConfederate solution to the war. But every time it looked like that would occur there would be a Northern victory Antietam Creek Gettysburg that upset the plan. Also the release of the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 muddied the waters. It reminded the people of France and Britain that the South favored slavery.Napoleon III was hoping a Southern victory would ensure his puppet Maximillian's Empire in Mexico would be secure. During the war he had conferences with a former Senator from California Dr. William Gwin who was proConfederate. Gwin wanted to have a portion of the Sonora state of Mexico set aside for Confederate emigrants to farm and mine.All this collapsed on April 9 1865 when Lee surrendered. VERA CRUZ follows the collapse of the Confederacy and how Gary Cooper joins the exodus to link up with fellow former Rebels in Mexico to support Maximillian. He also links up with Burt Lancaster who leads a gang of gunslingers for hire and the story turns on a huge gold shipment that is for Maximillain's forces. But in VERA CRUZ everyone sees this gold shipment as the key to a happy future for themselves or for their people. Cooper the hero in the film would like to use it for helping to rebuild the South. Lancaster and his gang including Ernest Borgnine and Charles Bronson see the riches for themselves. Maximillian George Macready in a very short scene  unfortunately  where he is not as sweet and well intentioned as Brian Ahearn had been in JUAREZ  wants the money sent for future purposes. Cesar Romero and Henry Brandon are intending the money should go to France. Denise Darcel a French aristocrat wants the money sent to France to  for herself.There are plenty of films about gold and how it brings greed out of everyone and VERA CRUZ is one of the best. It is not settled until the end who will get the gold  and only after one last gunfight after the battle.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vera Cruz is an old fashioned buddy western with two dissimilar buddies with 180 degree contrasting acting styles. Since one of the costars was the producer of this he got the showier part. But in truth I certainly couldn't see casting either one in the other's part.Burt Lancaster was the producer and star and he got the scenery chewing role of Joe Erin disarmingly charming and ruthlessly amoral gunfighter down in Mexico working for Emperor Maximilian for a price. He's leading a mini army himself of gunfighters that include among other Ernest Borgnine and Charles Bronson.Along the way Lancaster hooks up with Gary Cooper former Southern Colonel Ben Trane who's also looking to restart his life by making some money in Mexico so he can rebuild his plantation in Reconstruction Louisiana.Basically these two play themselves or at least stay true to the image that we have of both Cooper and Lancaster.The prize her is a big gold shipment that Maximilian is sending out of Mexico to pay for more troops from Napoleon III. The gunfighters are escorting it but they don't know it. They think the job is to escort a squeeze of Maximilian's nicely packaged in the shape of Denise Darcel. Just about everyone in the film from George Macready playing Maximilian to Cesar Romero playing a French marquis down to Lancaster Cooper Darcel and the rest of the gunfighters all have their own plans for the three million in gold they're carrying. Let's just say that it's no surprise where it winds up.Morris Ankrum plays a solid version of a Juarista general and Mexican film star Sarita Montiel does one of two American films the other being Serenade with Mario Lanza. She was and is a big name in the Mexican and Spanish cinema and no doubt her presence sold a few tickets south of the Rio Grande. She's an extraordinarily beautiful woman and she pairs with Cooper as Darcel pairs with Lancaster.Some of the dialog is a bit hokey. I always laugh whenever I hear Darcel tell Lancaster at heart you are French. But the action moves right along under Director Robert Aldrich and the climatic battle between the French and the Juaristas is well staged.".

It's about two soldiers of fortune Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster who venture into Mexico following the American Civil War to hire themselves out to the highest bidder between the forces of Emperor Maximillian George Macready and the revolutionaries led by Morris Ankrum. It turns out that there is a large shipment of gold that everyone is trying to get their hands on. There are double crosses and triple crosses a plenty before the matter is finally settled. Cooper plays Benjamin Trane a former Confederate Colonel who rides in alone and meets up with grinning teethy all in black gunslinger Joe Erin Lancaster. Erin has a gang that includes the likes of Ernest Borgnine Charles Bronson using his real name Buchinsky and Jack Elam. Jack Lambert heads up a gang that opposes that of Lancaster. Cesar Romero plays the Marquis Henri de Labordere a senior but corrupt official in Maximillian's government and Henry Brandon plays his second in command. Denise Darcel and Sarita Montiel provide the female treachery each after the gold for their own reasons and of course involving our heroes. Cooper looks out of place as Trane a little too long in the tooth to be convincing as the fast on the draw hero. Lancaster on the other hand apparently was given his head by Director Robert Aldrich and goes way over the top flashing those pearly whites at every opportunity. It was interesting to see Borgnine and Bronson in early roles before they made it big. Romero dashing as always steals the picture in my opinion. The battles scenes are well staged and exciting and the wide screen photography is spectacular. Vera Cruz is OK if you don't mind being blinded by the whitest teeth in the west.".

Compared with movies such as Three Coins in the Fountain and Good Morning Miss Dove' which I also saw around the same time Vera Cruz was an island of refuge in a sea of ennui for an eightyear old boy.Now that my movie horizons have broadened a little most of those old war movies and westerns seem very one dimensional if not totally unwatchable these days.But there are exceptions and Vera Cruz is one of them. After a recent viewing I can appreciate it's panache and even touches of brilliance.The story follows a group of American adventurers in Mexico during the Juarista revolution against the French imposed rule of Emperor Maximillian. Ben Trane Gary Cooper teams up with Joe Erin Burt Lancaster and it seems they are prepared to help whichever side pays the most money.They initially join forces with the French but later change to the Juaristas. They have the opportunity of getting away with three million dollars in gold but Ben Trane becomes emotionally attached to the Juarista cause while Joe Erin only has an emotional attachment to himself and the money  a showdown is inevitable.It would be hard to accuse the characters in this film of being onedimensional because they are so overthetop. They also bring a lightness of touch without which the whole thing would be pretty heavy going. With a witty script and the perfect cast director Robert Aldrich hit all the right notes with this film.All the actors playing the French turned the ham knob up high. Ceasar Romero is charming urbane and duplicitous. Henry Brandon's closecropped captain is superbly arrogant and has some great lines with Joe Erin. When he sees Joe greedily tearing into a whole chicken at a banquet he comments Your acquaintance with etiquette amazes me monsieur I had no idea you knew which hand to use. Of course their association was bound to end badly.As a scheming countess Denise Darcel femme fatales all over the place and George Macready as Maximillian delivers yet another variation on his unique brand of cultivated evil  this time with a gnomelike beard.But it's Burt Lancaster who steals the show. With that coiled spring grace and those clipped sentences he exudes a sense of danger despite overdoing the famous grin in just about every scene.Against all those fireworks Gary Cooper wisely underplays. He gets the girl at the end played by beautiful Spanish actress Sarita Montiel  despite looking old enough to be her father plus some.The Jaurista cause is seen in a positive light and the whole film was shot in Mexico often with Aztec ruins as a spectacular backdrop. If any group is cast in a bad light it is the American adventurers who are uncouth and badnatured almost to a man.The action sequences are superbly staged although there is little evidence that the human body contains eight pints of blood  despite the carnage the whole affair is quite bloodless.Vera Cruz is a movie without any agenda other than to entertain and it does that with style. Like most movies of the era the filmmakers didn't let historical accuracy or cultural sensitivities get in the way of telling a good story.".

	schema:headline " Hammy in spots but a good duster";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film years agomid late 1950's in a B theater that was unable to handle Superscope and CinemaScope. The result was everyone was super tall and skinny making it at the time more laughable then it was enjoyable.Flash forward to the present and I found myself on a kick to see some Robert Aldrich films. Since I love old westerns I thought this one might be pretty good given the director and the two stars. Basically I wasn't disappointed. It had good action and the story moved along quite crisply. Good start to the film in introducing the two protagonists Lancaster and Cooper and a tense standoff in a plaza. Great ending.But the film also had its hammy moments although I suspect it was unintentional. Lancaster's white teeth constantly flashing became more of an annoyance then anything else. Boy great teeth for the 1860's. Some of his gang were comical more than anything else and one poor sap was given to dancing sorry can't remember his name and of course became a caricature. Grant you it wasn't unusual given the time. The love scenes were more hilarious then anything else as both love interests were mismatched to the men involved although at least Lancaster and Denise Darcel gave it a whirl. But Cooper who is stilted at the best of times was just plain laughable with his love interest in Sara Montiel. Best part was Lancaster slapping Darcel around.Other parts that were unintentionally funny was that they were supposed to be headed to Vera Cruz which is on the Gulf of Mexico coast in the south of Mexico. At one point they had them headed north through the pyramids of Teotihuacan. Okay I guess it was for effect but anyone with even some knowledge of Mexico would find it just silly.So what was there to like? Well it was noted that this film had an impact on Sergio Leone who did the spaghetti westerns. The setting in Mexico and the gunfight at the end between Cooper and Lancaster was great. Reminded me of course of the final gunfight between Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West.

The village scenes and especially the assault on Maxmillian's forces by the Juaristas especially brought back fond memories of the final clash in the Wild Bunch. We even had Cooper and Lancaster grab a hold of the repeating machine gun ala Holden and Borgnine in the Wild Bunch. Great influence and a great scene.Would have loved to have rated it higher than the 6 I gave it but the hammy parts and the stilted love scenes kind of why bother dropped the score.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this film years agomid late 1950's in a B theater that was unable to handle Superscope and CinemaScope. The result was everyone was super tall and skinny making it at the time more laughable then it was enjoyable.Flash forward to the present and I found myself on a kick to see some Robert Aldrich films. Since I love old westerns I thought this one might be pretty good given the director and the two stars. Basically I wasn't disappointed. It had good action and the story moved along quite crisply. Good start to the film in introducing the two protagonists Lancaster and Cooper and a tense standoff in a plaza. Great ending.But the film also had its hammy moments although I suspect it was unintentional. Lancaster's white teeth constantly flashing became more of an annoyance then anything else. Boy great teeth for the 1860's. Some of his gang were comical more than anything else and one poor sap was given to dancing sorry can't remember his name and of course became a caricature. Grant you it wasn't unusual given the time. The love scenes were more hilarious then anything else as both love interests were mismatched to the men involved although at least Lancaster and Denise Darcel gave it a whirl. But Cooper who is stilted at the best of times was just plain laughable with his love interest in Sara Montiel. Best part was Lancaster slapping Darcel around.Other parts that were unintentionally funny was that they were supposed to be headed to Vera Cruz which is on the Gulf of Mexico coast in the south of Mexico. At one point they had them headed north through the pyramids of Teotihuacan. Okay I guess it was for effect but anyone with even some knowledge of Mexico would find it just silly.So what was there to like? Well it was noted that this film had an impact on Sergio Leone who did the spaghetti westerns. The setting in Mexico and the gunfight at the end between Cooper and Lancaster was great. Reminded me of course of the final gunfight between Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Even gave Lancaster and Cooper good face.But they should have mentioned some clear influence on Sam Peckinpah particularly his classic The Wild Bunch. The village scenes and especially the assault on Maxmillian's forces by the Juaristas especially brought back fond memories of the final clash in the Wild Bunch.

	schema:reviewBody "Defeated Confederate Colonel Ben Trane Gary Cooper drifts south into Mexico after the Civil War hoping to sell his services to whichever army  the Juaristas or Emperor Maximillian George Macready and his French allies  offers better pay. The straightlaced Trane joins up with Joe Erin Burt Lancaster a grinning psychopath with a multiracial gang of American criminals gunslingers and deserters and they are recruited by Maximillian's lackey the Marquis de Labordere Cesar Romero to protect a French countess Denise Darcel being transported to Vera Cruz. Along the way Trane and Erin discover the wagon is actually carrying gold and a complicated series of schemes tricks and doublecrosses between the Americans the Countess the French troops and Juaristas under General Ramirez Morris Ankrum develops. It leads to an explosive climax as Erin and Trane join forces with the Juaristas and Trane is torn between his chivalrous nature and his desire for gold.Vera Cruz is an extremely important landmark in film history. Directed by leftist filmmaker Robert Aldrich also responsible for such films as Apache Attack! and The Dirty Dozen it paints a cynical portrayal of American intervention in Latin America and depicts gunslingers as at best conflicted individuals at worst mass murderers. The movie's influence can be seen in any number of films The Magnificent Seven which could be read as a rebuttal to Aldrich's film the Man With No Name Westerns of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood Richard L. Brooks' equally cynical The Professionals and Sam Peckinpah's Major Dundee and The Wild Bunch. But Vera Cruz is more than just a bit of cinematic history. Although a bit dry and draggy in spots Vera Cruz is for most of its length a largely entertaining and enjoyable Western.For a film made in 1954 during the midst of the Cold War with the conservative Westerns of John Wayne dominating the genre Vera Cruz must have come as a shock. The film's characters are anything but the traditional whitehatted twofisted unequivocally good heroes. Presaging Henry Fonda's villainous turn in Once Upon a Time in the West albeit not in as extreme a fashion Western icon Gary Cooper plays a character who as outwardly chivalrous as he appears cares only about money and is not above betrayal or doublecrossing to get it. Ben Trane only becomes a noble warrior at the very end and is driven to it mostly by the increasingly psychotic actions of Erin. Another classic Hollywood icon Burt Lancaster is even more extreme. Joe Erin dons a black outfit spins and draws his pistol for fun and sports a charming yet disconcerting grin. He is not above doublecross trickery or murder even of his sidekicks and partners to achieve his ends. While Erin seems a mirror image of the noble Trane he is simply an uninhibited image of Trane himself.The film's attitude towards violence is fairly casual and shockingly blunt. In the film's most affective scene Erin with his men surrounded by Ramirez's Juaristas takes a small group of children hostage and threatens to kill them unless his opponent withdraws. Ramirez nobly intones Wars are not won by killing children but this is perhaps the only example of chivalry in the film. The large scale action scenes are if not graphic by modern standards still pretty rough for 1954. We see a Juarista shot in the face by the Countess a captured Juarista corralled and tortured by mounted French lancers an epic bloody climactic battle featuring machine guns and artillery Erin grinning as he impales a French officer Henry Brandon on a lance and the film's ending where Erin for no particular reason shoots his only surviving sidekick Ballard Arch Savage Jr. in cold blood. And yet despite all this the violence is portrayed in a casual and frenetically enjoyable style. It's not at all difficult to see where Leone and Peckinpah got inspiration for characters like the Man With No Name Tuco and Pike Bishop. In this amoral world all that matters is survival and gold and not necessarily in that order. And needless to say no one can be trusted.On a technical level Aldrich's handling of the battle scenes and shootouts makes for rousing good fun almost belying the message he is pushing. The final battle in particular is a wellstaged bit of action. Ernest Laszlo's beautiful cinematography captures the action scenes and the gorgeous Mexican countryside in most flattering manner. James R. Webb and Roland Kibbee script is witty quotable and enjoyably cynical while Hugo Friedhoffer contributes a pretty good if unremarkable score.Gary Cooper gives an excellent latecareer performance as Ben Trane the Southern gentleman whose mercenary instincts and ingrained chivalry come into conflict with one another. Burt Lancaster is wellcast as Joe Erin he might grin a few too many times and chew a bit too much scenery but given his reputation as an athletic lovable hero his casting as the psychotic bad guy is very unsettling and effective. Reliable character actors Cesar Romero George Macready Henry Brandon and Morris Ankrum turn in fine performances as the film's antagonists. Denise Darcel and the lovely Sara Montiel are wellcast as the film's femme fatales. And if you look among Lancaster's gang you'll see Jack Elam Ernest Borgnine and Charles Bronson nee Buchinsky in bit roles.Vera Cruz is a very entertaining film. While the pacing drags at times particularly in the middle its amoral violent and cynical nature makes it an interesting ride. Beyond its status as a cinematic landmark is a damned enjoyable film regardless of what one makes of it.810".

I mean I cannot think of later Hollywood pics until the Europeans made the Bond films and the Leone westerns that actually used fast cutting and terrific banter between the hero and antihero to such great success For a great example of an older movie I would offer Carol Reed's The Third Man. 3 And as mentioned the pacing and the character build up and the final showdown predated the showdowns in the EastwoodLeone westerns. For comparison watch Hang 'em High for the Hollywood western of that era that starred Eastwood following his three outings in Italy. Stylistically Hang 'em High is a snoozefest even though it had a compelling revenge motif and a brutal hanging to enliven the pace.So what we have here is a wonderful western with Lancaster playing the charming but utterly sociopathic antagonistquoting one Ace Hanna for life's hard lessons and Cooper playing an equally resolute good guy with a sense of humour and world weariness and smarts to see through Ace Hanna aphorisms into Lancaster's heart of darkness.

	schema:reviewBody "In a time when Westerns were dominated by John Wayne and his moralistic conservative and boring characters the Western genre was rarely not boring. I always thought it was thanks to the Italian 'Spaghetti' Westerns that this all changed but it actually began earlier.'Vera Cruz' is a rare nonmoralistic American western instead of the goody twoshoes Wayne ripoffs it is filled with morally ambiguous characters. Ben Trane Gary Cooper a former Confederate soldier and Joe Erin Burt Lancaster an outlaw are just two of many who go to Mexico to fight in their revolution but rather than helping the rebels free their country they strike a deal with Emperor Maximilian to escort a countess all the way to Vera Cruz. That is what made the Italian Westerns so good. The characters are fighting not for an idealistic protection of 'freedom' or whatever John Wayne would have used to justify it but for pure gold and money. They fight for themselves and themselves ONLY no matter if their side is 'right' or 'wrong'. They are not above doublecrossing others even their 'friends' to help themselves.And believe me there is a lot of doublecrossing going around here.The casting is very good Lancaster tends to be irritating with the way he keeps smiling and showing his teeth all the time but acts well and Cooper is terrific as always. The supporting cast with includes a equally terrific Cesar Romero and the thenunknowns Charles Bronson and Ernest Borgnine is very good. The actors all actually look their part another characteristic Italian westerns got from here.Unlike them though 'Vera Cruz' is not slow. It does not take its time to bask in the excellent scenery which is as good as those of some Sergio Leone's films for example and moves toward the action every time its possible. For its time it's surprisingly violent and realistically so again not like Wayne's westerns.An excellent western that influenced the Italian ones from the decade after 'Vera Cruz' is exactly what American westerns should have been. It still needed a bit more polishing something Sergio Leone and his contemporaries did masterfully but it is still one of the best westerns I've ever seen.".

The characters are fighting not for an idealistic protection of 'freedom' or whatever John Wayne would have used to justify it but for pure gold and money. They fight for themselves and themselves ONLY no matter if their side is 'right' or 'wrong'. They are not above doublecrossing others even their 'friends' to help themselves.And believe me there is a lot of doublecrossing going around here.The casting is very good Lancaster tends to be irritating with the way he keeps smiling and showing his teeth all the time but acts well and Cooper is terrific as always. The supporting cast with includes a equally terrific Cesar Romero and the thenunknowns Charles Bronson and Ernest Borgnine is very good. The actors all actually look their part another characteristic Italian westerns got from here.Unlike them though 'Vera Cruz' is not slow. It does not take its time to bask in the excellent scenery which is as good as those of some Sergio Leone's films for example and moves toward the action every time its possible. For its time it's surprisingly violent and realistically so again not like Wayne's westerns.An excellent western that influenced the Italian ones from the decade after 'Vera Cruz' is exactly what American westerns should have been. It still needed a bit more polishing something Sergio Leone and his contemporaries did masterfully but it is still one of the best westerns I've ever seen.";

It's an entertaining and often suspenseful movie that is wellcrafted with plenty of action as well.The setting in late 1860s Mexico is the kind of setting that has often produced some of the finest westerns a confused struggle where loyalties are up for grabs no one can be fully trusted and issues of right and wrong are easily clouded by personal desires. Joe and Ben Lancaster and Cooper are right at home in this atmosphere and the story makes good use of the possibilities.The opening sequence is a fine way to open the story with Joe and Ben confronting each other as well as the military. The battle of wits and weapons is interesting in itself and brings out a great deal about the characters right from the start. It is quickly clear that Joe and Ben have some important differences but also that they will need each other before long.The location filming in Mexico is an important part of making it work so well with plenty of interesting sights to go along with the realistic backgrounds. The rest of the cast is also good and they get a few moments of their own Sarita Montiel in particular grabs your attention although it is always Lancaster and Cooper who are the center of attention.

My main prejudice was always about Jean Lefebvre in the lead he was never a good actor only funny on the very narrow range of a weeping loser background character  supporting character actually demands real acting skills.I was also curious about Un Idiot  Paris after watching some delightfully worded scenes posted on YouTube or edited into that excellent documentary about the great dialogue writer Michel Audiard et le Mystre du Triangle des Bermudes. Yes Dany Carel and Bernard Blier shine in a couple of Audiard trademark rants. Yves Robert is great also in another scene but this one was actually in the book and is only a rare example of a fine adaptation work in the movie.Indeed these Audiard rants are simply out of pace in an already badly paced adaptation. The first few scenes actually a narration disjointed in vignettes introducing Goubi before he goes to Paris are just a total failure. They miss the point of setting the countryside reference to the journey. Ironically Yves Robert is around for a couple of minutes as I mentioned and he did know how to shoot the countryside to express what makes people free and happy there. As such the movie starts off with the ideas that countrymen are restless thick people whereas the point of the story is showing a poor naive character lost in the frantic Parisian merrygoround.Serge Korber was never a good director either and yet he was handed material with potential starting with this movie and ending with vehicles for top stars de Funs and Girardot  which bombed prompting a somewhat disillusioned porn stint. The young director's assignment excuse doesn't stick since his name is listed as a writer too. A good example of a poor director's job is how Korber directed Andr Pousse in his debut as a rude cab driver. Audiard had chiselled a fine rant for his friend the monologue is funny but Pousse is simply given too little direction to make this look good.Above all most of the harm comes from casting Jean Lefebvre as the lead. Whoever pushed the idea forward simply didn't understand that playing a dumb character requires a very talented actor think Rain Man Forrest Gump not just one that already looks dumb. Bourvil comes to mind here but he was certainly too expensive. Fernandel was too old but the part here is not too dissimilar to the one he had in Le Schpountz  an obvious reference in the novel when Parisians on holiday talk Goubi into believing he would be a sensation at the Olympia concert hall.It is difficult to recommend this movie. You can enjoy the best parts elsewhere yet these Audiard tidbits do little if anything to lift the movie out of its utter mediocrity. To see Bernard Blier Dany Carel wasted in this missed opportunity is really painful as the story hops along with other fine supporting characters including Yves Robert Jean Carmet Andr Pousse and Pierre Richard.".

Shot on a low budget on Hong Kong locations it tells a clever story and features a pair of intriguing lead characters. Wong Yue not to be confused with Jimmy Wang Yu plays a con man and pickpocket who constantly runs afoul of the cops and local gangsters. He then finds an amnesiac played by Gordon Liu who displays advanced kung fu skills when attacked and uses him to get back some money cheated out of him by a local casino. The two go on to rob the local crime boss of two bags of money and the amnesiac insists on distributing the cash to victims of the boss. The amnesiac who teaches his shady partner his kung fu moves turns out to be the missing son of an Admiral who comes to town looking for his son. Eventually the corruption is exposed the son gets his memory back and the two heroes fight off all the gangsters.There are many kung fu fights in the film and all are worked seamlessly into the narrative. There is an attractive and saucy female character Miss Ho played by Li Ying a restaurant owner who is harassed by the gangsters and rescued on more than one occasion by Wong Yue. Gordon Liu and Wong Yue also costarred in Liu Chia Liang's classic DIRTY HO 1979 and display great chemistry together. Wong Yue not only fights well but is a superb comic actor in both films as well.HE HAS NOTHING BUT KUNG FU was ably directed by Liang's brother Liu Chia Yung aka Lau Kar Wing who has a small part as the Admiral's assistant. The final battle between Gordon and the gangsters taking place throughout the full length of an abandoned building and atop its shingled slanted rooftop is particularly ingenious. Many familiar kung fu faces dot the cast including Lam Ching Ying Lee Hoi San and Meng Hoi as gang henchmen. The only annoying aspect of the film is the frequent playing on the soundtrack of a comical' guitar riff employing the Dixie' melody. Aside from that this is a mustsee for kung fu fans.".

It pairs together comedy actor Wong Yue who plays a conniving beggar and Gordon Liu who plays an amnesic martial artist in a plot involving them battling a bunch of gangsters. These two actors played together often for Shaw and while this film isn't of the same quality it's quite fun for fans of the genre. The action is acceptable enough and there's plenty of it but the most fun comes from seeing all of the familiar faces in cameo roles. The villains are played by the likes of Chiang Tao Chan Shen and Lee Hoi San while others such as Mars Hoi Mang Hsiao Hou and Lam ChingYing have bit parts. Even Karl Maka shows up at one point while Liu's brother Lau Kar Wing directs as well as taking on an acting role.".

It might be a good film but it's like classic clip from Fox News where Sean Hannity criticises Christopher Hitchens for being  incredibly mean and incredibly thoughtless  and that's a good enough reason to love both Christopher Hitchens and JACK FROST Any film that has a serial killer being regenerated as a snowman deserves some credit for that bonkers premise alone and the film does make the best of this premise and what makes it even more outstanding is that it is incredibly mean spirited . Take a scene where a teenage bully gets his head bitten of and the parents of the deceased bully and his victim get in to an argument and the victims father states that  Your son is a couple of feet higher than mine  only for an onlooker to blurt out  Not any more he ain't  . Who needs William Goldman when you've got killer one lines like that ? This scathing dialog  much of it spouted by the eponymous monster  reminded me of the wise cracking villains we had in 1980s horror films like Freddy Kruger or Channard Cenobite from HELLRAISER 2 . Indeed I constantly found myself having to the check the IMDb hadn't done a major error in giving the year of its release as 1997 because the whole look and feel of the movie screamed 1980s to me . A lot of this might have been down to the slightly murky and grainy cinematography but even so the whole fabric screams that it's a film from ten years earlier something of a golden age for the horror genre . In fact if it had come out ten years earlier then this would have been a film held in much higher regard which it does deserve . Highly enjoyable low grade entertainment that did raise a few chuckles".

A snowman about whom it is remarked that he has no legs or feet drives a police cruiser around town.2. Even though it is supposed to be close to or below freezing nobody's breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are running.3. The snow reminds you more of flocking or Styrofoam peanuts than actual snow.4. A teenage girl gets the hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is gruesomely murdered. She talks him into breaking into the sheriff's house of all places in order to get it on. But first she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine.5. After teenaged Jake's head is cut off by a sled runner his father argues with the sheriff about whether Tommy the sheriff's son had anything to do with it. The sheriff maintains that Tommy wouldn't have been fighting with Jake because Jake is at least two feet taller than Tommy. At that moment someone in the background chimes in Not anymore! 6. When the evil snowman finally starts to melt away the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period. This is much better than Tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor I would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point.All in all a fun film. There's not really even that much blood.".

This could have been made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone!!! On the moment that our titular character gets iced then the fun really starts and it becomes a laughoutloud lowbudget gem!! The deathscnes are quite inventive including a naughty one involving a carrot and a naked chick and a very cool slay decapitation. It is really cheesy and has the same appeal as those old horror monster movies from the fifties with lots of intentional humour. It also has a decent amount of gore allthough really campy...

Unlike some movies where they spend all their money on specail effects and there is no story. Like for instance Godzilla 1998. This movie was of course just a man in a cotten suit. Who cares? whenever he kills you always see his hands or face. Who cares? Anyway Jack Frost a killer is on his way to be gassed or injected or something. Heading toward the prison truck is a chemical truck. They of course crash together. It spills chemical on Jack Frost and turns him into a mutant killer snowman. A sheirff named Sam was the one who put him to death. Jack Frost goes after him killing people that get in hs way and just for the Hell of it. Jack Frost has the ability to melt himself and reshape again at will. Yes I do admit it is fake. But hey maybe they didn't have a lot of money to spend on it. This movie also has a rock and roll version of Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies. Just do yourself a favor and rent it.".

The majority of 90's horror movies were about serial killers science run amok or conspiracy theories. Horror became more realistic less fantastic. So it was refreshing to have a supernatural and over the top villain in a 90's horror film. If this film was made in the 80's it would have been considered a cult classic.The acting is good and the special effects are solid too. The concept of a killer snowman is pretty original as well. The intended humor is sometimes lame and awkward. But the one liners from Jack Frost are classic and amusing. Overall check this flick out if you wanna see a fun and over the top Bmovie. A rarity during that decade called the 90's.Jack Frost features shady government agents Shannon Elizabeth in a thong holiday decorated corpses decapitations rape by snowman and hair dryer weaponry.".

If this film was made in the 80's it would have been considered a cult classic.The acting is good and the special effects are solid too. The concept of a killer snowman is pretty original as well. The intended humor is sometimes lame and awkward. But the one liners from Jack Frost are classic and amusing. Overall check this flick out if you wanna see a fun and over the top Bmovie. A rarity during that decade called the 90's.Jack Frost features shady government agents Shannon Elizabeth in a thong holiday decorated corpses decapitations rape by snowman and hair dryer weaponry.";

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Chaplin was without a doubt one of the most important pioneers of filmmaking and through his life he saw the development of the cinema and its progress. Limelight is probably not as well known as most of his silent feature but it is a very important film to understand the vivacious mind of this genius. It is a very personal film that showcases Chaplin's feelings about his own brand of comedy and how it slowly lost the public's attention as he grew older.Limelight is the story of an old comedian named Calvero Chaplin who one morning discovers that his young neighbor Thereza Claire Bloom attempted to commit suicide. He decides to take care of her and discovers that she is a dancer knowing that both share a passion for performing he begins to cheer her up and prepares her to become a great dancer while at the same time he remembers his past glories.When one watches Limelight is impossible not to see the many autobiographical aspects of the plot as in many ways Calvero represents how Chaplin feels at the modernization of comedy on stage. Like Chaplin Calvero also played the character of an optimist tramp who always saw the good side of life and like Chaplin Calvero faced many times the urge to modernize his act. It's kind of frightening to think about how much of Calvero's story could be based on Chaplin's real experiences as it is a sharp criticism for its time to the way performers are treated by both their managers and their public.As the last of his talkies made in America Limelight is done with all the power Chaplin still had although the film would be banned as Chaplin lost his power due to his political opinions and it shows. The stage performances of the characters are sublime and in Calvero's memories Chaplin resurrects a way of comedy apparently dead by the early 50s and makes it fresh. The KeatonChaplin duo is a classic moment captured on film. However Limelight is not a comedy in the strict sense of the word. Those expecting a laughriot like Modern Times or The Great Dictator will be disappointed this is a very personal melodrama where Chaplin his emotions about his career.The acting is very good Chaplin may be more remembered for his parts in silent films but he delivers his lines with ease and ability. His physical comedy is superb and his overall performance is memorable mainly because it feels as if he was playing himself. Claire Bloom is at times a bit too melodramatic for the movie's sake but for the most part is very effective and makes a good counterpart to Chaplin's Calvero. Among the supporting cast Nigel Bruce as always chews the scenery and Buster Keaton is simply fabulous in his small yet classic role.Probably Limelight's main problem is its excess of melodrama and its at times excessively preachy attitude. The fact that is not a comedy may turn off people not used to Chaplin's more serious side as while the movie has its fair share of laughs it is obvious that Chaplin wanted to be recognized as more than a mere clown. The movie's slow pace and rhythm also put it closer to the melodrama of the 40s than to the image we are all used to see when we think of Chaplin.Despite all this Limelight stands as a testament of Chaplin's enormous talent and while not very wellknown it is one of the finest films he ever did. Fans of his work will definitely enjoy this film and fans of Keaton will appreciate his small yet terrific scene. 910".

Among the supporting cast Nigel Bruce as always chews the scenery and Buster Keaton is simply fabulous in his small yet classic role.Probably Limelight's main problem is its excess of melodrama and its at times excessively preachy attitude. The fact that is not a comedy may turn off people not used to Chaplin's more serious side as while the movie has its fair share of laughs it is obvious that Chaplin wanted to be recognized as more than a mere clown. The movie's slow pace and rhythm also put it closer to the melodrama of the 40s than to the image we are all used to see when we think of Chaplin.Despite all this Limelight stands as a testament of Chaplin's enormous talent and while not very wellknown it is one of the finest films he ever did. Fans of his work will definitely enjoy this film and fans of Keaton will appreciate his small yet terrific scene. 910";

	schema:reviewBody "Haunting and unforgettable piece from Charles Chaplin that was nearly lost in the American cinema all together. It played in very few cities within the U.S. in 1952 and was never shown in Los Angeles due to the suspicion that the House of UnAmerican Acts Committee had concerning Chaplin making no sense to me as Chaplin who was British was the polar opposite of a Communist from all indications. The film disappeared from U.S. soil and did not resurface until some 20 years later in 1972 and Chaplin actually won an Oscar with fellow scorers Raymond Rasch and Larry Russell for this movie's original dramatic score this was the only competitive Oscar Chaplin ever won. Chaplin stars as a washedup vaudeville performer. He is now an elderly man in his 60s when the film was made and the spotlight is gone forever even though he still secretly yearns for it. Chaplin discovers a very young ballet dancer Claire Bloom who has attempted suicide because she cannot handle being a performer. Naturally Chaplin cannot believe that this young beautiful and talented woman would rather take her life than be a ballet performer the fact that Chaplin yearns for her youth and the ability to be an entertainer again makes him bound and determined to get her back on her feet. He tries with all his might to get her performanceready again all the while he is also trying to resurrect the career that he lost long ago. Chaplin has a dream of a stunning performance he has on the stage but when his act ends there is no one there to acknowledge him one of if not the saddest sequences I have ever seen on film. Soon it becomes obvious that Chaplin's time is running out and his desperation to have that one last piece of action engulfs his mind body heart and soul. Limelight is one of the most dramatic and intense pictures I have ever encountered. Chaplin's life and career had changed dramatically by 1952. The Little Tramp was no more all movies had sound some films were being made in color and the subject matter of motion pictures was slowly starting to change. In many ways Chaplin was trying to show the viewing public his life in celluloid form and Limelight would be the vehicle used. This is a stunning work that once again shows the humanity and overall sensitivity that Chaplin had with his movies. Chaplin's longtime rival in reallife Buster Keaton even shows up late and acts as a partner in the duo's stage routine. The pairing is usually the most memorable part of this production to most but the story and the deep emotional part that Chaplin plays are the things that make Limelight quite possibly Chaplin's greatest cinematic masterpiece. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Chaplin is one of the undisputed masters of the cinema. He was one of the funniest actors of the cinema and he was also one of the greatest directors. Of course the films that he is most famous for are his silent comedies especially The Gold Rush City Lights and Modern Times. The latter two were the product of Chaplin's stubborn clinging to the format and conventions of the silent cinema though everyone else had gone to sound. This stubbornness was certainly sound. His contemporaries such as Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd lost popularity when they moved to sound. Chaplin's last two silent films were popular and made a lot of money. Audiences may have craved sound but they craved Chaplin too and did not disdain his silence. He was one of the silent artists who thought that they were just achieving the peak of their medium when sound came in. He proved himself right since City Lights 1931 and Modern Times 1936 are probably his two best films and both are two of the best films ever made.Finally in 1940 Chaplin directed and starred in his first talkie The Great Dictator. Three more followed Monsieur Verdoux then Limelight then King of New York which happens to be the only one of these four I have not seen. The Great Dictator and Monsieur Verdoux were both good films in their own way but perhaps Chaplin's in depth political commentary in these films detracted from them. The type of comedy that you find in his silent films did not mix well with this social commentary. The simple juxtapositions of the worlds of the poor and the rich in City Lights and Modern Times were far more powerful than what his first two talkies had to offer.Then came Limelight one of the most bittersweet films ever made. It is not perfect but it achieves a grand melodramatic beauty that few films have ever even approached. The story is simple a washedup old vaudvillian rescues a young ballet dancer from suicide. He takes care of her until she is healthy again and even restores her confidence. The story may be simple but the character dynamics are very complex. As the dancer Theresa is recovering Calvero is not only rebuilding her confidence but also his own. Theresa because of his kindness towards her finally believes she has fallen in love with him even going so far as proposing marriage to him. Whether she actually loves him or not and Calvero strongly asserts that she shouldn't and doesn't these two characters have a constantly evolving relationship that does not end until the credits role. It is utterly fascinating captivating and dramatic.There are a couple of problems and though they're small they deserve attention. Perhaps the biggest problem is that Claire Bloom is quite guilty of overacting. Her line delivery is bizarre and overdramatic. This isn't a big deal since you ought to be keenly aware that the film takes place in the world of melodrama and is thus exaggerated. Another thing that irked me is Buster Keaton's role. It is little more than a cameo. In fact his character doesn't even have a name in the credits. This is truly disappointing seeing that he although Chaplin may have had the most heart was the allaround funniest silent comedian.".

	schema:headline " The curious twilight of a comedian long since abdicated.";
	schema:reviewBody "Even for a fellow wellversed in Chaplin's sound films 'Limelight' proved an odd viewing experience upon my perusal of it. Following on from 'The Great Dictator' and 'Monsieur Verdoux' Chaplin eschews his physical comedy for the most part preferring to address 'big themes' and important issues. 'The Great Dictator' quite obviously tackles fascism and the demagoguery of a dictator indeed pretty pertinent in 1940. 'Verdoux' is an interesting oneoff in its inherent darkness the material concerning a mannered serial killer is treated with more sobriety and a blacker touch than had hence been the case with Chaplin's films. There is a startling effectiveness to the last reels of that film with Chaplin's theme of society forming the individual's behaviour being emphatically and eerily conveyed by his wellspoken character. 'Limelight' focuses on the gold mine that is Chaplin's career and the decline of his sort of comedy. It should be got out of the way first that considering the possibilities this stirs in the mind the result will likely disappoint. But that does not affect my view that this is a very interesting film and broadly a successful entertainment. It could be argued that 'The Great Dictator' is a finer insight into Chaplin's art the masterful pantomime is more vividly on show and is Hitler is not especially the evil figure we know him to be but more the manipulative balletic Chaplin commanding our attention.'Limelight' seems not to succeed in being a summation of Chaplin's career perhaps as it distinctly lacks the raison d'tre of his visual comedy. Okay perhaps Calvero is a character based partly on other faded stars from the music hall tradition but we are not convinced that this is quite the same Chaplin. Of course this is bound to be the case this is sound cinema nearly twenty years after the tramp's final sunsetbound trot. But here Chaplin's character talks incessantly and unrepentantly quite the conversion for the silent clown. Unlike Laurel and Hardy the adjustment to sound was never made in his original screen persona so this truly will seem a different Chaplin to viewers. He pontificates in a somewhat lofty generally admirable fashion but it is the speech of a mannered delicate sentimental old English gentleman and not a clown or philosopher. There are times his dialogue wades in some very interesting waters  such as that regarding his views on audiences and the rigors of performance  but often too little of worth is said with too many words in an overweening selfsatisfied manner. Where the film really succeeds is in the way Chaplin does take on a sort of tragic grandeur towards the close  or more rightly a rather sad grace a man out of time and out of sympathy with most the world has to offer. It seems he was lucky to obtain the services of Claire Bloom to play the ballerina Tereza as she invests a crucial part with genuine feeling and warm brittleness  a good contrast with Chaplin's slightly wearing charm and ghostly drifting through the film. His contribution in bringing Bloom to the screen is to be appreciated as she went on to a most impressive career in many mediums. Indeed Bloom is rather histrionic at times but at least it adds some genuine zest to proceedings. That she carries off this role that from the evidence we see is so unlikely  a young girl completely in the thrall of a curiously cold and verbose old man  is a testament to her skill. She really conveys more of Chaplin's appeal than is perhaps warranted by what occurs in the film.Touches like the visual flashbacks of Neville and Tereza's unspoken romance during her voiceover narrating the story really help the film. As do the inclusion of performance sequences early on which are revealed to be in Calvero's subconscious. The second of those rather amused me seeming atypically Chaplin in its bantering wordplay and slightly otherworldly air. The performing fleas routine is hardly vintage Chaplin but pray remember Calvero is a purely music hall performer of preWW1 days in its invention but it is very precisely performed. I loved the little bits implying a wider tapestry the drunken musical recitations by Calvero and a few friends in his flat the reminiscing in a bar. It may not be a picture focused on the details of London life in the era but tantalizing glimpses are given.It is charming to see faces of old Hollywood albeit briefly in this picture that is so dominated by Chaplin's selfregard. Nigel Bruce is a splendid presence as  you've guessed it  a doddering hapless old buffer with heart certainly in the desired place and dander constantly up. Buster Keaton adds some much needed comedic timing and experience to the film with his late appearance performing with Chaplin in a decent final routine. He really outshines Chaplin and it is a shame more isn't seen of his droll presence far more tangible and concrete than the curiously elusive Chaplin is here. Whatever one's thoughts on the film's comedy it must be recognized that this is more of a winsome selfabsorbed melodrama than it is anything like a comedy. That it works is surely down to the strange historical interest of the film and its undeniable melancholic resonance. This is a Chaplin at the end of his tether seemingly unwilling or unable to go back to being a comedian. The film is sad invested with a grand decay and propped up by perhaps a more real' Chaplin than was ever seen in his days of silence. It simply should not work  it is a portrait overegged to some degree  but this is somehow remarkably compelling stuff. The picture all the more mourns what isn't there. Rating   ".

	schema:reviewBody "This past week I've been on a Charlie Chaplin kick. I watched Great Dictatorwhich is marvelous and Modern TimesAlso a classic. This morning I watched Limelight. I knew that it was not going to be a ha ha laugh riot all the way through but I found myself chuckling several times in the movie. This movie has an excellent storyline about an aging performer who knows he is not marketable anymore but wants one more chance to shine. He meets a ballet dancer played wonderfully by Claire Bloom who almost commits suicide before beings rescued by Chaplin's Calvero character. Throughout the 2 12 hours they teach other to fight their demons and do what they love doing. This movie was so moving to me. I ended up crying the majority of the movie. This shows that Chaplin is a genius. You can watch his movies and laugh cry think. But at the same time it's just genius work. Sadly this was Chaplin's last film success in America. What a shame. Great talent. The ChaplinKeaton sequence is the highlight of the whole movie. 2 great comedy geniuses working for one time only. Perfect. 10 out of 10. Go see Limelight and see for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is well known that this film was Chaplin's final bow in America and in one way it could be said to be his final bow for England as well that is of course the England which the comedian once knew. He'd left the country for money and fortune and this is the end of it which never was. No no I'm not saying this was what Chaplin wanted to say with the film because I don't think it is. But it's hard to not think in such terms when presented to Calvero the sad reflected cheerful and extremely talented clown the latter is particularly evident after he's had a drink. The clown is now washedup and can't get work anywhere. Then one day he saves a young ballerina from committing suicide and as he helps her along eventually he comes to experience one final triumph in the limelight himself. Chaplin captures me completely in his obviously heartfelt role as Calvero and the rest of the cast is excellent including Claire Bloom as Terry Chaplin's son Sydney as the young musician Stapleton Kent's somewhat humorous portrayal of manager Claudius and of course The Other Biggest Big of The Silent Clowns Buster Keaton a special mention goes to Marjorie Bennett as Mrs. Alsop.Not only did Chaplin as always write and direct this film he also composed the beautiful ballet to which Claire Bloom dances hypnotizingly. I am not much into ballet but can't help the effect this one has on me just as with the entire film. As Chaplin would say words seem so futile and indeed they do as I try to cover what it is which makes me revisit this film over and over always wanting it to last longer. When I was in a very desperate stage of my hitherto brief life 20 next autumn Calvero's speech to paralyzed Terry truly saved me. Most of us do insane things to reach happiness and even insaner things when we fail in our attempts. Calvero should be here to tell us to quit it and go on. After all as long as we're conscious we can still be in hysterics of laughter at Chaplin's act with Buster Keaton towards the end of this film.Swedish critic and poet Lars Forssell has remarked that Chaplin with LIMELIGHT says little which he had not already expressed to greater effect in pantomime. I admire the work of Forssell but think that he here overlooks a radical point in fact perhaps the major theme of the story. If we are to sum up the main elements provided in this film we do indeed have a pretty typical Chaplinfilm a clown falls in love with a girl who in some way is superior to him this time in the sense that she's got most of her future ahead while he's old and ill. However in previous films Chaplin had been a clown with the mannerisms of a gentleman always eager to explore further despite life's many defeats. Being a clown on the surface the Tramp was playful childish and acted pretty much by instinct. In this respect Calvero represents his very counterpoint he is not a fantasy figure able to survive anything as soon as he does a twist with his ankle but a very real human being who has gained wisdom from the ups and for the most part it seems downs of life. We need to do nothing more complicated than viewing CITY LIGHTS as a contrast whereas the Tramp had helped the blind by pretending to be someone else Calvero accepted the world as it went fighting back when he could but admitting to be an old sinner. For his entire career Chaplin had played a clown and this is his turn to wipe out the makeup and speak to us from underneath. If you think it gets too chatty that's your problem. A clown is supposed to do pantomime on the stage. Here he's left it.However what is particularly fascinating with LIMELIGHT is that it not only speaks for Chaplin but for the entire music hallera in which the comedian laid the roots of his art it is a work based upon a phenomenal life of firsthand experience hence it does not feel more pretentious or selfcentered than it should do. Calvero is the eternal sad clown whose philosophy is carried through every performer who went the same way as him. He does in fact bear characteristics of Chaplin's reallife father who was once a topbill performer on the stage himself but eventually drank himself to death while Charlie was a boy. Although at heart a tragedy LIMELIGHT is to me at least one of the most uplifting films to watch when the clouds of life spread too much of shadow around I can't say for sure if I'd have felt the same way if I was at Calvero's age but I really believe there is some hope to be found for whoever needs it in this film. After all Calvero finally made it didn't he even without happiness?".

No it's actually a very poignant drama that in some ways is quite philosophical.

Eventually though he pushes and pushes hernot out of cruelty but because she CAN physically walk and can't continue feeling sorry for herself. He's very upbeat and optimistic throughout this period though as she needs to have a reason to live. Eventually she is able to walk and returns to her career as a stage dancer. At the same time Chaplin's career continues to go from bad to worse. Now she is much more optimistic and he is in a funk.Claire gets her big break thanks to the coaching of Chaplin. And in the show there is a small part for him as well. She goes on to stardom and then announces she wants to marry the very significantly older Chaplin. He is aghast as he feels this desire of hers is really due to her being grateful and fraternal love between them. But she will not be dissuaded so he disappears from the show and she is forced to continue without him. At first it's tough but she becomes a major star.A few years later she returns to London and stumbles upon Chaplin. She continues to voice her desire to marry him but he'll have none of itespecially since there is a nice young man on hand to marry her now played by Chaplin's reallife son Sidney. Despite this she arranges a big comeback performance for Chaplinas he WAS at one time a famous comedian. This comeback is part of a starpacked show and it's now Chaplin's chance to go out on top! The show goes on and in fact Chaplin is amazing. But after putting his all into it he has a heart attack and diesthus freeing Claire to seek out a life for herself. Now THAT'S pathos! The total package though a tiny bit slow and sentimental worked for me. Chaplin's music by the way earned an Oscar when the movie was finally exhibited in the USA two decades later! A beautiful sentimental and almost perfect filma fitting end to a great careertoo bad he went on to do two more lesser films in later years.By the way since writing this review I have found that this film haunts me and I often think back about it and how touching the film was. While it isn't one of his more famous films I think other than THE GOLD RUSH it is actually his best filmmaybe not the funniest but among the very best.".

	schema:reviewBody "An ageing vaudeville comedian is well into his decline when he rescues a young ballerina from death and nurses her back to health.  Her combination of vulnerability gratitude and unconditional adoration give the jaded Calvero a new lease of life.     Love Love Love is the title of a Calvero stage number and it would serve as a subtitle for the film with the young Claire Bloom as the jewish gamine the Paulette Goddard of the next generation.  As usual Chaplin does it all  acting writing directing composing and choreography.  He also packs the film with Chaplins with no fewer than seven members of the tribe appearing.  Sounds like a novelette says Calvero when he hears Thereza's story and the observation applies equally validly to this shallow and slightly tawdry love story.     What is this urge that makes us go on and on? asks Calvero.  The viewer can be forgiven for wondering the same thing.  This is Chaplin at his most selfindulgent and that's saying something with long rambling speeches about the secret of all happiness and horribly pretentious twaddle such as Desire is the theme of all life.  It's what makes a rose want to be a rose!     Desire is what makes Chaplin want to seem clever and profound but these witterings are meaningless The heart and the mind!  What an enigma!  He cites Freud twice as he 'psychoanalyses' a girl he doesn't know without any grounding in Freud's methods.  And the screenplay is horribly overwritten.  The strivings towards a selfconsciously literary style are embarrassing.  We get phrases like the elegant melancholy of twilight and at one point Thereza is made to remonstrate with Calvero against his despondency because You're too great an artist!  She tells him that he is excruciatingly funny when in fact he's just excruciating.  The overblown histrionic style had gone out of fashion forty years before this. Thereza is given dreadful bits of speechifying to do Truth! Truth! and the newspaper review which gets read aloud is literary pomposity of the most grotesque kind.     I wasn't funny admits Calvero.  Elsewhere he confesses I lost contact with my audience.  How very true.  Calvero is offered to us as one of the great artists of vaudeville but the simple truth is that the 'turns' which he performs onscreen are embarrassingly weak.  The patter is lacklustre and unfunny and the wretched flea routine which would not have survived the script consultation stage had there been one gets shown twice.  It is an emblem of the film itself  too longwinded and not nearly funny enough.  Calvero flirts with Mrs. Alsop the tough old landlady in what is meant to be a winning deployment of charm but it fails because Calvero isn't charming.  Worst of all is the seemingly neverending ballet Chaplin's most extreme form of selfindulgence in a film mired in directionless ego.  As a pianist Chaplin has dexterity without musicality as a writer glibness without eloquence as a composer facility without substance.  In all of his 'artistic' endeavours he tootles and tinkers without really ever saying anything.  The clown demands to be taken seriously but has nothing serious to say.     Plot articulations were never a Chaplin strongpoint vide the train wheels in Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight has some clumsy narrative apparatus.  The hoary old contrivance of the surprise telegram is lazy plotting as is the inelegant questionanswer dialogue by which Calvero elicits Thereza's life story.  Calvero has been on the verge of Skid Row for years but suddenly high society rewards him for his artistic achievements with a benefit gala  and thus is Claire Bloom's ballet worked into the story.  After a long slow buildup to the ballet the film ends with puzzling abruptness.     Postant the impresario Nigel Bruce and Neville the composer Sydney Chaplin occupy a no man's land somewhere between being developed as characters and being irrelevant to the plot.  The suspicion has to be that Chaplin introduced Neville in order to render the film palatable to an American audience.  The core story that Youth must break free of Age's tutelage in order to fulfil its own potential doesn't need Neville.     Chaplin was fond of backprojection eg the neverquitehalting train in The Great Dictator.  Calvero and Thereza go for a stroll against a backprojection of the Thames Embankment and it just doesn't work.  The artifice is simply too distracting.     Can anything positive be said about Limelight?  Well the routine with Buster Keaton is delightful but 1 was it really necessary to repeat the gags so blatantly? and 2 one hears ugly rumours that Chaplin butchered the scene at the editing stage because Keaton was so much funnier than he. There is a reversemotion segment in the clownage a device Chaplin had previously used in the 'globe dance' passage of The Great Dictator.  Oh and Eternally is a nice tune.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most ordinary people fall into a role and a persona in their lives and tend to not veer very far from it if it provides for them. Perhaps due to extreme situations they may find it necessary to reinvent themselves once or twice and rise to the occasion or fall into dissolution.An artist like Chaplain had to reinvent himself over and over again over four decades particularly in a medium that was changing every few years. That's probably why he had so many failed marriages with younger woman he had to feel like a player to keep the flow going and fight back the doubt and anxiety and the terror of becoming irrelevant that inevitably begins to haunt creative men in their twilight years. Don't underestimate the power of sex magic!Limelight is a film about those demons and the immense courage and yes the love of a much younger woman too doesn't hurt that is required to triumph over them. Still everyone knows there is one specter that no man can outrun  Death. Chaplain masks this existential dimension in layers of sentimental melodrama which you will have to decide for yourself is effective but I think he does this intentionally to smuggle in some deep and darker themes that filmmakers like Bergman would become famous for continually exploring masterfully.I found myself going back and forth with Limelight there are times when the melodrama overpowers the film and the pedestrian cinematography doesn't help matters. A few times I felt like I was watching the old Abbot and Costello TV show particularly the apartment scenes. However Chaplain is such an immense presence you can't help be engaged and encouraged to keep watching because you want so much for his character Calvero to triumph. His costar Claire Bloom is quite effective too and she has several looks in this film to contrast and mirror the ongoing struggle the old comedian in having internally.Getting on in years myself and feeling washed up and without hope and purpose Calvero's plight and faltering desire to once again command the Limelight was quite cathartic. I was amazed by his final performance with Keaton when Calvero starts rocking that violin like Eddie Van Halen in his prime I was in a state of sublime fascination. Here was a true artist giving everything up for his audience feeling the peak thrill of having the audience at his command once again for a few fleeting moments a thrill that tragically he will pay dearly for. We can only hope that we too can earn such an exalted death as Calvero's. Perhaps that is Chaplain's hidden message in this film that life is in the final analysis about striving for a death that ennobles those you leave behind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even into the early 1950s Charles Chaplin had never truly recovered from the cinematic conversion from silents to talkies which took place in the late 1920s. As late as 1936 Chaplin continued to produce his trademark silent slapstick comedies with great critical and commercial success. Even his muchlauded 1940 effort 'The Great Dictator' alternated between dialogue mainly to satirise Adolf Hitler's manner of speech and to deliver the Jewish barber's rousing final speech and silent slapstick the latter very much reminiscent of the Little Tramp. By 1947 with 'Monsieur Verdoux' Chaplin had finally adapted to the times but there's no doubt that he still believed the silent to be the purest form of filmmaking. 'Limelight' is Chaplin's almostautobiographical reflection on a oncegreat artist who has fallen from grace but who wishes to hear the passionate applause of an audience just one last time.Unlike his previous films most of which found a delicate balance between pathos and humour 'Limelight' pretty much disregards any major notions of slapstick comedy and focuses primarily on sentimentalism. With perhaps the exception of Frank Capra Chaplin was the finest in Hollywood when it came to such things and it's impossible not to feel for his Calvero the aging comedy stage performer who is overthehill and struggling to adapt to changing times. Having descended into crippling bouts of alcoholism he regularly claims that he needs to have alcohol in him to be funny onstage Calvero's life and career is slowly withering away and his name  despite being wellknown and revered back in his day  is now considered poison to organisers. The character is relatively autobiographical offering an insight into the feelings and personalities of Chaplin who was just like Calvero beginning to lose many of his oncedevoted fans in part due to his attitudes toward World War II and AmericaRussia relations which led to his being labeled a Communist sympathiser. These parallels were quite obviously intentional with faded posters in Calvero's apartment declaring him to be the tramp comedian and the character remarking at one point that he enjoys street performances perhaps because of the tramp within me.When he rescues a depressed ballet dancer Terry Claire Bloom from committing suicide Calvero convinces her that life truly is worth living inspiring himself in the process. While Terry eventually achieves great success as a dancer Calvero determines himself to captivate the audience once more though his comedy routines often end disastrously and he is simply unable to capture the magic of a passed era. This time as the aging performer sinks into bouts of heavy drinking it is up to Terry to return the favour to the man who saved her life and she ultimately falls in love with Calvero despite a massive age difference this particular scenario once again mirrors one of Chaplin's own relationships his fourth marriage to Oona O'Neill 37years his junior. Calvero's final performance is before a packedhouse accompanied by an old partner played by fellow silent comedy genius Buster Keaton in their first and only appearance on screen together and the pair finally receive the enthusiastic reception that they had waited so long to experience just once more.There is something very bittersweet about Calvero's stage performances. They are so sweetly innocent that you can understand why an advancing society has shunned them in favour of more sophisticated entertainment but they genuinely exhibit the performer's passion and enthusiasm. Most of them are played out before a completely silent audience giving them an almost dreamlike feel indeed several of the performances are played out as dreams allowing us to focus entirely on the actual comedy routines and also keeping us in suspense as to how the audience will actually react to what they are seeing. A very memorable routine has Calvero as a fleatrainer an idea he recycled from an unfinished 1919 short 'The Professor.' Buster Keaton's influence is really quite minimal  Chaplin naturally gets most of the good gags  but they work together so wonderfully that you wonder why they had never previously collaborated on any film projects. Chaplin's slow mournful sentimental score also by Ray Rasch and Larry Russell won him his only competitive Oscar though it didn't come until 1973 one year after 'Limelight' finally made its Los Angeles debut.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off I am a huge fan of Chaplin. At least that of the silent movie idiom. I just bought and watched for the first time Limelight and it is the first Chaplin talkie I have watched. So I have nothing to compare it to. Frankly I was astonished at how maudlin and depressing the overall feeling is throughout. The theme of the film could have developed into a powerful drama but in my eyes sunk into selfindulgent and a surprisingly poor story. Let's take Chaplin himself. He was well known for his ability to play a drunk and did so many times in films hearkening back to his prefilm days in England. His drunken state in the film is always the same without drawing out much more than a cardboard rendition of a drunken state. His wobbling about never has anything humorous about it. If it was meant to appear dramatic or tragic than it did not even come close to suggesting this. I was left wondering always wondering where is he going with this? For me it went plodding along to nothingness.Let's examine Claire Bloom. In far too many scenes her acting is overwrought and over the top. I ended up wondering if she was creating a parody of a tragic heroine? The early romance with the composer that she was unable to fulfill reappears later in the film all of it manipulated over and over again by an ambivalent Chaplin who does not quite believe what he's doing with his machinations. Chaplin's character seems to be so washed up that the only time he comes to life is when he's saving someone else's. Claire Bloom is a fine actor but the script and the direction turn her into a rag doll that is pushed around the screen by Chaplin.There are some strengths in the film and it's a shame Chaplin didn't develop them further. The odd choice of Bloom's character falling in love with a man who could be her grandfather is not given enough twist or edge. Perhaps that would have been asking just a wee bit too much of an early 50's audience to stomach? Still the platonic love she offers is spurned by Chaplin but at the first opportunity six months later she is right back where she started from fully in love with Chaplin. Even though she says she's grown older and maybe wiser her actions defy her words. There is a very shocking scene which jolted me and that is where just before Bloom is to dance before a huge crowd she cries to Chaplin that she's lost the feelings in her feet and legs and can't go on. He shouts at her and then when this is not good enough he slaps her on the face so hard he could have snapped her neck. The smacking sound in the movie is very pronounced and the effect on the viewer is very powerful. In keeping with the over the top elements of the drama she goes on to dance her heart out and bring the house down. It's just way too exaggerated and unbelievable.Keaton I've read that some people think that Chaplin brought Keaton into this film as a gesture albeit a very token one to an old colleague from the good old days. Keaton is not introduced we don't know why he's there unless I missed something and yet there he is at Chaplin's very important benefit concert. This scene leads me into another weakness in the film. The skit that Chaplin first puts on at the benefit is a repeat of what we've seen him do at least 2 or 3 times earlier in the film and it's a very bad version of a badly talented second rate hack from Vaudevilletype shows. Why he created this characterization was lost on me the first time but after 3 times I was more than a little perturbed. Was Chaplin insisting we believe that his character never had any talent in the first place? That would be contradictory to earlier information we are told about Calvero.So we put up with Chaplin's terrible rendition and then Keaton joins him on the stage during the encore. At last the sparks begin to fly. Finally we have the two undisputed masters putting on a delicious sequence of slapstick. And I laughed out loud for the first time in the entire film. Keaton is hilarious and Chaplin is wonderful. These old guys never lost a single bit of their timing. What is so clear in this sequence is that what is funny at least in this film is two guys acting as if they were in a silent picture! They don't say anything but we are in stitches just like we all were when we watched their many silent films.The movie comes to an overthetop end just a few minutes later. I sat there with my mouth open wondering what on earth Chaplin was thinking? He could have made us cry but the drama in the film was overt exaggerated bathos in full pathetic only in it's underdevelopment. This was a man who created the most memorable characters in silent movies he knew how to write and to direct and for me this film was stillborn from the getgo. If he was in the mood for selfindulgent sighing about his past like almost all late Jerry Lewis comedy then he did it very badly. Honestly I was astonished at how bad this film was and I do not know why others rave about it. I am still a fan but this film left me confused and dumbfounded.".

It's a very thoughtful film  obviously Chaplin in his 60s has lost none of his filmmaking skills the difference is that you come to Chaplin on His terms. No longer interested capable? of producing massive audience hits Chaplin produces an indulgent sentimental Limelight. It's an excellent work but very hard to digest.Some impressions Comedy is ballet. Life is ballet. Young needs old. Old needs young. Comics need a drug. Perhaps the film needs a single focus? I found the sequences where Chaplin is told by the suits he's washedup to be most memorable along with the small scene where a comic goes in for Chaplin's job because he's heard the old clown is awful. The stuff with Buster Keaton is very nice too and makes you wish the would have done a full film together.

I think it would be inappropriate to say that he descends into selfparody but ...The dramatic scenes however while not perfect are certainly much better. Charlot often cannot avoid the urge to pontificate on broad philosophical issues but when he returns to his main storyline there are often moments of pathos which give him some of his best opportunities to express facial emotion since the final indelible shot of City Lights. This film often feels like a reevaluation of City Lights in fact.Limelight contains many echoes of earlier Chaplin themes. Calvero's longing to live in the country was fulfilled by the Little Tramp in A Dog's Life 1918.In her memoir Leaving a Doll's House 1996 Claire Bloom writes that she feels too Jewish to be a comfortable English rose. I don't know she seems appealingly roselike to me. Her performance however is overamplified at times but I put that down to the influence of her director.The rest of the cast is like a bag of liquorice allsorts lots of variety nothing especially appetizing. Nigel Bruce plays Nigel Bruce Norman Lloyd struggles with his English accent Chaplin's son Sydney is here through the intercession of a doting father Buster Keaton seems glad just to be working.

She's reunited with composer Neville Sydney Earl Chaplin whom she had a crush on as a shopgirl. Calvero continues to dismiss Thereza's marriage proposals.I find Chaplin too stridden to be either romantic or as a kindly mentor. He's a little offputting and his comedy isn't working that well. He's more of a physical comedian. When the audience walks out on him it seems very autobiographical. This works a little better as a drama. Chaplin's son is a bit stiff. That role needs somebody better. The biggest missed opportunity is Chaplin's performances on stage. It seems like a great time to reintroduce the tramp. At this point Chaplin works better as a man passed his prime and that would be powerful. This movie asks too much from him. It's also fun to see Buster Keaton share the same screen with Chaplin and they have some good scenes together. Imagine if they did their act as older version of their acts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Grace Of My Heart is similar to Valley Of The Dolls because the characters in both films are loosely based on actual people showing their rise  fall in show business. Illeana Douglas plays singersongwriter Edna Buxton who becomes Denise Waverly. She's based on Carol Klein who became Carole King. A New Yorker who churned out hit after hit in the famous Brill Building. Where some of the action in Grace Of My Heart also takes place. John Turturro is based on record producer Phil Spector complete with bad toupee  the wearing of sunglasses indoors. Matt Dillon fronts The Riptides The Beach Boys. The Luminaires are based on girl groups like The Shirelles  The Chiffons. Bridget Fonda portrays teenaged angstridden bighaired bubblegum idol  lesbian Kelly Porter. There's no question that she's based on Lesley Gore. Interestingly Lesley Gore wrote the tune Bridget lip synch's in the film My Secret Love which is a homage to Lesley's You Don't Own Me. The music in this movie is very good  has that 60's 70's feel to it. I just wish the soundtrack album had included the tunes Hey There  Grace Of My Heart by Kristen Vigard who did the vocals for Illeana Douglas. If you like nostalgic movies about pop music like The Idolmaker Grease That Thing You Do  Hairspray you'll like this too.".

But this movie goes straight to my heart and puts a squeeze on it through the wonderful music the sweet nostalgia and what a cast!Illeana Douglas is beautiful and she really plays her character with great talent. She's supported by a strong cast and how can you go wrong with Turturro playing Phil Specter? The first time I saw this there was something familiar about the music the songs like God give me Strength. As much as I like Elvis Costello that scene of Illeana performing it for Matt Brian Wilson Dillon was such a unique delivery of a pure and powerful vocal. I later found that the 'familiarity' is Burt Bacharach and the 'voice' is Kristin Vigard Wow! Back in those days there was such an explosion of music and creativity and Burt Bacharach was truly a pop force.I loved the Brill Building scenes especially when they were working on the songs. I thought the movie lost something when it moved west to California but was deeply moved by Douglas and Turturro 'having it out' at the empty poolside. The final song with the flashbacks and her crowning achievement of recording that one great album had me weeping again. I really like this movie so I ordered the DVD online.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a former singer with a female group from the 70's called SOFTOUCH I could really appreciate the movie Grace of My Heart. I thought the movie was very authentic in its presentation of the artists' struggles with becoming a singer in his or her own right as well as a writer. It was not a popular position to be in in the 50's and 60's. I love Ms. Douglas. I thought she did an exceptional job with the material and the singing. John Tuturro was great as the manager and provided great comedic relief. Since his performance I have gone out of my way to see everything he has performed in. He is an awesome actor! Most importantly I enjoyed the music of Burt Bacharach. There is none other to compare. His songs are historic! My only concerns are these 1 I would have appreciated the female vocalist Kristin Vigard recording the hit God Give Me Strength. I thought her voice was much more haunting and convincing. 2 Where can I purchase the Song Book for the sound track? I am now a teacher of middle school students in the arts program and there are several clips from the movie that I have been able to show my students  and they love this movie! I cannot show the entire movie for the obvious sexual content however they get a kick out of the music storyline and the progress of the time including the wardrobe changes.".

I thought the movie was very authentic in its presentation of the artists' struggles with becoming a singer in his or her own right as well as a writer. It was not a popular position to be in in the 50's and 60's. I love Ms. Douglas. I thought she did an exceptional job with the material and the singing. John Tuturro was great as the manager and provided great comedic relief. Since his performance I have gone out of my way to see everything he has performed in. He is an awesome actor!

Much of the music is deadon in its nostalgia the production values are fine and Douglas is simply terrific her toothy smile and wide eyes are endearing yet the film hits a bump just before the final act and never recovers.

Ileana Douglas is an amazing actress with both comedy and drama ability. Beautiful woman with the most amazing doe eyes. She portrays a woman struggling as we women always seem to have to do in a mans world to be a music writer. With a bad marriage under her skirt and several other issues she knows pain and heartache all too well which gives her the ammo she needs. Not doing too well with recording her own music she needs a little more courage to put herself out there. Well it's a great portrayal of a woman who can't seem to get a break in her personal life but flourishes as a song writer. The music is great going from the 60's to the 70's and for someone like me who was born in '59 appreciates when music was music and you could actually stand to even listen to a little pop music. Sure there are a few comparisons to real musicians writers and producers like Jay Brian Wilson DeniseEdna Carole King Joel Phil Spectorbut it takes on it's own story line and you just to have to come to your own conclusion. I appreciate the story and music and hail Alison Anders as an excellent director and phenomenal writer. Go figure this good of a movie written and directed by a woman. Wow imagine that!".

Oz and Cynthia are in a quiet life in hiding from the gangsters. Lazlo is out of prison and wants revenge so he kidnaps Cynthia and now Jimmy Jill and Oz get together to save her only to find out there are more twists and turns than they expected. But Jimmy has to go deep back into his roots of being the tough guy not Mr. Clean.Now don't get me wrong The Whole Ten Yards has a few laughs here and there but for the most part I just actually felt bad for Bruce Willis with the silly attempt to be a soft like Martha Stuart type of guy he's just such a great tough guy it's hard to see him as anything else. Matthew Perry wasn't as fun as he was in the first movie and neither was Amanda it just seems like everyone lost their magic and chemistry with each other in this film.

	schema:headline " Far from brilliant but fun despite being superfluous";
	schema:reviewBody "I found The Whole Nine Yards to be a surprisingly fun film which worked thanks to its engaging plot and interesting characters. One thing I didn't think the film needed was a sequel but I decided to sit down and watch it anyway and to my surprise it's a lot better than I thought it would have been. I can certainly understand why it hasn't received glowing praise as many of the jokes are recycled and the whole film does feel like an excuse to give the likes of Mathew Perry something to do. That being said original script writer Mitchell Kapner has managed to put together a film that makes good use of its absurd plot and characters and somehow manages to be enjoyable despite feeling completely superfluous. The plot this time starts when Oz's wife Cynthia is kidnapped by a Hungarian mob boss. Oz decides to contact Jimmy the Tulip Cynthia's exhusband and hit man to help get his wife back from the mob. Along with Jimmy's wife and aspiring assassin Jill the trio attempt to thwart the mob boss and help Oz get Cynthia back.Just like the first film this one relies on the talents of its lead stars to pull it through. Matthew Perry's wisecracks are mostly amusing and he is in his element the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. Amanda Peet is still naive and sexy as the aspiring assassin while Bruce Willis sleepwalks in a role that is a spoof of what he's used to doing. Kevin Pollack chews the scenery with his silly accent but provides some laughs and just like the first film Natasha Henstridge is the spare wheel. The plot isn't very well done as it mostly features the lead stars hanging around and waiting for someone to shoot at them so it can become a bit boring. However the film is never far away from a oneliner or comedic set piece to keep it moving and there are a number of big laughs. Sequels like this often don't work Ocean's Twelve being the case in point but I'm pleased to say that The Whole Ten Yards isn't a complete waste of time as it delivers what you would expect of it. It's not particularly deep or clever but the film offers a fun time and the ending is rather well done.".

	onyx:emotionText "I found The Whole Nine Yards to be a surprisingly fun film which worked thanks to its engaging plot and interesting characters. One thing I didn't think the film needed was a sequel but I decided to sit down and watch it anyway and to my surprise it's a lot better than I thought it would have been. I can certainly understand why it hasn't received glowing praise as many of the jokes are recycled and the whole film does feel like an excuse to give the likes of Mathew Perry something to do. That being said original script writer Mitchell Kapner has managed to put together a film that makes good use of its absurd plot and characters and somehow manages to be enjoyable despite feeling completely superfluous. The plot this time starts when Oz's wife Cynthia is kidnapped by a Hungarian mob boss. Oz decides to contact Jimmy the Tulip Cynthia's exhusband and hit man to help get his wife back from the mob. Along with Jimmy's wife and aspiring assassin Jill the trio attempt to thwart the mob boss and help Oz get Cynthia back.Just like the first film this one relies on the talents of its lead stars to pull it through. Matthew Perry's wisecracks are mostly amusing and he is in his element the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. Amanda Peet is still naive and sexy as the aspiring assassin while Bruce Willis sleepwalks in a role that is a spoof of what he's used to doing. Kevin Pollack chews the scenery with his silly accent but provides some laughs and just like the first film Natasha Henstridge is the spare wheel. The plot isn't very well done as it mostly features the lead stars hanging around and waiting for someone to shoot at them so it can become a bit boring. However the film is never far away from a oneliner or comedic set piece to keep it moving and there are a number of big laughs.

Also Jimmy's rotten behavior towards Oz and his wife was so out of character from what was established in the first movie and his bizarre behavior in the beginning was inadequately justified. Furthermore Kevin Pollack was more incomprehensible in this movie than in the previous one which is saying something.

Every moment in this movie begs for a single laugh and it's as if the actors some who were all so promising in the original film The Whole Nine Yards 2000 were promised big paychecks if they were able to tag along with the film's script.The Whole Ten Yards assumes that the viewer has some familiarity with the first movie. Bruce Willis returns as Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski who's now living in obscurity with his wife Jill Amanda Peet. Both are having problems in their marriage due to a Jimmy's erectile dysfunction b Jill's inability to fulfill her lifelong ambition to become a contract killer and c Jimmy's transformation into a malelike Martha Sterwart.Meanwhile Nicholas Oz Oseransky's Matthew Perry finds that goons have kidnapped his wife Cynthia Natasha Henstridge and that they are led by Lazlo Gogolak Kevin Pollak the father of the mob boss also played by Pollak in the original who was eliminated in the original film. Oz tracks down Jimmy and convinces his old pal to give up cooking and house cleaning and help him in a rescue attempt.Warner Bros. has been unsuccessful in making mobstercomedy movie sequels. Analyze This 1999 was a funny film but the idea to make a sequel was unnecessary. The sequel Analyze That 2002 was an attempt to stretch an idea beyond its natural shelf life.But you have to wonder why the filmmakers felt it was a good move to make a sequel to The Whole Nine Yards or why Matthew Perry who is playing Chandler from Friends again is unlikely to have a movie career and why the film has been toned down to a PG13 rating the film cheats us of another view of Peet's breasts.Screenwriter George Gallo on the DVD commentary evidently has no regrets. I think this movie is very funny he insists I wrote 80 pages of genius. Apparently the scathing reviews and paltry box office have done little to humble him as he adds It's like a homicidal Three Stooges. When Hollywood lackluster sequels are meant to be made Howard Deutch is the man to call. He's responsible for Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II 1998 and Grumpier Old Men 1995. Deutch has also directed John Hughesproduced film such as The Great Outdoors 1988 Pretty in Pink 1986 and Some Kind of Wonderful 1987. In The Whole Ten Yards there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes Tranes  Automobiles 1987 but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it.But if you don't laugh at that there's Kevin Pollack again in one of the most singularly bad performances I have ever seen in a movie. It fails by calling attention to its awfulness. His accent his voice his clothes his clownish makeup all conspire to create a character who brings the movie to a halt every time he appears on the screen.There's also the propensity of a 107year old woman able to pass gas. Surely by now you must be rolling in the aisles? No? Then I will mention that Bruce Willis' character is often unpleasant. He puts on an apron and a head cloth during the early scenes as if such a disguise would do anything other than call attention to himself.Deutch on the DVD commentary is quietly apologetic as he points out all the things he wished he'd changed. I was always sorry we didn't cut this out  he says of one scene I think the joke is over. And I should mention that some of the film's elements such as the film's violence for example a scene where a woman gets a slap to the face don't blend well with the film's light comedy. And if you're planning on seeing or watching The Whole Ten Yards someday let me tell you it's not worth seeing for a whole ten bucks on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes sequels to good films should not be released... examples The Sting 2 Sister Act 2 Another 48 Hours Dirty Dancing  Havana Nights Grumpier Old Men etc. The latter Grumpier was directed by THIS director  that should serve as an omen for sure.Thank God Almighty I did not spend a dime on this rental with my Blockbuster Freedom Pass  something I highly recommend if you are frequently unsure of what to rent. This was a movie both me and my wife wanted badly to see but luckily missed in the theaters. We saw the ad for it out on DVD and were excited about renting it. The multiple copies were amazingly all rented out lots of suckers in this world and unluckily I got one coming back just as I was returning another stinker my tween daughter picked out Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen. I mouthed my complaints a few times last night as it Confessions being one of the worst movies I had seen in recent memory. My sincerest apologies to my daughter... that movie was Oscarworthy when compared to this film. OMG watching this film was gutwrenchingly torturous. I laughed admittedly at this supposedcomedy TWO times my wife three times... for no more than a second or two while the original film made us both laugh almost continuously throughout.The screenwriter obviously stole the entire story of the original Whole Nine Yards film's French protg'  this I know because the story writing of this unnecessary sequel was nothing even close to this film's viewworthy predecessor. I feel so sorry for those actors who could not have been paid enough to return and act in this awfullyscripted sequel. If a joke was not funny at first the screenwriter kept dredging it back up over and over ad nausea. To make matters worse he even did a retelling of the events to Oz played by Matthew Perry the dentist's receptionistassistant as if we left the theater and returned I guess  fat chance of returning. A good example of how poorly written this screenplay is... they the main characters argued over accidentally locking a bad guy in the trunk of their car for a scene that went on seemingly forever in fact in the scene following they were STILL arguing that irrelevant point. The story was so loosely tied together and with Kevin Pollack's horrendously overacted bad poppa type of character this movie almost instantly became ingraining on my nerves causing me a headache. This review is my headache and bellyache therapy I guess.Had I actually paid for a ticket at the theater I would have asked the manager for my money back or comp passes along with some Excedrin and Alka Seltzer after thirty minutes if I lasted that long complaining of becoming ill and unable to finish the movie. I kept watching the DVD counter waiting for this movie to mercifully end. Although my wife would not admit it I think she was thinking the same thing. My advice  see the first one and leave well enough alone  like the Dodgers SHOULD have done with their nearlyperfect 2004 team at the trade deadline. The Whole Nine Yards was not a classic by any means but it was well worth its money in full  however The Whole Ten Yards was not even worth being paid to view.

	onyx:emotionText "Sometimes sequels to good films should not be released... examples The Sting 2 Sister Act 2 Another 48 Hours Dirty Dancing  Havana Nights Grumpier Old Men etc. The latter Grumpier was directed by THIS director  that should serve as an omen for sure.Thank God Almighty I did not spend a dime on this rental with my Blockbuster Freedom Pass  something I highly recommend if you are frequently unsure of what to rent. This was a movie both me and my wife wanted badly to see but luckily missed in the theaters. We saw the ad for it out on DVD and were excited about renting it. The multiple copies were amazingly all rented out lots of suckers in this world and unluckily I got one coming back just as I was returning another stinker my tween daughter picked out Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen. I mouthed my complaints a few times last night as it Confessions being one of the worst movies I had seen in recent memory. My sincerest apologies to my daughter... that movie was Oscarworthy when compared to this film. OMG watching this film was gutwrenchingly torturous. I laughed admittedly at this supposedcomedy TWO times my wife three times... for no more than a second or two while the original film made us both laugh almost continuously throughout.The screenwriter obviously stole the entire story of the original Whole Nine Yards film's French protg'  this I know because the story writing of this unnecessary sequel was nothing even close to this film's viewworthy predecessor. I feel so sorry for those actors who could not have been paid enough to return and act in this awfullyscripted sequel. If a joke was not funny at first the screenwriter kept dredging it back up over and over ad nausea. To make matters worse he even did a retelling of the events to Oz played by Matthew Perry the dentist's receptionistassistant as if we left the theater and returned I guess  fat chance of returning. A good example of how poorly written this screenplay is... they the main characters argued over accidentally locking a bad guy in the trunk of their car for a scene that went on seemingly forever in fact in the scene following they were STILL arguing that irrelevant point. The story was so loosely tied together and with Kevin Pollack's horrendously overacted bad poppa type of character this movie almost instantly became ingraining on my nerves causing me a headache.

Matt Perry is Chandler....again Bruce Willis is not up to his best and the rest of the cast overact like demons. The plot is so bizarrely convoluted that I started to lose track very early in the piece or maybe that is because I ceased to care. And the script sounds like they were all making it up on the run.

	schema:reviewBody "I've just seen this movie so impressions are pretty fresh. And honestly I just LOVED the previous one Whole Nine Yards. It was great not only because of starring Bruce Willis in a comic role which is pretty hard to find but also because of the great cast of Matthew Perry doing all kinds of goofs and playing quite an idiot   the beautiful and dangerouslooking Amanda Peet and also Natasha Henstridge about whom I don't think I should add anything else I mean we know she's gorgeous and also a pretty good actress. All in all great cast good story and great laughs  it was the first episode for me. MINOR SPOILERS And now coming to this. I didn't really think it might be a good idea to make a sequel to such a movie but somewhere deep inside I feared that it'll become like this if it's ever made. I mean on longer terms what could the beautiful exmobsterwife Henstridge want from Perry? And what'd Bruce Willis alias Jimmy the Tulip be if he settled down with a girl? This is all stupid. I dunno who thought that it'll be a good laugh if they showed all this to the public but it was rather annoying. Neurotic Willis taking care of the household and also neurotic Perry who doesn't seem to grow up after getting hold of a lot of money and a beautiful wife. Whereas the end of the first part was great touching and totally happyend I just love when the geek gets the hottie   it begins somewhere like 10 years later adding the realism noone wants to see in a comedy. Frankly after a happy end I don't wanna see all this stuff happening it's simply too much like real life. And as the movie continues it gets even worse Oz getting lower and lower being just a doormat throughout the whole story and in the end finding out the point of the whole plot at last together with the audience  it's horrible! I mean come on! After some chasing some action and some notsomild humiliation of the characters we got to love in the first part in the last 2 minutes we get to figure out why it all happened... now are we supposed to feel any better? Despite of all the outcome the film was still about trashing all of the characters and after the first 20 minutes I started to be angry and hate all of them and there was about 60 more to go. All this just to have a very brief tiny moment of catharsis which definitely didn't happen? Well... nice script. Really. END OF SPOILERS Otherwise there are some funny moments. I simply love the new mobster Lazlo Gogolak and however his mother farts all the time which has never been funny it sucks big time in every movie it gets introduced as a joke at least she spoke some Hungarian for real!  And besides Lazlo was a really funny character along with the rest of the mobsters especially his son. At least they didn't ruin the wellbuilt reputation of the Hungarian mob from the first part maybe 'cos there was nothing to ruin  .So... I'd recommend this film to those who like melodrama and hate comedies and those who hated the first one  they'll both find it growing up to their expectations. Those who actually liked the first take care this is much worse the characters and the story as well. In fact this movie is far less than anybody who have ever seen the first would expect. My vote is 3 of 10 just to honor the cast... it's not their fault after all.".

Amanda Peet and Matthew Perry try their best but misdirecting causes them to run around and act like total idiots. Natasha Hendstridge is hardly in the film which probably isn't such a bad thing because she isn't much of an actor anyway. The best performance in this film comes from Kevin Pollak as Lazlo Gogolak he gives an amusing yet forced performance just like the rest of the cast tries to do. Hmm what else...Amanda Peet takes her top off yet again in this film but this time for no apparent reason and the fact that this movie is PG13 so they don't even show anything just makes the whole scene redundant.Minor spoilersNow for the idiotic plot points too many to explain so i'll just do it in point form  Franky Figgs' sister out for revenge who just happens to be an assassin as well  Lazlo being Jimmy's father which just made NO sense at all not to mention it doesn't get explained. So he killed his brother in the whole 9 yards? i stopped paying attention to the film by 23rds of the way through so bare with me Jimmy and his exwife whom he wanted to kill decide to devise a scheme together and keep it secret from their spouses and then Jimmy makes his wife think he doesn't care about her and will kill her in order to drive her away to protect her.

	schema:reviewBody "Rent it buy it just to see the classic comic performances timing and natural talent of Perry. Really this guy's reactions to all things nerve wracking had me on the floor. Watch carefully as you put yourself into HIS shoes while watching this movie...hard to identify with a contract killer played ably by Bruce Willis. Bruce is the straight man and does his part while the role reversal in the opening scenes is a natural scream.I felt technically there were a couple of problems to nit pick in the direction and editing areas. Some of the comedy bits were OVER played and lasted too long...not the actor's faults...that is editing or direction. The actors did a marvelous job. But heavy talent and a VERY funny script must be seen. Pollak overdid Lazlo...the heavy overdone accent clipped out a lot of funny lines for me and the closed captioning was not working correctly. I think Pollak could have been much more effective funny and convincing in his part if he did not add the Jerry Lewis overacting style to the part. It detracted from what was and is a VERY funny script excellent acting by ALL the rest of the cast and a great job by the director of photography and most of the crew.How funny is a contract killer as an obsessive compulsive cook and homemaker? Very! How great was Mat Perry in the part of a good Joe all American who has to deal with dangerous underworld people...? Hysterical. Gagging and sucking for air on the floor pleading for mercy funny. Really funny. Love to see more good scripts for Perry.".

The chemistry among the wonderful cast works perfectly highlighting the scenes with Matthew Perry who is one of the best comedians of the cinema industry. In the end The Whole Ten Yards is a great comedy without having any further pretension.

Even the performance of Rosanna Arquette who is unusually without merit in this part and Bruce Willis the hero of the common man it manages to be poorly acted with characteristic performances by Matthiew Perry and Amanda Peet.

Clumsy and inept he set loose in store and can't do anything right . Boy are they in trouble .

Director Frank Tashlin introduces cinematic especial techniques in animated cartoon style  such as odd camera angles montage and quickly paced editing  as some shots lasting only five frames long . Jerry Lewis is topnotch playing a botcher and meek store clerk  Jerry played similar character as a bumbling idiot in other films such as a caddy in The Caddy and a TV repairman in both RockaBye Baby and It's Only Money. The costarring role stands out Jill St. John  surely the most gorgeous girl any clerk ever had . Excellent support cast formed by likable secondaries as Ray Walston as Mr. Quimby  John McGiver as Mr. John P. Tuttle and special mention to Agnes Moorehead as Mrs. Phoebe Tuttle . Furthermore  watch rapidly to veteran Kathleen Freeman . Colorful and shimmer cinematography in Technicolor by Wallace Kelley and catching musical score .The motion picture was well directed by Frank Tashlin  one of the few directors to successfully make the transition from animation to liveaction  as he directed his cartoons like liveaction films and his liveaction films like cartoons . He directed various vehicles for Jerry Lewis as The Geisha boy Hollywood or Bust  RockaBye Baby  Cinderfella and for Bob Hope as The son of Paleface . Who's minding the store ? is considered to be one of his best films . Rating  65 . Entertaining and amusing movie that it will appeal to Jerry Lewis fans . Worthwhile watching .".

Walston is great as the weasel of a store manager who does everything he can to break Norman. McGiver is outstanding as Mr. Tuttle who in the process of the film turns from a milquetoast to a tiger as he finally stands up to his wife Phoebe. However Agnes Moorehead is perfect as Phoebe Tuttle and she pretty much plays a mortal version of Endorra the character she would play less than a year later on Bewitched. However the one negative criticism of the film that I have is the fact that like what a couple of other commentators said was the fact that this film is pretty much takes great joy in bashing women.

Female Wrestler who's actually been hired to make Jerry want to quit... Well this film is as funny as any film of the 1960's included are the Pink Panther Shot in the Dark and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World....This is also one film of Jerry's that you really don't have to be a fan of Jerry's to appreciate...with an awesome supporting comedy cast of Agnes Moorehead John McGiver Ray Walston Jill St. John this film in my opinion is Jerry Lewis FINEST without Dean Martin and maybe his best of alltime. But that would take alot of doing. My advice If you get the opportunity to see Who's Minding the Store?

He plays the milk toast Mr. Tuttle. I've seen him in a number of fun films and he always gives a strong performance. His wife who wore the pants was played by Hollywood legend Agnes Moorehead. She gave a strong performance in this film. She was simply wonderful. The things she puts Jerry up to are extremely over the top! Very funny.I was to young to see this film when it came out. However as a child I can remember seeing it on television. I can remember my dad falling out of his chair and rolling on the floor in laughter. I remember joining him on the floor and finding it hard to breath because I was laughing so hard. My mom was hitting the side of her chair and screaming. You can't buy memories like that. I truly believe Jerry Lewis was the best comic of his time. For that matter Our time.Jerry Lewis is a true comic who isn't afraid to be the butt of every joke. That's what separates great comics from the rest. People like Jack Benny Phyllis DillerGeorge Burns The Three Stooges and on and on. It wasn't about them It was about laughter. If you want to take a break from the stress of life if just for a moment and simply enjoy a little nuttiness for the sake of nuttiness this is the film for you.".

He plays dog walker 'Norman Phiffier' one of nature's dorks with whom the lovely Barbara Tuttle  Jill St.John  is hopelessly besotted. Bab's mother is the fearsomely rich Phoebe Tuttle  Agnes Moorehead  owner of Tuttle's worldfamous department stores. Not wishing this idiot to become one of her relatives she arranges for Norman to work in one such store. He is given a succession of dirty dangerous jobs by manager Mr.Quimby  Ray Walston  in the hope that he will quit and leave Barbara alone...The first twenty or so minutes are virtually laughfree but then something marvellous happens. Jerry wanders into an empty office and begins tapping an imaginary typewriter to the sound of Leroy Anderson's 'Typewriter Song'. The idea is not brilliant but the execution is. Lewis' facial expressions are a joy to behold. From this point on the film does not put a foot wrong as with each new job Norman screws up big time. Tashlin's background as a cartoonist is evident in these scenes. When demonstrating a golfing game Norman sends the ball crashing through the window beginning a long journey that sends it around the street  knocking out a traffic cop along the way  and right back where it started. Working in the shoe department he tries to fit shoes on a lady wrestler. Thinking he is trying to get fresh with her she belts him one. He is not totally stupid though  required to paint the ball on the end of a flagpole at the top of the store he finds a way to do the job without endangering his life. The surreal climax has Norman attempting to deal with an outofcontrol vacuum cleaner which is behaving like a '50's scifi movie monster.Despite the slapstick tone the script manages a neat dig or two at our consumerist society most notably in the sequence where Norman has to deal with dozens of women out to take advantage of a sale. Its like watching the Sack of Carthage in Technicolour.Barbara's infatuation with Norman is hard to understand but then this is a comedy after all. As ever Jerry is surrounded by topnotch comic talent including John McGiver  as Barbara's Dad  and the everreliable Kathleen Freeman.This is an engaging wacky farce and worth catching for the aforementioned 'typewriter' mime which is comedy gold.".

But AMC was recently running a miniJerry Lewis festival and this film was in it so I couldn't resist taking a look back and I have to say this one holds up surprisingly well.  Jerry plays the eternal bumbling idiot who's in love with an heiress to a department store fortune.  One problem though her mother is aware of the romance through the use of private detectives doesn't approve and wants to break it up any way she can.  The upshot is that Jerry is given a job at the department store doing the most impossible unpleasant tasks imaginable so that he will appear a failure in front in his new fiancee.As Jerry Lewis movies go this one is actually pretty good for a lot of reasons.  It has a bigtime supporting cast for one thing as opposed to Jerry playing six roles by himself in various modes of stupidity.  The script is funny that is the vignettes of Jerry moving from one disaster to another in different sections of the store. And the slapstick is wellexecuted without being brutal or forced.  Agnes Moorehead is great as the evil wouldbe motherinlaw playing a slightly more cosmpolitan version of the character she played in Bewitched.  John McGiver is very good as the cuckolded husband Jill St. John appropriately nurturing as the girlfriend and Ray Walston who to me is nothing but a showbiz benchwarmer is a howl as the whimpering flunky store manager who's complicit in the scheme.  As for the best bits the running gag of the hapless policeman on the blunt end of Jerry's screwups is well done Nancy Kulp is absolutely hilarious in a scene as a famous biggame hunter and at the top of the pile Jerry does his classic typewriter bit where he mimics the movements of a typist set to music.  This is a not good but great routine a truly inspired bit that is worthy of being described as genius.On the negative side I couldn't help but think that the message of the film the man is king of his castle etc. etc. mostly fits Jerry's worldview that women are worth little more than sex toys and kitchen utensils.  This sort of thing may have been quaint in 1963 but it's downright prehistoric now.  But if you can shake off the sexism this film has a lot of good laughs.  It might even be the Citizen Kane of Jerry Lewis movies. And since Agnes Moorehead was in both pictures I may be on to something.  2 12  out of 4 but for a Lewis picture that's a rave.".

	schema:reviewBody "Who's Minding the Store? is a movie that is so stupid its funny. This film contains scenes that are incredibly dimwitted. Other scenes are dumber than dumb. But I found myself laughing at what was going on. I haven't seen alot of Jerry Lewis movies with the exception of a few including this one. Who's Minding the Store? stars Lewis as Norman Pfeiffer a hapless young man who works as a poodle dog walker and animal sitter. He is engaged to be married to a lovely young woman named Barbara played by Jill St. John before she became a Bond woman in Diamonds Are Forever. Barbara works at a department store as an elevator operator. One day she goes to visit Norman while dogsitting and she breaks the news to him that her bosses want Norman to come work at the store. Norman is thrilled to get the chance to work close to his girl and foolishly accepts the job. However what Barbara doesn't know is that this is a scheme by her mother Phoebe Tuttle played by Bewitched star Agnes Moorehead who just happens to be the store owner. Phoebe is not happy one bit that her daughter is engaged to this imbecile. So she orders the store manager Mr. Quimby Ray Walston to give Norman the hardest most impossible jobs to do so that he'll quit his new job and hopefully end up breaking off his engagement to Barbara. The jobs that Norman does in this film are unbelievable and in the process ends up turning the store upside down into a disaster area. I laughed and laughed and laughed at the stupidity of what went on and I couldn't help it. This movie cracks me up interesting because 20 years after Lewis made this he made a movie titled oddly enough Cracking Up. I feel kind of guilty admitting that I like this film but I did. out of four".

	schema:reviewBody "Who's Minding The Store may seem prehistoric to many but it did reflect the times namely 1963. Just watch an episode of Mad Men and you'll see why.That said it is a very fun movie! Jerry Lewis is well Jerry Lewis getting into all sorts of nonsense. Thing is at the end we see real humanity in his character when he asserts his integrity as a worker and that may be the thing the French latch onto. Though the movie may seem misogynistic I see Jill St. John's character as being assertive in a positive way especially when she expresses her love of Jerry Lewis. The bit about man must be a king in his castle was likely a reaction by John McGiver about how his wife acted in such a disrespectful manner.No matter. Times were different in 1963. The movie was made when John F. Kennedy was president and released six days after he died. From that standpoint this movie was a relic.Castingwise this movie was brilliant! The actors rocked! Jill St. John did a great job as did Francesca Bellini who turned in a sexy performance worthy of Mad Men. The male leads fared well especially Ray Walston! He ROCKED!!! And Agnes Moorehead fared well! Come to think of it everyone else did! I did not give the film 1010 because of the attitudes of the times but it earned the other nine points for its comedy the visuals and the brilliant cast!! And thank you for getting this out on DVD!!".

The sight gags are hysterical highlighted by a very funny fight between Lewis and a very aggressive vacuum cleaner. Nancy Kulp herself a sight gag is pretty amusing as a great white hunter. Lewis gets a terrific foil in shrewish department store owner Agnes Moorehead. Although Jill St. John is a bit harder to take as her daughter. She's insistent on being with Jerry and that's tough to digest. Lewis usually kept his leading ladies to the Ina Balin type...semiingenues who would believably be smitten with him. Nevertheless the movie is terrific with the now famous typewriter gag.".

In the right vehicles he does show comic talent. Who's Minding The Store? isn't one of his classics like The Ladies' Man or The Nutty Professor but it is fairly likable. True the movie suffers from the fact that there is almost no plot or character development but if you are in the mood to not think very much the episodic narrative does suffice. None of the gags are classics though the typewriter scene does get close to that status but they are lightly amusing. Former animation director Frank Tashlin stages many scenes like a live action cartoon and these scenes are visually impressive as well as provoking a decent amount of giggles. It helps that Lewis here isn't strident coming across as a klutz but one that is determined and a good fellow. Actually there is one laugh out loud bit albeit unintentional Lewis' character at one point is mentioned to be twentysix years old  when Lewis was actually thirtyseven years old when he made this movie and sure looked it!".

As she got off the elevator with the vacuum out of control and pointed in her direction her skirt was sucked right off her body revealing her gorgeous legs encased only in dark brown silk stockings held up by a black lacey garterbelt over her pretty black panties.

	schema:reviewBody "Right up front I think it's important you know I am not particularly a fan of Jerry Lewis films. I am sure he's a wonderful human being but I have never really understood the appeal of his comediesparticularly his solo efforts. Now that does not mean I dislike all his films The Delicate Delinquent and The Sad Sack are very good comedies I just don't have a burning love for his movies like some reviewers. So why am I watching many of his films recently? Well because I want to be fairand in recent months I have deliberately chosen some big name stars whose work I am not all that fond of in order to reassess themto give them a fair chance. For example I was never a fan of Marlon Brando so I recently saw almost all his films and have a greater appreciation for some of his movies. Now I am working on Jerry Lewisespecially since a good friend felt I was being too hard on the man's work.Who's Minding the Store begins with a rich lady Agnes Moorehead consulting with some of her help. Apparently she's had them spy on her daughter's boyfriend Lewis to see what sort of guy he is. She sees him as an uncultured idiot and feels she must do something to break up the coupleshe CAN'T have her daughter marrying THAT! Moorehead decides to try to break them up by proving to her daughter that he is weak and incompetentand she plans on making his new job at the department store one she owns horribleto make him quit and to humiliate him. So she gets her manager Ray Walston to give him every horrible job he can think of...and the manager thinks of many! As for Lewis he has no idea his girl Jill St. John is wealthy as she lives simply and he also has no idea he's been under surveillance or that he's being set up to fail on this job.The style of this film is very episodicand that's not a bad thing. Each time Lewis is given a new job it's like a separate comedy bit. And when they don't work so well they come so often that the momentum is quite niceand most of these situations are very enjoyable such as the lady wrestler his very famous invisible typewriter bit and the ladies sale. In addition Jerry is much more likable in this one as he does NOT mug for the camera and is pretty restrained often a problem in some of his other filmshe's also a very a nice guy. It's also very very nice seeing his relationship with his future fatherinlaw John McGiverit's really sweet. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this oneit was restrained wellacted and had some nice laughs. Even the over the top vacuum bit was worth seeingeven if this one did lack subtlety! Because I enjoyed this so much perhaps I can look past some of Lewis' duds like Cracking Up ewww....now THAT'S bad and I look forward to the next.".

I am sure he's a wonderful human being but I have never really understood the appeal of his comediesparticularly his solo efforts. Now that does not mean I dislike all his films The Delicate Delinquent and The Sad Sack are very good comedies I just don't have a burning love for his movies like some reviewers. So why am I watching many of his films recently? Well because I want to be fairand in recent months I have deliberately chosen some big name stars whose work I am not all that fond of in order to reassess themto give them a fair chance.

	schema:reviewBody "PostDean Martin Jerry Lewis films were a mixed bag. You must totally suspend reality to enjoy the somewhat bizarre visual humor Lewis encompasses in his films. This movie is no exception for some of its gags but for the most part many of these bits offer genuine laughs.That future witchy motherinlaw Agnes Moorehead is at her domineering best as department store owner Phoebe Tuttle even the name is domineering! as she schemes to keep her beautiful daughter Jill St. John from marrying Lewis whom Moorehead considers a useless idiot. She has her department store personnel manager Ray Walston hire Lewis and give him the worst jobs possible in hopes of discrediting him with St. John. She doesn't count on Lewis befriending her milquetoast husband John McGiver the inname only president of the firm as well as succeeding in many of the tasks and somehow escape the others without quitting and proving her right.Lewis is an acquired taste but how can you not laugh at Lewis pretending to type to the popular instrumental ditty The Typewriter? He's also very funny as he finds a way to paint the tip of a 9th story flagpole. Dealing with a lady wrestler Peggy Mondo trying to fit into shoes way too small is painfully unfunny as is sadly the sequence with the usually delightful Nancy Kulp as a butch big game hunter. Usual Lewis nemesis Kathleen Freeman is wasted as another one of Lewis's customers in basically a walkin. Pardon the pun Her appearance is in the shoe department. The three most hysterical sequences involve store productsa golf ball a small boat and a vacuum cleaner. These are all farcial in presentation and lack the violence of the other sequences mentioned above. Dick Wessel is funny in a recurring gag as a traffic cop who is the unfortunate victim of some of Lewis's work assignments gone wrong. Walston is appropriately effette as Moorehead's coconspirator but it seems odd to giver his character sort of a lothario trait.St. John has nothing to do but be lovely and noble so she is upstaged by her onscreen parents McGiver and Moorehead. Each of them offers a lot of laughs especially Moorehead who is basically indistinguishable from her portrayal of Bewitched's Endora. At least viewers in 1964 could see her ravishing red hair several years before Bewitched went to color not to mention the blue eye shadow. Such familiar classic character comics as Fritz Feld Mary Treen Isobel Elsom and Milton Frome also appear in nice bits although Feld's sequence as manager of an exotic food shop is literally in bad taste.".

If you count a ratio of the movies that have been made with actors in their prime and put them side by side with movies where the same actors are reaching 50 60 or even 70 you'd be hardpressed to find more than a smattering over a decade's time. And to sell a romantic comedy above all to a youthobsessed public wanting to see the inevitable tight curves on the female lead's body and the rippled muscles on the male's where instead there are none is a gamble that would surely signal a train wreck by default.Surprisingly enough this one's a winner. While the story may not be the most original of all  serial dater finds the perfect woman as a headstrong woman close to his age but loses her to his dating habits then realizes he really does care for her after all  is really a variation of boymeets girl loses girl regains girl with the exception that this time around the boy is Jack Nicholson the girl is Diane Keaton and neither are under 55.To do a movie that has these two exceptionally mannered but no less veteran actors play parts that could have easily veered off into caricatures is a hard trick to pull off and thankfully the script and their acting is always on target to make us never forget these are real people and not their public persona. Nicholson especially has the harder part here  his role is so close to life he could have sleepwalked through it  but he brings a genuine humanity to what is initially a sitcomlike old lecher who can't date women older than 25. Keaton also has a difficult role because she's been known to play variations of Annie Hall but here she lays herself bare in more ways than one. To see her interact with Nicholson and see them play out their initial dislike their cautious flirtation which becomes actual attraction and see what happens to both of them once Nicholson chickens out to go back to philandering is what romantic comedies are made of. It's a great setup even when the pay off is a little too pat for comfort at times and seems somewhat manipulative. There were moments when I wondered what kind of a story SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE would have been had it decided on bringing Keanu Reeve's character into the front and having him being her choice but this being a conventional script it of course decides to have Nicholson win her back in the most traditional of ways with nary a conflict but this doesn't detract much from the film as much as tell a good chickflick with an emotional center.Some nice supporting roles here Reeves plays a character totally different from his MATRIX or CONSTANTINE roles Rachel Ticotin holds her own as the doctor whom Nicholson keeps bumping into every time his heart goes bonkers and Amanda Peet continues to prove herself as the rising star she is becoming. Frances McDormand has fun with a small part as Keaton's sister.As a note for a movie set in the Hampton's NY those were some pretty interesting looking palm trees.".

	schema:reviewBody "Diane Keaton gives the performance of her career in 'Something's Gotta Give' writerdirector Nancy Meyers' smart and savvy take on middleage romance. Keaton plays Erica Barry a 50something playwright living on her own in a swanky beach house in the Hamptons. Although she has achieved enormous success in her career her personal life leaves much to be desired.Erica though brilliant and attractive has pretty much shut herself off from the dating scene since her divorce a number of years ago. Erica's life runs like a welloiled machine with each element  both personal and professional  fitted neatly into place with no room left over for spontaneity or passion. One fateful day Erica stumbles upon a strange man rummaging through her refrigerator a 63 yearold professional bachelor named Harry Sanborn who Erica discovers to her horror is dating her 30 yearold daughter Marin Harry is actually a notorious bachelor having been profiled as such in a number of tony New York magazines. Even though Erica is disgusted by the situation she is forced to take care of Harry after he suffers a heart attack while staying at her place. Despite their diametrically opposed outlooks on love and romance Erica and Harry spend quality time together discover their ultimate compatibility and eventually fall in love.Meyers has written a witty sophisticated screenplay that offers insights into any number of 'battle of the sexes' issues. She has outrageous fun exploring the phenomenon of middleaged men cavorting with women half their age. Jack Nicholson known in real life for doing just that has a great time poking fun at his own public image while at the same time providing a richly textured portrait of a man who may not be quite as shallow as his persona would suggest. When he so unexpectedly finds his head turned by a vibrant attractive and intelligent woman in her 50's Harry a middleaged Lothario who finds he needs Viagra to help him keep pace with his youthful 'conquests' is forced to reevaluate what has hitherto been the defining philosophy of his personality and lifestyle. Nicholson is magnificent at showing us the profound confusion his character undergoes as he takes those much belated but faltering steps into adult maturity.Nicholson is however only one half of this extraordinary couple. As the other half Keaton having been handed what is clearly the role of a lifetime has never seemed so natural and selfassured on screen. She makes of the character a capable nononsense woman who has allowed her passions to lie dormant far too long. Though on the surface she appears confident and in control of her life Erica is underneath it all a woman wounded by past experience and intimidated by a culture that expects women to be put out to pasture the moment they reach middle age. It is this combination of strength and vulnerability that makes Erica such a complex recognizable individual  and it is the very quality that Keaton captures so exquisitely in her performance. The chemistry generated between Keaton and Nicholson in this film is so glowing and palpable one wonders why no filmmaker ever saw the potential of this dynamic duo until now.In addition to these two outstanding performers the film boasts excellent supporting work from Frances McDormand as Erica's pragmatic clearheaded sister Amanda Peet as Erica's levelheaded daughter and Keanu Reeves as Harry's handsome young doctor who finds himself smitten by Erica's mature beauty and charm.'Something's Gotta Give' is that rare romantic comedy that not only acknowledges the romantic inclinations of people over forty but also recognizes the emotional complexities of their relationships. Because both Erica and Harry have been around the block a few times they bring a lifetime of baggage to their burgeoning attachment. Thus unlike in the vast majority of romantic comedies which are clearly geared to the younger generation the lovers here have a depth not often encountered when the focus is on two inexperienced neophytes. It takes the experience that comes from living to make a person interesting after all.Thanks to the quality of the writing and the performances 'Something's Gotta Give' takes its place among the great romantic comedydramas like 'Two For the Road' 'Annie Hall' 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'The American President.' That's mighty august company indeed.".

The chemistry generated between Keaton and Nicholson in this film is so glowing and palpable one wonders why no filmmaker ever saw the potential of this dynamic duo until now.In addition to these two outstanding performers the film boasts excellent supporting work from Frances McDormand as Erica's pragmatic clearheaded sister Amanda Peet as Erica's levelheaded daughter and Keanu Reeves as Harry's handsome young doctor who finds himself smitten by Erica's mature beauty and charm.'Something's Gotta Give' is that rare romantic comedy that not only acknowledges the romantic inclinations of people over forty but also recognizes the emotional complexities of their relationships. Because both Erica and Harry have been around the block a few times they bring a lifetime of baggage to their burgeoning attachment. Thus unlike in the vast majority of romantic comedies which are clearly geared to the younger generation the lovers here have a depth not often encountered when the focus is on two inexperienced neophytes. It takes the experience that comes from living to make a person interesting after all.Thanks to the quality of the writing and the performances 'Something's Gotta Give' takes its place among the great romantic comedydramas like 'Two For the Road' 'Annie Hall' 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'The American President.' That's mighty august company indeed.";

	schema:reviewBody "Romance among the AARP set in a movie is never an easy proposition pardon the pun. The participants have to be sexy enough that the younger people in the audience don't get all grossed out Gramma and Granpa are KISSING!!! With tongue!!!! but not too sexy. The audience wants to be swept off its feet but it doesn't want anything that's overly salacious.For the most part writerdirector Nancy Meyers succeeds here. Diane Keaton plays Erica Barry a neurotic highly successful playwright. Jack Nicholson plays himself. Okay technically he plays 63yearold Harry Sanborn owner of a hiphop record label and chronic womanizer.One of the funniest scenes in the movie comes right near the beginning. Harry's with his new squeeze Marin Amanda Peet at Marin's mom's house. There's Harry in his boxers and a tshirt putting wine in the 'fridge when Marin's mom  you guessed it Erica  unexpectedly comes home. Naturally she thinks he's an intruder and calls 911. I mean wouldn't you? It takes some explaining but soon the misunderstanding is cleared up and our combatants oops participants can get on with the romancin'.The thrust of the story oops another pun is that while fooling around with Marin upstairs Harry suffers a heart attack. At the hospital Dr. Mercer an interestingly cast Keanu Reeves admonishes the unrepentant Harry for overexerting himself and tells him not to travel for a little while. Yup you guessed it that means he has to bunk with Erica. And our romance is thus set up.The good news is that pairing Keaton and Nicholson who appeared together in 1982's Reds was a great great idea. Keaton basically plays a grownup Annie Hall and she manages to look sexy and daffy at the same time. Nicholson for all his bluster and creakiness still has the panache that has served him so well for the past forty years or so.The trouble is that after their relationship is consummated the two leads behave like seventh graders. Now no offense to you seventh graders out there but you do have a tendency to get melodramatic. Admit it. In this movie Erica spends  no exaggeration here  a good ten minutes sobbing. And sobbing. And sobbing. Everywhere and anywhere. Yikes and double yikes. For his part Harry broods like no one's ever brooded before like he's up for an Olympic medal in the event of Feeling Bummed Out. After a while you wish these two crazy kids would just get over it. Call her! Call him! Do something!To make matters worse for the relationship Erica writes a play based on her experiences with Harry complete with him dancing drunkenly in a hospital gown. Does this lady play hardball or what?Granted the storyline is predictable but the two leads are wonderful and very well cast. Meyers wrote the script with Keaton and Nicholson in mind specifically the decision was a wise one.Something's Gotta Give has a funny beginning and a sweet ending but the middle suffers from an unfortunate lag.".

	schema:reviewBody "The teaming of Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in Warren Beatty's Reds back in 1981 was only given a minute glimpse. The glimpse though turned out to be some of the best parts of a very excellent movie. A film with these two living legends was destined for greatness and that prediction comes to reality in writerdirector Nancy Meyers' Something's Gotta Give. Nicholson is a brash and sometimes quietly obnoxious success from New York who has made a life out of chasing 20 and 30something yearold girls. He and his newest girlfriend Amanda Peet get along really well. They decide to go out to Peet's mother's Keaton beachhouse outside of the city to consummate their relationship. Of course just as everything looks perfect Keaton a noted playwright and younger sister Frances McDormand in another wonderful turn barge in and spoil the fun. All seem a little uncomfortable and you can cut the tension between Nicholson and Keaton with a knife. Before you know it Nicholson suffers a heart attack and all hell breaks loose. He is rushed to the doctor in the nick of time but now Keaton has to nurse him back to health at her home. Nicholson's doctor a good performance by Keanu Reeves getting away from his stupid Matrix films soon falls in love with Keaton who is totally oblivious to his feelings. And before you know it Keaton's warmth smile personality heart and intelligence eventually wins Nicholson over as well. But you all know about Nicholson's relationships with women in real life and the movies. Is he ready to fall in love for the first time in his life and make a true commitment? Or will his antics end up making matters worse for all involved Keaton in particular who becomes someone you don't want to see get hurt? Something's Gotta Give is a film I really liked a lot. The oldtime Hollywood style of the 1940s is very prevalent here in a 2000s package. Nicholson and Keaton what can you say? They are arguably the two finest performers living today and they do end up feeding off each other's astronomical talents throughout. Sometimes something eventually gives in Hollywood these days but I am happy to say that it never happens with this product. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of the many things I like about going to the movies there are two experiences that always stand out more than others.  The first is going to see a film that you have soso expectations for and finding out that it is not only better than expected but very good indeed.  The second is going to see a film you have high expectations for and not being disappointed. Something's Gotta Give falls squarely into the second category.Sometimes when legendary stars are teamed up in a film the result is often less than passable.  Not so with this film thanks to a sharpwitted script and direction by Nancy Meyers two great stars in Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson who click wonderfully together on screen and an excellent supporting cast that includes Keanu Reeves Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand.  This is a romantic comedy that is funny when it's meant to be insightful when it needs to be and filled with many sincere and touching moments. Harry Sanborn Nicholson the overage playboy who has spent his entire life avoiding serious commitments is set to spend the weekend with his flavor of the moment girlfriend MarinAmanda Peet at a beach house owned by Marin's mother.  Unfortunately for Harry and Marin Marin's mother Erica BarryDiane Keaton who is a famous playwright shows up for the weekend also with her sister ZoeFrances McDormand.  Of course Erica doesn't quite know how to deal with the fact that her daughter is dating and possibly sleeping with a man of Harry's reputation and age leading to some very funny dialog between Harry Erica and Zoe that rings mounds of truth.  It's these early scenes in the film that sets the pace grabs your attention then never lets you go.  Later when beginning to get it on with Marin Harry suffers a heart attack.  Now I know having a heart attack is not supposed to be particularly funny but in this case it's some of the many many hilarious scenes that rock throughout Something's Gotta Give.  When Harry is taken to the hospital we meet Dr. Julian Mercer Keanu Reeves who happens to be a great admire of Erica's plays and quickly develops a crush on her.  Of course plot manipulations being what they are Harry ends up recuperating alone in Erica's beach house.  Everything that happens from that point on speaks volumes about love aging and especially how men and women are viewed differently as they grow older.  I can't say enough here about Diane Keaton's performance in this film.  For all the dramatic roles she has played she once again proves how truly versatile she is with this very touching yet truly comedic role.  Jack Nicholson as Harry Sanborn is equally perfect also.  He manages to take a character that we should absolutely loathe for his shallow behavior and make him not only likable but gives him depth as well.  It is perhaps his best comedic role ever.  Keanu Reeves in a less flashy role shines as the young Doctor.  We believe in his sincere admiration for Erica and he manages to pull it off by making us believe this is not just a school boy type crush. For some brief but very funny moments Frances McDormand deserves our praise also.Nancy Meyers has shown great promise as a director with the OK efforts of The Parent Trap and What Women Want.  As a writer she has had some fine moments with Irreconcilable Differences Baby Boom and Father of the Bride. With Something's Gotta Give she puts the pieces of the puzzle together for some first class entertainment.  You won't be disappointed.My Grade A".

Beach kitchen bedroom. Here it is filler to allow some very practiced actors to snap and pop to fresh timing.Comedic timing changes over time. Like music it depends on expectations based on less clever humor. So Jack today has to calibrate himself differently than even five years ago. To get the same breezy wink today he has to do something quite different to make it seem the same.This is hard to test because when you see one of his older movies what you see is what you remember  not what is really there. But he his different here. He uses his neck folds as part of his face one of the few instances I know where the elements of the instrument have actually increased in number.Watch the way he winks to himself as he talks to Diane on their way back from their first walk. He is talking to her by talking to himself at the same time that he is having another conversation with himself physically. He works harder as he gets older different than almost any celebrated actor.There are quite a few jarringly false moves here Diane's yip when his blood pressure registers good her cries when writing the obligatory leaveemsmiling ending. But there are enough well managed moments for me to expect to see much of this subconsciously quoted in future comedies  especially in the timing.Check out the syncopation among different parts of Jack's face and the words he speaks. Each of those dozen parts plays a role each one setting a beat as if each finger in a chord was playing with its relation to others in coming a tiny bit before or after differently each time. Facial comedy. Nothing like it in the world.Almost as if to underscore that this is all about faces there is only one piece of physical humor when Jack falls off Diane's bed when she returns from her date.I make a special study of folding in films. A simple fold is when a writer writes about a writer writing about the story you see. The play within overlaps the movie and in this case outside the movie since we know the director wrote it. Three women writers overlap. Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

He is talking to her by talking to himself at the same time that he is having another conversation with himself physically. He works harder as he gets older different than almost any celebrated actor.There are quite a few jarringly false moves here Diane's yip when his blood pressure registers good her cries when writing the obligatory leaveemsmiling ending. But there are enough well managed moments for me to expect to see much of this subconsciously quoted in future comedies  especially in the timing.Check out the syncopation among different parts of Jack's face and the words he speaks. Each of those dozen parts plays a role each one setting a beat as if each finger in a chord was playing with its relation to others in coming a tiny bit before or after differently each time. Facial comedy. Nothing like it in the world.Almost as if to underscore that this is all about faces there is only one piece of physical humor when Jack falls off Diane's bed when she returns from her date.I make a special study of folding in films. A simple fold is when a writer writes about a writer writing about the story you see. The play within overlaps the movie and in this case outside the movie since we know the director wrote it. Three women writers overlap. Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.";

While at her mother's beach house with Harry and her mother Erica Diane Keaton a 50 something Harry has a heart attack. He recovers in the hospital under the care of Julian Mercer Keanu Reeves a 30 somethingwho is immediately attracted to Erica. Harry wants to leave the hospitalbut the doctor will only let him go if he stays a weeks at Erica's beach house. Erica hates Harry but agrees. Naturally they become attracted to each other...but the doctor is also attracted to Erica. Sometimes hilarious and romantic complications ensue.Fantastic! A Hollywood movie celebrating middleaged romance! It was a pleasure seeing Nicholson make fun of his own image with Peet and romancing a woman close to her age. Him and Keaton play off each other wonderfully and there scenes are beautifully romantic and VERY sexyproving we DON'T need young people always going at it. Also it was very refreshing to see a younger man madly in love with Keaton. The script is sharp and funny and the movie is beautifully filmed. Nicholson is just great. He tones down his mannerisms and plays the role quietly and intelligently. Keaton is superb she HAS to get an Oscar nomination for this!. She looks greatlines and allher comic timing is as always perfect and she's so radiant and full of lifeReeves attraction makes sense! Reeves is his usual blank self no expression no acting but he actually comes across as somewhat charming in his scenes with Keaton. Peet is wasted in her small role as is Jon Farveau. But it WAS great to see Rachel Ticotin in her small but fun role as a nurse.The movie has problemsit's WAY too long there are at least 5 times I thought it was ending and I HATED the ending. I won't give it away but Keaton ended up with the wrong guy! It's a quick turn around at the end that I just couldn't swallow. That just stopped me from giving it a 10I'm giving it a 9.It's great that this movie is doing so well! A main stream movie dealing with middleaged romance and showing that it can be as exciting and romantic as with younger people. A mustsee!".

So besides this movie's wildly ludicrous ending and setting it is also not a comment on what women think or feel but what men believe they should think and feel.  So I guess with that view it's hardly surprising that a lecherous fat old man who had dated her daughter messed up her house and insulted her in her own home was Diane Keaton's pick of the heap.  I don't know where writer Nancy Meyers gets these ideas. Wouldn't it be nice to see a movie where the women ends up with a young handsome man who treats her well and adores her?  I don't see how laughing over being unable to see the time on a wrist watch without your glasses constitutes finding one's soul mate.  Was I on crack or was it Keanu's character who had seen all Diane's plays and loved her work?  Clearly Diane's work is almost biographical so isn't it actually Keanu who gets her?  And why is Diane so uncomfortable kissing a man who is 20 years younger than she but Jack has no problems having sex with a woman 40 years his junior in her mother's home.  Anyway this film is just not what I thought it would be.  It had some funny moments sure but I still left the theater feeling empty.  I certainly do not believe it is in any way a good take on romance in old age.".

	schema:reviewBody "Something's Gotta Give 2003There are two things recommending this film Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. Alone and together they are funny and alive. You might expect their individual strengths but they actually have chemistry or at least rapport on screen.The story is fun and funny and heartwarming and you kind of know what's going to happen much of the time. And you want it to so you get that confirmation and have fun watching the two be together or not as their relationship grows and changes. Director and writer Nancy Meyers is pretty straight forward hereand if she's no Nora Ephron lacking finesse and wit at that level she's got the right idea. You can picture a better film smoother and more cinematic under a different director there are some clunky visual decisions if you are looking but the story keeps it going.The rest of the cast? Mostly what you'd expect. Keanu Reeves is better than usual playing an unplayed role nicely and Frances McDormand is funny but a bit awkward here as if miscast or at odds with the director. Amanda Peet as the daughter is cheerful enough but I found her unconvincing in her role scooping up a rap record label womanizer Nicholson three times her age. It's the unlikeliness of the main matchup that makes the movie work of course and in a way they dive into their success too easily. A screwball comedy would have sustained the tension until the last scene and here they keep it in the air for about five minutes. Of course this is a standard romantic comedy and the romance figures heavily. And there are turns in the feelgood plot that make it rise above. And make it worth watching twice believe it or not at least with a few years rest. The performances are what remain sparkling and new.You might have trouble as I do every time I see this movie and it's been a few times for some reason with the last scene. It's meant to be sudden and dramatic but the previous scene doesn't quite set things up that way. Sort of but not quite and the validity of the change of heart at the end is necessary. But then of course the snow falls and Paris is beautiful and life is beautiful and we all have hope. It's a feel good movie that really works.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love a good romantic movie. However I have noticed that most of these films feature extremely young folks. Because of this the covert message is that older people are not sexual or don't really matter! It's only s REAL romance when the actors are young and hot....or so you might think. However in Something's Gotta Give you have a film featuring a woman in her 50s and a man in his 60snot the sort of romantic leads you'd expect. And it's simply a delight to watch.When the film begins Harry Jack Nicholson is out chasing after a women who is about a third his age Marin Amanda Peet. However this womanizing eternal bachelor is about to come into contact with Marin's mother Erica Diane Keaton and for the first time in his life he begins to have real feelings for a woman. Up until then it was just a long series of shallow sexual relationshipsin a sad attempt to prove his masculinity and protect himself from real intimacy. How all this works out is just something you'll have to see. Plus with nearly 400 reviews for the film it's probably not worth me repeating what others have said so many times already.The film works for me for two huge reasonthe quality of the acting and the intelligence of the script. While Erica and Harry are NOT ordinary older folks they are both wealthy and relatively famous characters they represent interesting archetypesthe strong but lonely woman and the sad guy who doesn't realize just how lonely he really is. Most importantly however the writing is so good that you believe such a relationship COULD happenand it's not simply a formulaic film and the two behave in wonderful and unexpected ways when they realize they are in love. Well worth seeing and a great date night film for any age groupbut which will probably be appreciated more by an older audience. At 50 this sort of flick is just what I was looking for!".

	onyx:emotionText "I love a good romantic movie. However I have noticed that most of these films feature extremely young folks. Because of this the covert message is that older people are not sexual or don't really matter! It's only s REAL romance when the actors are young and hot....or so you might think. However in Something's Gotta Give you have a film featuring a woman in her 50s and a man in his 60snot the sort of romantic leads you'd expect. And it's simply a delight to watch.When the film begins Harry Jack Nicholson is out chasing after a women who is about a third his age Marin Amanda Peet. However this womanizing eternal bachelor is about to come into contact with Marin's mother Erica Diane Keaton and for the first time in his life he begins to have real feelings for a woman. Up until then it was just a long series of shallow sexual relationshipsin a sad attempt to prove his masculinity and protect himself from real intimacy. How all this works out is just something you'll have to see.

The use of a stellar cast misleads unsuspecting audiences into thinking that they will be entertained challenged or enlightened by this film. Unfortunately the plodding and predictable script leads viewers deeper and deeper into despair as implausible story lines are played out to their tedious conclusion.The film does raise some important questions however. E.g. why would lovely Amanda Peet ever give nasty old Jack Nicholson the time of day? And more to the point why would Keanu Reeves' character the young brilliant and charming doctor desire carnal contact with moldy old Diane Keaton? Is this some veiled remake of Harold  Maude? Obviously there is an unresolved Oedipal complex in Keanu's character's life or perhaps in the screenwriter's. For believability if they wanted a mature female lead go to Diane Lane. She's still got it in spades. Perhaps even Annette Benning. Or maybe even Meg Ryan who should begin to accept the fact that she is beyond ingnue parts. But Diane Keaton frankly looks too old for Keanu Reeves and the impression is conveyed to the viewer that some kind of Point is being made about women's rights. Why didn't they just use Meryl Streep? At least that would've sent a clear warning out to potential male viewers fooled by the presence of Jack Nicholson into thinking there was a movie in there somewhere.At any rate Keaton is not given much to work with as the sexually insecure and frustrated donna of this soap opera. She is reduced to looking embarrassed or heartbroken most of the time. Keaton is capable of so much more complexity going all the way back to Looking for Mr. Goodbar and The Godfather. Nicholson fares little better and one is never sure whether his character is supposed to be smarmy nasty or smarmy and nasty. Amanda Peet's character is a unidimensional dbutante who being young and attractive and therefore threatening to the intended audience of menopausal middleaged women is reduced to the status of a wellintended knownothing the naive daughter who has not lived long enough to have developed a real personality. This is a sad waste of talent and the interested viewer is encouraged to look at some of Peet's meatier roles in such films as the obscure Digby Goes Down or even the ludicrous Saving Silverman.If something's gotta give it's this movie  spend an evening watching something  anything  else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Diane Keaton can't cry. In Something's Gotta Give there is a period where she has to cry in brief scene after scene and either she can't cry or the direction was very very poor I kind of think it was the latter. For me her crying symbolizes everything that was bad about this movie. In the crying scenes she just wails and wails  loudly. After awhile it is supposed to be somewhat funny I think but it's really just kind of annoying. The crying is supposed to convey that she is getting over what is hurting her and channelling it into a more productive activity. But it just feels so disingenuous because of the brazen way it is portrayed. There is a way to get crying to be sad at first and then funny see Broadcast News but this ain't it. This crying is more like Ooh look. It's Diane Keaton trying to ball her eyes out.And that's what's wrong with Something's Gotta Give. Most of the scenes feel fake and like obvious attempts to manufacture the emotions that the directorscreenwriter is trying to elicit. The very final scene and I'm not ruining anything here is the perfect example. It's basically a scene with the main characters looking cute and funny while music plays. Kodak moments to be sure but they're manufactured Kodak moments.Additionally all of the major performances disappointed me. Jack Nicholson's character is barely introduced before he has a heart attack and the story gets thrown into motion. We're supposed to believe that he's Joe Cool Sr.  hip and attractive to much younger women. We're supposed to believe that not because of how his character is developed but because...well...because he's Jack Nicholson.Diane Keaton wasn't particularly disappointing because I've never been a big fan of hers anyway. However her character never seemed to be anchored to any particular way of being. It's the film's version of character development that her character evolves from an uptight recluse to a selfactualized fullyempowered woman but to me that transition was just too easy.Amanda Peet playing Keaton's daughter gives a one note performance that while consistent with the rest of the movie relies more on her beauty than on substance to get the audience to care about her. She smiles a lot and is very definitely easy on the eyes but she's basically another pretty face. In a movie like this which suggests that Jack dates young women because he sees them as merely pretty faces it's almost criminal to not prove to the audience that Peet is anything but.Finally France McDormand in a smaller role seems to exist solely for the purpose of directly verbalizing the movie's thesis at the beginning of the movie. And we're supposed to respect her character's opinion  she's a professor. Her speech is another good example of the way this movie tries to get the message across  by telling the audience what the message is instead of showing it.Rating 310".

You may not understand what I mean by that but I'll explain.I am pretty young 15 yrs. old but mature to some my age! I love love stories. And on average now you usually see the youngbeautiful in some ppl's opinions people in love movies! And to see Diane  Jack play these roles.. and basically show that even when you are at that age how devine it is  In my opinion I think Diane is beautiful also. My point is I really enjoy seeing the older couples sometimes on screen... to know what my parents exactly go there  feel but never tell me like that. Bc that isreality and truth not just your young love we don't stay young forever lol! But yes I know there are movies that have older couples but they are usually just there. I mean on average movies most of the time excuse the fact that how much in love they still are which I adore... especially like this movie!Alright on to the movie I have read what people have been saying that Something's Gotta Give is predictable. Uhm well of course I knew how it KINDA baselined to be from trailers also. But come on how many love stories do that?? They end up falling in love.. then have troubles.. at the end get together! A LOT. But to those who are reading this right now IT IS NOT ALL PREDICTABLE!!I love Keanu Reeves in this movie! He is very sweet and truly in love.. he was just right. I actually enjoyed him the best besides Diane  Jack's love. Why you might ask? Hm.. let me just say Keanu played a better guy then Jack him being a young ladies manplayer.But all in all I really liked it! At times cus of its length it may drag a little but that is it's only faults. It has enough humorlovesweetness lol to make it a great movie!! It all depends on your tastes too I've heard from various ppl that mainly it's a married woman's type of movie. But anyone could like it I believe so at your very least... you can rent it hopefully then it'll be led to buying it DI give it a 8.510! Alaina".

He will always be a great actor in my eyes but he was wasted in this film. None of his quirky qualities oddball behaviour or intriguing Jackness were given space to shine in this hollow shell of a movie.This movie tries so hard to please the audience is racked with clichs and is quite frankly embarrassing for all involved.The crying scene is indeed embarrassing and way too over the top. The Paris sequence is so so so clich and the bridge over the river Seine ending... wow. how clich can you get?Sure some of the scenes were OK. Keanu wasn't as wooden as I've seen him in previous attempts at acting but he still gave me splinters. Somebody else said this was the performance of Keaton's career. Annie Hall anyone? Not only is AH a great performance but a great film far far far better than this one. I appreciate that the filmmaker is trying to give kudos to older people falling in love and admitting your age and not constantly chasing people over half your age but it's very heavy handed and uninteresting. Forgettable. Paint by numbers. What more can I say. Although in the movie's defense I was into it until about halfway through the film. Not thinking that it was a brilliant film but some of the comedic sequences were funny. Until it fell on its face. Then the film fell to bits.. and yes seemed to never end.ever.but then it did.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Nancy Meyers in her third effort SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE cements her place in a sisterhood of gifted directors Penny Marshall Nora Ephron Elaine May who truly understand men and can create a 'chick flick' that doesn't caricature our endangered species! Her previous effort WHAT WOMEN WANT not only gave Mel Gibson the most 'wellrounded' comic role of his career but revealed a talent in song and dance that Gibson had never previously demonstrated with the revival of musicals one can only hope that Mel will get a shot at displaying those talents again.With SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE Meyers turns her magic to 66year old screen legend Jack Nicholson creating a character that more fully exhibits and explores his famous persona than any other film Smilin' Jack has ever made...and even takes him to task occasionally!Even more impressively she gives Diane Keaton at 57 her finest screen role in years and reminds audiences that actresses don't HAVE to be under 30 to be desirable with a character who is wise funny vulnerable and...dare I say it...still enormously sexy!The story involves a planned weekend tryst between a young Christie's broker Amanda Peet in another of her recent 'starmaking' roles and famous record producer Harry Sanborn Nicholson a wisecracking worldly Lothario in sunglasses famous for never dating a woman under 35. At her mother's empty beach house their liaison is interrupted by the arrival of her mom playwright Erica Barry Keaton and her aunt Frances McDormand who is fabulous firing 'robbing the cradle' oneliners back and forth with Nicholson. Despite a tacit agreement to share the house Harry is so stressed that he has a heart attack during foreplay saved only by Erica's reluctant CPR. At the hospital she meets handsome surgeon Keanu Reeves who is a fan of her work and is immediately smitten by her.Ordered by Reeves to recuperate at Barry's home Sanborn gets to accidentally see her naked and gradually discovers the infinite pleasures of 'older' women while Barry resigned to being alone rediscovers her sexuality and ability to love. Unfortunately 'love' is NOT a word in Sanborn's vocabulary and confused by his emotions he returns to his party life in New York.Devastated by his departure she begins an affair with the young doctor and turns Sanborn's visit into the basis of a play with her achieving 'closure' by killing his character off!

	onyx:emotionText "Director Nancy Meyers in her third effort SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE cements her place in a sisterhood of gifted directors Penny Marshall Nora Ephron Elaine May who truly understand men and can create a 'chick flick' that doesn't caricature our endangered species! Her previous effort WHAT WOMEN WANT not only gave Mel Gibson the most 'wellrounded' comic role of his career but revealed a talent in song and dance that Gibson had never previously demonstrated with the revival of musicals one can only hope that Mel will get a shot at displaying those talents again.With SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE Meyers turns her magic to 66year old screen legend Jack Nicholson creating a character that more fully exhibits and explores his famous persona than any other film Smilin' Jack has ever made...and even takes him to task occasionally!Even more impressively she gives Diane Keaton at 57 her finest screen role in years and reminds audiences that actresses don't HAVE to be under 30 to be desirable with a character who is wise funny vulnerable and...dare I say it...still enormously sexy!The story involves a planned weekend tryst between a young Christie's broker Amanda Peet in another of her recent 'starmaking' roles and famous record producer Harry Sanborn Nicholson a wisecracking worldly Lothario in sunglasses famous for never dating a woman under 35. At her mother's empty beach house their liaison is interrupted by the arrival of her mom playwright Erica Barry Keaton and her aunt Frances McDormand who is fabulous firing 'robbing the cradle' oneliners back and forth with Nicholson. Despite a tacit agreement to share the house Harry is so stressed that he has a heart attack during foreplay saved only by Erica's reluctant CPR. At the hospital she meets handsome surgeon Keanu Reeves who is a fan of her work and is immediately smitten by her.Ordered by Reeves to recuperate at Barry's home Sanborn gets to accidentally see her naked and gradually discovers the infinite pleasures of 'older' women while Barry resigned to being alone rediscovers her sexuality and ability to love. Unfortunately 'love' is NOT a word in Sanborn's vocabulary and confused by his emotions he returns to his party life in New York.Devastated by his departure she begins an affair with the young doctor and turns Sanborn's visit into the basis of a play with her achieving 'closure' by killing his character off! Her actions put Sanborn BACK into the hospital again TWICE before he realizes the full impact she has had on him...Can Sanborn learn from his mistakes? Will Sanborn and Barry find happiness together? Will the pair make the Paris rendezvous they planned when in the heat of passion? Can Barry give up her turtlenecks and Sanborn his Viagra?Full of witty observations about facing life after 50 with menopause presented for once in a favorable light SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is a wise funny testament about 'growing up' without 'growing old' underscored by classic French tunes the French after all understand the ageless nature of love far better than more 'youthdriven' Americans.While the film won't have you yearning for your 'golden years' it may help some 'over50' viewers feel less depressed about no longer being 35!If for that alone Nancy Myers deserves a Valentine!";

Add to this the fact that his lyrics were often censored for film radio and records and it seems very odd that 1940s Hollywood would attempt a biography. What they did of course was fictionalize it to the max reducing the story of his life to a mix of backstage musical and domestic dramaand transforming the tiny and waspish Porter and his icy bride Linda into handsome Cary Grant and lovely Alexis Smith. The result is pure nonsense of course but when you tack in a host of Porter classicsfantasy it might be but it is entertaining enough to watch.Grant is no singer but he has considerable charm and Smith is as always extremely attractive. The supporting cast is remarkably strong featuring the likes of Jane Wyman Eve Arden Dorothy Malone and Alan Haleand rare screen appearances by Monty Woolley and Mary Martin who deliver knockout performances of Miss Otis Regrets and My Heart Belongs To Daddy respectively.

Or maybe it's the youthful Alexis Smith as a perfect Mrs. Porter coping with challenges as a famous songwriter's spouse. Certainly Monty Woolley is amusing as himself playing a role he reportedly lived with the reallife composer. Then there's that honeycoated contralto Ginny Simms looking gorgeous in Technicolor and beautifully singing some of Porter's most expressive music and lyrics. In the supporting cast is a sprighty Jane Wyman before she became laden with heavy dramatic roles doing several comicsinging turns and even a surprise bit from Eve Arden as a French cabaret star Gabrielle performing an early lesserknown show number. The screen has only one bio of this outstanding American songwriter one who is respected by both popular and serious composerpeers as well as by the critics and general public alike. Surely the scripters did a job on Porter's factual life yet at least we have this elaborate effort with a gungho cast that's ready  willing to give it their all. They all look like they're having a great time and I for one have fun with them. Until a better Porter bio comes along this one will have to do.".

Although nicely shot in Technicolor the print is just a shade pastel and looks better with the TV's color cranked up just a little bit. The movie starts in 1914 with Porter at Yale and already writing songs even though he was a law student. However at Christmas break after he told his mother that he wasn't going back he was going to focus on writing music instead 'Oh I could be a lawyer but not a very good one. When I look at a lawbook I think of a song. When I read a legal case I hear a melody.' Like almost any biographical movie certain parts are fictionalized and many things have to be left out. But this movie gives us the pleasure of many Cole Porter classics and a glimpse into the man behind the songs. A good movie for anyone who is a fan of Porter's or American musical history in general.Cary Grant was 4142 when this was filmed so it is a bit of a stretch imagining him in the beginning as a college student. This movie came out the same year 1946 as 'Notorious' and one year before one of my favorite Cary Grant movies where he plays an angel in 'The Bishop's Wife 1947.'".

Though Cole Porter himself said that there was little reality in it his professional career was featured here in a most winning fashion with both negative and positive elements of it featured fairly. It is appropriate that the film concentrated upon the career rather than the seedier side of the protagonist's private life. It is all too common these days to have to suffer through presumptuous exposs of the mostprivate affairs of famous people who are no longer with us. At least this film was produced while its subject was alive. The Irwin Winkler remake or retelling Delovely was nothing but an outrageous shallow outing that concentrated on negativity while subjecting us to the most boring flaccid dialogue everironic I think for a story about one of the most clever American lyricists of the twentieth century! The 2004 outing starring Kevin Kline also featured some hideous modern renditions of Cole Porter's music that did no justice to the genius of the composer. Movies can accentuate the positive while minimizing the negative and still have value. This is one of the most visually appealing films I have ever seen but it has moments of disturbing realism as well as glamor. The rigors of life as a prolific artist as well as the trials of an artist's spouse are portrayed with an adequate degree of grim reality. It does not so much ignore the homosexual activities of the subject as it does allude to them very delicately and that is all that is required if one has good taste and an active imagination. I'll take an original over a remake any day and this production costarring the hilarious Monty Woolley and the lovely Alexis Smith as Linda Lee Porter is a good example of that preference.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen DE LOVELY the new musical biopic about Cole Porter's life  the movie trailer convinced me it would be as terrible as the reviews say it is. But Stephen Holden's pan in the N.Y. Times caused me to want to see NIGHT AND DAY again since he thought that for all its fraudulence it caught something right about Porter's life and times. Having seen it recently for the first time since childhood I can see what he meant. Evidently everything in it is a lie. Okay. Standard for Hollywood biopics.The more important thing it gets wrong is the music which for the most part is not handled well. In this period Warner Bros. did not have talented singerdancers under contract and it shows here. Ginny Simms is an accomplished if mechanical singer Jane Wyman a passable one but neither dances and neither dazzles. Mary Martin had talent and charm but not the looks nor the sparkle to come across well on film. When dancing is called for we get dull pretentious ballroomacrobatic routines from anonymous performers. This film needed the kind of musical talent MGM had under contract and that lack of talent and zip makes for a musically mediocre film despite the fantastic Porter song catalog.What the film got weirdly right was the casting of Cary Grant because either by his choice or director Michael Curtiz's design Grant's withholding enigmatic performance is intriguing and does most of the work of spelling out 'the gay thing' for audiences in the know then and now. DE LOVELY may well be frank about the fact that Porter was gay but gay audiences would have gotten the point in NIGHT AND DAY anyway. Lovely elegant chilly Alexis Smith does all the pursuing in the film as do the other women and yet Cole is charmingly evasive with all of them. They want him  who wouldn't want to sleep with Cary Grant at the peak of his beauty?  but he doesn't seem to care about anything but his music. Hmmmm. Where have we heard that before? Even when LindaAlexis lands him he's never really hers he always seems to have his mind and heart elsewhere. There is absolutely no suggestion anywhere in this film that there was intense passion emotion or love on his side of this relationship which is unusual in this period. Rather their marriage seems to be a companionable one of mutual respect which was apparently the case in real life. When LindaAlexis gets fed up with being neglected in favor of Cole's work we can also imagine that an endless supply of bellmen sailors and chorus boys may have had something to do with it as well. The movie can't say this but it leaves enough space and question marks for the audience to fill in the blanks. And we do.Even at the end with Porter being honored back at Yale with the all male glee club singing the glorious Night and Day and Linda walks in and she and Cole meet again on the brick patio in the moonlight Grant doesn't kiss her except for a chaste peck on the cheek. Once again as throughout the film he is the passive object of her desire and he hardly seems to care. This performance as much as his work in the excellent NOTORIOUS suggests the coldness and misogyny that sometimes lurk in his screen persona. It's explicit in SUSPICION and NOTORIOUS Hitchcock was exploring it there but it's actually implicit in NIGHT AND DAY in every closeup where Grant looks simultaneously gorgeous and conflicted. How hard it must have been to be this beautiful and this uneasy about it.I concur with those here who find the print currently on view on TCM as subpar. A new DVD is out on NIGHT AND DAY and TCM would do well to show this in future. Meanwhile feel free to check this picture out to see an example of screenwriters a director and a star who work hard to suggest what they cannot actually say.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike film biographies of George Gershwin Jerome Kern and Sigmund Romberg or for that matter RodgersHart those artists were gone by the time the silver screen told their stories. But Cole Porter was very much still with us when Night and Day was released in 1946 and some of his best work was yet to come.If Cole Porter had his druthers Cary Grant would never have played the part of himself. Porter fancied himself as more the Fred Astaire type. But given the nature of what happened to Porter in his life a dancing Cole Porter was out of the question.There's not too much that's accurate in this film. Cole Porter was born and raised in Indiana in affluent surroundings. Yes he went to Yale and his best and lifelong friend that he acquired from Yale was Monty Woolley. Yes he did marry the older and glamorous Linda Lee Thomas. And yes he composed some of the most beautiful and sophisticated songs ever done.Of course his marriage to Linda Lee was a sham. In the vernacular of the time Linda served as his beard his cover as it were because Cole Porter was gay. As was his lifelong friend Monty Woolley.Were they ever involved with each other. Maybe as youths but from what I've heard their tastes were different. Porter liked his male partners as sophisticated as he was and as beautiful as his songs were. Monty on the other hand was known for picking up street kids from Maine to California until he died.One thing that was true although glamorized for the film Porter did serve in the French army during World War I. No wounds however no hearing of African rhythms from Senegalese troops were he got the idea for Night and Day.Night and Day sure jumbles up even the order of his shows. Porter was writing songs from before Yale but he did not score a commercial musical comedy hit until the show Paris in 1928 where the song Let's Do It was featured. I sure didn't know that In the Still of the Night was originally done as a Christmas Carol way back in his youth for instance.In fact Where the Still of the Night along with I've Got You Under My Skin Rosalie and Easy to Love were all written for MGM musicals. You can take it to the bank that Louis B. Mayer soaked Jack Warner for plenty to get those songs heard in a Warner Brothers film. Similarly the title song Night and Day heard in The Gay Divorce on Broadway first made its screen debut in RKO's The Gay Divorce. Jack Warner must have paid RKO plenty for that one also.The other true thing is the fall from a horse that Porter suffered in the late thirties the constant pain he was in all of his life. It took 28 operations to save his legs back in the thirties. In 1958 long after the story in the film ended Porter did eventually lose a leg and from then on lived as a recluse in his suite at the Waldorf Towers. Linda Lee Thomas Porter had passed away about a decade before.Alexis Smith plays Linda Lee here and the cast of Night and Day also includes Jane Wyman Dorothy Malone Selena Royle Tom D'Andrea Henry Stephenson Donald Woods. Playing themselves are Mary Martin and Monty Woolley. Singer Ginny Simms of the Kay Kyser band sang many of the Porter tunes for the film.Night and Day certainly captures Porter's sophistication. Of course the gay lifestyle and a pretty hedonistic one at that which Porter led would not be shown at all back in the days of the Code. Some might complain about that pleasure driven pursuit that Porter had his whole life. If he sought beauty and pleasure in the world Cole Porter certainly gave enough of it back to the world to justify it.After Night and Day Cole Porter had still yet to write such film scores as The Pirate High Society and Les Girls and such Broadway shows as Kiss Me Kate Out of this Wolrd CanCan and Silk Stockings. You could score a film with just the material he had yet to write. It's not a great biographical film but Night and Day provides as good an excuse as any to listen and appreciate the art that was Cole Porter.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Cole Porter were to be shown in any film accurately you need a Don Knotts type with a bit more polish. Unlike his friend and rival Irving Berlin who did not mind showing up in one movie as himself THIS IS THE ARMY Porter had this image as a sophisticate that physically he fit if you recall that not all sophisticates look like Fred Astaire or other Hollywood types. As a matter of face if Porter did not look physically like Astaire an old friend or Cary Grant he also did not look like Kevin Kline in the interesting recent film DELOVELY which opened up more about Porter's homosexuality and his codependent relationship with his wife Linda.That said Porter is on record as having loved the musical film NIGHT AND DAY. When his friends pointed out all the errors he brushed them aside with the comment that any film where Cary Grant portrayed him had to be good. No fool our Cole.Although it gives the barest outline of Porter's career and makes some whopping errors it does give a basis for further study into his life for anyone interested in the most sophisticated American song writer of the period from 1928  1958. His music was not as remarkable as George Gershwin but George required brother Ira to do his lyrics as much as Richard Rodgers required Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein or Jerome Kern needed Hammerstein or Frederick Loewe needed Allan J. Lerner. Only Berlin and Porter did words and music solo Rodgers would do one musical by himself  NO STRINGS  after Hammerstein died.He was born in Peru Indiana his grandfather being a multimillionaire in the lumber trade who wanted him to be a lawyer and sent him to Yale for that reason. His years in Yale were pleasant and even artistically sound. He composed Eli Eli Yale and We Are Poor Little Lambs which are still sung by their glee clubs. We Are Poor Little Lambs is a rare exception in Berlin's career of total song writer. He retouched the original lyrics which are from the BARRACK ROOM BALLAD Gentleman Rankers by Rudyard Kipling. Kipling by the way was not too thrilled about it.After service in World War I as said on another comment he was not wounded Porter began trying to break into Broadway. Oddly enough his first serious work was in 1921 when he did a musical satire about American life from the point of an immigrant. But the musical did not succeed and the music is now lost. He spent the rest of the decade only composing music for friends on the Riviera yes his was a very hard life. It was not until 1928 that he began to try his hand on Broadway and remained for three decades.By now he was also married to Linda Alexis Smith in the film who appreciated his personality and wit and his talent. It appears to have been what is called a white marriage where they stuck it out loyally together from mutual respect and affection but not sex  each went separately there but always returned to each other.This of course is not in the film. But the 1938 horse riding accident is in it  which left him in actually constant pain for the rest of his life. For a pampered sybarite Porter was quite a brave man.The parts about this film that enable one to enjoy it are such musical bits as Mary Martin returning to do the Siberian Railroad Sequence from a musical that she introduced My Heart Belongs to Daddy or the dramatic moments like the death of grandfather Henry Stephenson. Grant and Smith are smashingly good as Cole and Linda at least as Cole liked the public to think of them. And Monty Wooley does his best playing his charming and straight talking self note how he uses the same speech to sell Cole's Broadway shows to potential backers and producers. For a film that one knows is not true as a biography it remains the best fictional biography of a popular composer made in Hollywood in the Golden Age of film making.".

No fool our Cole.Although it gives the barest outline of Porter's career and makes some whopping errors it does give a basis for further study into his life for anyone interested in the most sophisticated American song writer of the period from 1928  1958. His music was not as remarkable as George Gershwin but George required brother Ira to do his lyrics as much as Richard Rodgers required Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein or Jerome Kern needed Hammerstein or Frederick Loewe needed Allan J. Lerner. Only Berlin and Porter did words and music solo Rodgers would do one musical by himself  NO STRINGS  after Hammerstein died.He was born in Peru Indiana his grandfather being a multimillionaire in the lumber trade who wanted him to be a lawyer and sent him to Yale for that reason. His years in Yale were pleasant and even artistically sound. He composed Eli Eli Yale and We Are Poor Little Lambs which are still sung by their glee clubs. We Are Poor Little Lambs is a rare exception in Berlin's career of total song writer. He retouched the original lyrics which are from the BARRACK ROOM BALLAD Gentleman Rankers by Rudyard Kipling. Kipling by the way was not too thrilled about it.After service in World War I as said on another comment he was not wounded Porter began trying to break into Broadway. Oddly enough his first serious work was in 1921 when he did a musical satire about American life from the point of an immigrant. But the musical did not succeed and the music is now lost. He spent the rest of the decade only composing music for friends on the Riviera yes his was a very hard life. It was not until 1928 that he began to try his hand on Broadway and remained for three decades.By now he was also married to Linda Alexis Smith in the film who appreciated his personality and wit and his talent. It appears to have been what is called a white marriage where they stuck it out loyally together from mutual respect and affection but not sex  each went separately there but always returned to each other.This of course is not in the film. But the 1938 horse riding accident is in it  which left him in actually constant pain for the rest of his life. For a pampered sybarite Porter was quite a brave man.The parts about this film that enable one to enjoy it are such musical bits as Mary Martin returning to do the Siberian Railroad Sequence from a musical that she introduced My Heart Belongs to Daddy or the dramatic moments like the death of grandfather Henry Stephenson. Grant and Smith are smashingly good as Cole and Linda at least as Cole liked the public to think of them. And Monty Wooley does his best playing his charming and straight talking self note how he uses the same speech to sell Cole's Broadway shows to potential backers and producers. For a film that one knows is not true as a biography it remains the best fictional biography of a popular composer made in Hollywood in the Golden Age of film making.";

	schema:headline " How Biographical is this really?";
	schema:reviewBody "As an 'avid rabid' fan of Archie Leech aka Cary Grant my favourite films of his are his rather silly films where he used his famous English Rhyming Slang and other witticisms For example His Girl Friday Operation Petticoat or The Philadelphia Story  But there were a few films Cary Grant starred in that were more serious roles Which Hollywood demanded of him unfortunately as he was better as a witty loudmouth. But the ladies I suppose loved this guy and so how can a film about Cole Porter which starred Archibald Grant give us anything but a fictional romanticized image of Cole Porter? That is what we are given here.In the beginning of the film there are certain things that beg the question DID this happen this way? I find myself asking Did he really do this or Did this really happen? We see that in the film he writes the song Night and Day while he was recovering from a war injury and that he mostly was inspired by his wife Linda. At this point I had to start asking questions The film takes the song Night and Day and frames it around Alexis Smith who is actually absolutely lovely... She filmed rather well in this Technicolor just made her utterly ravishing.This film uses the life of Cole Porter as a platform for Archibald Leech to be as charming as he ever is. If we remove the fact that this film is allegedly about Cole Porter a real person and imagine that it is just a fiction story... Well then the film succeeds as a story and a romantic story which normally give me the jitters. But this film does not it is not really ah Mushy And as a matter of fact Grant tones down his sensuality a bit which is actually fitting for the person he is playing. In 1946 it was utterly impossible to deal with the fact that Porter was in fact gay and that his marriage was a marriage of convenience. But I did not know this at all until I looked here today.There are some actual real autobiographical things in this film Porter DID write songs for Yale and especially about that Dog mascot. And of course he wrote the songs that he wrote. As for how and why he wrote them I think that this is fictionalised. It is only the fact that Cary Grant is playing the part of Porter that we can accept the fictionalisation but only as an enjoyable story.Now in fact the song Night and Day was part of The Gay Divorce which when finally put to film with Astaire and Rodgers all Porter songs except Night and day were removed from the soundtrack And after seeing this film I think that was probably a kick in the teeth to Porter. And a bigger kick in the mouth was the song The Continental which is basically an inferior song actually WON an academy award. But it was not so much the song The Continental that won it but the camerawork the dancing and the set. And of course The Continental was set in the film The Gay Divorce as the big musical number of the film. I wonder if they had used whatever song Porter had written for that part of the show and given it the treatment that they gave The Continental  I believe it would have won the award.Because after seeing this quaint film  And hearing the wonderful songs Porter has written I consider that he was one of the great songwriters of the 20th century. So the biographical aspects of this movie fall way short of accuracy but that does not affect the enjoyment of watching a well directed film and a musical at that with Cary Grant and a lot of other very good actors including Jane Wyman a very smartlooking Ginny Simms many very good specialty dancers and of course Introducing Mary Martin even though it was a small part.Now someone elsewhere thought it was an oddly cast film especially having Archie in a Musical... He is not a singer really. Other comments were that Grant did not resemble Porter at all in lifestyle OR looks.I don't know if any of this bothered the real Cole Porter who appears to have had something to do with this film but it does not really bother me that much. I agree with the strangeness of the cast but in this case it works for the film not against it. So well mostly cos I enjoy films with Cary GrantArchie Leech in them I'll rate this a 10 but not out of generosity I think the film if I can break it down1 Looks good the film stock is great the colour is very good.2 Sounds good Very enjoyable The music sounds very good the dialogue is nice and clear and does not have that Canny sound of studio echo. The orchestrations are very clear.3 Well directed and acted.So I do not know what else to say about this Other than I just watched this I actually like it a lot and I'll watch it again next time I get a chance And as I do not like musicals that much at all this is the highest compliment I can give and my Hat goes off to all the people who had a hand in the production those that are still living and those who are not and of course my hat is forever off to Cole Porter This film makes me very interested in his literal biography.".

	schema:headline " Fictionalized Bio of Cole Porter with a Fine Cast and Good Production Numbers";
	schema:reviewBody "There are perhaps two things that set Night and Day apart from most musicals for me. One is the realistic way in which characters talk to and relate with one another the writers have made their motivations very clear at all points. Then there is Michael Curtiz's sensitive and innovative camerawork. In my opinion he brings out the story very strongly in appropriate and elaborate settings. Writing credit goes to Charles Hoffman Leo Townsend and William Bowers who used material from the life of Cole Porter adapted by Jack Moffitt the result is perhaps very poor biography but a very good thinking man's musical about an uncompromising composer. Jack Warner and line producer Arthur Schwarz deserve credit seeing the potential in this for this intelligent film. Difficult cinematography by Peverell Marley and William V. Skall award level Art Direction by John Hughes extraordinarily successful set decorations by Armor Marlowe and costume designs by Travilla and wardrobe by Milo Anderson only increase the believability and effectiveness of the film's colorful scenes. A comparison of this more realistic film to a similar An American in Paris is deserved and perhaps enlightening. Boy strives for art career boy avoids temptation of woman trying too hard to help boy wins girl after professional success and some troubles there's nothing new in this perhaps but the large and talented cast I say plays the story as if it had just been invented. Familiar faces such as Alan Hale Tom D'Andrea Selena Royle Eve Arden Henry Stephenson Sig Ruman Victor France Paul Cavanagh Herman Bing and Nick Stewart appear and disappear but every one adds a jewel to the film's rich design in the form of a scene wellacted. Only Donald Woods and Dorothy Malone among the supporting players continue throughout the film. Monty Wooley has one of his best Hollywood parts here as himself while Alexis Smith makes a marvel out of her part as the long suffering fiance. Cary Grant tries hard and brings an earnestness to his Cole Porter that is finally surprisingly effective. Jane Wyman is very attractive and wellcast Ginny Simms has four numbers all inimitably sung and shows talent as a romantic comedic and character actressnone of capabilities which moguls ever let her do much of anywhere else. Mary Martin has single number My Heart Belongs to Daddy and does well as both actress and singer. Other highlights of this long wellpaced dramatic musical include Monty Wolley's Miss Otis Regrets Begin the Beguine presented as a tropical extravaganza several fine versions of Night and Day and a dozen other songs that are familiar and given intelligent staging. Leroy Prinz's choreography is spot on as period work for the 1930s featuring many arm movements intricate turns. A scene in a New York music shop is for me one of the best scenes in the film for dialogue camera angles acting and Ginny Simms' rendition of What is This Thing Called Love. Other songs featured in the film include In the Still of the Night Let's Do It You're the Top You Do Something to me' I've Got You Under My Sin Don't Fence Me In Rosalie Anything Goes Just One of Those Things and I Get a Kick Out of You. This is a fine winter movie one of the best musicals of all. ".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is enjoyable for the music though the facts of Porter's life are fictionalized heavily. For one thing though Porter is shown as something of a ladies man he was actually gay. Knowing the moral climate of the time 1946 it is understandable that they would downplay this aspect of his life. While this doesn't spoil the picture it does take away a little of the believability. According to legend Porter actually requested that Cary Grant play him in the movie. Grant seems somewhat preoccupied and his acting is not up to his usual standard.

For one thing though Porter is shown as something of a ladies man he was actually gay. Knowing the moral climate of the time 1946 it is understandable that they would downplay this aspect of his life. While this doesn't spoil the picture it does take away a little of the believability. According to legend Porter actually requested that Cary Grant play him in the movie. Grant seems somewhat preoccupied and his acting is not up to his usual standard. Jane Wyman turns out to be a very good singer and a decent dancer but the highlights are provided by Ginny Simms and Mary Martin.

Alexis Smith plays his wife Linda Monty Woolley plays his best friend as he was in real life and performers include Ginny Simms Jane Wyman Mary Martin and Eve Arden.Most of this biography is pure fiction except for a few details. Porter was indeed injured while riding and endured something like 30 operations. I don't believe he and Linda ever separated and by all accounts were quite devoted despite Porter's same sex dalliances. His family did want him to be a lawyer and he did drop out of law school. He apparently did serve in the French Foreign Legion during World War I.However the important part of this movie is Porter's gorgeous music which shines throughout. Certainly he wrote some of the most beautiful music and lyrics ever including the title song I Get a Kick Out of You Begin the Beguine Let's Face the Music and Dance and countless others.This is an unusual film for Cary Grant. It calls on his class and sophistication but not the humor he brought to a role. He looks very handsome and is very convincing with the piano fingerings. He does a little singing surprisingly and his voice was pleasant with a fast tremelo. Alexis Smith is stunningly beautiful and elegant as Linda. Both roles are somewhat wooden just a backdrop really for the singing and dancing.Night and Day doesn't have a great script but it's definitely worth seeing for the music and musical performances particularly by the silkyvoiced Ginny Simms Mary Martin doing her breakout number My Heart Belongs to Daddy and Eve Arden as a French entertainer.".

Mary Martin plays herself with a great performance in a small role. The colors are brilliant in the sets and costumes. I see this production as an excellent example of the modern musical film.

Given my musical background I figured that Night and Day a biographical film of one of the world's favorite composerssongwriters Cole Porter would be my personal favorite of the five instead it turned out to be the film I liked the least. True it has the look of a multimilliondollar Technicolor production featuring many favorite Cole Porter standards such as I Get a Kick Out of You What Is This Thing Called Love? Just One of Those Things I've Got You Under My Skin and of course Night and Day. But there are a few major flaws with this movie. Most notably the various prolonged lavish production numbers cause this twohour picture to drag considerably. Plus it is my understanding that the events in this pictorial biography of Cole Porter could hardly be deemed accurate. To top it off Cary Grant one of my favorite actors was a curious choice to play the role of the great composer. Question is does he indeed FIT that role? Hard for me to tell but he at least plays the part with his usual charm and suavity. The story of Cole Porter as depicted in this movie traces through his final year at Yale as he neglects his law studies to the consternation of his grandfather his early struggles as a composer including a show that closed after one performance because of the sinking of the Lusitania his getting wounded in action during the First World War while writing his popular Begin the Beguine his writing of Night and Day in seclusion influenced by rain and a grandfather clock while being nursed by the woman who would eventually become his wife Linda Lee Alexis Smith his eventual successes with show after show after show to the detriment of his marriage his losing the use of both legs from a fall off a horse and his valedictory performance back at Yale.Despite the film's weaknesses Night and Day contains quite a few memorable scenes all of them musical. Cole's close friend Yale law professor Monty Woolley playing himself summons Cole from playing piano in a theatrical show to rush back to the Yale campus and lead the singing of his Bulldog Song at a football rally. At a rehearsal hall owned by the pompous Wilowski Sig Ruman Cole and his friend Gracie Jane Wyman perform a swinging arrangement of Cole's Let's Do It Let's Fall in Love. The French star Gabrielle a flashy role for Eve Arden sings Cole's I'm Unlucky at Gambling not much of a hit but I think it's a catchy tune. One of the more humorous scenes in the picture involves Monty singingreciting Cole's Miss Otis Regrets for a couple of theatrical producers one of them played by Alan Hale. At a sheet music store Cole and his friend Carole Ginny Simms perform What Is This Thing Called Love? which generates quite an auspicious response from the customers. Cary Grant actually lends his own voice to Cole's singingplaying of his You're the Top with Carole. And finally when Cole returns to Yale to perform a most beautiful rendition of Night and Day with an orchestra and a male choir he is quite surprised to see Linda in the audience after a lengthy separation Cary Grant again lends his own voice to the very soft You you you lyric during the introductory verse and before the piece ends Cole and Linda step outside and without a word spoken embrace.".

The film has been considerably sanitized and whitewashed even beyond the norm that Hollywood was used to at the time. It is not surprising that no mention of Porter's homosexuality is made but it is truly offensive that the filmmakers have the audacity to depict Porter as a wounded war veteran when he was never even in the military! It is almost as if director Michael Curtis and his team of writers have constructed a generic showbiz picture and grafted Porter's name and songs onto it as a marketing point.The film should still have the potential to work as a fictionalized biography however if it was wellexecuted on its own terms but for the most part it is not. The benign nature of the screenplay seems to confuse most of the actors and the majority of the cast often seem indifferent or confused by the gutted characters they are portraying. Not unexpectedly the film's biggest asset is Cary Grant who is a somewhat surprisingly adept choice to play the film's idealized version of Porter. Grant's immense talent and innate charisma can go a long way to salvage even some of the worst films but he is given so little to work with here that he eventually disappears into the bland void with everything else.Even the music  the one thing that could have saved the film  is handled badly with too many songs performed in generic arrangements and sung by tone deaf actors. Sadly Monty Woolley playing himself is the worst offender in this regard although Ginny Simms also sings far too many songs in an atrocious fauxopera style that really grates my nerves. Inexplicably even when a number sonically works as in Mary Martin's fabled rendition of My Heart Belongs to Daddy the staging and editing often undermine it. Nearly all of the musical numbers are flatly filmed with garish costumes and set design and further hampered with awkward choreography.Of note this was Cary Grant's first film to be shot in Technicolor and the actor photographed just as beautifully in color if not more so than he had in blackandwhite not all early movie stars would be so lucky. The film also has very impressive production values that strongly invoke the proper time and period. I wish that such time and attention were still lavished upon films today. Actually I wish such time and attention had been lavished upon a better film in 1946!".

	schema:reviewBody "Now I haven't seen that many Robin Hood movies at all actually I've only seen two the superior animated Disney version and Kevin Costner's rather boring Prince of Thieves but that isn't even necessary to notice this is a pretty good and unjustly obscure version about the legendary English folklore hero. This is the first of at least three Robin Hood movies produced by the awesome Hammer Studios  coincidentally also their very first film in color  and I'm ready to check them all out if they're as entertaining as The Men of Sherwood Forest. The story is fastpaced full of ecstatic characters and vivid adventure and steadily directed by the ever reliable Val Guest. He can pretty much be considered as Hammer's second best director right behind Terence Fisher who incidentally also directed one of the other Hammer Robin Hood flicks namely Swords of Sherwood Forest starring Peter Cushing and Oliver Reed. This earlier and obviously lowbudgeted gem doesn't tell the conventional Robin Hood fable but an entirely new one that hardly involves any looting corrupt Sheriffs of Nottingham or Maid Marians. Robin and his loyal gang including Little John and Friar Tuck learn that the one true king of England  Richard Lionheart  will soon return home after being in prisoner in Germany. Eminent accomplices of his malignant brother Prince John intend to assassinate King Richard on his way home and put the blame on Robin Hood and his gang but naturally the jolly hero in green is always several steps ahead of them. Don Taylor is really excellent in the role of Robin Hood. He's the ideally handsome charismatic and heroic performer you'd expect. Taylor retired from acting in the mid 60's already but became a respectable director and made some really cool genre films like The Island of Dr. Moreau Damien The Omen II and Escape from the Planet of the Apes. The one person to steal the show completely is Reginald Beckwith as Friar Tuck. He escapes from every perilous situation by luring his opponents into various sorts of gambling schemes. Undemanding lightheaded 50's entertainment for the whole family.".

	onyx:emotionText "Now I haven't seen that many Robin Hood movies at all actually I've only seen two the superior animated Disney version and Kevin Costner's rather boring Prince of Thieves but that isn't even necessary to notice this is a pretty good and unjustly obscure version about the legendary English folklore hero. This is the first of at least three Robin Hood movies produced by the awesome Hammer Studios  coincidentally also their very first film in color  and I'm ready to check them all out if they're as entertaining as The Men of Sherwood Forest. The story is fastpaced full of ecstatic characters and vivid adventure and steadily directed by the ever reliable Val Guest. He can pretty much be considered as Hammer's second best director right behind Terence Fisher who incidentally also directed one of the other Hammer Robin Hood flicks namely Swords of Sherwood Forest starring Peter Cushing and Oliver Reed. This earlier and obviously lowbudgeted gem doesn't tell the conventional Robin Hood fable but an entirely new one that hardly involves any looting corrupt Sheriffs of Nottingham or Maid Marians. Robin and his loyal gang including Little John and Friar Tuck learn that the one true king of England  Richard Lionheart  will soon return home after being in prisoner in Germany. Eminent accomplices of his malignant brother Prince John intend to assassinate King Richard on his way home and put the blame on Robin Hood and his gang but naturally the jolly hero in green is always several steps ahead of them.

Since I received it I found that the overall theme of the movie is learning to love someone else more than yourself. Yes there are elements of two cultures colliding and that's not just the Mexican American culture colliding with the WASPs but also a strong theme of east coast versus west coast but that simply allows the showcasing of some of the best and funniest aspects of each.In the end it is the strong performances by Salma Hayek and Matthew Perry that make the movie so special. The scene where Salma is going to go to the bathroom and Matthew leaves and is brought back by Salma with her underwear down around her knees is particularly delightful. I laughed so hard at the scene where Matthew is brought home full of cactus and says Lucy you've got some explaining to do that my wife came in to see if I had hurt myself.All in all a very pleasant experience.".

I am a Canadian married to a Portuguese lady so a number of these differences I have experienced first hand. For example when you meet the family it is not just three or four people it is half the town. Also when you sit in the sun all day some people tend to melt I do and others do not. In the movie I also found her father's line Presbyterian is not a religion a nice summary of why the parents didn't think the marriage could work.The movie has nice scenery of the grand canyon the hoover dam the desert and the great grandmother's Mexican casa. The surround sound is very enjoyable. It includes a great many songs all of which blend in nicely with the movie. The Elvis songs near the end of the movie are quite touching.Finally the two leads are sensational. Matthew Perry's body language is superb for the kind of light comedy role he plays. He also did the emotional stuff really well. Although not quite certain about his feelings his heart pulled him headfirst into marriage.Salma is very cute and her tan does her wonders. She also is a good actress and adds a lot to the humor.I've seen this movie six times in the last year. It is a nice relaxing watch.".

It's not exactly the most original plot line. However certain plot points put a slightly new and different spin on things and I think these along with some clever dialogue and great acting and chemistry save the movie from being totally unoriginal. There were a couple times where I was thrown for a loop but towards the end I had pretty much figured out how the movie would end. Well not EXACTLY how the movie would end but I had the basic idea. However the plot progressed in such a way that even though I knew what was coming I was still on edge.All in all a good movie to watch buy or rent.

Hayek is by far one of the best actresses out there and I don't know why she wasn't discovered after her performance in this movie. I can watch this movie over and over again and I will never get sick of it. It makes you feel warm inside and makes you want what Isabel and Alex have. I became a huge Salma Hayek fan after watching this movie. It is highly recommended. Whoever said that this movie was not good does not know what they are talking about.

She is not only superbly gorgeous to look at  those deep MexicanLebanese eyes just keep you enchanted throughout  but she is also pretty good at acting.

Firstly the film does not try to be sickly funny. It does not make ireful bile rise into your throat. Perhaps Matthew Perry is not the exact partner for the role but the chemistry between him and Salma Hayek seems to hold together fairly well. The story is also an indictment into situations which must be arising daily especially in the United States of America where racial intolerance can become highly murky. A white NewYorker falls in love with a Mexican girl. Well if they are all like Salma Hayek I would not be at all surprised. I would too. But sociological barriers  in the Mexican family also with a wonderful interpretation here by Angelina Caldern Torres  produce the logical but hypocritical obstacles which still persist in what for me should be classified as erstwhile societies.A film I shall see again which for me must be unique among films called romantic comedies. But there is just that something in the petite thirtyyearold Salma Hayek which lifts me heart and soul into clouds of surrealistic fantasy that has me fascinated enchanted.Therefore any objective commenting on this film is out of the question for me.

This movie differs a bit from other romantic comedies in that the two main characters get married At the beginning and THEN their problems start. Didn't know that was gonna happen and made it a bit different then other romantic comedies.Actually I really wouldn't call this a comedy. It is more of a drama and has an element of realismat times!! in depicting the hardships of marrying someone when you really don't Know the other personor yourself very well. I liked the premise and liked the castingparticularly Hayek who was wonderful here.I wouldn't say though that I loved this or that my attention was captured as much as with some other romances but I will say the first time I put this on I thought This was a 5. I just put it on for a second time. And now it's up to a 6 rating so who knows? Maybe by the third time I'll love it.All in all this is not such a bad movie and isn't dull like I originally thought it would be but it also shouldn't be listed as a comedy though there are certain comedic elements present certainly. If one's in the right mood this can make fun viewing.".

This movie differs a bit from other romantic comedies in that the two main characters get married At the beginning and THEN their problems start.

Its heart warming and I love how it shows the differences between two cultures and how the differences can be overcome. I do not like as another user said that they do not say the name of the baby but I think it should 'Faith'. Makes sense and it's a real pretty name too. But anyways the movie is awesome and should have won some awards. My cable provider only gave it 1 and 12 stars which is WAY off and irritates me. Great Love Story and if only I had girl like Isabel. 5 out 5 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has been accused of stereotyping its characters in some of the reviews I have read.  Fools Rush In however is antistereo typical in a number of ways.The movie concerns a onenight stand between a beautiful Latina photographer and an upwardly mobile young businessman from New York.  They meet in Las Vegas and the movie details the relationship that develops between them since the onenight stand results in her pregnancy.On one level this is the story of what happens when two individuals with scarcely an idea of serious love and commitment are confronted with a relationship in the pregnancy that is more than they bargained for.  That is not so unusual.  There are many unplanned pregnancies that occur in the world.  What is unusual is the way in which the movie handles this fairly conventional situation and the many unconventional issues it brings up.The reversal of stereotypes begins when Isabel arrives at Alex's house and tells him she plans to keep her baby.  This is after he tells her that he is prochoice.  When most people today say prochoice they usually mean allowing for clinical abortion.  They don't mean I plan to keep this baby.  Yet this latter choice is also prochoice.  This is just one of the ways in which this movie challenges the conventional stereo types of our time.There is another important way in which Fools Rush In challenges stereotypical thinking.  It presents as a very serious and viable option the possibility of an intercultural or even interracial marriage.  That isa topic which may still disturb some people but which should becomemore accepted if we are really serious about welcoming a multicultural world and an end to racism.The movie uses the Grand Canyon and its environment as a metaphor for this and I believe that the attitudes of Isabel's and Alex's family to their budding relationship are exaggerated for this reason  a kind of culture shock.  I don't think the movie's director is interested in perpetuating conventional stereotypes.Fools Rush In is charming and truly romantic because it shows how Isabel and Alexagainst longstanding cultural opposition and even their own expectationsare inexorably metaphysically drawn to spend the rest of their lives in love together.This is an exceptionally strong role for Salma Hayek.  She displays a kind of relational integrity in the role of Isabel that is independent of her supposed sex symbol status.  She takes control in this movie.  Of course the attitudes and reactions of the other characters are credible even if slightly caricatured.In summary Fools Rush In is nothing to rave about but it is rare enough to award three stars.  It is well worth watching!".

NEVERTHELESS I enjoyed Perry's charm wit and funny facial expressions to the maximum. I must also express dissenting opinion that this is a  BETTER movie than When Harry met Sally. But then comparing movies is pointless since it should really be judged on its own merits. Salma Hayek does a terrific job playing a woman who believes in herself  her culture but not to the exclusion of everyone else. I am American  my husband is Mexican so I can appreciate a clash of cultures but love the way his culture has expanded my whole experience as a human being and that is part of what this movie is about. Besides love romance and attraction it is about having the courage to open yourself to another person. As her Great Grandmother noted if you do not surrender to love you will never know love.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the better romance stories about star crossed lovers from differing cultural backgrounds. It's not exactly a new premise but the chemistry acting and comedic talents of Salma Hayek Matthew Perry and a strong supporting cast make this among the better of romantic dramedies.Isabel Hayek is a working class Latin Alex Perry is a rich New Yorker. They meet in Vegas and as the title suggests rush in to a Vegas quickie wedding complete with Elvis. Then the culture clash sparks begin.However what could be a tiresome clichfest of stereotyping quickly develops into a pleasing character study of the leads and their respective families. Isabel's father at first acts erratically almost as a comic relief but the story properly elevates him to be a very strong sympathetic and positive character. Many of the other supporting characters are very likable as well. Alex's elitist parents are more of an obstacle and provide some interesting conflict.It would be easy to dismiss this story as a typical love conquers all routine but much more happens than that. I love the symbolism of such landmarks as the Grand Canyon Hoover Dam including the state line located there New York Las Vegas and how they are used in the story. In the case of Vegas the music of entertainers associated with it is integrated well into the emotional moments. Isabel's flight to her grandmother's house is an endearing sequence and the Donka Schoen scene was very touching. You really feel for the lover who gets rejected in the latter.Perfect date movie highly recommended.".

In the morning Isabel sneaks away with no forwarding address perhaps because of a touch of shame. However a month or so later she comes once again to Alex's condo to announce that she is pregnant and that yes Alex is the father. Alex is thrown for a loop especially since Isabel is adamant about having the baby. Casting caution to the wind Alex decides to marry the lovely Isabel on the spot. But there are complications. Isabel is a MexicanAmerican with a Catholic family who is terribly upset that the marriage did not take place at a church. As for Alex's parents they are whitebread uppercrust America and they are equally appalled at their son's choice. Then too Isabel loves the desert Southwest but Alex can only imagine living in the Big Apple for the rest of his life. Will they be able to survive their first year? This is a very funny very romantic film about unlikely marriage partners. Perry is a talented comedian whose humorous delivery is priceless especially in this movie. Hayek although known more for more serious roles does a nicely comic turn here too and she is utterly gorgeous. The rest of the cast including Jill Clayburgh and Jon Tenney are very good as well. Then too the scenery in Nevada is of the putyoureyeout variety and the costumes script and production values are sharp also. If you are a fan of romantic comedy you should definitely rush out to see this one as soon as possible. It is worthy of many a top ten list. But even if romcoms are not your cup of tea this one will charm you with its funny situations and delivery. You will not be foolish at all to give it a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Fools Rush In' is probably my favorite Matthew Perry movie. It has the heart that 'The Whole Nine Yards' lacked and the seriousness that I felt ohsodeprived of in 'Three to Tango'. And you know it wasn't 'Serving Sara' at all thank God.This is your basic guymeetsgirl she asks to go pee they have a one night fling she ends up pregnant they get married by Elvis you know...the whole shebang and I promise I'll never say that again. But what I like about this film is that the characters aren't perfect. They aren't predictable and they aren't wonderfully wholesome people.Isabel Salma Hayek is blindly led by her faith and nearly lets her almost Godfearing beliefs lead her life. Basically if this chick got a sign that she should kill you I'd be running.Alex Matthew Perry is almost the antiIsabel but not quite for that would be clichd and this movie is anything but. Addicted to work Alex cannot seem to comprehend that there might be something more to life.Towards the end of this film Isabel the once guiding force in their relationship has given up on it and Alex the workaholic is willing to throw the order of his life aside for the feisty Latina. Despite coming from different cultures and leading different lives these two characters are made for each other.With some excellent dramatic acting from Perry gasp and Hayek I think this film will leave you on edge unless you've read this review in which I tell you a very happy ending occurs.7 for being complicated without losing its simplicity which is the simple message that love conquers all. Awwww....".

It has the heart that 'The Whole Nine Yards' lacked and the seriousness that I felt ohsodeprived of in 'Three to Tango'. And you know it wasn't 'Serving Sara' at all thank God.This is your basic guymeetsgirl she asks to go pee they have a one night fling she ends up pregnant they get married by Elvis you know...the whole shebang and I promise I'll never say that again. But what I like about this film is that the characters aren't perfect. They aren't predictable and they aren't wonderfully wholesome people.Isabel Salma Hayek is blindly led by her faith and nearly lets her almost Godfearing beliefs lead her life. Basically if this chick got a sign that she should kill you I'd be running.Alex Matthew Perry is almost the antiIsabel but not quite for that would be clichd and this movie is anything but. Addicted to work Alex cannot seem to comprehend that there might be something more to life.Towards the end of this film Isabel the once guiding force in their relationship has given up on it and Alex the workaholic is willing to throw the order of his life aside for the feisty Latina. Despite coming from different cultures and leading different lives these two characters are made for each other.With some excellent dramatic acting from Perry gasp and Hayek I think this film will leave you on edge unless you've read this review in which I tell you a very happy ending occurs.7 for being complicated without losing its simplicity which is the simple message that love conquers all. Awwww....";

	schema:reviewBody "Hamburger Hill is all too often compared cruelly and unfairly to Oliver Stone's Platoon a film that predates it by a single year and marked a return to Vietnam by American cinema almost a decade after Cimino and Coppolla set the bar for celluloid commentary on the conflict. In following Platoon's realistic approach as opposed to the stylised more artistic nature of these earlier films as well as Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket another film Hamburger Hill was forced to compete with John Irvin's film was seen as an inferior copy and is not remembered alongside these aforementioned films as a definitive Vietnam War film.In truth Hamburger Hill deserves to stand apart from Platoon as having its own approach and method. Hamburger Hill outstrips any other Vietnam War film in its pursuit of realism going beyond Stone's fictionalised characters with their spiritual and ideological battles. It tells the true story of the bloody assault on Hill 937 from the perspective of a platoon of mostly new recruits FNGs or Fking New Guys lead by a core of experienced troops headed by Dylan McDermott as the weary but passionate Sergeant Frantz. Irvin spends plenty of time letting us be introduced to the characters their quirks their cliques and their internal feuds before letting them see meaningful combat. As the film progresses so does their relationship to each other and to the war they're fighting. Hamburger Hill's god is resolutely in the details and it in these details that most of the film's best moments lie. The little scenes lines and moments have the air of true anecdotes often brief insignificant moments in the larger picture yet they stick in the mind and add up to create a collage of impression. Hamburger Hill is probably the most realistic Vietnam film yet made and the wealth of details give a sense that this film is the closest we've seen to actually being a soldier in Vietnam. There's none of the involved psychological exploration of a single character like Apocalypse Now none of Full Metal Jacket's black humour and archly artificial dialogue and none of Platoon's symbolic drama. The most important and impacting moments are always those of the actual conflict from the headless corpse to the halffilled canteen to the agonising friendly fire scene.Hamburger Hill is primarily a combat picture concerned with the ugly vicissitudes of the battlefield and its impact on the people involved and Irvin captures both the drama and the horror of combat effectively. The combat sequences are never short of either excitement pathos or intensity. Off the battlefield the film doesn't have the philosophical meditation that gives Apocalypse Now its enduring resonance but it is not completely without things to say. The film is utterly antiwar but at the same time prosoldier it celebrates the men who fought through the horrific conditions showing us what they had to deal with from the antiwar protesters at home who convince a soldier's girlfriend to stop writing to him because it is immoral to the faceless Blackjack who conducts the bloodshed from afar and through the simple physical conditions they endured. Irvin's message is that whatever your stance on the conflict the men there deserve respect particularly because almost none of them are there to consciously represent any moral or political position.Hamburger Hill's utilitarian design may prevent it from really being a cinematic classic but the only chief complaint is that it is dramatically unsatisfying on occasions. The climax in particular does not feel suitably impacting compared to the violence that preceded it and the film simply slows down to an end without any significant flourish. This ultimately is a product of its realism the battle of Hamburger Hill did not have satisfying dramatic structure because it was a real event and Irvin deliberately maintains this reality right to the very end an admirable gesture. Unfortunately the director's fulfilment of his own artistic manifesto comes at the sacrifice of audience satisfaction Hamburger Hill is ultimately too realistic to reach the pinnacle of artistic accomplishment.".

Fictionalizing the characters we see the typical group of soldiers some new some veterans some black some white some Hispanic conduct assault after assault on a hill for some reason that they only have a vague concept of.  But instead of making the battle slick and interlaced with subplots about the possession of souls such as Platoon or a work of art such as Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket the characters are real and the battle is believable.Whether intentional or not it is hard to identify individuals in this film. The viewer is aware that there are ethnic and class separations but identities are harder.  I believe that this was intentional to some extent by the director so that the impression could be made that this could be any unit and the soldiers could be anyone that you may know.  Like the faceless names on the Vietnam War monument during the opening of the film these soldiers are essentially faceless forcing the viewer to place a face and personality that they are intimate with.  The real star of the movie is the battle and the tragedies that resulted.  As with the better and more accurate war films there are no heroics just fear there is no glorious flag waving over a captured fortification just survivors.Again with the better war films it is the little stuff that separates the good ones from the cowboys and Indians in battle dress ilk the radio operator calling in an artillery strike in panic and is reprimanded for not using proper radio protocol the mud slide down the hill right in the middle of the battle the officer trying to call for reinforcements and realizing that his radio was blown to bits along with his arm.

	schema:reviewBody "Extremely brutal and fierce true story about one particular group in the 101 Airborne Division who spend ten days and eleven battles trying to claim a muddy and welloccupied hill that's dubbed Hamburger Hill.The cast in this film were mostly unknown like Dylan McDermott who made his film debut here and Steven Weber who both play the platoon's two weary and determined sergeants Don Cheadle is one of the five new recruits Michael Boatman and Courtney Vance are also in the cast.  It's certainly wellacted by McDermott and Vance..John Irvin The Dogs of War directed the film and here he lets the emotions of the soldiers go very far but not too far and the same can be mentioned for the battle scenes.  Also Irvin take a page of Robert Aldrich's WW2 classic and unforgettable melodrama The Dirty Dozen. Instead of making instant up close shots as Aldrich did Irvin slowly moves the camera in and it captures the unpredictable feeling that any of the G.I.s have.  I wasn't moved yet I was amazed as well.Jim Carabatos Heartbreak Ridge wrote the movie's story and like Irvin Carabatos is careful in making the tale absolutely clear and very understanding to the viewer.  The point that Irvin and Carabatos are trying to make is fascinating and simple  No one here is trying to be the hero nor the villain because surviving the war is a more important factor than trying to be gutsy and wind up being killed.Hamburger Hill isn't the type of war movie like Oliver Stone's Platoon or Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket were but it tends to be like Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line was a few years ago.  It's a fierce and very thoughtful film".

It's certainly wellacted by McDermott and Vance..John Irvin The Dogs of War directed the film and here he lets the emotions of the soldiers go very far but not too far and the same can be mentioned for the battle scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "I like most of the other people posting comments believe it is a very realistic movie. Some have commented that they didn't like the characters. Well I'm a military helicopter pilot and I have worked with the infantry on many missions. When they are in the field they are subject to a raw lifestyle that few would understand if they had not lived it. I've seen them and I've carried them. They do not apologize for the way they look act or even smell when theyve been out for days and weeks. When you see the complete fatigue in their faces you would not expect them to. They are who they are and I'm proud to have carried them as a crew chief on a CH47 earlier in my career and now as a UH60 pilot. But the movie does need a goof link for some critical errors. The men who assaulted Dong Ap Bia Hamburger Hill were never attacked by a UH1. The fratricide events occurred 4 documented times. Once by a Skyraider fixedwing and three separate times by AH1 Cobras. The Skyraider dropped I believe a 1000 pound bomb and the Cobras shot them up with their machine guns and rockets. Having pointed this out I do realize that the film industry putting out a lower budget film might have a difficult time actually finding a Cobra to use. Hueys are easy to find and cheap to operate. Also the scenes with who is supposed to be Col. Honeycutt in the Command and Control helicopter you never really see himportrays him as completely out of harms way during the battles. The fact is that he was in harms way with NVA artillery constantly. He and his staff also ended up in a fire fight themselves. The radio traffic also leads you to believe he is uncaring and dogmatic with his people. I could only answer this by pointing out that someone had to be the commander and it was a difficult mission. But the ruthless uncaring leader almost as a matter of political correctness is the only way Hollywood will portray a commander in Viet Nam. Too bad though that episode with his staff would have been interesting to have seen acted out. It doesn't change my opinion of the film though. It's one of my favorites in my DVD library.".

When they first get there the mountain is covered in jungle but as the battle continues over several days it is reduced to a treeless mudbath. The action all seemed very real most of the time the enemy was unseen and the battle was confusing as I imagine such combat would be. When the soldiers aren't battling the NVA they talk in a way that seemed real discussing what they wanted when they return home and the way that soldiers are being treated by protesters on their return. However we don't get preached at about the rights or wrongs of the war which I found refreshing.The acting was good through out in an understated way I particularly liked Courtney B. Vance who played Doc the rather intense medic and Dylan McDermott who played Sgt. Frantz. The camera work was top notch almost making the viewer feel they were right in there amongst the soldiers.

	schema:headline " Fierce and ugly Hamburger Hill's one of the most underrated of the war movies";
	schema:reviewBody "Hamburger Hill was released in 1987 on the heels of another Vietnam war movie Oliver Stone's Platoon 1986. Platoon helped revolutionize the war movie genre by presenting war on a personal level from the point of view of the average soldier or grunt as defined in ye old Platoon.Hamburger Hill continued the trend although it was made on a considerably smaller budget but that doesn't automatically mean it's bad. But first and foremost Hamburger Hill is definitely not for the squeamish with enough extreme combat violence blood sweat tears for two war movies. The cast is largely full of unknowns headlined by Anthony Barrile and Michael Patrick Boatman though Don Cheadle Dylan McDermott Courteney B. Vance and Steven Weber are a few of the other names that stick out.The film was written by Jim Carabatsos who served with the 1st Air Cavalry Division in 196869 and spent five years interviewing soldiers involved in the combat there and researching the battle it focuses on 14 members of the 3rd Squad 1st Platoon D Company of the 3rd Infantry Battalion who on May 10 1969 began what has been characterized as one of the bloodiest battles of the war from Hal Hinson's Washington Post review. The Englishborn John Irvin was the director responsible for bringing Carabatsos's film to the screen and cues were taken from these interviews to really capture the intensity of the combat.Hamburger Hill concerns their battle but it isn't all about the war.

	onyx:emotionText "Hamburger Hill was released in 1987 on the heels of another Vietnam war movie Oliver Stone's Platoon 1986. Platoon helped revolutionize the war movie genre by presenting war on a personal level from the point of view of the average soldier or grunt as defined in ye old Platoon.Hamburger Hill continued the trend although it was made on a considerably smaller budget but that doesn't automatically mean it's bad. But first and foremost Hamburger Hill is definitely not for the squeamish with enough extreme combat violence blood sweat tears for two war movies. The cast is largely full of unknowns headlined by Anthony Barrile and Michael Patrick Boatman though Don Cheadle Dylan McDermott Courteney B. Vance and Steven Weber are a few of the other names that stick out.The film was written by Jim Carabatsos who served with the 1st Air Cavalry Division in 196869 and spent five years interviewing soldiers involved in the combat there and researching the battle it focuses on 14 members of the 3rd Squad 1st Platoon D Company of the 3rd Infantry Battalion who on May 10 1969 began what has been characterized as one of the bloodiest battles of the war from Hal Hinson's Washington Post review. The Englishborn John Irvin was the director responsible for bringing Carabatsos's film to the screen and cues were taken from these interviews to really capture the intensity of the combat.Hamburger Hill concerns their battle but it isn't all about the war. The first third of the film introduces us to the men who will fight and die at Hill 937 Ashau Valley. The alreadymentioned future big names are here getting their rocks off and flirting with the Vietnamese hookers at local brothels.

	schema:reviewBody "Minor spoilers here...This is one seriously disturbing film.  I can't even begin to describe just how disturbing it is.  It has a pencilthin storyline too and is ultimately pointless.  Those are just a few of the qualities that make this perhaps the best  and I cringe at that word because it's really a terrible experience to behold  film yet made about the Vietnam conflict. Built around a cast of unknowns all of whom turn in utterly convincing performances this film's script must be either a really short or b a real mess.  Most of the dialogue in the film's last half for example is military jargon and yelling with a lot of screaming thrown in for good measure.  Much of the dialogue that precedes it is the kind of meandering pointless talk that real people  as opposed to actors in a theatrical production  fill time with.  This feature a failing in many other films. is part of what makes this film work.  If the film is largely without point that is only because the taking of Hill 937 the 'Hamburger Hill' of the title  was ultimately pointless as was in the larger sense the entire Vietnam adventure and as is ultimately most war itself.  The brutally repetitive storming of Hamburger Hill that occupies the second half of the film particularly from May 15 on the assault began on May 10 1969 and was finally completed ten days later is mindnumbing.  Well you WISH that it were mindnumbing but your mind's all too awake and aware and the images that fill it are horrible.  This movie has some gruesome scenes and a lot of gore.  Is it gratuitous?  No.  Well yes in the sense that the reallife equivalent is just as gratuitous and unnecessary.  Is it realistic?  Yes. That's what makes it so horrible.  Added to this is an extreme sense of confusion to the viewer that mirrors the confusion of the soldiers.  All war is better understood after the fact or by those who draw arrows on campaign maps and make the decisions at the time and this film does not present the big picture at all.  Again this only places us in greater empathy with the young men sent to complete an ultimately futile task.  For that matter I'm not sure that much of the Vietnam War was even able to be accurately characterized by arrows drawn on maps.The acting's firstrate in that it's less acting  or appears that way  than real response to an insane situation.  Dylan McDermott Steven Weber and a couple of others look familiar to me from subsequent projects but at the time the entire cast was basically new to film or close enough to it.An interesting feature of the film is that the NVA soldiers are shown  these are NVA regulars and not the unseen 'Cong' or 'Charlie' of other films the Viet Cong were largely a spent force after the 1968 Tet Offensive  and the US soldiers of the legendary 101st Airborne have more in common with them than with their own commanders.  Helicopterdelivered 'friendly fire' only reinforces the question of who the real enemy are as does intrusion via letters a tape recording a film crew and personal anecdotes of men home for leave from 'The World' an America that had turned its back on  if not spat on  the GIs stuck in Vietnam.  The blackwhite poorprivileged issue is effectively entered into several times too.I've never been in combat and was still a kid when the Vietnam war ended but a friend of mine  who completed three tours of duty in Vietnam with the Marines 19671969...lovely time to be there  told me that it's the most realistic Vietnamwar movie that he'd seen.  He avoided seeing any movies that would remind him of Vietnam but in the '80s his young son began asking him about the War and he was forced to begin dealing with things that he had covered over and mentally put aside.  'Processing' the Vietnam experience as pop psychologists might say.  Part of his selfadministered therapy was catching up on movies made on the topic.  He didn't talk to me about what he saw in combat my grandfather was similarly taciturn about his WWI experiences but he did tell me enough about some of the ancillary matters like his treatment when he returned to the US that I was glad that he stopped there.  His film recommendations were telling though.  He dismissed the phenomenal Apocalypse Now as unrealistic  not surprising because at heart it is neither about Vietnam nor war  and he also said that Platoon was bogus.  In his experience at least. Hamburger Hill he said  watch Hamburger Hill and you will begin to understand how it was there.  I'd never heard of the movie but I watched it  this was over a decade ago  and saw what he meant.  I haven't watched it again until today.  I wasn't in any particular hurry either.  It's a nasty movie but only because it was documenting a nasty situation.This is a movie that I always feel I have to be careful in recommending. It's just a bit too disturbing for some especially those who avoid violence in movies.  The fact that this is not some Charles Bronson exploitation film doesn't really matter in that respect and the violence in this film is far more real and random than in any 'slasher' film.  I can't believe that the US military actually cooperated in the making of this film.  What I do believe is that this should be required viewing for those who don't even blink at sending young men into war especially for an empty cause.  What did the Screaming Eagles do with the hill once they'd finally seized it? They were choppered out after a while of course.  Does that make sense to you?  I hope not.".

Imagine seeing that over and over again for ten straight days to your FRIENDS and you have a GI's experience taking Hill 937 in May 1969.In a remarkably simple story we follow a group a platoon of American GI's as they embark on a mission to take a hill someone pointed to on a map. Don't be put off by the simple story. It's a wellwritten acted and deeply moving one you will not soon forget.John Irvin's direction is bold  he doesn't let us ignore the bloodshed he lingers on the faces of the dead making sure we see making sure we recognise the man whose life has just ended so suddenly.We crawl through the mud and blood we are assaulted by the sounds of the dying and the thunder of war. We don't just see it we are not just shown we are pulled down into the mud with the grunts.We feel pain as a medic cries over a headless corpse some anonymous GI killed in an artillery attack. He ponders the headless man thinking aloud as he cries I don't know who you are... We experience the suddenness of death as a man wounded remarks to a comrade See you at home... and then quietly dies.We witness the horror of a friendlyfire incident proving that in amongst the blood and the mud and the filth it is difficult to tell the difference between a friend and an enemy.There is no endofmovie posturing on the futility of war. We are left almost as numb as the soldiers who look back down the hill they just came through hell to capture. We are never removed from this battlefield and thus it remains in the mind for hours after the movie ends. The anonymous voice of the HQ radio operator trying to raise the platoon over the radio and his calls going unanswered the radio operator is long dead is a haunting and chilling final moment in the film. There is no need for preaching the images of violence in this film say it louder than any words ever could war makes beasts of us all.This is such a brutal frank and unapologetic antiwar film that I just had to review it and help keep its rating up because it deserves to be alongside Platoon in the antiwar canon of Vietnam movies. It's basically saying in the first 40 minutes here you go here's a bunch of young likable guys for you to meet.Now in the last 40 minutes you get to watch most of them die.And die horribly at that. Thus it's not really a pleasant or enjoyable film but it is an essential one for any war movie buff and actually any movie buff in general because it's a great example of lessismore. It is also a timely reminder that it is not the grunts our antiwar sentiment or anger should be directed at it is the men and women in suits sitting behind big desks in sterile government offices pointing at all the Hill 937s on maps and saying Mine.".

Hamburger Hill is the first war film I have seen where the reality of war is presented in an unashamed noholdsbarred manner. From life at the base to the assault on the hill the film pulls no punches but also doesn't seek to be overly moral or preach to anyone the futility of the war simply to present life as it was for the soldiers who served fought and died in Americas most disastrous conflict. Films like this and We Were Soldiers should almost be compulsory viewing for history students because even though a book can explain what happened nothing shows it better than films like these. The editing of the film shows its age in some places and some of the dialogue seems a little contrived at times however the acting of people such as Courtney Vance most recently known for his role as ADA Carver in Criminal Intent is outstanding and while Tim Quills' who plays Private Beletsky acting begins a little fuzzy by the end of the film his role becomes clearer and his acting improves into a very believable performance. This is a must see for fans of war films and historians alike and I highly recommend it.".

From life at the base to the assault on the hill the film pulls no punches but also doesn't seek to be overly moral or preach to anyone the futility of the war simply to present life as it was for the soldiers who served fought and died in Americas most disastrous conflict. Films like this and We Were Soldiers should almost be compulsory viewing for history students because even though a book can explain what happened nothing shows it better than films like these. The editing of the film shows its age in some places and some of the dialogue seems a little contrived at times however the acting of people such as Courtney Vance most recently known for his role as ADA Carver in Criminal Intent is outstanding and while Tim Quills' who plays Private Beletsky acting begins a little fuzzy by the end of the film his role becomes clearer and his acting improves into a very believable performance. This is a must see for fans of war films and historians alike and I highly recommend it.";

Platoon remains the most preachy of the lot always bringing in morals and spirituality into the mix.Enter Hamburger Hill an introspective look into the lifestyle of the soldier in Vietnam without trying to sell us a message.  What you get out of it is not what they tell you but rather what you interpret on your own. The battle itself is one of the most gruelling experiences ever put on celluloid.  My kudos to John Irvin for pulling it off so effectively and warping our emotions as he proceeds. My biggest guff with this movie rests in the fact that it takes more than halfway through for them to actually GET to Hamburger Hill.  After that it's definitely worth a look.  Overall 3 out of 5 stars.".

The movie depicts the allied assault on hill 937 in the A Shau valley 69 were we follow a squad of US troopers from the 101st Airborne through their moment of horror and friendship. The footage is good and many times more realistically than most other Vietnam war films. The confusion of combat and the no see enemy that hides in the bush together with good sound effects makes this a hairy film. The actors also whose performance are very good makes this a much more thrust worthy film then many other commercial Holly Wood productions. If it had a higher budget and more publicity it would probably be more known than the movie Platoon witch I feel is kind a sad. A must see for anyone that got an interest in modern war movies or in history lessons. There is a poem in the end credits don't miss it or you miss the whole message.".

As seeing the other two I still steered away from this one believing it just wasn't as good or it would be like I've seen it all before you know. I know I had read a couple of bad reviews but they were mixed opinions on this one. Having just seen this film 29 years later I'm glad I did. Yes it is different from the other two which I won't mention and I must say I was really bowled over by some of the performances especially Mc Dermott's Courtney B Vance's and Stephen Weber the guy who lost his head practically in Single White Female. This story was based on the horrific 1969 battle of hill 437 where 241 vets died on this death hill one would say during a nine day hell fire where during the explosions rain and sludge these poor soldiers had to keep their spirit alive and continue to fight among hardship and obstacles virtually undermined by Charlie who were picking them off like flies. The violence is raw and confronting and this one is quite bloody. Irwin an interesting director who believe it or not made the Arnie pic Raw Deal prefore and also that fine British actioner Shiner has so well shot and captured the horror and action with some truly gripping moments some feel a bit too close for comfort. One real CU shot near the start featuring a village boy bummed down as an Army jeep passes is a nice touch. There is a lot of tension a couple of fights where Vance's edgy and tense character is so enjoyable to watch how he never got some acting award for this leaves me blinded. One scene that will linger with me and I won't forget for years to come is that tape recording of a young vet's girl telling him she'll stay loyal and some other stuff that is so poignant and affecting if a little eerie too the writer has outdone himself with this bit. We have some lighter scenes with some nice nude Asian hotties getting cosy in a little R and R session with Mc Dermott and Weber. Tasty. There are some things you won't expect like a teeth brushing session don't worry it has merit plus a sneaking enemy illustration partook by a crawling crazed looking gook. While this doesn't feel as mainstream as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket where may'be budget seems the problem here's a story and part of Vietnam which must be told where at the end of this piece like Mc Dermott and company we really feel like we've been put through the ringer witnessing their struggle and unbroken spirit where inspiration and hope treads heavily in this true Nam' telling tale.".

Instead there are one or two short bursts of unexpected fighting that are over as quickly as they begin. What's of more interest to screenwriter James Carabatsos is the depiction of the everyday life of a G.I. There's the conventional talk of pinups and muscle cars macho posturing and racial tensions but unusually that takes second place to the minutiae of life on the front line. There's an extraordinary amount of screen time taken up with talk of salt pills lessons on oral hygiene the difficulties of identifying headless corpses if the deceased was thoughtless enough not to have dog tags on his boots etc. The audience learns along with the grunts the things they weren't taught in basic training. For a genre so often mired in clichs this approach is refreshing  a completely different way to get under the skin of the characters and enable the audience to care about them. Rather than rely solely on bad news from home or personal struggles to humanise the characters Irvin is happy to just let the camera roll while they chat.It's not all talk though. As previously mentioned the visceral final act is a lengthy battle with great choreography stunts and explosions although it's marred by some awful music that thankfully doesn't play during the entire scene and throughout the film there are some brief flashes of absurd horror that wouldn't look out of place in a David Lynch film.".
