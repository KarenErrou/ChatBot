	schema:headline " The Much Needed Return of the Creature Feature";
	schema:reviewBody "The whole mythos surrounding Bigfoot The Abominable Snowman or Sasquatch is an enthralling one captivating the general public since the first alleged Bigfoot sightings in the early 1950s. A number of Bigfoot films have been made capitalizing on the general population's interest in these anomalies. Needless to say many of these films have gone relatively unnoticed or dismissed as the campiest of BMovies excluding Hammer Studios' 1957 classic 'The Abominable Snowman'. This brings us to Ryan Schifrin's featurelength directorial debut 'Abominable'. Not since 1957 has such an enthralling riveting yet original picture hit the screens pertaining to this subject matter  a true creature feature with a Hitchcockian twist.'Abominable' begins with the paraplegic Preston Rogers Matt McCoy traveling up to his mountainhome for the first time in six months after recovering from a mountainclimbing accident. Preston is accompanied by Otis Christien Tinsley an impatient and condescending physical therapist The viewer soon learns from a local newspaper that the town has received an alleged Bigfoot report from a local resident. Preston soon reaches his cabin. As the evening progresses he resides on his deck overlooking the forest and a neighboring house gazing off into the woods through a pair of binoculars. When Otis steps out to get a carton of soy milk for Preston at the nearest store a group of girls arrive at the neighboring house. At the same time Preston soon begins to notice strange happenings in the woods surrounding the neighboring house and watches helplessly as the tragic events of the night unfold.Standing drastically alone from the pseudohorror produced by major and minor studios of this day and age 'Abominable' is an excellent extremely original and extremely unrelenting film. The film accomplishes an atmosphere and storyline unachieved and untouched since the heydays of drivein horror that were the 1950s through the 1980s. 'Abominable' possesses a certain quality which has been vacant within the horror genre especially the monstermovie subgenre for years and years it is devoid of CGI. The Monster Michael Deak is in fact a man in a suit! To some this conjures up a question does the suit look excessively cheesy and unrealistic? Fortunately it does not the effects used are executed quite well and The Monster doesn't generate a phonyvibe in the least. Many of the facial movements of The Monster seem to be achieved through robotics ala 'An American Werewolf in London' and the result looks extremely realistic and lifelike. The film's plot is the result of a winning combination it features the classic creaturefeature storyline coupled with a very Hitchcockstyled 'Rear Window'esquire premise. The screenplay is excellent practically all of the events within the film are experienced from Preston's helpless perspective. Whether it is at his window or on his balcony Preston overlooks almost the entire series of events giving the film an extremely claustrophobic and helpless atmosphere. The cinematography and lighting are also ingenious the shadowy woods seen from the balcony add depth and an eerie uneasiness to the film. Matt McCoy proves himself to be an excellent actor as does Christien Tinsley but the character interactions between McCoy and Haley Joel prove to be the true acting highpoint within the film. A broad range of emotions are showcased between the two all of which are executed with precision.'Abominable' achieves a certain charm lacking in practically all horror films of this day and age. It showcases a style of filmmaking that has been lost a style of filmmaking that is the horror genre the classic monster movie. No it doesn't have breathtaking CGI no the plot is not Steven Kingworthy but it manages to entertain and it manages to illustrate that which is the embodiment of American horror. Schifrin's film stands firmly as an instant cultclassic on par with great titles and counterparts dare I say of the 1980s such as 'Pumpkinhead' 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'Prophecy'. 'Abominable' stands alone in a time when horror has gone to the dogs it breaks the trend of spineless PG13 horror films and shatters the standards of pointless special effects showcases such as 'Cursed'. The creature feature is back ladies and gentlemen and in full force. The way horror should be  Abominable.".

A paraplegic widower whose wife died six months before the opening credits in a mountainclimbing accident. This has left him with agoraphobia fear of the outdoors which his psychiatrist has ordered him to face head on at the old mountain cabin.Accompanying him is Otis a somewhat patronizing physiotherapist. And while he goes shopping for some nonallergenic milk five gorgeous young women arrive at the ritzy cabin next door for some kind of bachelorette party weekend.Wouldn't you know it? That's when the local Bigfoot arrives as well. And the first victim it takes is Karen the blonde who's more addicted to cellphones than that spokesguy in the commercials.Pres doesn't know it was the Monster until he sees its glowing red eyes. The first time peering at him from the edge of the woods. The second time peering at him right through the glass of his own backporch window after he's been forced to tranquilize the disbelieving Otis!Finally we get to see the Monster fullscale. And that's where my twopoint deduction comes in. The movie's title kind of described the prosthetic Bigfoot costume! Sorry Mr. Deak. But that getup made you look like a Jack Elam impersonator with hypertrichosis more than anything else.Even so the rest of the movie was very suspenseful. I empathized with Pres' selfdoubt so much like William Shatner's in the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episode Nightmare At 20000 Feet. I loved the fairly bigname cameos by various SF veterans especially Lance Henriksen. And there was only one gratuitous nude deathscene among the five women. Thank you SciFi Channel! Practice is finally making perfect with your madeforTV movies.Just a couple nitpicks before I go. With all due respect to that cryptozoologist interviewed on the Internet? Yetis and Bigfeet are supposed to be oneandthesame things! Just separated geographically.And the name of the nearby town Flat Woods? Written as one word that's the name of the actual West Virginia town that had the firstever reported case of a 4thclass close encounter. In September of 1952 five years and two months after Roswell!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at a screening at the 2006 Rue Morgue Festival of Fear.Abominable is great. I believe I've seen a few horror movies about the yeti but this is the first decent Bigfootsasquatch horror movie I've ever seen. It's surprising that this is the first I know of considering that Bigfoot is such a big cryptozoological icon in north America.Abominable has some decent actors for a relatively low budget B movie. The main characters for the most part are very well acted. There are hilarious cameos by B movie stars Jeffrey Combs and Lance Henrickson.The feel of confinement is conveyed well. The cinematography really helps you identify with the wheelchair bound main character and his limited perspective. There are a few jump scares that will get you. The creature effects are great and the monster reveal doesn't happen too early.The movie is fun and has a classic ending that really satisfies... something which I find is a rarity these days.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this movie at a screening at the 2006 Rue Morgue Festival of Fear.Abominable is great. I believe I've seen a few horror movies about the yeti but this is the first decent Bigfootsasquatch horror movie I've ever seen. It's surprising that this is the first I know of considering that Bigfoot is such a big cryptozoological icon in north America.Abominable has some decent actors for a relatively low budget B movie. The main characters for the most part are very well acted. There are hilarious cameos by B movie stars Jeffrey Combs and Lance Henrickson.The feel of confinement is conveyed well. The cinematography really helps you identify with the wheelchair bound main character and his limited perspective. There are a few jump scares that will get you.

	schema:reviewBody "Abominable is a lot better than it's release origins give away.SPOILERSPreston Rogers Matt McCoy goes back to the cabin in the mountains where his wife was killed to get some closure on it. Now a paraplegic his assistant Otis Christien Tinsley goes along to help him out. When a group of sorority sisters arrive in the cabin next door he decides to watch them for company. When he sees something in the trees when one of the girls goes missing he believes he's going crazy with hallucinations. As the teens next door mysteriously vanish one by one Preston tries to get Otis to believe him that a Bigfoot is the cause of everything. No one believes him until the creatures attacks the house causing the remaining girls until a fight for survival against the rampaging beast.The Good News I was actually surprised at this one. It was a lot better than it should've been as it's a SciFi Channel original. The film's greatest strength is the smart script. It cleverly mixes two different films together into an imaginative creative plot that is such a refreshing site to see. Imagine a Rear Window type affair with a killer Bigfoot instead of the human killer. That is a nice change as it dispels the usual creatureontheloose movies. By using this formula it also bring a lot of suspense as well. We see things from only one point of view and that heightens the tension incrementally. From that vantage point we are just as inthedark as the characters are and we find out about the situation just as the characters do. That makes the characters' danger and fears so much more tensely than in any other style. That is quite ingenious and gives the film a little intelligence. The film's setting is pretty creepy as the woods are effectively milked for all their suspensegiving worth. The forest is creepy and makes us feel isolated which is what the feeling should be. The monster is also quite effective and is smartly kept offscreen for most of the movie. That just makes his actions all the more creepy as we know something is happening yet in keeping with the inthedark nature of the script it's not crystal clear and the doubting nature of everything combined makes it a suspenseful movie. The creature looks scary and it isn't like a traditional Bigfoot. The face is different enough for it to be an entirely different creature but the body makes it look like the usual monster. A slight hint of recognizablyused methods mixed with an air of originality. Plus the gore and deaths in here are definitely deserving of mention. The deaths are quite effective and they're pretty bloody. One is bent backwards while pulled through a window one has their neck bitten out and another has their ribs ripped through the skin. There are a couple more deaths in here and they have all gruesome endings which I can't reveal. It should just be said that the deaths here will leave any gorehound happy. Even more surprising the deaths have an actual hidden meaning behind them. The first deaths are pretty bloodless and tame but the attacks get more and more violent as the final death is the most graphic and gruesome of the deaths. That is pretty ingenious and is a nice little subliminal effect on the viewers. The ending is also nice with some well written action scenes that don't really overstep their bounds and are nice to see. And what more needs to be said about that ending? One of the best ever and it definitely works.The Bad News The creature's roar is used far too often in other films before but this is the only complaint as it's roar is effective for the film.The Final Verdict This is a lot better than it had every right to have and is one of the best films the SciFi Channel has shown. It succeeds for a lot of different reasons and is very enjoyable. See this one at once as there are really no real reasons not to.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Nudity".

Without breaking a sweat the usually big as an 800 pound guerrilla but harmless as a toy poodle Bigfoot went bananas and broke into a number of homes outside city limits making his presences felt.It just happened that the crippled in both mind and body mountain climber Preston Rogers Matt McCoy was sent by his doctor for rest and relaxation to stay at his former home in the deep woods where Bigfoot decided to put his big foot down. Bigfoot had been raiding the local farmers livestock earlier in the movie but now for some reason decided to attack man whom he considers unlike the livestock his mortal and eternal enemy.We get the usual sexy and willing to take their clothes off teenage or collage student who get themselves with the also usual exception of a single survivor among them knocked off by the Bigfoot who also devourers them. This is something new for Bigfoot since it was always thought that he was a vegetarian! Preston who's being taken care of by what seems like his male nurse Otis Christian Tinsley sees the Bigfoot running around his front lawn but his cries fall on deft ears.

The Bigfoot attacked Karen and dragged her into his secret cave where he was in the process when hunter Henriksen discovered it of preparing his dinner with Karen as the main course!With Preston Otis and the girls trapped with no place to go the Bigfoot now went into action as he tore into his human adversaries with both teeth claws as well with his scent as his extremely offensively strong body odor By far the worst weapon in his entire arsenal.The movie ends with the Bigfoot getting a kingsize stomach ache but only after killing off almost the entire movie cast including Otis who was left with his face completely bitten off! Not that bad of an acting job by both Bigfoot impersonator Michael Deak and the hero of the film playing the paralyzed Preston Rogers actor Matt McCoy.

The first half of the movie was able to live up to expectation. Even though the sound effects where overdone and sometimes inappropriate the movie kept a grip.This tension was however totally lost when we get to see the full monster at about half way. No creepy sounds or gory murders during the rest of the movie could make up for this abominable cheap Halloween costume.This creature simply should have stayed in the dark...";

This may not be an academy award winner but compared to other SciFi channel movies such as King Kobra Vs Komodo released the week after it is much better. It is probably the bets SciFi original I've ever seen with the exception of Dog Soldiers. This movie was also not filled to the top with hundreds of C.G.I monsters and effects. Anyone you ask will say a guy in a monster suit looks better than some C.G.I monster. The story is about 5 young girls who go to a cabin for a relaxing vacation. In the cabin next to them is Preston Rogers a crippled man and his assistant Otis. During the movie many people are killed by this enormous Yeti as Preston basically watches from his window the whole movie. Of course the police won't believe that the monster is real. The acting isn't great but it isn't horrible. Some notable people are in this movie such as Lance Henriksen Dee WallaceStone and Ashley Hartman or The O.C. Overall this movie is a good and entertaining watch with a lot of gore. Abominable is rated R and stars Haley Joel Karin Anna Cheung Lance Henrikson Paul Gleason Matt McCoy and Ashely Hartman".

That is until it comes out of the woods very unhappy and very hungry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Although it stole a little for the Hitchcock classic Rear Window Abominable was a pleasant surprise. Having an intelligent and original story filled with blood  guts and shocks it had everything a creature feature needed and more. So if your looking for a scary bloody suspenseful evening pop some popcorn and watch Abominable. Also starring horror legends Jeffery Combs The ReAnimator franchise From Beyond and The Frighteners Dee Wallace Cujo The Frighteners Critters and The Howling and Lance Henriksen Aliens Alien 3 AvP Omen 2 Pirahna 2 Near Dark Pumpkinhead The Terminator and many more.

I still cannot believe that the humanity is able to do pains and kill so many innocent people but it's the truth. The history shows that the Jewish people have been always followed in the past and I can only pray for all the victims and children that have to die during the second World War.

The history shows that the Jewish people have been always followed in the past and I can only pray for all the victims and children that have to die during the second World War. DER LETZTE ZUG has a great meaning for me and we should never forget what happened in the wars. All the actors played very strong and this movie should earn at least attention from all the audience. 710.";

That it is basically unheard of in the English speaking world is both an absolute travesty and in some ways  very befitting the content of the movie.The acting is  without exception  well above par. The cinematography superbly Oscar worthy and the direction flawless.But this is a HARD movie to watch  make no mistake about it. It is utterly devastating I had to turn it off twice and compose myself before watching it again. That makes this at least in my books one of the bravest takes on this horrific period in history. My only singular criticism would be that the movie is not quite claustrophobic enough  the reality of the transportation trains by all accounts is that there was not even enough room to sit down  they had the carriages loaded so fully. But this is the last train to Auschwitz and populated with less than 700 Jews  so that may explain it. The transition from oppressed ghetto Jew to death camp deportee is very real and you are led through the journey in utter terror. You hope against hope for a happy ending  but as we all know  the journey to the death camp was just the beginning of the end for almost all the Jews who were sent to Auschwitz. It's a must watch film  even if for no other reason that to keep alive that awful stain on mankind lest it ever happens again  if you do nothing else in your life ever watch this movie. I do not want to do any spoilers  but I would STRONGLY caution parents of very young children who might watch this movie. No pain is spared and there are some harrowing scenes some truly truly harrowing scenes. I gave this the full ten for many reasons  but mostly because it is the best movie I have seen since Let the Right One In about 20 years ago.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der letzte Zug or The Last Train is a German  Czech coproduction from 2006 so this film has its 10th anniversary this year. The language used most in here is German but others are heard too. The writer duo are Artur Brauner and Stephen Glantz and they may not be known to many I guess. The directors however are fairly famous namely Joseph Vilsmaier and his nowdeceased wife Dana Vvrov. The cast does not include too many wellknown names but German film buffs probably have come across Gedeon Burkhard and Sibel Kekilli already. With the topic in here I must say I am a bit surprised this 2hour film did not receive much more awards recognition outside the Bavarian Film Awards.Almost the entire film is set in a train that rides to the concentration camp Auschwitz so yes this is another German movie set during the dark days of World War II. I also feel that it did not really offer anything new that has not been shown in older movies in terms of the relationship between Nazis and Jews and the killings of course. But I am interested in the subject so this was not a problem at all for me. What makes this film stand out though is the background. This is not really about Jews trying to flee from Nazis in ghettos or trying to break free out of the camps. This is inbetween namely in the train and I think they did a good job here at finding a healthy balance in terms of telling stories and letting us get to know some characters while not focusing on others. It's a fine line but Vilsmaier is walking it successfully here. Yes there are moments of heroism and tragedy that did not always feel authentic but it's also difficult not to include these in a film with this topic and runtime. And being a huge Kekilli fan I may also be a bit biased. But I think for a film over 120 minutes there are really not many lengths in here and I would call it a success. Go see it if you are interested in German history of the 20th century.".

Her character Laura goes from being 'drunk beyond belief' to being perfectly sober and her lines are delivered without any alteration throughout the film. But what scares me most is the overconfidence of the character she portrays. I thought it was quite difficult for a modern woman to find a man but this girl treats men like disposable tissues. Furthermore what kind of message is this film trying to send? Are the girls now supposed to accept the sexual infidelity as far as the man in question pays for the holidays? Good performance from Simona Stasova Laura's mum but overall not funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many Czechs love this movie and by the comments on this site I can see that even some Americans do. I can't see why though. To begin with Romn pro eny is simply not funny. I can't think of one moment which would even amuse me. Instead I felt like groaning every time there was any attempt at humor. Why was this ? Maybe because there is no real timing. Maybe because the comic situations are presented in such a smug and happygolucky way that it's more like nonridiculous people deciding to force themselves to act ridiculous than a naturally funny comedy. Maybe it's also because the actors are average dramatic actors rather than comedians. Or most likely it's because the movie derives much of its humor from people acting weird like the mother being an enthusiastic participant in the rituals of foreign cultures because she dislikes her own people the heroine's best friend pretending to be like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill or the braindamaged grandmother constantly repeating the same question over and over again. In the hands of a better director or screen writer such situations could be at least slightly funny. However here they just seem like boring nonweird people's unimaginative idea of weirdness.The movie does not work too well as a love story either. The scenes which are meant to be touching didn't touch me at all. This is probably because the characters are simply not likable. For example Zuzana Kanocz's character is a young woman who takes everything with a light whimsical attitude and does not seem to feel anything too deeply except for when she is dumped but not when she is the one doing the dumping and Marek Vasut's character is an inherently unpleasant jerk who lacks the warmth or charisma or even nicenessto be a good romantic lead. But then if these two characters are both intended to be good looking almost amoral and mostly unemotional they are perfect for each other. There is also the problem of the movie being kitsch in the sense that the plot twists are at least moving as ideas eg. the closing subwayrelated sequence but their execution in the movie is clumsy and not moving at all. The pairing up of two minor mildly unattractive characters at the end is not only equally ineffective but something that any intelligent viewer could predict. And let's not even go into Kanocz's more minor boyfriends. Those are strictly in the let's make a character out of one or two qualities mode. The sequence with the sky diver is particularly bad as it feels just like a chewing gum commercial.So why do people like this movie ? Probably because they identify with the characters which is pretty scary.".

Maybe it's also because the actors are average dramatic actors rather than comedians. Or most likely it's because the movie derives much of its humor from people acting weird like the mother being an enthusiastic participant in the rituals of foreign cultures because she dislikes her own people the heroine's best friend pretending to be like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill or the braindamaged grandmother constantly repeating the same question over and over again. In the hands of a better director or screen writer such situations could be at least slightly funny. However here they just seem like boring nonweird people's unimaginative idea of weirdness.The movie does not work too well as a love story either. The scenes which are meant to be touching didn't touch me at all. This is probably because the characters are simply not likable. For example Zuzana Kanocz's character is a young woman who takes everything with a light whimsical attitude and does not seem to feel anything too deeply except for when she is dumped but not when she is the one doing the dumping and Marek Vasut's character is an inherently unpleasant jerk who lacks the warmth or charisma or even nicenessto be a good romantic lead. But then if these two characters are both intended to be good looking almost amoral and mostly unemotional they are perfect for each other. There is also the problem of the movie being kitsch in the sense that the plot twists are at least moving as ideas eg. the closing subwayrelated sequence but their execution in the movie is clumsy and not moving at all. The pairing up of two minor mildly unattractive characters at the end is not only equally ineffective but something that any intelligent viewer could predict. And let's not even go into Kanocz's more minor boyfriends. Those are strictly in the let's make a character out of one or two qualities mode. The sequence with the sky diver is particularly bad as it feels just like a chewing gum commercial.So why do people like this movie ? Probably because they identify with the characters which is pretty scary.";

This style film called for using nonactors just typical folks in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.In this case the film is about French and German coal miners so appropriately the people in the roles seem like minersnot actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the FrancoGerman border. Instead of one big mine it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This language differences illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factionsresulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history though the film's impact was minimal at best. It's a real shame as like this one WESTFRONT 1918 JACCUSE Gance and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT Milestone had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion.

But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work. Also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions but real people with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well. These are ordinary workingclass men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man and in this day of individualist opportunism I'll take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that I think we can all aspire to.Note Apparently the ending is cut on most prints where the French rebuild the mining gate closing off the men once again. This is a brutal turn of events and may have made the film a better overall film but I would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence so in short I'm glad it was clipped. Grade 810 B  7 of 11 of 1931".

A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a wellcrafted and written scene a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story is it not? Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not but his poetry is there to be discovered. He isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal. Ther is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness.

	schema:headline " An early film about a catastrophe in a coal mine";
	schema:reviewBody "This is another excellent film of director Pabst. Apparently the story is based on true events which makes it even more interesting. It is nice to see as a main character Ernst Busch the German singer of protest songs and a predecessor of Woody Guthry and Bob Dylan. But first of all it is a film about a catastrophe with lots of suspension. This time it is not a failing airplane a sinking ship or a burning skyscraper but an underground coal mine. The underlying theme is also fascinating and in fact quite simple namely the international solidarity among miners. The actual realization of this solidarity is another matter and the film highlights the tension between hostility and collective interests on all levels. The stage is the borderland between France and Germany just after the First World War. Clearly there is still a lot of animosity between the two countrymen even though the decision to declare war had been made on a governmental level but why did the people cooperate?. The regional coal field is exploited by a French mine and an adjacent German one. The French part is afflicted by gas pockets and eventually a huge explosion occurs which leaves many French miners trapped. The subsequent rescue operation requires special equipment notably oxygen masks. The German miners realize the general shortage of such equipment and spontaneously send their own rescue teams to the disaster area. There are some original features such as the underground gates separating the German and French galleries. The shots actually give you the feeling of being present in the mine and this is even more supported by the blackandwhite display. We witness the miserable life of the miners and their families in general and not restricted to just the times of disaster. Then after the completion of the rescue operation there is a fraternization between all the miners. Pitman is pitman. Another interesting feature about this film is its cultural kinship with the later Bolshewist films notably the ones from EastGermany for instance Sonnensucher about a uranium mine. A not so hidden message is that workers are mostly good and leaders are usually corrupt. Now there is some truth in the existence of professional deformations but the Bolshewist film makers transformed it into a blatant dogma. Pabst manages to mediate the message in a credible form without creating caricatures. So in my opinion it is an enjoyable and historically important film. A documentary akin to Kameradschaft and about the same period is Ellende in de Borinage of Joris Ivens. You can also consider Germinal Subterra Matewan or the more recent Harlan County War. If you like social films consider seeing my other reviews.".

	schema:reviewBody "I already know that I can't add anything to those who have already reviewed this film...and why not  you say??? Because I saw it about 30 years ago on VHS and haven't seen it since so I would be woefully remiss on the details. YET....I NEVER forgot it and have told NUMEROUS people to REMEMBER THE NAME back in my day it was Kameradschaft and not Comradeship as it is known today in case by some chance SOMEWHERE they may stumble upon it. I myself stumbled upon it in the foreign films section of the video store and I had never seen it anywhere since until a few used VHS tapes came onto Amazon. The only reason I picked it up was because it was from something like Janus Films or the Criterion Collection or something of the sort and I figured if it were from 1931 and they obviously reissued it then it must be pretty decent. So I read the liner notes on the back of the box because they're always so perfectly accurate in their critique of the film...please note heavy sarcasm and it seemed like a very interesting premise. I was sold enough to give it a shot. It remains one of the films I STILL talk about to this very day and even tried listing it on my Facebook profile but of course Facebook apparently never heard of it either and there was no cover page so I had to list it as one of my favorite films with a picture of a strip of film instead of a cover. LOL. Anyway...I digress.Here's the main reason I'm writing. Something I saw on TV tonight triggered my memory of this film so I decided to see what IMDb reviewers had to say about it...ALL 9 OF THEM. Sheesh I wish we could get the word out. Be that as it may I was happy to see how it got such good reviews. Now here's the REAL reason I'm writing...one of the reviewers wrote...and here's the spoiler alert Note Apparently the ending is cut on most prints where the French rebuild the mining gate closing off the men once again. This is a brutal turn of events and may have made the film a better overall film but I would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence so in short I'm glad it was clipped.. I have no beef with the reviewer because I can see how he or she could feel that way. However I myself DID find the ending of the ONLY version of the film I have seen where they DID close off the connection of the two mines once again to be the major STRENGTH of the film and I was SHOCKED that it had been cut from later versions. To me it DID make it a better overall film because the ending seemed AMAZINGLY profound to me and one I NEVER forgot. Although the upbeat ending will appeal to many I thought the original ending was EXTREMELY POWERFUL because I just shook my head in sad disbelief that the wall was shown being sealed off again not even a gate but rather a large steel opaque plate. I took this as the filmmaker's way of adding a really stunning twist to the plot and at the same time saying WAKE UP PEOPLE!!! DON'T YOU SEE WHAT JERKS YOU ARE BEING??? And to me THAT is what both impressed me about the screenplay AND moved me emotionally although there were PLENTY of emotionally moving scenes in this film all in one jawdropping brief final shot did I really just see what I thought I saw???So...I'm happy to provide another good review for this film in whatever version you see and I hope my take on the ending is food for thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kameradschaft or Grubentragdie or Comradeship is a German 85minute sound film from 1931 so it has its 85th anniversary already this year. I don't think I know any of the cast but director Georg Wilhelm Pabst is fairly known even today still almost a century later. This film was made between the two World Wars of the 20th century and focuses on comradeship between French and German miners when one groups helps out the other as they are in deadly danger being stuck under the earth. And it is not just about this and about the idea of helping others in need no matter where they come from but there are scenes early on as well in which the two groups get along well despite their different nationalities for example at a party or one group warning the other of a fire. Professional solidarity is more important than xenophobia. You can probably imagine very well what the Nazis thought of this concept and film.Unfortunately this blackandwhite film does not elaborate convincingly on this pretty interesting premise. Quite a shame as there really was the possibility of a fairly great film here. But none of the characters and the plot in details turned out interesting. You can't blame one person or group for that but as a whole it just didn't work out. Oh yeah this film is listed as French here but I am not sure about that. The language was almost exclusively German in the version I saw. The director is German and so are the writers. The actors with the most screen time are all German too as the film focuses on the German perspective of the tragedy. So if you speak German you won't need subtitles at least not for the version I saw. If you are French or English or anything else subtitles will be a great help. Then again you should not really watch the film anyway. Not a particularly rewarding watch and I do not recommend it.".

Two decades pass and Barnabas Johnny Depp has the world at his feetor at least the town of Collinsport Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor Barnabas is rich powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard Eva Green. A witch in every sense of the word Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death turning him into a vampire and then burying him alive. Two centuries later Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his oncegrand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better each harboring their own dark secrets.

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Burton is probably one of the best choices to direct a Dark Shadows movie. He's always good at making Dark Gothic films and everyone's expecting it to be something like Sweeney Todd and Sleepy Hollow. Instead it has a hybrid of Corpse Bride and Beetlejuice. It begins with decent gloominess but the rest is scattered with groovy soundtrack and colorful images. But that may not be the problem. It's actually pretty good at recapturing the 70's. The main problem is the plot development. It's fun but also disappointing.It looks promising in the beginning. Tim Burton uses his campy directing style which made the intro intriguing. It get silly when Barnabas returns from his grave. Exploring the changes of his town. It's quite funny and delightful. There's a good character development in this that made it entertaining. Johnny Depp gives a delightful performance as Barnabas Collins. Eva Green is quite menacing as Angelique. Jackie Earle Haley and Helena Bonham Carter are the extra comic relief. Chlo Moretz is always good at bad girl roles.There's a lot of fun going on but in the end the experience feels like something's missing. It could have been an interesting story but it ends pretty lazy. There are couple of senseless twists that aren't consistent. At least there is something good in the filmmaking. The production design is quite decent and sometimes unlikely colorful. Postmodern music are played often which made Danny Elfman's music score hard to notice. But these merits can't fix the film's storytelling.Dark Shadows is undeniably entertaining and nothing else. There are things that could have been better. I don't think the colorful groovy look is the problem. It just needs a better ending that gives consistency to the story. People can still give it a try for its camp. There's a true vampire here that is nothing like our modern vampires. Dark Shadows is not bad. It's just unsatisfying. It has the color life and all but what's missing is a proper plot development.".

I wonder if Depp was watching the same series I was. As much as I loved the original Barnabas I see no trace of the character in his interpretation. Frankly the minute he murdered Julia the whole movie collapsed for me  the implied oral sex scene was bad enough but the killing finished it. In the House of Dark Shadows bigscreen remake this was accepted by fans because the series was still ongoing. Depp does not have that salvation.I really don't care that she's alive for the sequel. I doubt there will be a sequel. If there is it's still not the characters I grew up with. However we're supposed to be reviewing what the film is not what it's not. What it is is an overstuffed suitcase that somebody sat on in order to zip it shut. It spills out all over everywhere. The cohesiveness is forced. The characters are largely unrecognizable.

What can you say about a movie that only comes to life in it's montages set to a pop songs from the early 1970's? Depp doesn't even attempt to capture any of the guilt ridden angst of Barnabas Collins. His Barnabas is a trick or treat Pirates of the Caribbean very much like a kid playing dress up on Halloween and with two emotions upset and more upset. Film has some nice set pieces but Burton doesn't bring any true Gothic feeling or sense of dread to the surroundings. The script has that throw everything up against the wall and see what sticks feel to it. Burtons direction comes off in a conveyor belt okay let's shoot this one tone with interest only in visuals which are striking. He's really more of a visual artist than he is a film director. Indeed one gets the feeling that this film would never have been made if not for Johnny Depp and his love for the original series which is evident here. It's unfortunate that he relies too heavily on make up to carry his performance. Helean Bonham Carter has no interest in being in the film and it shows doing it only as a favor to her husband. Eva Green is the type of actress Tim Burton is attracted to and loves to cast in his films but she possesses little of Angelique's spellbinding jealousy. The only one in the cast that has a hint of what these surroundings should be played like is Michelle Pfeiffer.

Based on a soap opera Burton doesn't seem to know what to do. It changes tone dramatically from obvious humour involving Depp's character waking up after 200 years of being buried and being confused by things such as television. To grisly kills where he takes out innocent victims. There are a whole cast of characters each one is given their own story but none of them are given enough time to develop. Miller Carter Heathcote are all wasted as are their stories. I didn't even get the point of Miller which is a shame because he was great with what he had. Entire scenes have no place in the film or are needlessly long and repetitive. The main plot seems to have Eva Green asking Depp to be hers and him rejecting her over and over and over again. It really does feel like snippets from a soap opera condensed down. This is really just a clip show. By the end it starts pulling things out of its backside. Couldn't care for anybody in this film and think the original property should have just been left alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lets be frank. If you had a dime for every time Hollywood took something dusty and old and tried to turn it into something shiny and new you could retire.In fact most of these attempts barely work. But having seen this one front to back three times since its first release I believe this is an exception and moreover I believe that viewers have become so jaded to these attempts that they instinctively rebelled against the film hence the low rating without even giving it a chance.The script by Seth GrahameSmith is witty and clever and engaging.

If you had a dime for every time Hollywood took something dusty and old and tried to turn it into something shiny and new you could retire.In fact most of these attempts barely work. But having seen this one front to back three times since its first release I believe this is an exception and moreover I believe that viewers have become so jaded to these attempts that they instinctively rebelled against the film hence the low rating without even giving it a chance.The script by Seth GrahameSmith is witty and clever and engaging.

I think in this situation I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda no attachments. That being said this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless he forgot he was making a film. It's a simple and fun idea but it feels like ego and showiness kept them from making the plot even make sense. We get it Tim! You are weird! Don't ruin a good performance by Depp and a fun idea for a film because you have to live up to your own Gothic standards. Grow up. So much talent is wasted on these films having the same look cast and feel to them. Take that talent and make something fresh! Stretch yourself just a tad out of that Hot Topic comfort zone will ya? This movie was long boring and ruined. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer. By the way.... wasn't this supposed to be the 70's? Other than a shot or two of trees and a hippie van it was just like the set of Sweeney Todd. The whole film felt like London in the 40's. That's bad film making whether your name is Tim Burton or not.".

The script relies too much on gags some funny and some rather lame. The basic characters are mostly here with the exception of the melding of Maggie Evans into Victoria Winters and the actor playing Willie Loomis does a better job with the character than did the one from the 1991 revival who chose or was directed to play the role as a halfwit.The one element I disliked about the revival. The 1970s music cars costumes and hairdos are spoton and add to the comfy 1970s feel of the piece. The climax is all special effects and one revelation of the plot is so absurdly done here that it is unintentionally laughable. In all I would say that this film may appeal more to those who never saw any of the original versions of this than the fans of them. I didn't hate this film I just didn't love it either.".

He does it well great in fact but that's not a reason to make a movie. This was very much a disappointment. Too much happens too quickly and other things happen without much thought. Characters are not defined and Michelle Pfeiffer and Jackie Earle Haley are wasted. We have a vampire witch ghosts and a werewolf and not much scare or many laughs.. a few chuckles at the 'fishoutofwater' aspect but Austin Powers was funnier and more poignant. I didn't understand the motivations for any of the characters except the witch who curses Barnabas to be a vampire... he essentially uses his servant girl for sex then falls in love with another woman no wonder she wanted revenge. This was a disjointed piece of distraction. Barnabas kills a bunch of construction workers which has some scares then he kills hippies for laughs. He complains that killing is destroying his soul but we don't see any reason to believe that. The sets and costumes are excellent as is the cinematography. The only thing missing is a well thought out story. The final shot suggests a sequel... which would be a curse.".

	schema:reviewBody "While it had a bit of a slow start with technical limitations being obvious and the characters not being as interesting from the moment it switched to colour and introduced its most iconic character Barnabas Collins unforgettably played by Jonathan Frid the 1966 'Dark Shadows' is a classic.It is easy to see why it was so popular back in its day and it is equally easy to see why it is remembered so fondly now. Despite its flaws which were forgivable in a way this reviewer spent many days and hours watching it with sheer joy it really helping me get through many stressful and mentally straining times this year at music college though there were many great times too and saw a huge progression and several seemingly impossible achievements.Sadly this 2012 film version of 'Dark Shadows' was hugely disappointing. As an adaptation of the show it just doesn't compare and understandably can and has been be seen as a travesty to diehard fans. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp apparently claim to be fans of 'Dark Shadows' but to me that wasn't obvious at all. There was more of a sense that Burton hadn't even seen the show seeing as the tone and spirit feels completely wrong or he thought he could improve upon it.On its own as a film it has its good points but several major flaws that to be honest for this reviewer were more obvious. It is a shame as I am a fan of Burton's 80s and 90s stuff especially 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood' which are two of my alltime favourites but after his career lowpoint 'Planet of the Apes' he became hitandmiss. While it is better than 'Planet of the Apes' along with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' and 'Alice in Wonderland' 'Dark Shadows' is very much a lesser effort from Burton.There are good things. It does look great with splendidly Gothic and vibrantly colourful sets wonderful and atmospheric use of colours effectively ghoulish makeup and appropriately kooky costumes that suited the characters very well while it's beautifully and stylishly photographed as well. The music score is groovy rousingly orchestrated haunting and a long way from forgettable or generic if not one of Danny Elfman's best or most inspired scores with some clever song choices. There are some amusing wellwritten lines in the script loved the line about Alice Cooper and it is most successful when Barnabas is struggling to fit in and a few of the cast acquit themselves well.Johnny Depp is no Jonathan Frid and he has given better performances though also much worse it is one of his better performances in any of his later collaborations with Burton but he is clearly having a lot of fun as Barnabas without overdoing it and is one of the most involved members of the cast he also is very charismatic. Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the most successful at injecting a genuine and faithful personality while Eva Green is both sexy and intense. Cameos by Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper are wellutilised.Unfortunately a number of the cast don't come off well. Jackie Earl Haley who is very good at being menacing and sometimes lowkey if he needs to be looked bored in a role that is so much in the background that there was almost no need for him. Helena Bonham Carter overdoes it and comes over as out of place while Chloe Grace Moretz is irritating in a negatively stereotypical role. Much of the acting is either overcompensated and bland being able to do very little to nothing with their dull and often unrecognisable in personality characters and while it was interesting to see Frid his appearance is far too short to leave a lasting impression. The chemistry between the characters one of the show's biggest strengths is barely there.'Dark Shadows' script has its moments but these moments are too sporadic. Tonally it is very unfocused and muddled too often it rarely seems to know whether to be eccentric comedy or fullblown melodrama. It attempts to do both amongst others and never completely succeeds at either the comedy is too sporadic and can be childish and overdone and the melodrama is unmoving and overwrought. Storywise it's a mess it never really comes to life has twists that come out of nowhere and are completely misplaced especially the werewolf subplot parts that drag endlessly and contribute very little to the plot and parts that looked alright on paper but executed in a halfbaked way.As a result the Gothic atmosphere is almost completely lost with it only being obvious in the production values while the sex scene choreographed to Barry White is too broad and overlywild and the ending is overblown to ridiculous extremes. Burton's direction does well with the style is but severely lacking in the story and the substance where there is a complete lack of heart and soul.Overall not awful but disappoints hugely both as a standalone and especially as an adaptation of a classic show. 510 Bethany Cox".

When a film stays in my head I know it's made an impression and again Tim and Johnny have done just that. I can replay most of the movie in my head. Everyone is the way you'd expect their character to be and they are all excellent in their roles. They've made a film that will appeal to a wide range of audiences. When Barnabas hypnotizes someone you believe he's doing it. Johnny is amazing again! The sex scenes such as they are imply rather than show anything but the expressions on Barnabas' and Angelique's faces tell you a lot. The story is ahem fleshed out rather nicely as everything is explained in due time and you're not hit over the head with stupid jokes. There is a good balance of humor and drama and even a bit of sweetness when Barnabas is with Victoria Winters but not the kind that is sappy. Barnabas does reveal who his to Elizabeth but how this transpires and what it leads to is interesting and not played for laughs. Michelle gets Elizabeth and even her false eyelashes are a nod to the original TV show actress' look. The costumes! Colleen Atwood has done it again. 'Nuf said. There are Sleepy Hollowlike elements in the use and look of the blood the horror elements like when he kills and can I mention the fangs? They come out when he's about to dine. They're marvelous! I will probably see this again with some friends as I'd like to see Dark Shadows in IMAX because heck IMAX is wonderful. My recommendation Go see it! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Dark Shadows opened to an eagerly awaiting audience of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans. Based on the ABC daytime show which aired during the late 1960s which generated a cult following what was taken seriously in the late 60s  early 70s comes across as comedy today. The majority of the movie is set in 1972 and incorporates music from the Moody Blues Nights in White Satin with appearances by Karen Carpenter in a TV scene a cameo appearance by Alice Cooper and appearances by four of the original Dark Shadows actors including Jonathan Frid who passed away shortly after filming. Rated PG13 for comic horror violence sexual content  drug use language and smoking one of our 14yearold critics Raven Devanney rated it 6 out of 5 stars for ages 13 and up. Here's her take Dark Shadows Reviewed by Raven Devanney httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vc2NE6UPSLcM Dark Shadows is a hilarious movie about a man named Barnibus Collins who is cursed by an evil witch when he refuses to give her his love. Turned into a vampire Barnibus is locked away in a coffin for two centuries. Now freed by unsuspecting construction workers Barnibus finds that his home town of Collins Port has drastically changed. He must learn to fit into the 70s while protecting his family restoring Collins Port to its former glory and riding himself of the evil witch Angelique who cursed him to be a creature forced to hide in dark shadows. I absolutely loved this movie. Johnny Depp who plays Barnibus Collins did fantastic! Johnny is one of my all time favorite actors and when he teams up with director Tim Burton you know it's a film worth seeing. The cinematography was great because of the gloominess that you will often find in Tim Burton's films but they found a flawless way to thrown in the bright colors of the 70's. The special effects were great too especially in the end when Angelique's skin started to crack she really looked as if she was made out of porcelain. Something that did bother me about the visuals was that the blood in the film looked way to fake considering that it is a vampire movie. My favorite character would have to be that daughter of the Collins family played by Chloe Moretz. One she is my favorite young actress two she played a moody mellow dramatic angsty teenager perfectly. The acting in this film was priceless because there was a lot of over acting but not in a cheesy way it was done very purposefully and it gave a wonderful comedic feel to dramatic situations. I suggest this film for ages 13 and up because of sexual situations mild drug use and language. I would give this film 6 out of 5 stars because it far surpassed my expectations!".

	schema:headline " Absolutely great opening scene then terrible!";
	schema:reviewBody "Warning a few spoilers but nothing about the ending I have been a fan of Dark Shadows since the days of the late 1960's and running home from school to catch the show when I was 9. I tried to go into this with an open mind. I promised myself that I would realize this was not going to be my beloved Dark Shadows but hopefully something of value to see. The entire opening sequence where young Barnabas leaves for the United States to the building of the Collinwood estate to Josette's jump off of widow's hill had me cheering in my seatYES this was going to be fantastic though all of the opening storyline was terribly rushed including Angelique putting the curse on Barnabas.Then Johnny Depp Barnabas was released from his coffin in 1972. And from that point on which was most of the movie really I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen. I find it very hard to believe that Depp and Burton were also kids like me who ran home to see the original series. Why did they take this direction? I mean panties on Barnabas' face in his coffin? Carolyn saying Yeah I am a werewolf get over it when the entire movie we knew nothing of her being a werewolf? I was never so ashamed of Burton and Depp like I was today.The original cast members are there for about 23 seconds walking into a party and in the background again for 2 seconds for a shot. They were flown to England to do cameos. For 23 seconds? I mean come on! And the humor some jokes were just plain awful.If Burton and Depp had taken the route they took with Sleepy Hollow this could have been one of the best stories in film this year. If they had stayed with the feeling one got in the first 7 or 8 minutesthis could have been an absolutely fantastic horror movie. Instead it not only insults rather than respects Dark Shadows fans but it completely loses that great feeling that was there for the opening sequence which I loved when Depp is telling the history of the Collins family.I was turned off by the rock music at the very end why not have all the credits playing some of the original Dark Shadows music and why couldn't Danny Elfman interweave the main theme of the original into his music somewhere. Instead the action scenes had that Mars Attacks opening credits type score which I do love but not here. The opening credits instead of a good horror score had the Moody Blues? Geeeez! And Alice Cooper at a party given by the grand Elizabeth Stoddard? Unbelievable. I think someone like Glen Close or even Judy Dench would have played a better head of Collinwood Phiffer was just too young even though she did a decent job and tried but all she had were bad lines to work with. Barnabas not having to sleep during the day in his coffin but using a hat and umbrella with dark glasses to keep out the sun and the light? And couldn't Burton take a break from all the white faces again and again and again?I find it hard to believe that some 18 of people gave this a 10. I guess these must be under 18. I can assure you than anyone who knows anything about the original Dark Shadows did not give this a 10. Why didn't they just make a vampire movie and leave Dark Shadows out of it and let someone make a real Dark Shadows film? If you want to see what Dark Shadows was and why it was so beloved see the original film from MGM with the television series cast House of Dark Shadows. I hear Warner is going to release it at the same time they release this new piece of junk on video.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess I will start out by saying that I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and that I even like some of Tim Burton's works Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas. However that being said I did not like this film all that much. If you are looking for some comedy in this film then go and watch the trailer because most of the funny parts are in it. I understand that this film was supposed to be a spoof of the soap opera that appeared in the 1970's but it really fell short of my expectations. I remember being in elementary school and rushing home to see what was happening on Dark Shadows. In this film not only did I not want to see what happens next I really didn't care. Johnny Depp Barnabas Collins once again embraced his character and does a really fine job of making the character believable but the content just wasn't there. I don't think that this film ever decided what it wanted to be when it grew up. There were elements of comedy horror drama and even a little romance. There was some jostling around in this film between Barnabas and Angelique Eva Green but you could almost sense the wires that the actors were tied to. And is it just me or does Bella Heathcote Victoria WintersJosette DuPres look a little like Anne Hathaway? Victoria and David Collins Gulliver McGrath gave a whole new meaning to the phrase I see dead people. I guess my favorite character in the film was Willie Jackie Earle Haley who was Barnabas' sidekick. He was fun to watch even though he did not have many lines thank goodness. This film may end up sucking the life out of your expectations. By the time you get to the end of the film things get downright silly and stupid. The last ten minutes of the film I kept thinking to myself .. oh brother. Also at the end of the film there was almost a hint of a sequel man I sure hope not. Not all of the DeppBurton collaborations have been successful and this is one of them. If you just want to see Johnny Depp on the big screen then by old means go. However I think that this film should be locked in a box redbox. As sure as my blood is red so is the light for this film.".

Then I saw the preview and  for the first half was pleasantly surprised.It begins in Liverpool in 1752 when the Collins family dad mom and young son Barnabas immigrate to the United States and settle in Maine. There they establish a fishing business and soon are the richest people in Collinsport. As a young man Barnabas Depp woos a scullery maid Angelique Bouchard Eva Green Casino Royale The Golden Compass but refuses to marry or even acknowledge his love for her.Ticked as ANY woman would be under these circumstances she uses her substantial witchcraft powers to cause the death of his beloved fiance turn him into a vampire and have the townspeople bury him alive. Almost 200 years later a construction crew inadvertently unearths the coffin and Barnabas now must face life in 1972.These scenes are easily the movie's best as he tries to deal with the trappings of modern society the sights sounds technology and mores.

Their only assets being a brokendown cannery and a few feeble fishing boats. Meanwhile Angelique is still alive and controls most of the fishing fleets in the town and is rich beyond imagination.Using a hidden treasure trove Barnabas restores the Collins' wealth and prestige which sets up the conflict in which Barnabas battles his former trollop for control of his business his soul and his family legacy. His efforts to fight this imposing demonic figure and to continue to get used to things in the seventies spark some genuine laughs as does his initial introduction to the ridiculous household.Things begin to go South however when there are several real and not very funny killings hey Barnabas IS a vampire after all and he NEEDS blood. It's just most of these characters were actually interesting including a group who just wanted to help him out of a tough situation. The inclusion of these mass murder scenes was not charming or darklyhumored just disturbing.Then there is the introduction of a few supernatural monsters that turn up muddle the conclusion present really lame and notsospecial effects and end up not resolving much of anything.And while Depp remains true to his Willy WonkaJack SparrowMichael Jackson motif character hybrid he seems to have established in recent efforts Burton's quirky and slipshod direction has never been more evident  or glaring here. The only thing I can write about this picture that was consistently terrific was the soundtrack. From Nights In White Satin to Bang a Gong to Theme From 'A Summer Place' to My First My Last My Everything to Crocodile Rock to Top Of the World to No More Mr. Nice Guy as sung by Alice Cooper in an amusing cameo these tunes  while not ALL from 1972  still had me humming along and enjoying the show.I just wish the rest of the film would have had the same effect on me.".

The inclusion of these mass murder scenes was not charming or darklyhumored just disturbing.Then there is the introduction of a few supernatural monsters that turn up muddle the conclusion present really lame and notsospecial effects and end up not resolving much of anything.And while Depp remains true to his Willy WonkaJack SparrowMichael Jackson motif character hybrid he seems to have established in recent efforts Burton's quirky and slipshod direction has never been more evident  or glaring here. The only thing I can write about this picture that was consistently terrific was the soundtrack. From Nights In White Satin to Bang a Gong to Theme From 'A Summer Place' to My First My Last My Everything to Crocodile Rock to Top Of the World to No More Mr. Nice Guy as sung by Alice Cooper in an amusing cameo these tunes  while not ALL from 1972  still had me humming along and enjoying the show.I just wish the rest of the film would have had the same effect on me.";

Tim has done some great work  Sleepy Hollow is a favorite of mine except the scene with the old witch who was a talking skull whose eyes and tongue popped out stupid this was a great film. Once I heard Tim was on board I knew the stupidity would commence and the film would be ruined. I really hoped Depp wouldn't allow Stupid Burton Tricks in this film. They were both supposed to be fans of the show. Clearly they weren't. They just made the claim to win over TRUE Dark Shadows fans. It is unfortunate that Depp allowed Burton to ruin what could have been a great film. It's unfortunate Burton was ever signed on to the project.The other reviews here give enough examples of the stupidity I refer to. I had hopes for new blood for Dark Shadows. A new future with new stories. Now I can only hope we won't have to endure a sequel as well.Thanks Tim for driving a stake through the heart of my childhood memories.".

It bears VERY little resemblance to ANY of the original series or movie and that resemblance is only in the names of the characters. How a Gothic romance horror can be turned into this joke of a movie is beyond my ability to comprehend. there was no horror and very little goth or romance. I understand the need to modernize a movie to make it appealing to a different generation but this is not modernization it is butchery. Would you approve of the works of Shakespeare being butchered in such a way? The tell tale heart turned into a comedy with NO resemblance to the original work? No.. My advice to all those who loved the original series OR the original movie? No not watch this you will wrists before the movie is even 12 way through. And Tim Burton? Jonny Depp? I am ashamed and appalled to EVER call you great after what you did to this story...".

	schema:reviewBody "While I can forgive Tim Burton a great many INSTANCES of narrative sloppiness because he is FAMOUS for being a style over substance kind of storyteller this film is a unmitigated failure on almost every level and if there is justice in the world should end the partnership of Burton and Depp. And why? Because1. Barnabas is a weak protagonist. He is presented in the wholly unnecessary prologue as inheriting wealth. He doesn't desire ANYTHING. They say he preserved the Collins fortune but we don't see it. We see him making vague shallow investigations into The Dark Arts but we never see anything come of it. for example Mephistopheles is not the name of the Devil. Neither incidentally is Azazel Adramelech Aschema Beelzebub Belphigor... These are all names of demons. And I am no student of the dark arts by any means. I'm just a researcher at best.Barnabas is merely a cold fish who spurns a lover... who happens to have much more power than he imagines. And too bad for him.But who is the protagonist if not him? As near as I can tell it's the witch. She's the plucky adventurer who pulled her self up by her boot straps. She's the one with specific goals and drive and passion. She's the one with the perfect breasts.2. The story elements are muddled with too much of everything and not enough of anything. Element one witchcraft. Element two vampirism. Element three seeing ghosts. Element four lycanthropy. Element five child neglect and abuse. Element six seventies concerns like the president the war as well small town commerce and politics. Each element is mentioned in a slapdash superficial referential way. They are not made to matter. Any story problem is literally solved by 'handwaving'. Barnabas needs a servant so he wiggles his fingers and voil loyal slightly stupid butlerchauffeur. He needs to hire a flotilla of fishing boats and he overcomes the wise old captain with more or less exactly the same method of jazz handsNosferatu fingers. And nobody else seems to notice the shenanigans or care. This is actually an epidemic in the film. The Good Doctor discovers there's a vampire in her immediate vicinity and yet she is easily mollified with be fascinated. Ol' Barnyboy lights himself on fire by standing in a sunbeam and everybody kinda shrugs and moves along.3. Nobody... expects the Spanish Inquisition. Also nobody says 'no' to Eva Green's breasts. They're like the two towers YOU. SHALL. NOT. PASS! And so you see how hamfisted cultural references just isn't funny. Spoiler Alert Alice Cooper is in the film. Spoiler Alert  2 Alice Cooper is played by a dude named Vincent Damon Furnier. Spoiler Alert  3 Barnabas thinks Alice is the ugliest woman ever. This is an old joke. It's such an old joke it makes you remember how young you were when you first heard the joke... and then you get depressed about how old you are now. Referential humour is like salt a dash gives you seasoning a lot gives you a coronary. My chest hurts.4. What does Barnabas want? Success and True Love. So he nips down to the larder and rustles up some jewelry. How does that work exactly? you want to refurbish your home? Nifty! We take cash Visa and rubies...? We never see him working for his success. Rather it just happens. And nobody seems to notice. Similarly the way he goes about courting Josette 2.0 Victoriaifthatreallyishername leaves much to be desired. I've been in love a couple of times. Funny thing the girl I FIRST fell in love with... I still think about her now. A decade later. I wonder how she is. I sometimes hear her voice on the breeze. And when I was still with her well... I thought of nothing else. I ate and drank and slept her. Love was an all consuming passion. Barnabas rather forgets Whatsherface. He's too busy making clueless ball jokes that ACDC made in 1976. And eating hippies and who doesn't eat hippies? And killing the doctor again nobody goes Hey that perpetually drunk quasisomnambulist psychiatrist woman... where did she go...!?.How much better if he spent his time wisely either menacing his swornenemywholockedhiminboxfortwocenturies... or wooing the lady he claims to love? But no. There's none of that. He even took time out of his not very busy schedule to hatefk his nemesis. At least that's what I think they were doing. They destroyed her office but kept their clothes on. Not even a frond of his elegant HipsterGothic hairdo was out of place after. And it was risible and not at all erotic.Don't get me wrong if Eva Green professed undying love for me and offered her undying body to me I'm pretty sure I could play along at least for a bit. But then she hasn't killed my true love and my parents and destroyed my family's name and business or oh yeah locked me in a casket for two hundred years. So there's that.The problems of the film can be enunciated in two clear flaws. 1. When you consistently make style over substance films you become a prisoner of your style. So in the final scene where Barnabas lies at the bottom of the cliff with his now transformedlover I don't think oh! How romantic!. I think holy poopskates! It's the chick from Corpse Bride!2. A vanity project almost always comes off as vain even pointless. And who wants a pointless vampire movie?In the end I could have saved myself 31.50 and stared at a dreamy poster of Johnny Depp... Or that chick from Corpse Bride.I give it two stars one for each of Eva Green's arresting... eyes. got ya!".

He has married a fine woman and they have raised a fine son. He is no friend of the Party however and is being asked some rather direct questions about why he is still not a member. His employer too makes it quite plain that without Party membership future employment with the firm just might become difficult.His wife's brother Kurt has fled the country for being a subversive and this connection does not help Hans's parlous situation.After the brother secretly returns to Germany to continue his role as a militant he comes to Hans for a request. His expertise is needed to repair the broken printing press which the group uses to publish their subversive pamphlets. Oh dear and just when life was looking up too. He decides to take the chance and all would have been fine until one evening when young Hellmuth his son is stuck for the answer to a crossword puzzle. Consulting the family dictionary he finds more than the answer for hidden in its pages is a pamphlet. And as a loyal Hitler Youth member he must of course consult the authorities.This movie is told in flashback from Hans's prison cell. It is a tragic but ultimately uplifting story of forgiveness which again becomes a metaphor for Germany's rise from the ashes. There is a particularly beautiful scene in the end which has the son and his bride to be unknowingly mirroring the actions of his parents so many years before. The son and his bride come to a fork in a country road and they follow it to the left. Years ago his parents had wandered this very same road but their path led to the right.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rotation is a German movie from 1949 and that year Germany was separated into two countries so this one is officially an East German production. The director is Wolfgang Staudte and he is also one of the writers. The other two are Austrian Erwin Klein and Staudte's father Fritz. As this movie will soon have its 70th anniversary it is a blackandwhite film of course ignoring the color propaganda films from Nazi Germany and it has sound which was really common already even in the 1940s. The main character is played by Paul Esser who was in his mid30s when this film was made and he plays a man who is somehow stuck between his own ideology and the Nazis'. Occasionally he wants to join them and then he does not a couple moments later. Apart from Werner Peters I cannot say that i am familiar with any of the supporting players in here. The most unusual thing about this film we have here is that it has actually a couple sequences that you could almost call action sequences especially for the standards back then. Anyway I was neither too impressed with any of the performances including Esser' nor with the plot and story in general. I have seen a few German films that deal with the subject of coming to terms what happened in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s but those that were made directly after World War II I tend to find fairly ineffective just like this one here. There was never really anything interesting about it that would get you to the edge of your seat and I was kinda glad this film stayed under the 80 minute mark even as it dragged quite a bit nonetheless. I give it a thumbsdown and I cannot agree with the awards recognition or the IMDb rating here. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I literally just came back from a midnight screening of this and I had an amazing time. Craven's managed to reclaim the franchise with a worthy instalment that's a fantastic sequel as well as a quality slasher film in its own right. Honestly speaking there aren't too many surprises to be had in Scream 4. No matter how mordantly selfaware the movies are and believe me Scream 4 gets a little tediously indulgent in its postmodern cleverness there's an inevitable predictability to some of the proceedings but anybody who's a genresavvy horror fan will appreciate how brilliantly everything is executed. The opening sequences for example are one of the best parts of the movie and are a perfect reintroduction to the franchise and while the bulk of the story lags a little it's redeemed by the ballsy ending.The acting is great with the core trio Campbell Arquette and Cox delivering their usual strong performances and the rest of the cast however limited their respective roles are just as entertaining. All you TV buffs there will get a kick out of seeing actors from Heroes Veronica Mars True Blood Mad Men and Community share the silver screen and camp it up. More importantly the film is hilarious and just a whole lot of ridiculous fun. Craven isn't afraid to take the story to some beautifully insane places and the ending was to me perfect. All in all it's a great irreverent slice of horror that's hilarious and true to the franchise. Highly recommended.".

It makes up for the awfulness of Scream 3 and includes many very talented new actors and actresses. I was very surprised to walk into the screening theater and see a fantastic horror film. As soon as the Dimension logo appeared on screen my heart began to race. The opening scene was brutal and hilarious and it was great to see all of the original characters back on the screen again. I found the Wes Craven cameo and was laughing as I spotted it out. This movie was great to watch even though there were some things that needed to be fixed. Very minor problems though. There were some parts in the dialogue that seemed unrealistic Ehren Kruger rewrites but it wasn't a huge deal. Also the ending was kinda long but it was also very suspenseful. I would most definitely recommend this to a friend in search of a good horror movie.".

And most importantly for our enjoyment Scream 4 makes fun of itself before we can get there. Just when you start to roll your eyes they roll their eyes.But it also stands as a good slasher flick  perhaps the LEAST slashery of the lot so far it can't be everything after all but there are plenty of jumpinyourseat moments.The combination of old generation cast and new generation is actually seamless again lots of selfreferencing about that too.The highlights are too many to name  but the opening of the movie will have you laughing far harder than you'd have expected to.Overall Scream 4 is excellent.".

P.S.Go see it with as many friends as possibleit will be fun as hell!".

Scream 4 is more than that while a sequel it feels like a complete new beginning it carried the bad stigma that the failed Scream 3 left behind yet it proved that the series is still relevant and with the adequate script it takes off on a delightful new killing spree.10 years have passed since Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell last encountered the Ghostface killer she has moved on with her life and now dedicates to writing her most intimate memoirs and book touring the country with her publicist making her last stop at her hometown of Woodsboro the place where it all started. Gale Weathers Courteney Cox and Dewey Riley David Arquette are living their peaceful lives in that town the same as Jill Roberts Emma Roberts Kirby Reed Hayden Panettiere and their friends which begin being stalked by a new masked killer.When at it's best Scream 4 manages to make you laugh hysterically but at the same time in the same scene give you heartstopping scares other reviewers think that the only characters you care about are the main threesome Sidney Gale and Dewey but in my opinion it is precisely the new rules factor that make you doubt whether they'll make it or not meanwhile you start caring about the other characters specially Kirby Reed played by Heroes cheerleader Hayden Panettiere who shares her love for horror films with an unusual crush.While some of the decisions made by characters really fall into the dumbblondewhogoesupstairs category it is precisely the killer that takes credit for this decision making since you don't know where he'll pop up next thus making going outside an even scarier choice.Scream 4 is really better thought out than it's predecessor there's no doubt about that this time the gore is even more gruesome the body count is larger and the truth is that you'll never guess who the killer is it really could be anyone and director Wes Craven really makes this a possibility.In the end Scream 4 perfectly combines comedy horror action and drama to create a new formula while not a perfect movie it's shortcomings become less important by one aspect it really doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time it makes a homage of the saga and utilizes itself as a tool to further immortalize the Ghostface killer as one of the most popular icons in the horror genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been too long since Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson teamed up to deliver the goods what with Craven concentrating on his rehash of remakes and Williamson penning the likes of the Vampire Diaries. It has also been too long since a good Scream movie hit theatres after the dreadful Scream 3 passed by in a whimsical so you can imagine my horror when Dimension announced they were reviving the sequel and adding a fourth movie on the end. Not only did I feel that the Scream franchise belonged soley to the 90's and thus it avoided the campy 80's slash era and the 2000's torture gorn obsession I also wondered how on earth would they pull it off after more than ten years since the last intalment. Scream 4 or Scre4m as it is being cleverly marketed follows the usual concept behind a revisited sequel. The main characters from the previous movies end up reuniting for whatever reason the killer has an even more ridiculous motive that is as nonsensical as it is insane or in this case obsessive the body count is once again cranked up and the injoke references are gracelessly thrown in. The result is a good rehash that hovers somewhere between the greatness of Scream and the finely rendered shocks of its first sequel. The plot is fairly thin and sees the series protagonist Sidney Prescott returning to her hometown of Woodsboro following the 10 year anniversary of the famous Woodsboro Murders to promote her new book. Here Sidney's younger cousin Jill excellently portrayed by the fantastic Emma Robertsattends her old high school and the towns sheriff is non only than Dewey Riley who is now married to the cantankerous Gale Weathers. Unfortunately a serial killer cottons on to the fact that Sidney's last stop on her book tour is Woodsboro and takes it upon him or herself to start a new reign of terror evoking horrifying memories for Sidney Dewey and Gale who must once again solve the mystery behind Ghostface.There you have it a simple minded plot that strides on familiar territory whilst managing to twist the story elements enough for the audience to focus on solving the mystery. What Scre4m does well is to build up enough tension for the audience to be scared whilst also being funny enough for the same audience to laugh out loud. There are some genuinely gruesome scenes in this one. The opening is gut wrenching and very well thought out but it is also hilarious and sets the overall blackly comic tone the rest of the movie glides on. The kills are actually quite original and there are plenty of them. The acting borders on very good to corny and wooden as does the writing they had to pull Williamson's script and make changes and this is very noticeable. Overall the cast do a good job especially Neve Campbell who gets stuck into the role once again and Emma Roberts as the lead. She is a great actress and she almost carries the movie when the three headlining stars are out of the picture. It is nice to see Courtney Cox postFriends in her gorgeously overthetop dramatics routine and David Arquette is as campy as ever. The rest of the cast are generally OK especially Hayden Panettiere and Anna Paquin. Rory Culkin also does well filling the shoes of Jamie Kennedy in the comic role.Everything from the script to the direction is carefully painted. You can tell that despite the production problems Craven and Williamson had a blast. They throw in a few nods to recent movies add in the old cat inthecloset scare and even take the pi out of the Saw franchise so Scre4m is as playful and funny as it is scary. Don't get me wrong there are some terrifying moments littered in there but it all comes with a nicely polished laugh track that reminds us why Wes even bothered making the original in the first place. Now for the negatives. Whilst Scre4m makes good use of its young cast it appears that Cox Arquette and Campbell were underused in some scenes. Also Emma Roberts was not given enough screen time which is a shame as she plays a big part in the finale and yet we don't see her develop much as a character. She is just Sids cousin which is odd as she is is supposed to be the new lead. I found Culkins character slightly obnoxious and clich at times but he did a good job with what material he had. The ending was good if not slightly absurd. The killer's motive is obviously well thought out but it seemed a bit far fetched for my liking. Overall though a great movie.So... here it is. Ten years in the making and finally Scre4m is ready for mainstream audiences. Craven and Williamson have crafted together a nice sequel that is funny scary and a LOT better than Scream 3. Here's hoping Scre5m and Scre6m follow this lead.".

This sequel is just as good as the original but double the scares and double the ghost face killings. Its also good to see NeveDavid and Courtney back together again after so many years apart and also Wes craven as the horror director. Plus seeing new faces like Emma Roberts or Hayden Panetierre was a nice touch to the franchise. However i noticed somethings in the movie that MAY have been a little too similar or just very different. Emma Roberts Jill well i found her motive the exact same as Roman's from scream 3 just out of pure jealousy for Sidney. And something was new about Ghostface like before he had to work at his killings by chasing or stabbing the victim a few times before they died except in this movie he stabs the victim once and they just fall which i thought was anticlimaticbut still Scream 4 met my expectations very well and i hope that it makes enough money so there will be a Scream 5".

	schema:headline " Could have been way better but was still fun to watch.";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all I love the original Trilogy of Scream and when I heard that they were making a fourth one and perhaps even a new trilogy I got extremely excited! I literally came on IMDb everyday to check up on news reports and clips for the move and was ecstatic when the first trailer appeared! I ran to the theater once I was able to go and see it and was all jittery with excitement and disbelief that I was actually FINALLY going to see the new movie. I know what you're thinking is he 5 or something? No I'm just a big fan of scream... I was like 4 when the first scream came out though... But anyways once the credits hit I felt very disappointed by how everything turned out. So I made a list as to what I didn't like about the movie  The worst opener in the scream series. The original trilogy was so tragic how the characters died Casey Becker gets killed by ghost face and her parents were so close to saving her Maureen gets killed in a movie theater filled with people who could have helped her but they all thought it was a publicity stunt and Cotton Weary tried desperately to save his girlfriend who attacks him because she was manipulated into thinking he was trying to kill her and eventually they both get killed. This beginning was more comedic and tried to have lots of twists unfortunately it was not surprising since when the girls were killed there acting suddenly became really fake and the killer moved at super speed... I knew it was going to end up being a stab movie and it was stab 6 I remember craven said they're on stab 7 so I knew the next sequence was also a stab movie. then finally we came to the real world and we see these two girls jenny and Marnie talking about the stab movies and then jenny decides to play a prank by pretending she's ghost face on the phone but then Marnie gets killed which you don't see happen and jenny suddenly gets the call and eventually she gets killed herself. Another thing I had a problem with was how the story developed everything was happening really fast and there were no real character development or mystery to it. It was more like hmm I wonder who's killing everyone and BAM people dropping like flies everywhere. One thing that seemed awkward to me was that NONE of the new cast members besides Deputy Judy lived. Which you didn't really care about since none of the characters was developed besides Kirby who I loved but saw her death coming from a mile away which also led to the reveal of the first killer. The other characters I liked were Rebecca who was really fun to watch but she was really stupid why didn't she call the cops while she was locked in the car? and Robbie because he could have easily become Randy 2.0. I also liked detective Hoss but only because he was played by Adam Brody. Another problem was the deaths they weren't creative AT ALL!! The only death I liked watching was Olivia's death because it was the longest and most violent which really made the film appear like it was trying to show how horror is now a days with all the super violence. All the other deaths were basically just a stab to the back or torso and one really dumb stab to the forehead he should have died automatically I mean seriously Hoss gets stabbed in the back and dies instantly but Perkins gets stabbed in the forehead and still manages to say a oneliner!?? Also where is all the catmouse chase scene? There was like one that was sort of a chase scene involving Rebecca in a parking garage. oh BTW when people died in this movie the characters literally reacted for 2 seconds then moved on like nothing happened! Are these people heartless? My last complaint was the killers and their motives. It was pretty obvious that Charlie was one of the killers because he was the only one that wasn't automatically killed by ghost face. He was tied up so that Kirby had to answer some horror movie questions and for the first time ever got the last question right only for her to untie him and get stabbed. Then Jill was the other killer obviously since she was the only character who was still alive and who never got a red herring on her and she kills Charlie and reveals that she wants to be Sidney 2.0 because she wants to be famous LAME! Eventually the dumb bitch gets it and Emma Roberts overacted the ENTIRE scene! She wasn't scary or convincing as a psycho like the previous killers in the trilogy. Also when the movie ended we never got to see an after math it just ends when they finally kill Jill.".

Its been a decade since scream underwhelmed everybody with its lacklustre third instalment and with a fourth on the way I was sceptical about how the fourth would go and how it would affect the introduction to the review I would to write about it.In my second paragraph I can now write about how much I enjoyed the film and how I can now use my summary in that Scream 4 or Scre4mwas great fun and I was pleasantly surprised. I can't begin to tell you how true this statement is the plot manages to weave a tidy little knot of a mystery that comes to a surprising and comical climax. The body count is large making killings in this instalment come thick and fast. Though with a reduced age rating scream 4 is far more gruesome than the previous threesome and a lot more in keeping with the current horror movie gore fest. To finish off the second paragraph of my review I will conclude that Scream manages to stick to its guns but modernise itself not unlike the remakes it satirises.Paragraph 3 contains scenes of critical nature. Now the film is paced very well however there are a lot of characters to get through. And despite its self aware nature the twodimensional characters are so underplayed that its hard to feel much for them as they quickly get stabbed to death. The only characters you feel much dread for is Gale Dewey and Sidney as familiar faces that you don't want to meet there bloody doomhowever the new cast have so little characterisation that you really couldn't care less if their stabbed to death and left to dry on their parents lawns. The film also wasn't as scary as the original and despite the kids knowing the rules of the horror movie they were starring in they all seem to go outside to investigate a strange noise when they know they're all being hunted by a killer. Whether this is done on purpose as to mock other horror films is a possibility but to be honest it would make the film a lot less predictable if they didn't make there predecessors mistakes.So my conclusion is gonna be as sharp and concise as a horror movie should be. Scream 4 is entertaining funny and thrilling. And one of the last lines of one of the survivors is bloody great.".

This specific type of horror movie is in the past and just doesn't keep up to pace with the genre anymore. I wish that the fourth movie hadn't been made at all just in that the third gave a plausible ending and a motion that the characters themselves were ready to move on. I don't think the plot of Scream 4 was good enough to compete with that.".

	schema:reviewBody "It wasn't nearly as deep or character driven as the first two. Pretty much the only character I cared about besides the original trio was Kirby. It didn't take the time to properly flesh out most of the other characters go figure how ironic especially with what was said in the beginning.It didn't take itself anywhere near as serious as I had hoped it would was hoping for a level of seriousness equal to that of S1S2. There were a lot of dead end story lines stuff that was built up but never paid off such as Gale's book and the love triangle.There wasn't much cat  mouse at all if any between the killer and the victims. There was almost no mystery or sense of urgency to figure out who the killer was by any of the characters nice try Gale.When Sidney realized a new killer was starting up she didn't seem to care much at all This should have been an epic and significantly emotional revelation for her. Although Jill turned out to be one sick puppy I never took her seriously as a villain. She's a good actress but when it came time to flip the psycho switch she failed whereas all the other killers hit it perfectly by that I mean it didn't feel real. I don't think it necessarily felt forced but it was definitely on its way.Above all else though it just didn't feel like a true Scream movie. It felt more like an imitation like a Stab film. After all this time I honestly said to myself as I was walking out of the theater... I waited 11 years for this? This was the best they could come up with?To say that I am extremely disappointed would be a massive understatement. This film was a repugnant farce and a slap in the face to the rest of the series and its fans. Shame on Wes Craven and the Weinsteins for butchering Kevin Williamson's script.".

	schema:headline " A Slasher that is going back to the style of the 1st yet it's still predictable";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been a while since I have seen a slasher and Scream for that matter yet here it is years later and finally we are getting back to the roots of the classic slasher. The movie starts out with a couple of funny scenes that lash out at the recent slashers that have been produced and how predictable and cheesy slasher films are but then dives into the clich of slashers starting with two helpless victims. After that we start to get back into the classic killing spree that was seen in the first movie with the addition of a lot more gore. Yes I'm sure we all know that slasher movies are becoming more famous for the increased amounts of blood that are constantly finding their way into the movies these days as well as the increasing use of the F word.So what is good about this movie? In my opinion the best part of this movie is the constant slams on horror movies and how lame they can be. The movie does a good job at mocking the genre and pointing out the goods and bads the genre has to offer which is very satisfying to hear that even directors in this day and age can insult the genre. The second thing I liked about it was the cast did a good job reviving the series. Yes you had the airheads and geek victims that are famous in the genre but the main cast does a good job of playing the concerned victims who fear for their lives. The classic characters of Arquette Cox and Campbell are still strong and play their roles well as the returning survivors. The new cast also does a good job diving into the series playing the roles of popular cheerleaders AV geeks and bad girls who want to have fun. Although a little overacted the new generation has potential for making horror genres return to a classic style instead of turning into the crap we have seen it evolve into. A third positive would be the twist that this movie had to it. As I watched the movie I tried to figure out the identity of the killer or killers of the movie. I started to narrow down the victims and figured out the identity of one of them rather easily. However the other killer was quite a surprise and was a nice twist to the movie instead of just a cheap identity that we had seen in the last two screams. Okay so what about the bad stuff of this movie. Well the first thing I have to say is the excessive amounts of blood seen in this movie. It seems that as technology improves more directors think we need to see lots of blood and intestines. That's not my cup of tea to tell the truth and so I could have done without the excessive spill of red liquid. The second weakness in my opinion is the use of the F word. Again I think that this word is the only vocabulary word the movie world knows and I am getting quite annoyed with hearing it used as much as it is. However if you are not offended or annoyed by the word you won't be too turned off by this movie. A third thing that I felt was weak was the predictability of this movie. Yes it's easy to tell who is going to die and who isn't that's what this movie makes fun of but I found it really easy to predict when things were going to try and scare you. The camera angles the music and so much more gave it away and I was not surprised or scared by any of the tricks they tried to pull though one lady screamed at just about every thing in the movie. Finally the fourth big weakness is the explanation for why the main killer is on the loose. It was lame and kind of cheaply written and could have been much better had they taken more time to write it. Her accomplice had a better motive for killing a few of the victims but still it wasn't the best. Although it is predictable Scream 4 is starting to return back to the classic work of slashers. It's aggressive humor colorful cast and new spin on the mind of the killer made it much better than I had originally intended. However I still don't like the predictability the phony bologna acting on some parts and the weak motif for killing which suggests that more work is needed before we can return to the old favorites. If Wes Craven decides to do another remake then I suggest he work on adding new twists and stop making them so predictable. I recommend this movie for die hard fans of either Scream or Horror films as well as for those who just can't get enough blood in their day. This may also be a movie for fans who like to make fun of horror movies or are looking for a way to kill time in the day. Regardless I give this movie a 7 at the highest. Enjoy.".

	schema:headline " I wanted it to be as good as the original";
	schema:reviewBody "Sce4mAs a huge fan of the 'Scream' franchise I wanted this movie to be just as good as the original trilogy but it really wasn't. The movie lacked the togetherness of the other films. The characters were all split up and frankly completely unoriginal and uninteresting making it hard audience to connect to them and ultimately not caring who lived and died and that included Sydney. There was zero character development through the whole film so you felt exactly the same about the characters when the end credits rolled as you did when they first appeared on screen.Now if you're a fan of the original 'Scream' you know that it had just the right balance of comedy and horror. 'Scre4m' however felt more like another ridiculously stupid 'Scary Movie' with desperate awful actors trying to be funny and failing. Everyone seems to be praising 'Scre4m' for using new up and coming actors but the great thing about the older Scream movies were that they used practically unknown actors and when they used well known ones they killed them off exception being Patrick Dempsey but don't tell me you didn't think he was dead first time you watched Scream 3.Now I don't know about anyone else but did you find Ghostface scary because I thought he was comical. The phone conversations just didn't have the fear factor and originality of the previous films and that really disappointed me because my favourite scene in 'Scream 2' was when Ghostface and Randy were on the phone there was a menacing nature to the humour. When it was finally revealed that Sydney's niece I can't remember her name even though I only watched it four days ago. How many characters can you name not including the originals without looking it up? was the killer it was a great twist but was completely ruined by the fact that her motive was completely pathetic. She wanted fame like seriously what does Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson think about the youth of today? She put me in mind of a Justin Beiber fan on homicidal rampage yes I know that is kind of scary I was waiting on her saying 'I'm killing you so that Justin will know me'.I really thought that there was too much emphasis on technology and the amount of product placement was really distracting. The teens were going on about how the next big thing was the killer needed to be filming the murders. 'Scream 2' anyone? It's already been done who cares if the killers streaming live which to be fair has been in hundreds horror movies in the past 3 years so it's been done this again showing the complete lack of originality of 'Scre4m'. Now saying all that there were things that did in fact make 'Scre4m' semi watchable. I like everyone else had no clue who the killer was in 'Scre4m'. I personally thought it was Trevor andor the blonde cop. I also liked when during the 'Stabathon' when the teens were watching the first 'Stab' movie and they were saying the words at the same time as the characters because how many time have you sat in a room with friends or family watching 'Scream' doing exactly the same thing I know I do it every time I watch it. I also liked Trevor even though I thought he was the killer. The scene when he walked in on Kerby and Charlie was hilarious. So overall I hated 'Scre4m' for it's complete lack of originality and it's overemphasis on comedy rather than horror. On another note did anyone else think the music completely sucked?".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm 23 years old. 12 years ago I watched the original Scream 1996 and it was the first horror movie I enjoyed. It was a landmark in the puberty years of many moviebuffstobe who grew up in the late 1990's good times!. SCREAM 2  3 were released in 1997 and 2000 respectively and although entertaining didn't hold a candle to the original which is fine most sequels don't. Scream 3 in particular lacked Kevin Williamson behind the script and not even Wes Craven could turn what Ehren Kruger wrote into gold meaning a good flick it did make a lot of money though and Parker Posey made it hilarious at moments.So eleven years later a new SCREAM movie comes out reuniting the original director writer and the three survivors of the franchise heroine Sidney Prescott my first movie crush Neve Campbell still naturally beautiful and always a competent actress Dewey David Arquette and Gale Courteney Cox. Die hard fans like me have been waiting for this for a decade and it paid off. Actually it works so well because it was made 11 years after the last installment. The movie is far from perfect obviously but stands as the best of the sequels Scream 2 was above the average but came way too soon and the third one was a wasted opportunity. The tongueincheek humor works for the most part and Williamson knows how to parody a trend that he recreated himself including the ridiculousness of torture porn from the likes of SAW and its annual sequels  movies with no character development in which you don't care who lives or dies. That is the strongest link in this franchise we've come to care about Sidney Dewey and Gale making the SCREAM movies work equally as slashers and satires. Whether or not SCREAM 5  6 will be made it all depends on how much money this will make I'm satisfied with this 4th chapter although I won't deny I will still see another one if Craven Williamson and Campbell are involved. That said it was a nostalgic flick that made me feel like I'm a preteen again. It may be a new generation with new rules but the iPhone generation oughtta know The first rule of remakes you don't f with the original. Bravo Sidney!".

Wes Craven has just exposed himself as a massive lying moneygrabber by even attempting to continue this series. Despite my reservations I did pay good money to go and watch this abomination.With due respect the opening sequence was intelligent and humorous however it went rapidly downhill from there. The film tried extremely hard to make fun at itself to a point that it became quite uncomfortable to watch. For example SPOILER! the scene where the young filmmaker boy gets killed off he decided to pretend that he was gay in a failed attempt to bargain for his life. This was weak and made it unbelievable. It felt more like a scene straight out of Scary Movie 0.5! Other than the poor humour the film's plot and motive of the killer was the weakest of all four films. I mean the other three were farfetched with possibly the most believable of them all being a vengeful mother but this was absolutely ridiculous. A girl who is so fed up of hearing people talk about her infamous estranged cousin that she feels compelled to kill a bunch of people including her own mother is a stretch of even the most impressionable of imaginations. One of the strong points of the film had to be the likability of Hayden Penitieirieire's character who she portrayed quite well and it was also good to see Ms Campbell back on the screen again. Overall I feel that if as has been suggested this film is continued into a Sawlike polygy that things can only get worse.".

It steps far beyond the line between clever and cringeworthy dumb and pointless in the direction of the latter. It attempted to mock the majority of horror movies including its own predecessors far too hard making it difficult to take seriously or even watch at all.The character development of the new generation was poor meaning that it was hard to feel sorry for any of them given the circumstances that surrounded them. Most of the new characters were easily unlikeable. It felt as though their inclusion was purely filler in order to provide a good number of potential victims for Ghostface. The direction was horrific at times  characters showed little if any remorse for their perished peers. No suspense was created toward or during Ghostface's appearances. It was as though even the writers were unsure what they were trying to achieve. They failed miserably in finding the perfect balance of humour and horror instead meshing the two together as one big annoying mess.The music was used at inappropriate moments and was confusing in that it didn't really provide a specific feel for the movie. It was even goofy at times spoiling the atmosphere completely.The film was terribly structured. The last half an hour concluding the film was clumsy and laughable and the choice of killersjust to throw you off and the motives was ridiculous and unbelievable.Poor pacing no tension nonexistent scare factor some bad casting awkward jokes overly selfreferential and a very big anticlimax. Just bad. Some reviewers are saying that fans will appreciate it but I believe that they will be most offended by this train wreck.Don't waste your time.".

So my mom and I rented all three so we could go see the fourth one...I really loved the first one the second one was interesting third one not so much....so I was unsure that the fourth would just be a dumb money maker.

We went to go see the fourth at the movie theatre today...and we loved it almost as much as the amazing first which started it all!! It was so unpredictable the killings were more fresh and original the actors who had had roles before acted as if nothing had ever changed. 11 years?!? Not a chance! They acted as if it was just like 2000 and then 2001! It was amazing...the new actors were just as great...overall a great movie that brings pride to the horror genre. It was awesome!

There are still problems in this movie like how the end drags a little the dialogue could have been better at some points and right after the amazing opening seen it tries it inter dose all the characters again which takes awhile also the kills are all stabs not like saw where bones and blood are flying everywhere. To me i liked the stabbings more than death traps in saw. This movie brings back slashers and puts paranormal activity back in the trash this is good old fashion horrors and the best scream movie and it is better than most reboots which this is. so in the end i have one thing to say go watch SCREAM 4".

Picture it American Indians living in a village of tepees all sound more like professors in a Berlin university.The movie was no doubt intended as a sort of propaganda piece. The positive depiction of American Indians was in stark contrast to the John Wayne movies and so the movie was indirectly denouncing the US.

	schema:reviewBody "Let's try to write this review in style. I do not argue whether Sons of Great Bear 1966 by DEFA is great Movie or not. It's first in row from Gojko Mitic's franchise in Indian Films based mostly on writings by Liselotte WelskopfHenrich. You can check in Wikipedia who that woman is. Despite some inconsistencies she was true German from a beaten generation after the fall of Third Reich in Germany. I wouldn't buy talks that she was Communist because such was reality in those Cold War times. If you don't put your signature under collaborative statement you wouldn't be allowed to travel abroad. Thus you remain peasant and ignorant period. I myself lived through those times and never was Communist.Second thing about the Movie. Since I doubt whether Americans or other English speaking people have watched Gojko Mitic's films and I will reiterate again. Very successful spaghetti western with typical German stamina. The hero is Winnetou type undefeatable macho imaging the noble but dyeing Indian heathen. In the final scene in battle of honor TokeiIhto kills his enemy Red Fox the white Fred Clark then liquidates about 20 adversaries with single pistol and escapes. This is typical Karl May scenario and Liselotte WelskopfHenrich was his staunch student. The chief TokeiIhto or Stone Horn is imaginary taken from Indian painting by George Catlin. But other Sioux chiefs like Tashunka Witko Crazy Horse and Tatanka Yotanka Sitting Bull are real personages. They were massacred in Nebraska during Wounded Knee Incident 1890. Sioux tribe was put in Black Hill reservation and a branch DLakota lead by TokeiIhto fled to Canada unreliable sources.Now let's go to the book trilogy by Liselotte WelskopfHenrich. I wouldn't even imagine say that this was unworthy effort. She studied history and anthropology for 20 years plus before Die Sohne der Grossen Barin appeared in 1951. Courtesy to success of the book she wrote two prequels  Harka der Sohn des Hauptlings 1962 and Top und Harry 1963 which treat earlier periods of life for Harka  TokeiIhto. But Sons of Great Bear is finale and could be read alone. In such order they appeared in Bulgarian a bulk of 1500 pp. and favorite novels for youths. I am not aware whether this great trilogy rival to Winnetou adventures is published in English. Probably not which is a loss.See folks the Indians from Winnetou and TokeiIhto series bear German hearts and if you don't understand the undying German spirit you are in great trouble. I talk this to Nationalists all around the world nowaday. Don't throw Globalization in the garbage bin. Otherwise you risk standing in position like Jack Nicholson yelling  You can't handle the truth  in Few Good Men. See You ...".

Courtesy to success of the book she wrote two prequels  Harka der Sohn des Hauptlings 1962 and Top und Harry 1963 which treat earlier periods of life for Harka  TokeiIhto. But Sons of Great Bear is finale and could be read alone. In such order they appeared in Bulgarian a bulk of 1500 pp. and favorite novels for youths. I am not aware whether this great trilogy rival to Winnetou adventures is published in English. Probably not which is a loss.See folks the Indians from Winnetou and TokeiIhto series bear German hearts and if you don't understand the undying German spirit you are in great trouble. I talk this to Nationalists all around the world nowaday. Don't throw Globalization in the garbage bin. Otherwise you risk standing in position like Jack Nicholson yelling  You can't handle the truth  in Few Good Men. See You ...";

West Germans loved Karl May and Winnetou back then and East Germans watched these similarlythemed movies starring Gojko Mitic as an Indian tribe chief instead. I am not a fan of the Winnetou films and I must say this one here is sadly not any better. There was hardly any memorable moment in here and I felt that Mitic is a much better actor than what he was allowed to put on display here. The costumes are fine and there are moments when the story isn't bad either but overall I must say that this film left a lot to be desired. The action and characters were simply not interesting enough for a film that easily runs for over 90 minutes. Maybe it was good that writer Liselotte WelskopfHenrich screenplay and novel never worked on other films again. It was not a failure but there is not really a reason or aspect good enough either to watch this movie directed by Josef Mach. I give it a thumbsdown.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Micky Irish Ward and his boxing career with his crack addicted brother at his side. Apparently Marky Mark was so hell bent on getting this film made that he stayed in shape for years and years just in case the film went into production. That's dedication and passion for you yet the man still manages to be the weak link. It's not really his fault David O. Russell packed the film with a lot of talent. Christian Bale plays Dicky Ecklund Micky's crack addicted brother who tells the same story over and over again about him knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. It's his claim to fame. There is a film crew following him around he thinks it's going to be about his comeback yet it's really about the harsh realities of crack addiction. Bale again submerses himself in the role. He is pure method. You can not like him as a person or even an actor but you can't deny his passion for the art. He is on the thin side again with thin balding hair and brown teeth. He looks deathly ill in every scene. The man has one of his finest roles to date and will no doubt be nominated come award season. I hope he actually takes home the award. He is without a doubt the most interesting character in the film. Their mother is played by Melissa Leo another performance worthy of recognition come award season. Her desire to see her kids rise to fame blind her from the truth. She denies the drugs and the failures and believes she knows what's best for her kids. This means not letting them get a real chance because it would be with a real manager and she would be left behind. Family is important to her and she wants to keep everyone very close even if it harms their chance at making a name for themselves. She of course doesn't realize this. Amy Adams is the love interest you know there had to be one. She manages to pull Micky away from the family that is dragging him down. They don't like her for it. She has her own inspirations too yet the story isn't interested in them. The main focus of the film is with Micky's bumpy road to the championship fight. Since this is based on a true story I can't really fault it for becoming a bit formulaic and predictable yet it is. David O. Russell is notorious for getting angry and violent with his crewcast. He was in a physical fight with George Clooney on the set of Three Kings and anyone can go on youtube and check out the melt down he and Lily Tomlin had on the set of I Heart Huckabees. Both films coincidentally star Mark Walhberg so it seems he doesn't have a problem working with the combative director. I can't deny that the man has talent. I really love Three Kings and found I Heart Huckabees to be an ambitious project for the sheer weirdness of it all. With The Fighter he plays to a more conventional audience. In terms of boxing films it works. It plays on the down and out character the poverty of his life and the sheer determination he has to make a name for himself. It's no Rocky or as others have mentioned Raging Bull but it is good enough to be mentioned with them.Russell always has an eye for a creative shot. Check out Three Kings colour scheme for what I mean. Here he uses TV cameras for the boxing matches. Interesting move it feels like we are watching it at home and are not really in the ring with them. I admire directors who think outside of the box. Russell does this no problem. He also decides to include real footage of the characters. The film has some home video segments throughout and during the credits we get to meet the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eckland which is even more reason to appreciate Bale's performance. The film trips a bit because of the lack of emotion from Walhberg. I dig the guy and enjoy his films but his range isn't there yet. When given a role that he can play the absurdity of he scores. Watch The Departed for that. For a film where the audience needs to get behind a character to root and cheer for them to overcome their obstacles he falls a little short. Thank goodness the film makes up for this with the performances from Bale and Leo.The Fighter features great music engaging performances and a predictable yet true story. I felt attached to the characters and hoping they would make smart decisions. If a film can get me to care about the characters I say bravo. The Fighter is a winner in my books.".

Wahlberg also produced Entourage and the startling In Treatment. He now produced The Fighter and his performance interior and powerful dominates the film allowing other members of the cast to shine in truly showy roles Christian Bale for instance  really good.

	schema:reviewBody "Does David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' follow the formula of underdog surpassing all obstacles and winning in the end as is the case with this genre? The answer is yes but 'The Fighter' still manages to maintain a unique quality. First of all the four principle characters Micky Dicky Charlene and Alice are unlike anyone one has seen in this kind of film.They are wonderfully defined and the actors who portray them are cast against type and turn in their finest performance. Both Melissa Leo and Amy Adams are like you've never seen them before and they appear very natural on screen. Mark Wahlberg is superly restrained and Christian Bale does one of his best works of his entire career. They are supported by a host of impressive actors.In addition to the marvelous performances the makeup department has done a remarkable job especially by making Leo look old enough to play Bale and Wahlberg's mother. Bale actually does look years older than Wahlberg when in reality he's a year younger and that just adds more to the authenticity.From the opening sequence I was under the impression that 'The Fighter' was going to be a documentarytype movie but O. Russell tricks and surprises the audience with that. His execution is subtle unlike the loud approach which other directors commonly follow.For me 'The Fighter' is more about the human connection than the sports itself. Boxing is clearly a metaphor as is the title which has multiple meanings. Even though he's been constantly let down by his family Micky chose to give them a second chance and have them by his side. Even though Charlene disapproves Alice and Dicky's involvement in Micky's career Dicky attempts to persuade her because he knows that Micky won't stand a chance without her by his side. Even though Alice and Charlene don't see eye to eye there's a silent acceptance between them as they know that Micky needs them both.I am really beginning to have more respect for Mark Wahlberg for producing gems like this in addition to some amazing TVseries like 'In Treatment' 'Boardwalk Empire' and 'Entourage' and his growth as an actor is obviously apparent he just needs to avoid tripe like 'The Happening' at all costs.'The Fighter' is a winner on various levels.".

	schema:headline " Conventional script elevated by great direction and fantastic performances";
	schema:reviewBody "After Rocky Raging Bull Ali Million Dollar Baby Cinderella man and many others one begins to wonder how many more boxing movies we really need in the world and what a new one can bring to the table. Indeed watching The Fighter one can't help but wonder what the film can do to renew the genre and bring something new to the table. Unfortunately the answer is nothing much. The script is a pretty conventional ragstoriches story whose most interesting element is the relationship between Micky Ward and his brother Dickie Eklund. Luckily Russell and company recognized that this was the strongest aspect of what is otherwise a good but ordinary and somewhat flawed script with some problems with flat characterizations and unnaturalsounding dialogue. However everyone involved in the film tries their best to transcend the script and for the most part they succeed.Russell's direction is absolutely fantastic. His use of the camera  which still has that indie looseness freemoving and handheld and gritty quality to it which really adds to the atmosphere and energy the film tries to capture. His staging of scenes is fantastic and he usually just lets his actors riff off of one another sometimes sticking to the script but sometimes talking over one another interrupting and creating a very dynamic backand forth that further lends to the realistic quality of the film and its setting. A fantastic rock oriented soundtrack only adds to this energy and atmosphere. In terms of bringing something new to the table of boxing movies Russell employs a very interesting technique of filming the boxing scenes as they were shown on HBO payperview TV in the 90's cheap video quality multicamera setups the whole package. The boxing scenes were all shot over 3 days which left the crew just enough time to run through one boxing match at a time and just shooting it as if it were an actual match the cameras capturing everything including mistakes and messups and spontaneous uncontrolled occurrences which yet again add to the very loose and realistic style the film attempts to capture. It is a very interesting and unique technique I have not seen used before and I thought it was a fresh approach to boxing scenes which have become very conventional ever since Raging Bull.Ultimately though this is a movie about two brothers and their overcoming demons and obstacles in order to succeed and reach their mutual goal together. Being a characterbased film the success of the acting is a key to the success of the film and luckily it is in this field that the film succeeds the most. Mark Wahlberg is adequate in the lead role of Micky Ward. I have never thought much of him as an actor and think that he did an okay job on this film not bad but not particularly noteworthy. However his supporting cast all shine and his chemistry with them especially with Christian Bale is really what sells the movie for me. Bale's achievement is nothing short of revolutionary. He completely steals the show as Micky's crackaddicted older brother and trainer a former boxer himself and a shadow of his old self except he can still throw one hell of a punch and knows just what Micky needs to do in order to succeed. Bale completely embodies the role and really gives it his all  both in his appearance hollow cheeks bulgy eyes balding but also in his bravura performance. It is an incredible feat of acting one of the best I have seen all year Bale's best work as an actor yet and totally deserving of all the accolades it will inevitably receive. Also worth mentioning though are the two main female supporting roles namely Amy Adams as the tough and sassy but supportive girlfriend and Melissa Leo as the overbearing mother. Both actresses are very much out of their comfort zone which is just what makes their performances so good. Adams who has never really shown her tough side like she does in this film does a spectacular job and really creates someone human and relatable out of what is otherwise an underwritten character. The same goes for Melissa Leo her character could have gone the completely onedimensional villainous way but Leo adds a certain humanity to the character which just makes her seem more sad than vicious.Ultimately The Fighter tells a pretty conventional story in an interesting and not necessarily conventional way. It is a film that could have been overdramatized and heavyhanded had it been put in another director's hands see Cinderella Man for an example of over dramatization but Russell and his cast reign it in and set out to create a very specific atmosphere and set a particular mood that lends the film a sense of realism and a very unique dynamic energy that with the help of the fantastic performances from the cast help carry it above and beyond its conventional script.".

Indeed watching The Fighter one can't help but wonder what the film can do to renew the genre and bring something new to the table. Unfortunately the answer is nothing much. The script is a pretty conventional ragstoriches story whose most interesting element is the relationship between Micky Ward and his brother Dickie Eklund. Luckily Russell and company recognized that this was the strongest aspect of what is otherwise a good but ordinary and somewhat flawed script with some problems with flat characterizations and unnaturalsounding dialogue. However everyone involved in the film tries their best to transcend the script and for the most part they succeed.Russell's direction is absolutely fantastic. His use of the camera  which still has that indie looseness freemoving and handheld and gritty quality to it which really adds to the atmosphere and energy the film tries to capture. His staging of scenes is fantastic and he usually just lets his actors riff off of one another sometimes sticking to the script but sometimes talking over one another interrupting and creating a very dynamic backand forth that further lends to the realistic quality of the film and its setting. A fantastic rock oriented soundtrack only adds to this energy and atmosphere. In terms of bringing something new to the table of boxing movies Russell employs a very interesting technique of filming the boxing scenes as they were shown on HBO payperview TV in the 90's cheap video quality multicamera setups the whole package. The boxing scenes were all shot over 3 days which left the crew just enough time to run through one boxing match at a time and just shooting it as if it were an actual match the cameras capturing everything including mistakes and messups and spontaneous uncontrolled occurrences which yet again add to the very loose and realistic style the film attempts to capture. It is a very interesting and unique technique I have not seen used before and I thought it was a fresh approach to boxing scenes which have become very conventional ever since Raging Bull.Ultimately though this is a movie about two brothers and their overcoming demons and obstacles in order to succeed and reach their mutual goal together. Being a characterbased film the success of the acting is a key to the success of the film and luckily it is in this field that the film succeeds the most. Mark Wahlberg is adequate in the lead role of Micky Ward. I have never thought much of him as an actor and think that he did an okay job on this film not bad but not particularly noteworthy. However his supporting cast all shine and his chemistry with them especially with Christian Bale is really what sells the movie for me. Bale's achievement is nothing short of revolutionary. He completely steals the show as Micky's crackaddicted older brother and trainer a former boxer himself and a shadow of his old self except he can still throw one hell of a punch and knows just what Micky needs to do in order to succeed. Bale completely embodies the role and really gives it his all  both in his appearance hollow cheeks bulgy eyes balding but also in his bravura performance. It is an incredible feat of acting one of the best I have seen all year Bale's best work as an actor yet and totally deserving of all the accolades it will inevitably receive. Also worth mentioning though are the two main female supporting roles namely Amy Adams as the tough and sassy but supportive girlfriend and Melissa Leo as the overbearing mother. Both actresses are very much out of their comfort zone which is just what makes their performances so good. Adams who has never really shown her tough side like she does in this film does a spectacular job and really creates someone human and relatable out of what is otherwise an underwritten character. The same goes for Melissa Leo her character could have gone the completely onedimensional villainous way but Leo adds a certain humanity to the character which just makes her seem more sad than vicious.Ultimately The Fighter tells a pretty conventional story in an interesting and not necessarily conventional way. It is a film that could have been overdramatized and heavyhanded had it been put in another director's hands see Cinderella Man for an example of over dramatization but Russell and his cast reign it in and set out to create a very specific atmosphere and set a particular mood that lends the film a sense of realism and a very unique dynamic energy that with the help of the fantastic performances from the cast help carry it above and beyond its conventional script.";

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to winning awards boxing films seem to always be contenders as such the thought of watching another boxing film can be offputting. But The Fighter hangs in and fends off those labels earning every bit of its critical praise. That's because most of the fighting in this film takes place out of the ring Irish Micky Ward Mark Wahlberg spars with the troublesome brother who trains him and his mother who manages him and these superb supporting characters have their own challengers to overcome.David O. Russell brings a needed dose of realism to the boxing genre downplaying the underdog nature of Micky's true story and focusing on the relationships that push him through and hold him back all throughout his journey toward the welterweight title. Much of the time in fact the story feels equally Micky's and his brother's. Dickie Eklund Christian Bale as beat over our heads early in the film went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him down becoming the pride of small workingclass town Lowell Mass.  which as one might imagine wasn't hard.But Dickie an offkilter funloving yet irresponsible guy a transformative performance from Bale to say the least spends the time he's not training Micky in crack houses. In fact he's completely oblivious to the fact that HBO is following him around for their documentary on crack abuse not one about his comeback. It's clear that his behavior is keeping Micky whose had a string of bad losses of late down. After an embarrassing fight in which Micky was mismatched Micky suddenly finds himself wondering whether he should keep his boxing career and family separate.The idea of it irritates Micky's mother Alice played by Melissa Leo who impressively embodies every controlling mother. Alice sits in her house most days and smokes cigarettes while her seven grown daughters pathetically vie for her attention. Leo keeps Alice from being an aggravating total monster providing a more complete picture of a mother whose blurred the line between business and family.Amy Adams also excels in her supporting role a bartender and college dropout but one who  like the audience  sees how Micky's family has kept him back and as his girlfriend pushes him toward the right path. Interestingly as she grows more invested in Micky's career the script divides her from the audience which gives her performance more weight.Russell's characters have a harsh reality to them much like the Bostonbased characters in Ben Affleck's films Gone Baby Gone and The Town. In addition to looks clothes and mannerisms Russell chooses a more handheld documentary feel for the film like Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler and even opts to film parts of the boxing sequences with lenses like the ones used in the late '90s to give the feel of watching a live broadcast.The fights though effective remain secondary to the other fighting. Watching Dickie spiral downward and come back up again Alice have trouble letting go and Micky struggle to speak up for himself and recognize what he truly needs serves as the more compelling conflict. All together they give The Fighter the best ensemble cast of 2010. And like all great boxing films all these tensions blow in and out make their way symbolically into the boxing ring for that final fight. As Dickie urges on his brother in the waning rounds of the championship fight he captures it perfectly when he says everything that's happened take that out there with you.The emotional moments of The Fighter do lack a real knockout and many intimate moments are tempered with humor in awkward but not sceneruining ways but rather than be a heavyweight drama that rides the underdog story for two hours The Fighter opts to be something a bit more natural by fixing on the right things the people and the personal relationships that hurt or harm us are all essential to our success.Steven CVisit my site at httpmoviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Do we have a lot of sport films where the underdog ends up winning and overcoming many obstacles along the way until the end? Definitely. Does The Fighter succeed? Very much so...For a film like this it is very difficult to make it completely unpredictable yet while The Fighter is in a way conventional it is also unpredictable many times. It has great characters to boot but also a strong cast that is willing to give it their all. This is the best ensemble cast of the year many amazing performances. First I start off with Mark Wahlberg who has been the most under the radar but he is definitely up for this. He is a great lead and I am surprised he was as good as he was. I am also very pleasantly surprised by Amy Adams. Not to say she is a bad actress but I was always used to her roles all being similar and now she is in a completely different role for her and to say she succeeds is an understatement. She is excellent and is only made strong when sharing the screen with any other actor. Melissa Leo is also great and I think she is on par with Adams. The difference between Adams and Leo is that Leo has the more awardbaity role. Now we have Christian Bale who I do think is the best. I have seen his performances and while he has always been good he has never truly risen above others in his films here he does. He is excellent and he as of now deserves that Oscar.David Russel's direction is part of what makes this film so great He soars scenes to unbelievable heights and I think that the screenplay in another director's hands would have came out with a merely good film. But here we have an excellent film perhaps better than 2008's The Wrestler and one of the best films of the year.".

Walt WhitmanMark Wahlberg has achieved a career high with The Fighter not so much for his acting which is eclipsed by a supportive cast that would be hard to beat in the Oscar race but because he fought for years to bring the story of Lowell Mass. to the screen. He caught perfectly the bluecollar town's karma and their devotion to the fighting brothers Irish Mickey Ward Wahlberg and Dicky Eklund Christian Bale.Director David O. Russell has assembled this cast around the idea that a town in the shadow of Boston can become world famous as its sons become winners in the ring. But then Stallone did more for Philadelphia as Rocky so what's the big deal? Like Ben Affleck's excellent thriller this year about Boston in The Town Fighter captures place and struggle in equal dramatic measure as filmmakers take a close look at the working class's struggles over the last 30 years. While Million Dollar Baby 2004 focused on trainer and fighter and Cinderella Man 2005 gave a microscopic view of a troubled fighter and his small family The Fighter does all of that with a vigor as exhausting as a bout itself.The Fighter is not just about boxing because as in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull 1980 it's all about people who find in the sport a way to transcend their social prison. In The Fighter it is more even about family which weighs heavily on Micky's success or failure. And outside family as well for girlfriend bartender Charlene Fleming Amy Adams is a formidable force in liberating Micky from the suffocating family his five harpy sisters and domineering manager mother Melissa Leo fearsome in her cigarette smoke and driving vision for her sons. Unlike other boxing films Fighter is patient with Micky's long climb to success almost painfully long but rewarding in the reality of its prolonged struggle. But it's also the acting that distinguishes it Christian Bale as Dicky transforms himself again by losing weight and morphing into a manic brother who loves Micky despite Dicky's negative life of drugs and mania Amy Adams is believable as the gritty but beautiful girl friend and Melissa Leo plays mom like a lady Macbeth in tight Dockers.Although there will be heavier films competing for 2010's Oscar I can't think of another whose cast so eloquently has caught the poverty and riches of a town caught in boxing fever.".

Bale's finely etched creation of Dicky and Wahlberg's extraordinary dual turn as producer and star in the role of Dicky's brother Micky should place both men front and center for Oscar nominations along with Russell who shaped the film with a keen sensitivity.

Everything Scott watched had to be either American  feature a big name or feature an action sequence so our tastes weren't very similar . Regardless of this one film Scott felt the need to rave about was THE FIGHTER . I'd seen the trailers and vaguely knew the story of Micky Ward and felt it was going to be clichd true story biopic with embellishment and a happy ending . In other words it was going to be a seen it all before sports movie . Okay Scott  I asked  What's the selling point ?   The acting Theo .It's brilliantly acted especially Christian Bale who plays MarkWahlberg's brother . He plays his trainer  Sometimes acting alone can't carry a film  only bring a film down and when I watch a film I'm after a good story so decided not to bother with THE FIGHTER until it was broadcast on Channel 4 . After seeing it I came to the conclusion that both Scott's opinion and my own are totally correct Bale is an actor who is fortunate in that the roles he will be most remembered for are those that belong in a franchise such as BATMAN BEGINS and TERMINATOR SALVATION . You could argue he's luckier than he is talented but here as Micky Ward's half brother Dicky Eklund  a crack addicted  brain damaged former boxer he gives an acting tour de force . You know when you're on the bus and someone gets on and you mutter to yourself  Please don't sit anywhere near me please  that's the exact feeling you see when Eklund appears on screen . One wonders if Bale should have been drug tested after each scene such is his convincing performance . It's a story of mean streets and of mean people hitting rock bottom and you don't feel you're watching actors merely going through their pacesWhere the film does fall down it's down to the usual flaw of making true stories dramatic and having to restructure things . Ward beats up and coming boxer Alfonso Sanchez which means he gets a world title shot against Shea Neary in Britain . In reality Ward fought another 6 fights  losing two of them before he got the title fight against Neary and with all due respect the title fight in question was for the World Boxing Union  WBU  which most boxing fans consider a mere  alphabet title  not a world title at all . Also the film feels the need to dramatise the fight with Ward being dead on his feet in round three . In reality Ward was wobbled in that round but didn't hit the deck . The fight was a slugfest for sure but was never as one sided as portrayed here . Perhaps most disappointingly of all Ward's three legendary fights with Arturo Gatti are relegated to a caption at the end of the movie In all THE FIGHTER is the cinematic equivalent of the battle between Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Sugar Ray Leonard . It's a definite split decision . You can se why people loved the film  you can see why people liked the film  you can see why people disliked it and perhaps why people hated it . I'm certainly hedging my bets and voting for a draw".

It's a definite split decision . You can se why people loved the film  you can see why people liked the film  you can see why people disliked it and perhaps why people hated it . I'm certainly hedging my bets and voting for a draw";

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Don't let the hype or the fear of just another boxing movie keep you from this one. Yes it is based on the true story of Irish Micky Ward a boxer from Lowell Massachusetts but this is every bit as much a story of family and commitment and tenacity as any story you know.Directed by David O Russell I Heart Huckabees the film does a terrific job of dumping us right smack into this blue collar community and this ohsocolorful family. Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward the younger brother of former boxer Dicky Ecklund a noholdsbarred Christian Bale. Ecklund lived for years off his fight against Sugar Ray Leonard where Leonard either was knocked down or slipped down. Either way Dicky is as close to a local legend as it gets. In the mid80's younger brother Micky joined the fight game  with Dicky as his trainer and his mother Melissa Leo as his manager.As realistic and believable as the boxing is in the film the real trick was in presenting Micky's family. The first impression of his mother and gaggle of sisters is that it's a cartoonish presentation. In fact it's very realistic! When local bartender Charlene Amy Adamsbecomes involved with Micky she tries to set him straight on exactly what his family is doing to his career.Oh did I mention that Dicky was a crackhead? Did I mention that his mother pushed him into fights against upper weight classes because she needed the money? Did I mention that Micky tries to remain loyal to the family ... even to the extent of nearly costing him a shot at a legitimate career? There are some real emotions going on all over this wellpaced film. Thanks to the Amy Adams character we really get to see how an outsider views the family and vice versa. It's not a pretty sight! I can't say enough about Bale's performance as Dicky. He has the movement and gait of both a boxer and a crackhead. His mannerisms mirror that of the real Dicky as seen over the ending credits. This is crazy good acting. Melissa Leo is fast becoming the hardest working actress in Hollywood. This is the third film I have seen her in this year! Her performance when combined with Jacki Weaver in Animal Kingdom really create some nightmares for kids with creepy mothers! Amy Adams is totally convincing as the pretty tough love interest and guiding light for Micky. As for Wahlberg he is quite convincing as a boxer. His physicality is without question. The only thing I didn't like was the couple of times he slipped back into his mumbling whiny persona. Luckily that effect was minimal.This is a film I would recommend to most. The only word of caution is the language is quite realistic for working class Lowell Mass. In other words the F word is utilized in every conceivable manner throughout. It's just part of the community fabric. Also be warned that the boxing is also quite realistic ... it's a violent sport and that comes across very well. I loved how the boxing matches were filmed digitally for effect. Just a wonderfully well made film with terrific performances ... and actually quite uplifting!".

It not only told the story of Irish Micky Ward Dickie Eklund and the family aspect but was a credit to the real internal and external struggle of never giving up. the fighter  does proper justice to the hardworking ways and the People of Mass and Boston areas. In this film  the title has a double meaning as not only being a fighter as a boxer but speaks to many that in regular life that being The Fighter success can happen if you put the work in. The story does have strong female leads in this film that has never been shown in previous boxing based films. It is a cross over to both worlds  male and female Young and Old and those that would usually skip a Boxing based film as it is much more then just that. I was at screening of The Fighter in the Beverly Hills theater with Director David O'Russell and main Cast  Mark Wahlberg Christian Bale Amy Adams Melissa Leo The Director and cast show their love and passion for this film and how hard they all worked to make this possible in their very warm words and replies to the questions from the audience. In all  a class group of fine professionals and actors put their heart and soul into this one and I hope their efforts are well rewarded when it comes time to nominate and vote for Oscars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow what a movie. It's an inspirational true story of a boxer finally getting his break. It's also a story of addiction and how it can affect loved ones. And above all it's about family. There are some great boxing scenes in THE FIGHTER they feel authentic and brutal but the true fight is really outside the ring. Which is not to say this is an overbearing melodrama no far from it. It handles the subject matter gracefully. It has a lot of heart and can be quite funny and there are some humorously absurd moments something director David O. Russell has proved to be very good at providing.Mark Wahlberg gives a great performance playing the lead character Micky. This is Wahlberg's most reserved and complex role to date. Micky has an unbreakable devotion to his family which both strengthens and cripples him. He never really speaks for himself and would rather suffer than upset those around him. Through the course of the movie the character really grows thanks to the help of a good woman by his side. Mark Wahlberg shows a side of himself we've never seen before this isn't the overthetop badass THE DEPARTED Wahlberg which don't get me wrong is awesome too but he finds a different range here. Truly the guy has come a long way from The Funky Bunch.Christian Bale is absolutely phenomenal in his scenestealing role as Micky's drugaddicted brother. This is such a great character that Bale really brings a lot of depth to. Dicky's easily angered often detached and oblivious to how his affliction is affecting his life. He's also ashamed and vulnerable. He's not the most reliable guy in the world and he's in need of a serious wakeup call. But the thing is...you can completely understand why Micky would stand by him for so long. Underneath it all he really is a great guy full of energy and affection somebody you'd really want in your corner. This is sure to go down as one of Bale's most remembered roles and hopefully his enormous talent will finally be recognized by winning an Academy Award for it.Behind every great man is a great woman and Amy Adams also delivers a fantastic performance as Micky's girlfriend who really helps him develop some backbone and at the same time is able to find some clarity in her misguided life. She's great in her role and I'd be lying if I said I didn't thoroughly enjoy the eyecandy she brings to the movie. She has her fair share of revealing outfits and in one scene is shown wearing a seethrough bra. Now THAT'S great filmmaking! Also notable just because it stood out to me is that Conan O'Brien's sister Kate has a role in the movie playing one of Micky's sisters. I sort of wish I wasn't privy to this information before seeing it because her resemblance to the goofy talk show host is uncanny...and a little disturbing.I don't know why a lot of the most involving sports movies happen to be about boxing I guess there's just something so primal and against all logic about people that get the crap beaten out of them for a living. It's worth knowing what makes these people tick. Yes this is based on a true story but I'm sure it's been tailored to fit Hollywood needs. Events have likely been rearranged and certain moments probably fabricated or altered but THE FIGHTER doesn't attempt to portray the family shown here in a completely positive light. Nobody is a saint here and everyone has their faults. When it finally arrives at its conclusion it is relieving satisfying and yes inspiring. This is ultimately a happy story well deserving to be told on film but the sad reality is that there are no doubt hundreds and hundreds of similar stories that didn't end up quite as well. I can't tell you what exactly makes the family depicted in this movie so special. Maybe they're stronger and more willing to compromise and just maybe a little lucky too. But I was left recalling a scene from the movie THE STRAIGHT STORY where Richard Farnsworth lays down some wisdom upon a teenage runaway he told her how he would give each of his kids a stick and ask them to snap them which was easy. Then he'd give them a whole bundle which couldn't be broken. That's family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alright.The Fighter is a true story about Mickey Ward  my favorite boxer. I grew up around this time and watched most of the fights featured in the film. I recently wrote a sportsblogfor 4 years about a variety of sports boxing football baseball basketball etc. On one particular occasion I wrote a blog about 'The Top 20 Sports Moments Since 2000'. Amongst them were Michael Phelps' Gold Medal barrage Usain Bolts' 100 meter worldrecord and the 2004 Red Sox winning Major League Baseball's 100th World Series which ended the Curse of the Bambino. What was 1? What eventmoment did I single as the greatest? Mickey Ward's first fight against Arturro Gatti.It was a fight that made movies like Rocky 3 marginally realistic. The brawl of brawls. The most violent epic unforgettable irreplaceable 'shake your hand on your buddies head'' moment of sports Godliness. It took boxing fans back to the predepression days of bareknuckle fights and hardmen and reminded us of the euphoric heights of heart and determination that can be captured in sport.Not even a strong performance from Christian Bale can make up for that sports' moment being left out of this screenplay. We can only hope that Aronofsky's dramacomedy will get nonboxing fans to look into the career of Mickey Ward  so that they might see that fight.Bale's performance is amazing but I don't think that Mark Wahlberg really captured the role of Mickey in the same way. At least he didn't immerse himself into the character in the same way as Bale and the biggest resemblance he had with Mickey was his physique.This was a very good movie entertaining fastpaced with a brisk running time. 'The Fighter' isn't quite as good as its' current ranking here but it should crack the years Ten Best IMO. The boxing scenes are more realistic than most and the interaction between Mickey's family and circle of friends is priceless.Good. Not great! Nudged out 'The Town' as the best movie I saw this week. If Wahlberg was on par with bale and if this had gone another halfhour and included the WardGatti fight it might have scored as high as a 88.5.75100Solid Recommendation.You'll like it if you like Bull Durham Without Limits Conviction and Rocky Balboa.".

	schema:reviewBody "There has been a trend this year to show the darker side of nature in movies both on TV and on the movie screens and The Fighter continues to expose those festering qualities that prevent us from bonding with each other and might end up having some very toxic results. However The Fighter shows an interesting point of view as it balances the negative with some redemptive moments some of which shine because of a very outstanding group of actors.For starters Melissa Leo and Amy Adams surpass any work they have previously done as the obsessive and supportive female leads in the story. Leo as the mother who is blind to her own powerful interventions and interferences almost leading to the destruction of her own children. Adams is a tower of strength with a caustic underside. She is a vulnerable woman who has grown tougher because of her own life experiences and she finally finds someone who understands and needs her. Still she must now face a group of siblings who might prove to be more than she wants to handle.In The Town we saw how the environment shapes the nature of human beings and finding success is pretty elusive. In most cases the results are the reverse and tragic. Mark Whalberg's Mickey has reached that crucial moment in his life when he must choose to detach himself from a stiffling family environment and pursue his dream with the proper support. It is time to go for his life's dream and though it might be a little too late and very difficult because of Dicky's Bale constant selfdestructive moves and their aftermath Mickey might never see his dreams come true.Bale who has done superlative work in more than a dozen films from his superb debut in Empire of The Sun completely outshines everyone else in the film and regardless of the barrage of publicity out there his is a leading man's turn dark subversive suicidal pathetic emotional and an effective and affective portrayal of a man who is about to hit bottom someone who is now apparently unaware of how much pain his actions can cause. As the older brother who is now addicted to drugs he can't see the way he is dragging everyone else into his own hell especially Mickey a resilient but sweet character who can't break away from this situation.Eventually fortunes change and we see how it is possible to produce change. The Fighter never really explodes or overwhelms. In The Wrestler pain was intense both visually and emotionally almost reaching torture levels for its protagonist and the audience. Here there is a restrained sense of despair and even exhilaration is portrayed in an almost muted way. We want to ride the emotional waves of the main character and this hardly happens. Unlike Milk where there was a documentary feel that make the events appear almost real there is something amiss here yet even that sense of detachment can't keep us from admiring the magnificent work done by Leo Whalberg Adams and most impressively Bale an actor who understands and undergoes the transformations required by the roles he chooses. It is impossible to imagine a darker Batman a more demented yuppie or a more traumatized child. In this movie his physical and emotional transformation will bewitch you and add you to a list of admirers who have followed an artist who keeps delivering knockout performances a true champion.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Fighter is based on the true story of boxer Irish Micky Ward's unlikely rise through the ranks to the WBU World Boxing Union lightwelterweight title.Micky's story would be a conventional sports film if not for the presence of his halfbrother Dicky a boxerturnedtrainer whose life was screwed up by crack addiction and the petty crimes that associated with that life.The brother played by Christian Bale makes the story interesting and charges it emotionally. Bale bursts from the skin of his character igniting every frame with his energy reminding occasionally of his role as the highenergy boy in Empire of the Sun. As in The Mechanic Bale lost a lot of weight preparing for the gaunt crackaddicted brother. He was 100 per cent convincing.Bale's character Davy exudes personality every time he enters a room or walks down a street. You know he is a drugaddled screw up and you know he is going to mess up his brother's life but the brother loves him and is loyal to him so you want to see Davy rise above his problem.One of Bale's best scenes was shot on the front porch of the house where Charlene Micky's girlfriend played by Amy Adams lives. Clean and sober after eight months in prison Dicky carries a ton of baggage to that porch. He has hurt people. He has conned neighbors. He has disappointed everyone but his mother and his half brother. The entire town of Lowell Massachusetts remembers Dicky as a boxer The pride of Lowell but they also remember him being addicted to crack so nobody is prepared to believe he has gotten past the addiction during his eight months in prison.On the porch Micky knowing that he carries that baggage wants to charm Charlene and patch things up for his brother. Charlene however is fueled by her complete distrust of Davy. She loves Micky and she has seen Dicky mess up Micky's life over and over again. On the porch she has just walked away from Micky because he insists on being loyal to Dicky. No way is she going to be easily convinced that Davy has changed.She is skeptical of every word to come from Dicky's mouth but Dicky pulls out all the stops in an effort to overcome his baggage and connect with her to make things right for his brother.The immovable object meets the irresistible force. It is a fine scene.Amy Adams is equally amazing in this film. As an actor she is gutsy. Even when she started to command bigger paychecks she continued to make independent films and bring to those indie films performances that made them better than they might have been. She never shies from a challenge. In this role she plays a worldly bartender who flunked out of college despite a full scholarship in high jump. As an athlete she can understand with Micky.In the final analysis it is Amy Adams who makes the chemistry work between Charlene and Micky. Wahlberg can be as wooden as Ben Affleck when it comes to romantic subtleties. Amy Adams in this role is like one of those good dancers on Dancing With The Stars who has to work with a partner who might as well be a post or a tree stump. While Wahlberg is unmoving Amy Adams' performance reaches out and emotionally draws the scenes together.The Fighter has dimension to it and a lot of the depth from the supporting cast.The mother played with conviction by Melissa Leo. She runs a family home surrounded by seven adult daughters and all seem to either be living at home or visiting their mother a lot. The sisters are a hoot sort of like a Greek chorus on a living room couch. Highly emotional the sisters hate Micky's girlfriend. I loved them because there was something fascinatingly hideous about the sisters.Rocky Raging Bull Ali Million Dollar Baby and Cinderella Man are all fight films that have taken the viewer where The Fighter goes. No surprise there. Micky as you expect gets the crap beaten out of him. He struggles through the rank. He gets his shot at a title and he enters the ring against a better boxer to compete for a world championship. The sports genre always travels down a wellbeaten path and always takes us to a happier place. Every sports film tells this ofttold tale. You enjoy the genre because getting there is what makes sports films a pleasure.The Fighter benefits from the fact that it is not just a sports film but a story of family and redemption. You family is important addiction is not unbeatable. The Fighter is a feel good film with a lot of ugly stuff to overcome.IAlthough I put The Fighter along side most of the other boxing films it could have been a lot better. If Micky had been more threedimensional the film might have been a classic. The elements are there struggle and redemption. It's a true story with a lot of subtext and that alone makes it better than Rocky. Unfortunately Wahlberg is no DeNiro so it's no Raging Bull and the script isn't up to Million Dollar Baby.That said The Fighter is worth seeing. You'll like it for the performances by Christian Bale Amy Adams Melissa Leo and character actors whose faces you'll recognize from dozens of other films and television performances. You will love it for the feelgood arc the love and redemption that are built into this genre.If you like boxing you'll love the action. The camera work in the ring scenes is first rate and convincing. On the big screen you feel every punch.However if you are of that generation that hates boxing but likes cage fighting there's no hope for you sorry ".

	schema:reviewBody "Powered by terrific performances from its cast The Fighter also happens to be David O. Russell's best film to date that may not rank amongst the finest examples of its genre but it still serves as a competently crafted sports biopic that's less about the sport  more about the athlete his family  his path to redemption.The story of The Fighter follows the life of professional boxer Micky Ward who withdraws from the boxing world after suffering a humiliating defeat in a match he already had reservations about. The plot chronicles the journey he takes to get back into the ring while focusing on his relationship with his brother whose own life has taken a selfdestructive route.Directed by David O. Russell best known for Silver Linings Playbook  American Hustle the story journeys the same route that majority of boxing films tend to take plus also falls flat in between on a few occasions but what infuses a vibrant energy into it is the rich set of interesting characters it packs in  a talented ensemble that brings those characters to life with finesse.The boxing sequences are brilliantly choreographed and do provide the necessary adrenaline high when it matters but this picture is more focused on the relationship between the two brothers and illustrates it amazingly well for those moments do pack a powerful punch. But it also suffers from letting it characters go a bit overboard at times something that has become a norm in O. Russell's films of lately.Coming to the performances the cast comprises of Mark Wahlberg Amy Adams Christian Bale  Melissa Leo with Bale  Leo impressing the most. It's not that the input by leading cast falls short in any aspect it's just that Bale  Leo take their supporting characters to a different level and the Academy Award they won for their respective works in this feature film is definitely an earned one.On an overall scale The Fighter is no genre masterpiece but it still offers a sufficiently entertaining ride that will leave majority of its viewers satisfied in the end. It's not without its shortcomings but most of them get brushed away by the powerful explosive  riveting performances delivered by its ensemble. The story isn't memorable by any means but what Bale  Leo pull off here will continue to reverberate for a few more years down the line.".

	schema:headline " A welltold boxing story appealing to the inside jock hibernating in most of us.";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved The Fighter the first time I saw it. It probably has a lot to do with my infatuation with boxing films as a genre  Raging Bull and When We Were Kings rank high in my personal movie pantheon. Russel visibly knows the canon perfectly and manages to pay tribute to all these great virile sport flicks without ending up making a pastiche. The Fighter is full of intertextuality  from the font of the boxing matches' captions to the training routines  it's knowingly selfreferential but also playing strictly by the rules and that's why it works so well despite what could be easily dismissed as a clichladen script of another underdog narrative.The Fighter is based on the real life story of Mickey Ward Mark Wahlberg a taciturn and limited proletarian grafter very similar to Rocky Balboa if the latter was Irish and not Italian trained by his brother Dicky Christian Bale like Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. The difference here with Scorsese's classic is that the only sane and sensible character is the fighter his dysfunctional and self destructive family his brother has a serious drug problem while his mom is plain greedy become his main obstacle on his way to victory. Loyal to his family till the end Ward wastes his best years until his brother ends up in prison for one crack stunt too many. Now in the twilight of his career and with the help of his girlfriend a local barmaid and a grumpy Irish cop played by his reallife counterpart Mickey finds his way back to the ring and stumbles on a chance to fight for the world title his one and only shot at glory. Will he capture it? Or just let it slip? etc. You get the idea.Christian Bale once again delivers the performance of a lifetime as the brothercoach of the title character a local boxing legend turned crackhead. He adds a new dimension to the film somewhat between cartoonish and pathetic as if he came straight out of Trainspotting. His lame schemes to support his habit are hilarious as are his friends from the crackhouse depicted in the same warm nonjudgemental way of Danny Boyle's cult film. Bale's extravagant albeit touching portrayal is also reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson's performance in Jungle Fever perfectly channelling the madness of the moment under the influence of crack while maintaining the character's humanity and integrity avoiding to turn into a white Tyrone Biggums.In the ropes Mark Walhberg does what he does best toughness  Irishness. Bringing vulnerability grit and authenticity to the film he leaves the flamboyance to Bale who in return happily chews the scenery. Marky Mark could have just as easily steal the show like in The Departed but chooses not to. Definitely an underrated actor  mainly because he's capable of restraint.This is David O. Russel's finest movie since Three Kings a long awaited comeback for the director who wraps it up perfectly playing with the different takes on the pugilistic genre from the ESPN Classic approach the shooting of a documentary on Dicky unfolds as an important storyline within the film while offering a welcome miseenabme to the Hollywoodian reconstitution and dramatisation of reality. The boxing fights alternating insidethering shots  la Raging Bull and HBO's satellite coverage style are infectiously gripping and perfectly edited. Finally the recurring use of the song How You Like Me Now by The Heavy brings energy and coherence appropriately opening and closing the film.Admittedly The Fighter is nothing that we haven't seen before and was clearly made to provide Christian Bale with a custommade Oscar vehicle. It is no Michael Man's Ali though and it is to the credit of the director and the cast if The Fighter still manages to pack a serious punch. A welltold sporting story will always appeal to the inside jock hibernating in most of us.ggendron.wordpress.com".

The Fighter is full of intertextuality  from the font of the boxing matches' captions to the training routines  it's knowingly selfreferential but also playing strictly by the rules and that's why it works so well despite what could be easily dismissed as a clichladen script of another underdog narrative.The Fighter is based on the real life story of Mickey Ward Mark Wahlberg a taciturn and limited proletarian grafter very similar to Rocky Balboa if the latter was Irish and not Italian trained by his brother Dicky Christian Bale like Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. The difference here with Scorsese's classic is that the only sane and sensible character is the fighter his dysfunctional and self destructive family his brother has a serious drug problem while his mom is plain greedy become his main obstacle on his way to victory. Loyal to his family till the end Ward wastes his best years until his brother ends up in prison for one crack stunt too many. Now in the twilight of his career and with the help of his girlfriend a local barmaid and a grumpy Irish cop played by his reallife counterpart Mickey finds his way back to the ring and stumbles on a chance to fight for the world title his one and only shot at glory. Will he capture it? Or just let it slip? etc. You get the idea.Christian Bale once again delivers the performance of a lifetime as the brothercoach of the title character a local boxing legend turned crackhead. He adds a new dimension to the film somewhat between cartoonish and pathetic as if he came straight out of Trainspotting. His lame schemes to support his habit are hilarious as are his friends from the crackhouse depicted in the same warm nonjudgemental way of Danny Boyle's cult film. Bale's extravagant albeit touching portrayal is also reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson's performance in Jungle Fever perfectly channelling the madness of the moment under the influence of crack while maintaining the character's humanity and integrity avoiding to turn into a white Tyrone Biggums.In the ropes Mark Walhberg does what he does best toughness  Irishness. Bringing vulnerability grit and authenticity to the film he leaves the flamboyance to Bale who in return happily chews the scenery. Marky Mark could have just as easily steal the show like in The Departed but chooses not to. Definitely an underrated actor  mainly because he's capable of restraint.This is David O. Russel's finest movie since Three Kings a long awaited comeback for the director who wraps it up perfectly playing with the different takes on the pugilistic genre from the ESPN Classic approach the shooting of a documentary on Dicky unfolds as an important storyline within the film while offering a welcome miseenabme to the Hollywoodian reconstitution and dramatisation of reality. The boxing fights alternating insidethering shots  la Raging Bull and HBO's satellite coverage style are infectiously gripping and perfectly edited. Finally the recurring use of the song How You Like Me Now by The Heavy brings energy and coherence appropriately opening and closing the film.Admittedly The Fighter is nothing that we haven't seen before and was clearly made to provide Christian Bale with a custommade Oscar vehicle. It is no Michael Man's Ali though and it is to the credit of the director and the cast if The Fighter still manages to pack a serious punch. A welltold sporting story will always appeal to the inside jock hibernating in most of us.ggendron.wordpress.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since it was announced that Wahlberg was trying to get this film made  and that was a looooooong time ago at this stage  I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this film. I was not disappointed.Not to rehash the story too much but this is a real life story of Boston boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward and the struggles with his career personal and family life in the mid90s. Wahlberg is Micky Ward and Bale plays his crack addicted squirrelly brother Dicky Eklund. The style of the film is more realistic than the likes of 'Rocky' 'Raging Bull' and other fight films. It has some nice HBO TV style fight scenes which is shot is a clearer presentation akin to watching the bouts on primetime television. But the meat of the story and the conflict is not in Micky's quest to achieve a world title  but in his ultimately uncomfortable relationship he has with his family. 7 girls 2 boys 2 fathers and 1 mother is a hell of a mix in a poor neighbourhood. Add to that Micky's mother is also his manager his brother is his coach his father also a coach and you see how complicated this could become. Micky is essentially the meal ticket for the entire clan.Performances Bale is terrific. If he doesn't get the Best Supporting Actor Oscar this year then I'll eat my left shoe. I might regret that last statement as Geoffrey Rush seems to be swooping that accolade for 'The King's Speech' But nonetheless  Bale deserves it. His portrayal of a crack addicted mighthavebeen is spot on. Twitchy wideeyed slurred but his stint in prison and the viewing of his so called 'comeback' documentary straightened him out and made him realise what is important. Family. His brother. Adams is a ballsy character too  she has to be to survive in this environment. A strong woman who stands up for herself and her man against a formidable family group. I didn't know anything about Adams previous to this film but she seems to have that slightly grubby yet likable nature about her. Leo as the mothermanager is a tough piece of work also. The family actually reminds me of so many families that I grew up with and in  that even though you know it is exaggerated on screen  there are many veins of truth running through it. Lastly  but not least  Wahlberg himself. He has such a quiet way about him that even though he is a tough cookie grew up in VERY similar circumstances to Ward and portrays a hardy boxer with a physique to match any professional  he remains an enigma. He comes across as a truly nice guy  both on screen and in real life. Even though he has had his brushes with the law most famously his own stint in jail for a racist assault which resulted in his victim being left permanently blind in one eye he really seems to have his life on track. Successful actor producer father and husband is a testament to his ability to stay the track. Here  his performance is an understated one but still packs a punch amidst the other more animated characters. He is the soul of the film both on the screen and in the background trying to get the thing made. None of the honours mention him but he knows deep down he has made something to be very proud of. Well done Marky Mark  you've come a long way from the Funky Bunch.Overall  I'll score this 810. Some scenes a little slow to boil some 'patchy' dialogue in places but overall it's heart is in the right place.".

	schema:reviewBody "Long in the development pipeline and long something of a labour of love for actor Mark Wahlberg The Fighter arrives just before Awards season depicting a oftentold story about overcoming obstacles to reach your dream. Wahlberg who takes centre stage as IrishAmerican welterweight boxer Mickey Ward spent four years bulking himself up for the part and learning to fight like a professional fighter. You have to admire his dedication as his performance and the film itself is surprisingly excellent. After all this story has already been told in the form of Rocky although that was told with a more fairytale edge. The Fighter is grounded in a very miserable reality where poverty and crackaddiction is rife.Trained by his formerprofessional boxer halfbrother Dickie Christian Bale Mickey is going from fight to fight making little money and usually getting his arse handed to him. He is what is known in the boxing world as a 'stepping stone'  someone to knock out the way just before your big shot. Things aren't helped by the fact that Dickie is an unreliable crackhead and his manager mother is selfish and only sees what would be beneficial to her family rather than Mickey's career. Mickey O'Keefe a policeman and Mickey's cotrainer believes him to be a formidable fighter trying to do the right thing while his family keep messing things up. When Dickie is arrested and is jailed for a long stint Mickey quits boxing and shacks up with feisty bartender Charlene Amy Adams much to his mother's and his seven sister's dismay. When an opportunity presents itself Mickey must decide what is right and consider stepping back into the ring and fulfil his potential.So far so clich you may think. And you would be right to think that too as the film does tick all the boxes. Yet it has never been done with so much dedication and heart and this pours onto the screen for us to see. It's a film of excuse the pun knockout sorry! performances by a highly talented cast. The critics have raved about him yet the Awards panels have failed to recognise Mark Wahlberg's restrained performance as the shy quiet Mickey. He holds the film together as it's a film that needs a central character that you can truly root for and Wahlberg nails it. Perhaps because it is a less showy performance than the other actors but Wahlberg can stand tall after this capturing the standard of acting that we have seen previously in Boogie Nights and The Yards. It is Christian Bale however that is scooping up the awards and has received an Oscar nomination for his painful depiction of drug addled Dickie Eklund. It is a fine showcase for possibly the finest actor around at the moment and you can only sit back in awe at his complete dedication to his craft. He apparently stayed in character throughout shooting and he lost a lot of weight to portray the decimation of Dickie's addiction. Of course he's done this before in The Machinist but here his acting overshadows the physical attributes.The downside to the film is it's clichs but I was so completely engrossed in the story and the characters that I just didn't care. It is difficult for the sports genre as a whole as their is always something that has been done before. The better sports films of the last few years  Friday Night Lights Million Dollar Baby The Wrestler  also had to sacrifice originality for the sake of telling a good story and it's the same here. Kudos though for director David O. Russell who directed the fantastic Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees  both containing great Wahlberg performances who takes an unfussy nononsense approach. During the dramatic scenes he simply points the camera and allows his actors to act and the story to be told. He changes this however during the slightly disappointing boxing scenes which are clearly influenced by Scorsese's Raging Bull but lacking the magic and artistic flair of the 1980 classic.Although it's never going to win the Best Picture Oscar it is a worthy contender much like it's protagonist. I hope Bale will received the award he so thoroughly deserves and Wahlberg will realise he's not an action star but a very good actor. A very pleasant surprise.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I fell in love with this movie from its first frame. Or at any rate the first BOOMBANGCRASHWALLOP of its fabulously overthetop piano soundtrack  as if Liberace were stationed just off camera with blazing gold candelabra and rhinestonestudded Steinway grand. Its visuals are if possible lusher than its score. Crystal vases weep rose petals over the photo of a murdered woman. Venetian glass mirrors reflect the elegantly chiselled face of Klaus Kinski  glowering at us seductively over a polkadotted silk cravat.If you are used to Kinski hamming it up in a Herzog epic his role here is a revelation. As a London millionaire who may or may not have murdered his lesbian wife he is so subtle and ambiguous so  dare I say it?  restrained that he keeps us guessing right up until the last few seconds. Seeing her 'come back to life' in a porno film shot after her death Kinski's face takes on a haunted look that outdoes all his raving eyerolling and toothgnashing in more famous roles.Proof if proof were needed that director Riccardo Freda was not just a great unsung visual stylist but a maestro of mood and suspense. Imagine a Chabrol or Hitchcock with the eye of a Renaissance painter and you come close to the splendours of this film. So exquisite in its visual detail that its minor flaws  i.e. blatantly fake model car wrecks continuity howlers such as Kinski walking bareheaded through Soho then sitting in a nightclub with his hat on  simply evaporate before our eyes.Oh and I even like the tacky Italian pop ballad that keeps recurring as a 'clue'  to oddly chilling effect. So perhaps I'm just a sucker for this type of film.David Melville".

We shortly afterwards see Klaus Kinski and his wife badly superimposed onto a skislope pretending to slide down a mountain. I'm guessing the budget for this one wasn't too high but at least it lends a daft edge to this film.Fugly Klaus Kinski isn't too happy that his wife hates him and clearly parades her lesbian lover in front of him all the time which makes him the prime suspect when the car she's in crashes and explodes. The real question is Klaus hated his wife but is he the one that killed her? We follow our subdued Klaus around London as he searches hippy filled freak out dens looking for answers. It's in one of these stinking holes full of unemployable idealistic morons that Klaus discovers his wife starring in some sort of porno film. Her face is covered but a scar on her neck and a distinctive ring are enough proof for Klaus. He hooks up with a hippy chick to continue his search and gets a good kicking in a porn studio for his trouble. However as shifty as Klaus looks someone else may be up to something  why else would Klaus be being drugged?We get a calmer Klaus here but you still get the usual traits from him too  staring glowering looking etc. Nothing is quite revealed until the end so feel free to nap through some of the film  I had a feeling I did and didn't seem to miss anything either. This isn't the best Riccardo Fredda film  If you want giallo try his incredibly daft and enjoyable Iguana With the Tongue of Fire and if you want horror my preference is the Ghost. Boob fans however will not feel let down by this one.In an alternative universe Klaus Kinski would have been the ideal actor to play Mark E Smith of The Fall.".

	schema:headline " Not bad for Riccardo Freda";
	schema:reviewBody "It has to be said that Riccardo Freda wasn't the greatest Italian director to ever live and as such his films don't tend to rank among the best of the genres he's worked in. Double Face is not one of the best Giallo's ever made though it's a hell of a lot better than Freda's later The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire and it's a pretty decent genre entry in its own right. As is the case with most Giallo films the central focus of the plot is on murder but rather than following a string of murders as many of these films do this time the focus is on just one murder and the investigation into said crime. The plot centres on John Alexander a successful business man whose wife just happens to be a lesbian. She is unfortunately killed in a car crash towards the start of the film and John then encounters Christine a sexy and uninhibited blonde seductress who seems to have a keen interest in him. One thing leads to another and John ends up seeing a blue movie starring Christine and apparently his wife! The mystery then builds as John comes to believe that his wife is still alive.The stand out star of the film is definitely Klaus Kinski. It's quite odd seeing him in this role as I'm so used to seeing him play the badinsane antagonist whereas here he finds himself in the hapless victim role. Kinski keeps it together well and while this performance isn't as great as the ones where he gets to go over the top it has to be said that he gives a solid performance in the lead role. He is joined by fellow German Christiane Krger who takes up the role of sexy leading lady well and the central cast is rounded off by Margaret Lee who appeared in a handful of Giallo's including Slaughter Hotel and The Killers Are Our Guests. The film is never overly exciting and sometimes it seems too content to just wallow in the plot but there are some interesting scenes to help fill out the running time. The film is set in London although it wasn't shot on location and that fact clearly shows. The final ten minutes are the best of the film as the plot finally reveals itself and mostly makes sense. Overall I cant say that Double Face is one of the best Giallo's ever made but it's good enough and certainly worth seeing.".

Set in New York mainly Little Senegal is a compassionate crude and compelling story about love.Maybe many would disagree with the idea of love when most layers on this film seem to be about hatred and senselessness. But even when these very negative subjects are clearly portrayed on film the basic force that moves it is love. A love so deep that can endure mostly anything. The love of someone who wants to know. A man in a search that he won't let go 'til its very end.This film has been called counterHollywood. I think it's just a FrenchSenegaleseGerman film that as most filmmaking in the world is not counterHollywood it's just pure cinema where all the flashiness and predictable stupidity seen in most American films is simply not even considered.This film is a triumph in showing the terrible change that actually happens every day in American society. The dark side a very broad one of its Dream. A life that is no dream for millions. Something most Americans wouldn't even consider a possibility in their country. Something pretty well kept by the current Administration 2008 and prosecuted as crime illegal immigrants when it is a reality that has made the US what is now.This film left me thinking about many things you can see the twin towers in winter against the sky from a grave that have happened since 2001 when this film was premiered.Incosistent lives. Weird calls from politicians to their country to keep it safe. Alienating policies. Building a wall that may be the most degrading act since Berlin's Wall and the new Wall of Jerusalem.This is not a documentary but it is well documented. And it's only about the lives of a few people but it represents a huge amount of others who embraced the motto The American Dream and fell into its fangs unaware that it would change their lives from the inside.It's a fact I lived many times a fact we see every day but a fact we don't want to look at because it makes us feel guilty.Acting is spoton cinematography is what cinematography should always be a medium to convey the story to the viewer and on this film it's plainly brilliant. One of the most exhilarating qualities of this film is the way sound is mixed most of the time its direct sound is so forceful that you actually feel the weather. The soundtrack is outstanding and it comes in handy many times to play a character on its own.Watch this film you won't be disappointed. Be ready to cringe and cry.".

Because they were bred only with Rosetta's DNA they need the balance of an Y chromo or male sperm to survive. Rosetta projects seduction scenes from movie clips onto Ruby which absorbs as she sleeps. The SRA'S can not distinguish dreams from reality. Ruby acts out these scenes in real life with the men and shares her spoils with her sisters.

The film is about a scientist who creates three computer generatedrobotic duplicates of her own self. The duplicates exist in a virtual reality safe from the harm that the real world can levy on them. As the film progresses we see through the interactions with the main character that they have become her alter egos. Trouble brews when they start to become selfaware and want more freedom. As I watched the film I was surprised by the apparent low budget it was made with but how it outshines most bigbudget Hollywood blockbusters in its depth and scope. The acting is OK but amateurish with occasional bad timing and wooden responses. The dialogue seems to get a little too long and pretentious at times and you have to be very attentive to catch the double entendres and metaphors in order to keep up with the script. Despite all this it was a very good movie that proves that there is underappreciated talent out there that Hollywood refuses to acknowledge.

These are the films which consistently make worthwhile viewing  regardless of how we feel about the film there are enough people with opposing viewpoints that we can consider for a fresh insight on things...Teknolust is this process in small. To some it seems dull to others thoughtful. Some find it obvious and crudely drawn others see it as a symbolic metaphor. Some belabor the obvious scientific inconsistencies while others focus on the human side of things.This movie is something of a landmark being the first? featurelength production to be shot entirely in digital 24P. The sharp visuals are the result of this. No technical stuff but 24P is a step toward making digital video more filmlike. It is interesting to note that the director still chose to keep and exaggerate the digital feel for the production. Tilda Swinton is definitely a draw  one of my favorite actresses utterly fearless and it is delightful to see her with so much to work with. LOVED her interpretive dance  sheer fun! Upon considering the reviews which felt the acting to be hopelessly wooden I can see where they are coming from. But it may well be that this was a deliberate approach by the director  doesn't Rosetta tell Ruby to be more robotic on her web portal as she is starting to appear too real? The more I think about it the more it seems to me that the slightly detached acting was yet another mechanism to make us question what is real and what is only presented to us.The movie features many wry little jokes  I love that Rosetta's geneticist associate is named Crick Crick  Watson  Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962 for discovering DNA  and I suspect that further viewings will reveal more. Lots of little questions too  like why does Agent Hopper have little adhesive bandages on his face in different places during the movie? Does he have a disease? There are also some interesting questions raised about our reality in a digital world. How many copies are we removed from the original? At what point does copy degradation set in? The copy center employee who is fascinated by skewed imperfect copies is a brilliant concept for a character. For many people daily and digital lives are overlapping. What would it be like if they blended with just as much casual copying and exchanging of information? A virus is essentially an information packet. Is real reality ultimately more desirable than digital reality? I look forward to watching Teknolust again. With an open mind. And a touch of dream. And some friends to discuss it with afterward.".

But I have to warn you off. This is written and directed by someone with such a shallow understanding of the issues involved that it is a selfparody. There are some truly interesting concepts that could have been explored if the science in this science fiction was actual science  or even if the concepts had been coherent and the writing good.The general idea here is that seduction identity experience cinema and something she calls technology are coupled in a way that matters and is interesting and embodied in a virus. Also that what it means to be a woman and to desire desire circumnavigates these four points of a compass.Although Tilda is more than capable of layered seduction what we have here is manikin attraction. There is no hint of real seduction either among the characters or with the audience. There are copious references to films important and influential films. But they might as well have been posters on the wall as they are not integrated in any way with the film we see.The real problem is that the idea of selfaware beings vlogs here called portals human and computer viruses DNA and semen are somehow conflated as if they somehow were equivalent. Tilda stars as a young woman in a university near San Francisco who is a programmerAI researcher. She is a hidden genius who is profoundly lonely so creates three clones of herself independent robots consisting of code made flesh. The three each are a primary color and are named so. Tilda plays these women as well. At night they download selected seduction scenes from movies as dreams but are generally bored as they are cooped up in our genius's basement. Oh our genius is named Rosetta Stone. One of the replicants Ruby goes out at night  Jess Francolike  and harvests semen from males she seduces by repeating scenes from movies. The semen is needed to feed the clones and to reinforce their immune systems. Those systems are infected with the virus that created them  the selfreplicating virus being what brought them into being. The men in question become infected with this virus which leaves them impotent and with a bar code on their foreheads.I'm not making any of this up.After several dozen cases of infected men show up some goofy agency is called that inspects these sorts of things and a gaggle of incompetent males is flummoxed. At the end the key investigator is seduced by our heroine the real one while our vampiress falls in love with a guy who works on a duplicating machine what we would call a xerox.Oh the investigative agency calls in a disenfranchised expert Dirty Dick played by a sixty two year old Karen Black who scopes things out but does not interfere.So much of this is designed to resonate with me just by the accident of what I do and who I am. But it is such incompetent storytelling so lacking in seduction and coherence so empty of insight that it harms a disease. The Love Virus is better as bad as it is.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

A lonely nerdy female scientist replicates herself into a trio of cybernetic copies. In order to live these clones need regular doses of male chromosomes found only in male sperm. So the eldest copy goes out into the world collecting samples for the sustenance of her and her sisters. Yes this definitely sounds like something that came out of the imagination of some sexstarved scifi nerd. Except... that the film was actually written and directed by a woman. So there is plenty of subtext and symbolism to legitimize a plot that sounds like it was dreamed up in Letters to Penthouse. Tilda Swinton is the main reason to watch this movie... she plays the scientist and the three copies and she does a great job of making each one of them a different character. Also there is one wacky scene where the three sisters are doing some weird interpretive dance all on screen at the same time that is just sublime! Unfortunately except for Swinton the acting is pretty awful. Actually Jeremy Davies is okay playing a lovelorn copy guy who falls in love with one of the copies but all he really gets to do is make cute puppy eyes at Tilda. For a comedy... the tone of this movie seems awfully sombre at times. A quicker pace and some livelier dialogue might have helped this movie become a classic. As it is it's an okay movie enlivened by the talent of Tilda Swinton.".

Hell the solid red green and yellow color schemes should clue you in that this is more like 60's psychadelic dreams. Other clues that this is fantasy is that Rosetta talks to her clones Ruby Olive and Marine through a microwave oven!One great line in the movie that really got me rolling on the floor was when Olive tells Marine that a virus that she just eradicated was from an attachment and Marine responds that Rosetta was right attachments are dangerous. Of course this was double entendre one meaning of the word attachment meant email attachments while the other one meant relationships.

If anything profem point it out. It just cannot be seen from the screen nor heard from the dialogues.Anyhow it might be the worst investment of your 80 minutes. Luckily though not more than 80.310".

	schema:headline " High tech fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "This film has high aspirations and gives the viewer plenty to think about both good and not so good but the story's execution by the director is a mixed bag that has rightly given this film it's cult status. Story is about Rosetta Stone Tilda Swinton who's a scientist in biotechnology and she's made three computer clones of herself by downloading her DNA. The three clones are Ruby Marinne and Olivia all played by Swinton and they live in Rosetta's computer but at night Ruby sneaks out into the real world as a hooker and collects sperm samples from men which she takes back to make tea with that refuels them.SPOILER ALERT The men that have had encounters with Ruby all become impotent and get a rash on their forehead resembling a barcode which prompts Agent Hopper James Urbaniak to investigate and it leads to Rosetta whom he quarantines. Meanwhile a nerdy and virginal copyshop guy named Sandy Jeremy Davies meets Ruby and they talk of how difficult intimacy is and leads to them falling in love.This film is directed by Lynn HershmanLeeson who is making her second feature film effort after Conceiving Ada also with Swinton and while she shows great promise in her ideas it's the manner in which her films are told that comes under scrutiny. I'm definitely not one that wants a script to be obvious and dumbed down for general audiences God forbid but I do believe that this story could have been a tad more self explanatory. It does take a concentrated effort to follow some of this story but I do think that if viewers stick with it they might find enough substance to keep them interested. One is the casting of actress Karen Black as a transsexual private eye which has become typical in some of the roles in her career. Leeson's film does have an interesting look to it not because it was shot on highdefinition video but just a uniqueness from the bar that Ruby ventures to and the living quarters that the three clones live in. None of this means much without the performance of Swinton who's presence alone is worthy enough to give this a look and she does an exceptional job of giving all four of her characters a distinctive persona of they're own. The films script asks enough interesting questions about making copies in our own image and what people really want or need in terms of intimacy but the end result is a film that's amusing but comes across slightly cockeyed.".

Not only is she the shy Dr. Rosetta Stone she also plays her offspring Ruby Olive and Marine. She decides to mix her DNA with an experimental AI program and the results are interesting to say the least. There are plentyosynopsis type reviews out there so if you want plot details etc  please look elsewhere. I can tell you that one of the scenes at the beginning made me say EEEWWWhhh out loud. But like a car crash  I couldn't look away. The acting is as mechanical as it should be  no more or less. The overall look of the film is very glossy and sharp. It definitely qualifies as eye candy. Tilda Swinton does a fine job playing all the lead characters and Jeremy Davies is completely believable as the inept copy boy. This movie has plenty of tongue in cheekyness. This surprised me. I avoided all the online reviews until I could see it for myself and was ready for something very artsy and serious. It does deliver that on some levels but it's not near as cold and stark as it could be. Overall it has a good mix of technology art and humor  in a variable order.".

	schema:reviewBody "Teknolust is like someone wrote a terrible script for a scifi sex comedy and then handed it to someone with the sense of humor of a pine wood box. Since Lynn Hershman Leeson was both writer and director here I can only conclude she has a split personality. One of them must be a talentless hack and the other a Trappist monk whose funny bone has been surgically replaced with a rod of boron.Rosetta Stone Tilda Swinton is a research scientist. Yes that's her name. No neither she nor this story has a blessed thing to do with language or translation. Rosetta has created three copies of herself darkhaired Ruby blonde Olive and redheaded Marinne. Are they clones? Robots? Some sort of virtual constructs? Even if you haven't seen this film your guess is still as good as mine. They're referred to as viruses in the movie but this script also suggests computer viruses can infect human beings so take that for what it's worth. Rosetta keeps her copies hidden away in color coordinated rooms subjects them to old Hollywood movies as they sleep and communicates with them through her microwave. Yes her microwave.Rosetta doesn't appear to have anything for her copies to do so they basically just lounge around until nightfall. That's when Ruby goes out to find food for the copies. What do they need to survive? Human sperm. Ruby goes out picks up a random guy to have sex with and then brings the used condom home so she can use it to brew up some tea. Ruby also runs a website called an internet portal in the film. It's not entirely clear what Ruby does on her site but it's enough to make a fan of Sandy Jeremy Davies a loser who lives with his mom across the street from Rosetta and company.The guys Ruby boinks start going impotent and sterile with red rashes between their eyes that turn into bar codes. That sparks an investigation by one of Rosetta's colleagues John O'Keefe an undefined federal agent named Hopper James Urbaniak and Hopper's even more undefined associate Dirty Dick Karen Black. There's a whole bunch of floundering around where it's never all that clear what's happening with any of the characters leading to what I can only assume is theoretically meant to be a happy ending for all involved.Despite the nature of the story I just described Teknolust has no nudity or sex scenes. There's also no real profanity or violence. The dialog stinks and the actors mostly appear to be engaged in some sort of competition to see who can look and sound most like a department store mannequin. There's some decent set design but when you notice that you know you're watching an awful motion picture.I could never tell the difference between when Teknolust was trying to be funny and when it was trying to be dramatic which obviously means it failed at both. As best I can figure it this film is an attempt at willful oddity like one of those off off off Broadway plays where everybody's wearing galoshes and speaking Esperanto. This movie isn't really that odd though. Even with the whole used condom tea thing Teknolust is like some suburban housewife's tame concept of weird. It's the crazy ramblings of someone whose creativity was burned out by watching too many middle school plays.Unless you're entertained by stuff like a character who whispers for no reason or another who constantly has a bandaid over a different part of his body like Les Nessman from WKRP in Cincinatti you should stay away from this movie. It's boring and gets more boring every time it pathetically tries to be interesting.".

There are nice sets though and the use of strong basic colors is interesting and hardly unnoticeable. But everything else is void. The movie is deprived of a strong premise a decent storyline and interesting ideas. Every theme present in TEKNOLUST was already debated in several other movies cyborg questioning his nature and trying to turn human human falling for cyborg the dangers of genetic manipulation and cloning and so on.I'll not bother criticizing the absurd computerrelated technicalities because that becomes unimportant when compared to the flawed and unstructured plot. If there isn't a good plot a strong dilemma it's hard for us to become attached to the movie. TEKNOLUST suffers from this problem and I couldn't care more about what was going on. If it weren't for three plus one Tilda Swintons I'd probably never had reached the end of the film. Even though the movie is slow and uninteresting. The deficient plot translates in lack of cinematic rhythm. It's boring. Luckily TEKNOLUST runs for no more than 80 minutes.Not everything is awful as you might expect. Apart from the nice use of colors be it on the sets or in the wigs and costumes there is some kind of wittiness in the tone of the movie that keeps us from leaving the theatre. Nevertheless what ultimately saves this movie from being a total disaster is the glamorous Tilda Swinton.".

It was artfully done and skillfully told this story focuses on a French man's journey through the steppes of Kazakhastan. This journey clearly matched the landscape desolate lonely downtrodden. Perhaps sad. Provocative views emerged both from the scenery and the loneliness that sometimes seared through the tale.I enjoyed the views of the rivers and steppes the animals and the people. It was a view of a land and culture I have never seen. The encounters with Ulzhan a French teacher at a Kazakhastani school and even Shakani were good momentum builders to a seemingly desolate trajectory injected at the right time to keep the story moving. In my mind this movie is not about Ulzhan but the man's journey. This probably created some unwanted expectations in my mind. I think if the movie were differently titled  not sure to what  it might have been better setup in my mind.Nonetheless this was a good movie overall. It was leisurely paced to capture the lost feelings of the story wellacted and with the right tone and backdrop to capture the bleak and subtle humanity of the overall movie.".

The encounters with Ulzhan a French teacher at a Kazakhastani school and even Shakani were good momentum builders to a seemingly desolate trajectory injected at the right time to keep the story moving. In my mind this movie is not about Ulzhan but the man's journey. This probably created some unwanted expectations in my mind. I think if the movie were differently titled  not sure to what  it might have been better setup in my mind.Nonetheless this was a good movie overall. It was leisurely paced to capture the lost feelings of the story wellacted and with the right tone and backdrop to capture the bleak and subtle humanity of the overall movie.";

Ostensibly the story is about a French teacher who mysteriously stops his car on the side of a highway in the middle of Kazakhastan and starts walking East into the steppes. Despite being grounded in a very unassuming and naturalistic performance by Philippe Torreton and set against the very real backdrop of modern Kazakhastan the film exists in a world of dream logic. Much of the dialog is alternatively poetic or lunatic and the relationships between French teacher and the two guides he picks up are only understandable on subconscious symbolic level as in dreams.At a symbolic level the film appears to be about European involvement with the eastern world. The film takes place in the steppes of central Eurasia the very border of the occidental and oriental worlds. Throughout the film we're consciously reminded of the cultural 'living in zoo vs. living in the jungle' economic international oil drilling and environmental aral sea nuclear testing sites impacts of occidental involvement in the orient. Unfortunately a lot of the comment seems to be overtly racist. The French man in many ways seems to represent the Occidental world in it's relationship with the oriental world. He is racked with self doubt and existential concerns over his presence and purpose which he describes as a search for 'treasure' but seems to be a desire for selfdestruction. Despite his wish to remain uninvolved with anyone while on his search a young local Kazakhastani woman Ulzhan who herself works as a French teacher insists on leaving everything to follow the French man and serve him as a slave oh the white man's burden. The comment seems to be that as much as EuropeansAmericans may desire to remain uninvolved in the oriental worlds they invade for resources etc. they will find themselves playing the unwanted role of master to the oriental even if they had not intended it. The film ends on the note of the oriental slave being the only one that can save the Europe from itself. Needless to say a Toronto audience wasn't particularly impressed with the message. The film didn't receive a single clap at its conclusion which is the first time I've seen that at any festival movie.".

	schema:headline " A dark vision of the then near future";
	schema:reviewBody "Kamikaze 1989 is a German movie from 1982 so this one has its 35th anniversary this year. The director is Wolf Gremm and he is also among the writers who adapted the novel for the screen here. The outcome is a 105minute movie in the German language. The lead actor is famous German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder and this is actually his last performance of an actor before his untimely death. Fittingly the cast also includes many actors who have appeared on several occasions in Fassbinder's films such as Mira or Kaufmann. I already wrote that this movie is from 1982 and the events it depicts are actually a vision of the future of what the year 1989 may look like. A touch of Clockwork Orange you will find in here for sure even if the focus is on the good side of the law this time. Fassbinder's character is a police officer dealing with a bomb threat that may be legit or just a prank. It all has to do with the governing institution that is apparently very powerful and has their very own ways to make sure things stay the way they are. You could certainly characterize this film as shrill here. The sets but even more so the costumes are really extremely over the top but it feels all intended and it adds a decent little atmosphere to the entire project.But unfortunately the story cannot deliver beyond all the bright and colorful characters in here. The story about the crime becomes ultimately forgettable in the face of it being just one absurd scene chasing the next. And sadly these aforementioned characters rarely have more than two scenes which results in them becoming ultimately mostly forgettable as the moment they may have depth they are recycled for the next wave of characters. Except Fassbinder of course who is in this for every scene from start to finish. As a consequence the film also feels very Fassbinder for example during the scene when the woman invites him to her place and also the entire scene at her place then. Anyway I personally was relatively underwhelmed and I would call this a piece of style over substance. I still think Fassbinder is at least as good of an actor as he is of a writer and director and he shows it here. There are moments when his line delivery comes off a bit wooden but it still works somehow. He is the least of problems this film has even if I found it pretty sad to see him like this. His looks make clear that something is very wrong with him and his health and it was a bit of a depressing watch because of this even if his acting was certainly one of the very few okay aspects about this movie. But overall it is just not enough especially in terms of the script which sacrifices coherency in its desperate and unsuccessful attempts to be as bold and mesmerizing as possible. Don't watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "Kamikaze 1989 is a German movie from 1982 so this one has its 35th anniversary this year. The director is Wolf Gremm and he is also among the writers who adapted the novel for the screen here. The outcome is a 105minute movie in the German language. The lead actor is famous German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder and this is actually his last performance of an actor before his untimely death. Fittingly the cast also includes many actors who have appeared on several occasions in Fassbinder's films such as Mira or Kaufmann. I already wrote that this movie is from 1982 and the events it depicts are actually a vision of the future of what the year 1989 may look like. A touch of Clockwork Orange you will find in here for sure even if the focus is on the good side of the law this time. Fassbinder's character is a police officer dealing with a bomb threat that may be legit or just a prank. It all has to do with the governing institution that is apparently very powerful and has their very own ways to make sure things stay the way they are. You could certainly characterize this film as shrill here. The sets but even more so the costumes are really extremely over the top but it feels all intended and it adds a decent little atmosphere to the entire project.But unfortunately the story cannot deliver beyond all the bright and colorful characters in here. The story about the crime becomes ultimately forgettable in the face of it being just one absurd scene chasing the next. And sadly these aforementioned characters rarely have more than two scenes which results in them becoming ultimately mostly forgettable as the moment they may have depth they are recycled for the next wave of characters. Except Fassbinder of course who is in this for every scene from start to finish.

It features Rainer Werner Fassbinder only acting he has no creative role in the project beyond that as far as I can tell in the lead. It has appearances by Franco Nero and Brigitte Mira. Co starring is early Fassbinder regular Gunther Kaufman. The point is the cast is pretty damn good.The soundtrack is entirely original and is penned by Edgar Froese of Tangerine Dream. I am assuming that was not cheap for the producers to arrange.With a good cast good soundtrack you have what appears to be a good futuristic sci fi script. An antihero cop and his partner are called in to organize an evacuation of the building for the most important corporation in the country or world was a little fuzzy of how far it reached. The bomb threat turns out to be a hoax then things get twisted and confusing. I'd describe the story has having half devils battling half angels except you can't tell if they are fighting themselves or there really is a certain opposition. The film ends with major events not appearing on film. In fact the film feels like it's missing most of the third act before coming to an abrupt conclusion. You sort of have closure during the very end but the exposition is coming from a news broadcast. It could have been thrown on in post production just to save the project and get it rushed to release in time to still cash in on the international success of Blade runner both are futuristic sci fi stories but Blade Runner debuted a month before this or perhaps to capitalize on the untimely death of Fassbinder who died unexpectedly 6 weeks before this film was released.Regardless of the reasons you get what might have been a complex story well acted and brought to life via an interesting plot and without the need for cheap special effects. Alas you get the pretense of a good story and are stuck trying to piece together the events in the second and third acts. It's a chore.I've watched this several times. I like most I imagine was drawn to this movie if only to see the type of film project Fassbinder would simply act in without much more creative input. The film looked like it was trying to follow the same approach of Fassbinder sci fi experiments like World on a Wire. Maybe if Kamikaze '89 were almost three and a half hours long to explain what the heck is happening like World On A Wire is then perhaps things would be different. Instead good luck with the 106 minutes you get.".

There's also the ending where Fassbinder bloated in a robe girates his body against a photo of an astronaut I'm guessing this is Fassbinder's input as the exact same ending pretty much is used in Stationmaster's Wife.

The story is full of strange shady secretive and suspicious characters but the revelation of the killer's identity still comes as a shock to me at least  it blew my theory away!. Apart from the sometimes overemphatic music score this 40yearold movie still holds up today. And who wants to miss any opportunity of seeing Klaus Kinski playing....Klaus Kinski?

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Lee in Circus Of Fear. It's got to be a horror movie right ? Well no. Circus Of Fear is a pretty classicstyle whodunnit full of red herrings and characters with skeletons in their cupboards.It starts with a very dramatic and almost silent armoured car heist which goes terribly wrong when a security guard is shot and killed. The gang escape and divide up the loot saving one share for their boss who only communicates with them via the phone and who none of them have ever seen. The action soon moves to the winter quarters of Barberini's circus  which appears to be somewhere in Berkshire! There is a quite surreal shot of a line of elephants and camels moving down a suburban street. The rest of the film takes place here its angloGerman cast perfectly capturing the international flavour of the circus. And it is here that the murder mystery element of the film really takes off. Leo Genn is 'Gentleman Jim' Elliott the police inspector investigating the heist. Though it seems most of the circus folk are keeping an eye on each other. Christopher Lee makes a startling appearance as Gregor the lion tamer who wears a black hood at all times to hide the horrible scars he received when he was attacked by a lion. The film was written and produced by Harry Alan Towers for whom Lee made the series of Fu Manchu pictures and directed by John Moxey for whom he had made the 1959 occult chiller City Of The Dead. There are pleasures to be had from cameo appearances by the likes of Cecil Parker as Elliott's superior and Klaus Kinski who gets to lurk menacingly as a member of the gang. It's not long before more bodies start piling up. But who is the killer ? Is it Barberini the circus owner with financial troubles ? Mario the jealous knifethrower ? Maybe it's Mr. Big the blackmailer ? Or Karl the ringmaster with an unhealthy interest in Gina Mario's girlfriend ? Or maybe it's Gregor whose brother is in jail for murder ? I've seen the film. I know the truth. The killer is..Aaaarghh!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is living proof of the wonders a stunninglooking print on DVD can do to a film when I first saw it in a dubbed version on latenight Italian TV I had felt it was nothing more than average and dismissed it somewhat. Truth be told a few weeks prior to this I had watched the other Christopher LeeJohn Moxey film  THE CITY OF THE DEAD 1960  by way of VCI's exemplary DVD edition and perhaps I compared it unfavorably to this minor horror classic. I had long known Blue Underground were preparing a SE and I was not sure it was worthwhile for me to invest in it but now I'm certainly glad I did because I enjoyed the film immensely even though I had my heart in my throat all the time expecting the picture to freeze and break up any minute  which thankfully did not occur!. It's still nothing great I guess Lee certainly made many better films where his talents were more immediately in evidence the hood and the fairly ridiculous accent hamper his performance here somewhat but it's easily the best film from BU's The Christopher Lee Collection Set  and in fact it and the restored edition of THE BLOODY JUDGE 1970 not forgetting the plentiful and wonderful supplements save this relatively expensive purchase from being a wasted opportunity considering the low profile of all four titles in the Lee canon! The plot is pretty convoluted I can certainly believe Jess Franco here when he said that Harry Alan Towers is a very good writer not evidenced by the two Fu Manchu films while the identity of the killer could have easily been established if one had thought about it for a while considering it follows the Agatha Christie maxim that the least suspiciouslooking character is indeed the guilty party but frankly the film provides red herrings and new twists at every turn that when the final revelation is made it still comes as fairly surprising it's perhaps harder to swallow that the buffoonish if clearly ambitious Eddie could be the delicious Margaret Lee's secret lover!. The film also features an arresting opening robbery sequence and is beautifully shot for such a lowbudget film. The music score is very atmospheric and the circus scenes consist mainly of stock footage but the liontaming and knifethrowing acts inject a measure of excitement at appropriate moments.Casting is certainly aboveaverage for this type of film there are some pretty good performances here Leo Genn's above all as the amiable yet dogged Police Inspector Margaret Lee is more than a radiant beauty  despite her sluttish character she was fairly sympathetic especially after having been threatened by a lion and I think that the film loses something with her sudden tragic exit I liked Skip Martin a lot amusingly named Mr. Big  he is a pretty interesting character to begin with sort of a cynical Chorus to the proceedings and even more so for being involved in some shady business on the side for which he gets his just desserts in the end! Klaus Kinski is eminently watchable despite his limited role at least he does manage an effective death scene Cecil Parker added some nice but not overstated British humor Heinz Drache made for a pretty engaging hero Suzy Kendall on the other hand was more decorative than anything else  though in all fairness she could only do so much with her thinlywritten role. As I've already mentioned it's disappointing that Christopher Lee was not involved at all with this release an interview would have been nice.The gloved killer of this film brings up comparisons with the giallos being made contemporaneously in Italy though it's nowhere near as violent in fact this one is pretty tame in the scaresgore department. I did notice some flaws in the story Christopher Lee taking off his hood when his mortal enemy Drache is beside him is a miscalculation in my opinion ditto we never learn how Drache finds Lee and Kendall's hidingplace in the cave so easily when we had just been told the Police had scoured the area thoroughly bearing no results! Also Lee's death comes as a surprise he is not the villain and if it was done because it was deemed 'obligatory' it was certainly a silly move!I only saw the film for the first time a couple of years back but for the life of me I have no idea what constitutes the 'new' 8minute sequence which was supposedly unearthed for this release? Can anyone shed some light on the matter? The Audio Commentary is somewhat dry though Moxey's enthusiasm for his films if not his memory of them is constantly felt throughout the discussion again disappointingly the cuts this film was subjected to are hardly mentioned and certainly not listed in any way  though in all fairness Moxey probably wouldn't have watched any of the export versions not recently anyway!".

That's possibly why this film is not easy to come by as despite the fact that it stars Christopher Lee in an interesting role as a circus lion tamer Circus of Fear at times isn't all that easy to get along with as the plot is really quite messy and the horror that goes along with the central mystery often gets in the way. The plot begins with a botched heist that ends with one of the criminals shooting a police officer. The shooter is given the chance to go and give the boss his share before being allowed to flee the country but unfortunately he is murdered upon his arrival at the meeting place. The action then switches to the local circus where is believed that the identity of the murderer will be revealed. There we are introduced to a whole host of shady and mysterious characters...The film is directed by John Llewellyn Moxey who previously directed Christopher Lee in the excellent fogsoaked City of the Dead. Said previous film is a better one as the plot worked better but while Circus of Fear doesn't always work well the things that do work are very good and the film never gets boring. The cast is headed by Christopher Lee who is grim and imposing in his role as a horribly scarred and masked lion tamer. The film also features a small role for the great Klaus Kinski as well as sound performances from British performers Anthony Newlands Leo Genn and Margeret Lee. The film presents a lot of suspects and it soon becomes easier to just watch it rather than try and guess who the killer is. However the two twists in the tale can be guessed the first one is very obvious without putting too much strain on the viewer which is a shame. City of the Dead was all about atmosphere and this film is fairly atmospheric too though not nearly to the same extent as the earlier film which is another shame. Overall Circus of Fear is not a great film but it's entertaining enough and I can recommend it.".

This latter happens to be one of my all time favorite suspense films and even though Circus of Horror isn't as unsettling or astonishing it still definitely is a very good movie with an interesting plot and an original setting. To my regret however I also must admit that it's a severely flawed movie and that's largely because the makers didn't seem to know for sure whether they were shooting a detectivethriller... or a horror film. The opening sequences show a group of men robbing a truck transporting bank money and the loot then mysteriously disappears within the scenery of a traveling circus. Scotland Yard inspector Elliot investigates the case and encounters many potential culprits such as a masked lion tamer horror veteran Christopher Lee a blackmailing dwarf and an emotionally frustrated knifethrower quite a danger in his profession. Many older Britthrillers had extended wellmounted heist sequences so the one featuring here isn't very spectacular. The sequences inside the circus are very atmospheric though and nearly every character looks threatening and as if they're hiding something. The plot takes quite a few twists near the end and the outcome eventually is unsatisfying...or at least it was to me. The cast is excellent with yet another strong performance of Christopher Lee and a curious role for Klaus Kinski as Manfred. If you're familiar with classic horror you'll recognize the dwarf from other genuine gems like Vampire Circus Hammer The Masque of the Red Death Roger Corman and Horror Hospital. This could have been a much better movie but  hey  who's complaining? Definitely worth a watch if you can find it.".

The mystery that unfolds is a dandy with quite a surprise revelation of who the killer is. I'm really happy I had a chance to see the remastered and fully uncut Blue Underground presentation in color as it really should be seen in a quality transfer. The setting of a circus only adds an extra dimension to the mystery and seeing an early crime thriller featuring the likes of Lee and Kinski certainly provides CIRCUS OF FEAR with an extra allure. And in the capable hands of underrated director John Llewellyn Moxey you can expect solid camera work and an effective filmmaking style. Probably one of the more recognizable Krimi thrillers to come out of the genre even if this particular film was actually shot in London with German monetary backing. Well produced by Harry Alan Towers..a real winner if you like a good mystery and interesting characters. The film itself however doesn't quite live up to that humdinger of an opening heist which is excellently staged.".

A member of the heist MasonVictor Maddern shoots a driver who wouldn't halt when he told him to stop and must deliver a suitcase featuring a quarter million pounds to the mastermind of the operation located at a circus. Mason is stabbed in the back by the person who must be a professional knife thrower and the suitcase somehow winds up in the possession of liontamer GregorChristopher Lee a sternvoiced and serious circus star whose head is covered by a balaclava to protect his facial scars. He works with his niece NatashaSuzy Kendall whose father we are informed had escaped from a South African prison after killing a man associated with another circus. But as we will soon discover Gregor and Natasha are hiding a secret and ringmaster CarlHeinz Drache whose carried personal animosity towards their relative for quite some time..Natasha's father Otto killed his fatherand awaits his return to see them. He has quite a surprise in store. Meanwhile knifethrower Mario'sMaurice Kaufmann fianc GinaMargaret Leediscovers a set of knives..with the distinctive characteristic of a silver triangle with one missing that may very well be the weapon used to kill Mason..it's a person she's been sexually active with and his arm is hairy. After one murder attempt on her life the killer succeeds in silencing her the second time right under the police's nose with Scotland Yard detective Inspector ElliotLeo Gennworking with ManleyLawrence Jamesof local police to find the stolen money and solve the mystery as to who is behind the series of killings. While most of those involved with heist are either dead or in prison Manfred HartKlaus Kinski with limited dialogue but still quite effective thanks to his fascinating faceis snooping around in search of the loot hidden away by Gregor. Other characters include BarberiniAnthony Newlands owner of the circus EddieEddi Aren't his assistant who desperately wants to have an act as a clown and dwarf Mr. BigSkip Martin another who works as a hand blackmailing Gregor in keeping mum over an important fact unknown to the rest of the group.Very plotdriven crime thriller with quite a gallery of interesting suspects and a terrific cast. Lee even behind the black balaclava impresses as does Genn as the delightful detective who seems at ease despite the difficult case he's stuck with. Heinz Drache as the determined ringmaster out to get revenge for his father's death with colorful characterizations from Aren't as the goofball Eddie and Martin as the midget he's always playing practical jokes on.

Christopher Lee is the hooded Gregor masked in mystery also kept by his lovely niece Natasha Suzy Kendall who fancies Heinz Drache the attractive circus ringmaster with a secret edge to him. Barberini deftly played by Anthony Newlands has all the bigness of a circus owner making policy and calling the shots a powerful personality in his Russian hat and odd accent. Maurice Kaufmann is Mario the controlling jealous boyfriend of the beautiful playgirl Gina played by a beguiling Margaret Lee. Add to the mix Klaus Kinski the oddly affected criminal trying to tie up ends Mason the imperfect money deliverer hard boiled crime leader Jackson Manley the sweet local police lieutenant Cecil Parker as the incredulous eyepopping Sir John Skip Martin as the conniving midget Mr. Big and the idiotically sweet Eddie Eddi Arentt the circus owner's right hand man and clown wannabe. It is an interesting story a good mystery with a fabulous theme weaving interesting characters with mysterious agendas starkly filmed with a surprise ending well worth the wait. It is on my A list.

I've just watched the 91minute colour version put out on DVD by Blue Underground and found it absorbing throughout.My guess is that many of the reviewers have seen only the truncated 1965 American version 65 minutes naturally missing 26 minutes of a 91 minute film one will see only a very imperfect version of what the filmmakers intended. To get a true sense of the film one has to have the uncut version.Despite the advertisements of the time which played up the film as a horror movie cashing in on the fact that horror icon Christopher Lee was the star of the film this is not a horror film. There are some frightening moments but this is essentially a whodunit and a fairly good one. The slight horror tinge to the film with its hooded lion tamer murders by skillfully thrown knives screaming circus starlets vicious circus lions etc. add atmosphere but the story remains a whodunit.It's also a caper film insofar as it opens with a wellfilmed money truck heist in broad daylight on the Tower Bridge in London. It was filmed on location for that part. But there ends up being some kind of sinister and unclear connection between the heist and goingson at a circus and it takes the whole film to make clear exactly what the connection is.Leo Genn is brilliant as the Scotland Yard detective. He has a smooth beautiful calm acting manner reminiscent of Herbert Marshall's and is a joy to watch. The excellent dialogue he is given doesn't hurt. The movie also has good performances by a number of very good British and German actors of the 1960s it was a GermanEnglish coproduction.Christopher Lee is good in the part of the hooded liontamer with an ambiguous past. He shows his ability to act in nonhorror parts here.The opening and closing theme music is good with a 1960s British flavor but the film itself has only incidental music with many parts of the story unaccompanied. This works well for this type of film.The colour photography is beautiful.This movie is definitely worth more than a 7 out of 10. Maybe it's not quite worth an 8 but to compensate for the ridiculous 5.4 average I give it an 8 anyway. That's less misleading than a 5.4. A 5.4 says Don't waste your time watching this movie but this movie is very much worth watching for Genn's performance alone not to mention its other merits.".

	schema:headline " too cheap too grainy and too forgettable";
	schema:reviewBody "While I'm heartened that Christopher Lee is currently enjoying something of a career renaissance thanks to his imposing presence in the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars films the truth is this talented performer has lent himself to an astounding number of unworthy projects over the course of his fiftyeight years on screen. How does one explain participating in wretched films like The Devil's Agent Curse of the Crimson Alter and Safari 3000? Is it all about the money? Perhaps but not in the way you might think I tend to believe Mr. Lee has lost too many bets to too many bad filmmakers.Circus of Fear is typical of the projects Lee involved himself in during the early to mid '60's when not working on English horror films drearily shot on bad film stock sloppily dubbed even when performed in English! poorly financed and apparently edited with a chainsaw. The opening heist scene has potential but is so poorly photographed it's hard to tell at first if the film is in color or black and white. The film plods along choppily until we are introduced to the circus folk including Lee and the proceedings grow increasingly murky and complicated as their backstories develop. As Lee has often done he has accepted a role that is more an extended cameo than a lead part he plays a disfigured lion tamer who hides his face beneath a heavy black hood which clashes with the beige tweed jacket he wears throughout the film. Lee's liontaming scene is embarrassing shots of the actor wielding a whip interspersed with even grainier shots of anemic looking lions lifted from another film. To make matters worse the fact that Lee performs from behind the aforementioned hood draws attention to his rich sonorous baritone.

	onyx:emotionText "While I'm heartened that Christopher Lee is currently enjoying something of a career renaissance thanks to his imposing presence in the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars films the truth is this talented performer has lent himself to an astounding number of unworthy projects over the course of his fiftyeight years on screen. How does one explain participating in wretched films like The Devil's Agent Curse of the Crimson Alter and Safari 3000? Is it all about the money? Perhaps but not in the way you might think I tend to believe Mr. Lee has lost too many bets to too many bad filmmakers.Circus of Fear is typical of the projects Lee involved himself in during the early to mid '60's when not working on English horror films drearily shot on bad film stock sloppily dubbed even when performed in English! poorly financed and apparently edited with a chainsaw. The opening heist scene has potential but is so poorly photographed it's hard to tell at first if the film is in color or black and white. The film plods along choppily until we are introduced to the circus folk including Lee and the proceedings grow increasingly murky and complicated as their backstories develop. As Lee has often done he has accepted a role that is more an extended cameo than a lead part he plays a disfigured lion tamer who hides his face beneath a heavy black hood which clashes with the beige tweed jacket he wears throughout the film. Lee's liontaming scene is embarrassing shots of the actor wielding a whip interspersed with even grainier shots of anemic looking lions lifted from another film. To make matters worse the fact that Lee performs from behind the aforementioned hood draws attention to his rich sonorous baritone. This would be okay if he didn't affect an unconvincing German accent he also tends to bellow his lines as if he were addressing someone an acre away.Despite this seeming diatribe I respect Mr. Lee and I'm glad he survives as the last of horror film's Old Guard. I grew up enjoying the fine work he did at Hammer and Amicus studios. I marvel at his personal and professional longevity and wish for him more of the same.

	schema:headline " Sweeping and romantic epic saga of the Russian Revolution";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful timeless epic romances of all time set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Stunning cinematography combines here with a turbulent historical setting an unforgettable idealistic hero and one of the most compelling fictional love triangles of all time. This surely ranks among the best of director David Lean's many masterpieces. It is based on Boris Pasternak's novel which I confess to not having read so cannot comment on the faithfulness of the film.The story revolves around the dreamy physician and poet Yuri Zhivago and his dramatic experiences during the tumult of the Russian Revolution. The story is told in flashback mode during later Communist years by Yuri's half brother Yevgraf a Soviet Army officer to the young woman Tanya who may be the long lost daughter of Yuri and his lover Lara. As a sensitive young boy Yuri's mother dies and he is adopted by a foster family the Gromekos. Later reaching adulthood he studies medicine and marries his childhood sweetheart Tonya and they have a little boy Sasha. However earlier at their engagement party he has found himself strangely drawn to a beautiful  mysterious woman named Lara. Soon all their personal lives are thrown into turmoil by World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution.The handsome Omar Sharif is brilliantly empathetic in the role of Zhivago masterfully conveying his character's emotions. Who can forget his intensely expressive tear filled eyes at some of the more emotional moments especially with snowflakes melting on them? A physician but also a poet Yuri has a deep appreciation of the beauty around him. His gentleness and idealism stand in sharp contrast to the horrific violence of war and revolution as Yuri witnesses such atrocities as dismemberment and cannibalism. Also this is a man who remains very much an individual despite the Bolshevik's philosophies of collectivism.That era's devastating events unfold including the Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent Civil War between the Tsarist Whites  the Communist Reds. However the main conflict here is internal within Yuri's own heart as he is torn between fidelity and passion. He deeply loves his sweet gentle and dependable wife Tonya and struggles to remain faithful. Yet he is tempted by a forbidden passion for the alluring Lara a nurse at the wartime army hospital where both are caring for wounded soldiers. Lara serves as his muse speaks to his soul and is the inspiration for his poetry. Unlike most modern cinematic tales of infidelity which involve little restraint or guilt Yuri and Lara desperately seek personal integrity as they are repeatedly brought together and separated by the upheaval of war and revolution. Surely if Yuri is 'the worst of sinners then he is the worst of sufferers also'. The two women in Yuri's life wife and mistress stand in sharp contrast though both come across as sympathetic characters. The lovely Geraldine Chaplain portrays his ladylike aristocratic wife Tonya who is well bred and has been schooled abroad. The daughter of the bourgeois Gromeko she is actually Yuri's step sister which might understandably tend to elicit more platonic than passionate feelings from her husband. Yuri and Lara succumb to their passions even as the blameless Tonya is pregnant with Yuri's second child. Tonya is a warm loving wife and devoted mother undeserving of her husband's infidelity. Julie Christie plays the gorgeous  enigmatic Lara a woman whose station in life makes her vulnerable to misuse by men yet she possesses a genuine resourcefulness and inner strength. As a teenage girl she is seduced and violated by the lecherous Victor Komarovsky a despicable politician and her own mother's lover. She falls under repeated abuse by this vile  contemptible character who calls Lara a slut and treats her as such. Later she is fianc  then wife to the misguided idealist and activist Pasha who holds intense political ideologies which become more crucial than his wife to him. Pasha later becomes Strelnikov the obsessive Bolshevik officer who eventually comes into confrontation with Zhivago. During much of the tumult Lara entrusts her own  Pasha's daughter Katya into the care of others. Of course the legend of Lara lives on musically in Maurice Jarre's lovely haunting Lara's Theme.Supporting cast members include Rod Steiger who is perfect as the villainous Komarovsky and Tom Courtenay as Pasha  Strelnikov a shy and pure individual who earns the abused Lara's respect and love later going on to become a cold hearted revolutionary. Alec Guiness portrays Yuri's half brother Yevgraf and Ralph Richardson is Tonya's aristocratic  gentlemanly father Alexander Gromeko.This film has amazing Oscar winning cinematography throughout. During World War I and the Revolution there are vivid scenes of battle mass desertion and endless march through the desolate blizzard ridden Siberian wasteland. Also visually stunning is the spectacular train ride Yuri and his family must make from Moscow to the Urals site of the family dachau. However surely most viewers' truly unforgettable pictures are the snowy white sleigh ride and the magnificent ice castle at Varykino. No other film can compare in its depiction of winter scenery. This sweeping panorama the era's tumultuous political events and the emotional portrait of one sensitive man's experience of them create a visual masterpiece and a truly immortal screen saga.".

	schema:reviewBody "You really do miss something when you see a formatted version of Doctor Zhivago as I recently did. This is the kind of film that was made literally for the big screen. It's what epic movie making is all about.I also think that you should see this on the big screen back to back with Warren Beatty's Reds. Two very opposite views of the Russian Revolution one from the inside and one from the outside. You could have a very interesting discussion on which is which.The title character played by Omar Sharif is Dr. Yuri Zhivago who is both doctor and poet. He was orphaned as a child and raised in the house of Ralph Richardson and Siobhan McKenna. He marries their daughter Geraldine Chaplin who of course he loves but naturally like a sister. The real passion of his life is Julie Christie who is married to a committed Bolshevik in Tom Courtenay. Courtenay is also a guy with shall we say some issues. She loves him in her own way though and goes to search for him when he volunteers for the army to subvert it as the Bolshevik plan was when Russia entered World War I. Christie meets Sharif at the front and the passion ignites. But all around them the society they knew and were brought up in is crumbling about them. Their story set against the background of the Russian Revolution is what Doctor Zhivago is all about.Zhivago knows change was inevitable the old order in Russia was ready to be toppled. But he's a poet and not one to let his art be subverted for the sake of the state. Fortunately he's also a doctor and his services are needed in fact the Bolsheviks rather brutally insist on his accompanying one of their brigades as a medical officer.I still remember as a lad the acclaim Boris Pasternak's novel got world wide when it was published while being banned in his home land. After winning the Nobel Prize for Literature Pasternak died shortly thereafter. It's a pity he did not live to see this film I think he would have approved.From the deserts of Arabia to the steppes of Russia David Lean certainly knew how to direct a film that involved vastness. Yet the people of his stories be it Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago never get lost in the spectacle. Lean makes you care about the characters that Pasternak created you get involved in the romance of Sharif and Christie you want to know if they'll make it in this country undergoing revolutionary convulsions.Other performances of note are Alec Guinness as Sharif's half brother Yevgeny Zhivago a committed Bolshevik himself and Rod Steiger as the opportunistic Komorovsky.Doctor Zhivago won a host of awards in several technical categories strangely enough it wasn't nominated for Best Picture in 1965 though. It is a classic and even now with the Soviet Union a memory I doubt if even a Russian made remake of Zhivago could equal what David Lean and his wonderful cast gave us in 1965.".

Two very opposite views of the Russian Revolution one from the inside and one from the outside. You could have a very interesting discussion on which is which.The title character played by Omar Sharif is Dr. Yuri Zhivago who is both doctor and poet. He was orphaned as a child and raised in the house of Ralph Richardson and Siobhan McKenna. He marries their daughter Geraldine Chaplin who of course he loves but naturally like a sister. The real passion of his life is Julie Christie who is married to a committed Bolshevik in Tom Courtenay. Courtenay is also a guy with shall we say some issues. She loves him in her own way though and goes to search for him when he volunteers for the army to subvert it as the Bolshevik plan was when Russia entered World War I. Christie meets Sharif at the front and the passion ignites. But all around them the society they knew and were brought up in is crumbling about them. Their story set against the background of the Russian Revolution is what Doctor Zhivago is all about.Zhivago knows change was inevitable the old order in Russia was ready to be toppled. But he's a poet and not one to let his art be subverted for the sake of the state. Fortunately he's also a doctor and his services are needed in fact the Bolsheviks rather brutally insist on his accompanying one of their brigades as a medical officer.I still remember as a lad the acclaim Boris Pasternak's novel got world wide when it was published while being banned in his home land. After winning the Nobel Prize for Literature Pasternak died shortly thereafter. It's a pity he did not live to see this film I think he would have approved.From the deserts of Arabia to the steppes of Russia David Lean certainly knew how to direct a film that involved vastness. Yet the people of his stories be it Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago never get lost in the spectacle. Lean makes you care about the characters that Pasternak created you get involved in the romance of Sharif and Christie you want to know if they'll make it in this country undergoing revolutionary convulsions.Other performances of note are Alec Guinness as Sharif's half brother Yevgeny Zhivago a committed Bolshevik himself and Rod Steiger as the opportunistic Komorovsky.Doctor Zhivago won a host of awards in several technical categories strangely enough it wasn't nominated for Best Picture in 1965 though. It is a classic and even now with the Soviet Union a memory I doubt if even a Russian made remake of Zhivago could equal what David Lean and his wonderful cast gave us in 1965.";

Who can believe now that there was a time when that was sufficient?I first saw this film when I was 8 years old.  Certainly I was not able at that time to understand all aspects and nuances of the story but I was nonetheless mesmerized by the production  the sheer scope and spectacle of it the absolutely glorious cinematography the rich characters.

For that alone I have a soft spot in my heart for this film and will always be grateful for it and David Lean.So I admit I'm prejudiced.  I'm unabashedly in love with this movie and find it hard to take criticism of it even when the rational part of me acknowledges that there might be some accuracy in it.  We all have our weaknesses!  Its especially blasphemous to me to hear anyone criticize Julie Christie as Lara  even as an 8 year old who wasn't too fond of girls I thought she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen and well she's still right up there on my list!  For those people who question why Yuri would be with her when he was married to Tanya...well look at her for God's sakes no disrespect to the lovely Geraldine Chaplin!  Is any further justification really needed?  As to the ingrate who slammed her performance and downgraded her subsequent career implying she had no talent it has always been my impression from all I've read that Miss Christie has never been one of those to pursue stardom and her career at all costs.  She certainly had many opportunities to do splashy commercial films but instead has had an interesting long  and varied career working in quality projects with many great filmmakers Truffaut Schlesinger Altman Beatty Lumet Branagh etc.  She has been true to herself and has proven to be an outstanding talent.  There are certainly many more deserving targets for the gentleman to heap venom upon than this wonderful actress.Doctor Zhivago was a reflection in the 60's of the 1930's Gone With the Wind and a precursor to the 1990's Titanic  a sweeping love story with charismatic leads set against a cataclysmic event.  Oldfashioned undeniably but would you really want it any other way?

	schema:reviewBody "Within the heart and mind of the true poet resides a grasp and perception of life and the human condition unequaled in it's purity by any other art form.  From Rimbaud to Frost to Jim Morrison he will in a few words or lines create or recreate an experience thereby enabling his audience to know that experience as well albeit vicariously.  The poet of course will choose the medium through which he will share his vision.  For director David Lean that medium is the cinema and with Doctor Zhivago' a film of sweeping and poetic grandeur he reveals that within he harbors the heart and soul of the poet.  Indisputably this is the true nature of David Lean and it is evident in every frame of this film from the beginning to end.To borrow a line from the more recent Moulin Rouge' this is a story bout love.'  A love story set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Dr. Yuri Zhivago Omar Sharif is a general practitioner but he is also a poet through his vocation as a man of medicine he tends to those in need in everyday real life.  But it is through his avocation as a poet that he expresses what he sees.  He marries Tonya Geraldine Chaplin and has children but the War and revolution intervene and it is during these tumultuous times that his life becomes inexorably intertwined with a government official Komarovsky Rod Steiger a young revolutionary Pasha Tom Courtenay his halfbrother Yevgraf Alec Guinness and finally Lara Julie Christie.  It's desperate times for Russians from all walks of life and Zhivago does what he can to do what he can to keep the fragile threads of his life and of those around him intact.  But fate plays a hand and in the end even Zhivago must go where Destiny leads.With Zhivago' David Lean has crafted and delivered a magnificent and monumental motion picture of epic proportions that at the same time is disarmingly intimate rendered as a world within a world with each a vital part of the other.  Lean blends actors cinematography story and music with his own compassionate perspective to create a true work of art a work of true poetry.  In telling his story he offers breathtaking visuals like the awesome vistas of the snowcovered Urals or a long shot of a wide open Russian plain with a solitary figure in the distance trudging through the snow juxtaposed against the enormity of the landscape. Often however what he doesn't show you but suggests is even more effective and emotionally stirring.  Consider the scene in which a complement of mounted dragoons sabres drawn ride down upon a crowd peacefully demonstrating in the city streets Lean sets it up so that you understand what is about to happen then trains his camera on Zhivago watching from a balcony overlooking the street as the carnage unfolds below. And in Zhivago's eyes in the expression on his face in his reaction to what he is witnessing there is more horror because of what Lean has established in your imagination and which significantly enhances the impact of it than anything the most graphic visual depiction could have produced.  Similarly when the Czar and his whole family are shot Lean does not take you there instead you learn of it and realize the impact of it through the reaction of Alexander Gromeko Ralph Richardson Tonya's father and it places it into a context that makes it all the more effective.  This is filmmaking at it's best and an example of what makes Lean's films so memorable.Put a talented actor into the hands of a gifted director and results of more than some distinction can be expected and such is the case with Omar Sharif and David Lean.  In 1962 Sharif received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work in Lean's Lawrence of Arabia' and in Zhivago' Lean's next film Sharif gives a sensitive affecting performance for which he should have received a Best Actor nomination but inexplicably did not It was Lee Marvin's year for Cat Ballou'.  Still as Yuri Zhivago he has never been better.  Sharif successfully manages to convey his deepest internalized emotions expressing them through the genuine compassion with which he imbues his character.  Lean allows his star the time he needs to share with his audience his appreciation of the beauty he perceives in the world around him and it's in those pensive moments that we in turn perceive the inner beauty and poetic nature of the man.  You have but to look into Zhivago's eyes to know his sense of joy in all living things. It's a wonderful collaboration between actor and director that so vividly and poignantly brings this character to life.1965 was a career year for Julie Christie she received the Oscar for Best Actress for her work in Darling' yet in this film created an even more enduring and memorable character in Lara aided in no small part by the hauntingly lovely Lara's Theme' by Maurice Jarre which indelibly etched ChristieLara in the consciousness of Zhivago's vast international audience.  Lara's beauty is obvious yet of a kind that goes much deeper than what you see on the surface her station in life has made her vulnerable to misuse but at the same time has endowed her with a strength born of necessity.  And Zhivago sees in her a quality and a resourcefulness that fulfills his romantic notions of perfection and with a beguiling screen presence and a performance to match Christie makes those notions credible and believable.  Guinness Richardson and Courtenay are exceptional in their respective roles Lean without question knows how to get the best out of his actors and also turning in noteworthy performances are Siobhan McKenna Anna Rita Tushingham The Girl and Klaus Kinski who is unforgettable as Kostoyed manacled and designated for forced labor yet the Freest man on this train!'  One of Lean's greatest films.  1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "No wonder the highest directorial achievement for direction of the British Academy of Film and Television is named after David Lean. An artist who knew how to combine great performances with breathtaking settings haunting soundtrack in order to create works of art that are to remain as pillars for the future generations of filmmakers.Doctor Zhivago is definitely one of his most outstanding works a film that breathes with life and suffers with passion. Neither though of the credited people can take as much credit for it as David Lean. Omar Sharif delivers one of his best performances of his career Julie Christie has never been as stunning or Rod Steiger as Komarovsky or Tom Courtenay as Antipov ever left more memorable performances than these ones. Not even Maurice Jarre who composed one of the most unforgettable themes in film history or Robert Bolt for his skillful adaptation on Pasternak's difficult novel not even Freddy Young's cinematography can rise above the vibration of genius which is David Lean. We almost feel the complexity of the universe collapsing on us with a mad power that we instantly become part of it and fall in love with all its particles.For those who haven't seen the film this might make little sense and it can give a misleading understanding of what one is to expect. Doctor Zhivago is a poet who at the beginning of the 20th Century is caught in the historical Bolshevik revolution. An outstanding doctor married to his childhood friend Tonya Geraldine Chaplin in a warm performance finds that there is beauty beyond deceit love beyond commitment by starting an affair with an enigmatic lady which appears often in his path in the most unnoticeable of moments.

	onyx:emotionText "No wonder the highest directorial achievement for direction of the British Academy of Film and Television is named after David Lean. An artist who knew how to combine great performances with breathtaking settings haunting soundtrack in order to create works of art that are to remain as pillars for the future generations of filmmakers.Doctor Zhivago is definitely one of his most outstanding works a film that breathes with life and suffers with passion. Neither though of the credited people can take as much credit for it as David Lean. Omar Sharif delivers one of his best performances of his career Julie Christie has never been as stunning or Rod Steiger as Komarovsky or Tom Courtenay as Antipov ever left more memorable performances than these ones. Not even Maurice Jarre who composed one of the most unforgettable themes in film history or Robert Bolt for his skillful adaptation on Pasternak's difficult novel not even Freddy Young's cinematography can rise above the vibration of genius which is David Lean. We almost feel the complexity of the universe collapsing on us with a mad power that we instantly become part of it and fall in love with all its particles.For those who haven't seen the film this might make little sense and it can give a misleading understanding of what one is to expect. Doctor Zhivago is a poet who at the beginning of the 20th Century is caught in the historical Bolshevik revolution. An outstanding doctor married to his childhood friend Tonya Geraldine Chaplin in a warm performance finds that there is beauty beyond deceit love beyond commitment by starting an affair with an enigmatic lady which appears often in his path in the most unnoticeable of moments. Their destiny is as confused as Russia in the turmoil started by the Reds it is shaped by history without their approval. There is no solution for a country that abandoned its passions in its desire of selfimprovement just as for the two lovers which find themselves abandoned in the middle of the Siberian taiga.This is a slow film and for the good reasons.

	schema:reviewBody "Doctor Zhivago is a fascinating touchstone of what made 1960s cinema uniquely great without ever being great itself. It is unique though.Yuri Zhivago Omar Sharif pursues a happy life as a physician and poet in Czarist Moscow until fate war and revolution drive him from home and family to a woman who turns out to be the love of his life Lara Julie Christie. But will those same forces contrive to tear them apart?Directed by David Lean in such grand style as to invite unfair comparisons to his previous masterpiece Lawrence Of Arabia Doctor Zhivago is about as sumptuous as filmmaking gets. Whether its the hooded mink on Geraldine Chaplin's Tonya as she gets off a train or the baroque velvet finery of a fancy restaurant where Lara finds herself courted by the consummate political insider Kamarovsky Rod Steiger one is continually bombarded with the fact no expense was spared bringing this vision of the Boris Pasternak novel to the screen.The story covers a lot of ground in more than three hours and though it does drag at times Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt nourish their production with much of the same visual and verbal eloquence that nourished Lawrence. Maurice Jarre's eerie score centered by the haunting Lara's Theme works at times like musical heroin jolting you back into the movie just as your attention starts to drift. Cinematographer Freddie Young uses windows and mirrors as a constant visual reference as if to underscore the movie's concern with the shallowness of appearances but at least through the first two hours what grabs you about Zhivago is its great sense of depth.But sense of depth doesn't exactly equal depth itself especially when you get to the final hour and the romance that is supposed to be the fulcrum of the film. Sharif on a DVD commentary suggests Zhivago is a woman's movie the way Lawrence is more for men. It's a sage thought as one notices the rational side is pushed aside along with Zhivago's wife and family in favor of an allornothing romance with Lara. Neither Bolt nor Christie do much to justify this gambit however and we are left with more images of windows for Sharif to stare out of looking poetic.As Sharif himself plays Zhivago as a gentle uncomplicated soul there is ample room for the supporting players to outshine the leads. Steiger sinks his teeth in the film's meatiest part a cagey brutal man whose passion for Lara is at least as interesting as that of Zhivago's his lips forming a cruel scowl but his eyes suggesting a secret hurt.Don't fool yourself into thinking this was rape he tells Lara after one brutal encounter. That would flatter us both. Ouch!Chaplin is also very good as the other woman in Zhivago's mess of a life winning your affection with her unguarded smile and uncomplicated love for Yuri which he is just good enough to know he doesn't deserve. Klaus Kinski pops up winningly at one point as a forced laborer sneering as only he can. There is great cast work by the smallest players.If you want a film that bears witness to the cruelty of the Communist Revolution and being caught up in social forces beyond one's control Doctor Zhivago is all that and more. As a romantic saga it feels hollow at its center and stretched out too far for all but the most patient of viewers. Yet what do I know? I'm just a guy.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Lean had just directed two of the greatest films ever made The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia the more recent of which was easily the greater.  As you'd expect Doctor Zhivago isn't as good.  But this isn't to say that it's flawed in any way there is in fact NOTHING wrong with it.Of course the previous two films had exceptionally strong stories this one while rich in incident has almost no story  which would not be interpreted as a defect.  The point of the film is to sketch a historical epoch by showing us the thin lifelines of a handful of people who lived through it.  It's like looking at a stretch of a vast river and seeing the illuminated pathways of half a dozen or so minute particles.  If there seems to be an undue amount of coincidence in the way these pathways repeatedly intersect ... well we had the whole river to choose from.It was fashionable to criticise Maurice Jarre's score at the time but in addition to being undeniably attractive and catchy it comes across as a model of intelligent and tasteful scoring today.  Bolt's script is based on less promising material than Lawrence of Arabia so is less inspired but still flawlessly crafted.  Particularly good are the gaps in the narrative. Some things we simply don't see anything of Yevgraf's life before he enters the story anything that happens to Pasha when he isn't in the vicinity of Zhivago ... but we have the material available to infer and as it happens it's the fact that we infer rather than see that makes the story feel so convincingly large.Most of all this is a beautiful film with some of the most breathtaking location footage it doesn't matter that it's Spain and Finland standing in for Russia ever shot.  As always the real test is whether the characters look like they're really there Moscow the distant Russian countryside their feet really touching the ground and leaving footprints.  If Doctor Zhivago had done nothing but convey this impression so well it would still be a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't remember the origin of the quote but I remember it distinctly.  A Communist Party official of the Soviet Union justifying the Bolshevik destruction of Tsarist Russia told a foreign observer If you want to make an omelet you've got to break some eggs.'  The visitor replied I see the broken eggs but Where's the omelet?'  Dr. Zhivago is set at the time when the Bolsheviks feverishly ideological were creating their socialist state. The epochal drama that unfolds is the ageold question about whether the ends justify the means.  As materialists matter precedes spirit not vice versa the Bolsheviks believed that they had found the holy grail of human progress in MarxismLeninism and were now able to assume the reins of history in their own hands.  They believed that their violence was not only justified but necessary oblivious to the fact that they too somehow felt the angel of medieval teleology smiling over their shoulders.  In contrast to the Bolsheviks Zhivago's ethos if he had one was almost identical to Kant's categorical imperative' which had just one axiom treat people as ends in themselves and not as ends to a mean.  There couldn't be a sharper moral contrast.  There's a fabulous scene midway through the movie that highlights the difference in moral attitude.  Dr. Zhivago confronts a communist functionary who has ordered the destruction of a village a hamlet suspected of aiding the Mensheviks by selling them horses.  To the Bolsheviks if you weren't 100 percent behind them you were a counterrevolutionary' sorta like Dubya's idea that you're either for us or against us.  And so Strelnikov the passionate Bolshevik glibly justifies his actions to Dr. Zhivago as easy as if he were tossing his hair aside saying that the annihilation of the village however cruel is necessary to make a point.  Zhivago replies Your point  their village.'  I love this film a timeless epic.  If there's a more beautiful heroine in all of moviemaking history than Julie Christie Lara I'm not aware of it. And Omar Sharif is stunning as Iuri Zhivago who heals the body with emetics scalpels antiseptic and gauze while he heals the soul with his poetry.  Although the movie is three hours and 20 minutes long the cinematography is so efficient evocative and densely layered that one hardly notices.  This is in my opinion one of the best films of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Lean's Doctor Zhivago is a fine and stirring epic which has stood the test of time. One baseless criticism which pops up again and again dwells on..... Julie Christie's sixties bangs!! To me they were cinematic shorthand for schoolgirl which her character was at the outset of the plot. For those hung up on hair the really noticeable sixties styles in this film can be seen elsewhere Early in the film as Zhivago is conferring with his professor at medical school we see a group of female medical students in the background with teased bouffants. Later at a Christmas party many of the female extras are adorned with the same anachronistic coiffure this is supposed to be 1912 Moscow!. As to bangs one can find for instance photos of the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova from around the same period with very obvious sixties bangs. Bangs have been around to one degree or another whether in vogue or not since there has been hair. Case closed.Another worthless criticism It's too slow too long. Phooey. Some movies have to be slow and long to tell a big detailed story.If one is going to criticize this film I suggest the following 1. Screenwriter Robert Bolt's kneading of the characters' lives into the progression of the Russian revolution is sometimes at odds with actual chronology so that anyone familiar with this period cringes from time to time. In one scene in order to identify for the viewer the historical point that has been reached a character blurts out I paraphrase but only very slightly Lenin is in Moscow! Civil war has started! Neither could have been true at that moment in the narrative. Bolt could have polished his distillation of the novel but who apart from direct participants can ever know why such gaffes occur in highpressure multimilliondollar productions? 2. This is yet another movie about a writer in this case a beloved but politically controversial poet not a word of whose poetry is revealed to the audience except for the title of one poem Lara after the woman he loves. Other major movies including Julia 1977 and Wonder Boys 2000 also commit this offense. Ironically one exception is the campy and rather dreary Isn't She Great 2000 about trash novelist Jacqueline Susann which actually explores the act of writing! 3. The physical reproduction of the era is uneven. Some moments are too clean. One example When Zhivago slides open the door of the ostensibly foulsmelling box car in which he and his family have been traveling for weeks packed alongside filthy probably liceridden passengers he looks too healthy scrubbed and well rested. This and other moments stand out because they occur in the context of innumerable convincing depictions such as mudfilled wartime trenches a looted and vandalized city mansion or a halffrozen refugee tramping stiffly over the ice of a frozen lake. 4. It is said that Russian viewers laugh at the oniondomed house where the lovers hide from the Bolsheviks. Russian churches have onion domes they say but not houses. Granted. But I'd like to think that the person who built this particular house was an eccentric and got away with the concept because the house was in an isolated rural area away from the prying eyes of the architecture police. In any case the emotional truths underlying the occasional inadequate or wrongheaded representations register powerfully. The grandscale perspective gives a sense of the tumult of the times vivid and memorable casting choices keep us fascinated with the characters and concentrated upon them you feel the terrible losses people suffered when history so rudely pulled the rug out from under them you are reminded of the pitiless cruelty of war and the depths to which people in its grip can descend and how despite the tragedies of our history we go on no matter what. David Lean had a great gift for injecting bold images at just the right moment. And he had the same gift for the perfectly timed sound effect often occurring at an edit point. At Zhivago's end one feels a tremendous sense of sadness and loss but hope for the future. Considering the international political climate of the time of its release it treats the Russian Revolution with enough detachment to illuminate both sides of the political divide. In other words it doesn't propagandize for either side.This was the first major Hollywood treatment of the Russian Revolution was still running in theatres around the world two and three years after its initial release despite dismissals from most of the major film critics of the time. Its popularity came from word of mouth i.e. from the public's genuine love of the story and its striking technically expert presentation. Interestingly Zhivago as a box office blockbuster was second only to The Sound of Music released the same year. Both films told the story of individuals faced with historically recent Old World political upheavals communismfascism. Furthermore the soundtrack album of each film took on a life of its own selling millions of copies. And why not also add that central to the success of each film was an English actress named Julie Christie as LaraAndrews as Maria. How many times have you heard of or personally known a woman under 40 with the previously uncommon name of Lara? Guess why that name became popular in the 60's and afterward?".

	schema:headline " So different from the book";
	schema:reviewBody "At age 15 I relished on the romance between Lara and Pavel Antipov. We were all a bit idealistic in the 60 's and me too. I loved the herodom of Pasja Pavel Antipov whilst I abhorred the character of Zhivago which I considered unmanly. In some commentaries a wrong image is cast on the romance between Lara and Zhivago vs a vs the romance between Lara and Pasja. After reading Pasternaks book recently I got to know that the writers intention was very different.

Later when Pasja commits suicide his motive is not the discovery of Lara and Zhivago's love but Pasja's fear to be executed on false accusations.

In some commentaries a wrong image is cast on the romance between Lara and Zhivago vs a vs the romance between Lara and Pasja.

I love the lengthy epics Like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben Hur so this was pretty much the only gap in this genre I had left.So now the gap is filled. I Love long films which you can get lost in and this although over 3hrs did not seem long. It seemed to grab me and accost me into the Russian Revolution along with the characters themselves. I think the film looked great and Curtis Steiger's performance was very accomplished. Omar Sharif excuse my spelling on the names was exactly what he needed to be.my issues with the film start with the complete lack of empathy I found I had for the characters. Terrible and monumental things happened to these people and I was following the events but the characters gave me nothing to make me emotionally invested in them. Yuri's throwaway family for instance we see no mourning for his separation from them he is only distraught that his wife met his lover not that he may never see her or his two kids again. I seemed to feel more for his situation than he did as he settled down with his surrogate family. We spend a lot of time with the good doctor and the ending does seem a little rushed  I needed to know why and how he managed to evade the persecution which forced him into hiding with Lara? After such a long and sprawling film  the ending seemed to attempt to wrap it all up at a jarred pace compared to the film I just saw.I could have watched another hour I wanted to know more about what Yuri did and not just have it hinted at by Alec Guiness' character in the bit tacked on at the end.I also would have liked to hear some of Yuri's poetry. Overall I am awed but disappointed. I'm sure this film has many followers in fact I know but I found the characters vulnerable but never really threatened and how his wife son and fatherinlaw characters who we've invested in exit the film was wholly inadequate.All in all I think many love this film because of either hype or they have had a long running affection for it what I mean to say is many film lovers probably came to this much earlier than myself and it was much more powerful than if seen with a more objective gaze. Some may love Lean and so do I but from a naughttosixty Doctor Zhivago experience I found it enthralling but flawed.".

Adequate acting by Omar Sharif  though David Lean's first choice for the title role was Peter O'Toole who declined citing the grueling experience of having made Lawrence of Arabia 1962  Sharif asked Lean to consider him for the role of Pavel Antipov and was surprised when Lean instead offered him the title role. However  Sharif claimed that he was close to breakdown throughout most of filming due to stress over playing such a highprofile role and David Lean's demands on him. Supporting cast is frankly excellent such as Alec Guinness as Yevgraf  Tom Courtenay as Pasha  Ralph Richardson as Alexander  Siobhan McKenna as Anna Klaus Kinski as Kostoyed  Grard Tichy as Liberius  Adrienne Corri as Amelia  Jack MacGowran as Petya . And Geraldine Chaplin's English language film debut  as David Lean discovered Geraldine Chaplin when he spotted her on the cover of a magazine and enjoyable Rita Tushingham who filmed her part in two weeks . The film was shot in Spain during the regime of Gen. Francisco Franco.

While the scene with the crowd chanting the Marxist theme was being filmed  police showed up at the set thinking that a real revolution was taking place and insisted on staying until the scene was finished. Apparently people who lived near where filming was taking place had awoken to the sound of revolutionary singing and had mistakenly believed that Franco had been overthrown. As the extras sang the revolutionary Internationale for a protest scene the secret police surveyed the crowd making many of the extras pretend that they didn't know the words. Breathtaking set design  Moscow set built in Canillas was half a mile long and the inside of the ice palace was mostly made up specifically formed wax.

I guess Boris Pasternak keeps up this tradition with his novel DOCTOR ZHIVAGO being a bit too top heavy with characters and incidents and it's this that has led to many critics putting the boot into the film on its initial release You could say that David Lean is the natural director for this kind of movie since he gives the word  Epic  a whole new meaning . Unfortunately he's not exactly the type of director who can make a tight script even tighter . The story contains a few too many characters and subplots  Though this is probably the fault of the studio and screenwriter Robert Block more than Lean's that leaves the audience wondering if it's a love story or a history lesson . It should also be pointed out that despite having some very memorable scenes like the frozen Russian bodies in a winter landscape  the train door covered in ice and the White Russian kids being machine gunned you still have to sit through a lot of talky scenes .However I'm going to be kind . DOCTOR ZHIVAGO works best when we're shown the birth of the Soviet Union  a wonderful ideal born out of the carnage from the Great War that ended up becoming in many ways even more terrible than Nazi Germany . Pasha starts by naively handing out seditious pamphlets speaking out against the Tsarist police state and ends up by becoming a communist despot  a good piece of character study showing that when people are given total power it will consume them totally . Oh and let's not forget the cast all of them are convincing but there's too many to mention by name so I'll just point out that Guiness is as superb as always and Stieger is absolutely breath taking  and it's shocking to think this great character actor went onto to star in straight to video films in the 1980s and 90s . Strangely the one performance I will always remember in this film is a cameo by Klaus Kinski as a prisoner on the train ! So a very good film but not a classic mainly down to the fact that has many memorable scenes surrounded by even more stodgy scenes . In other words you'll remember the great parts long after you've forgotten the boring bits which means you'll be slightly disappointed after seeing it again several years later".

	schema:headline " A Romantic Epic But One That Is Missing Out On Another Great Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Although I agree that this is a wonderful film if a bit overlong and is worth watching I feel that in his effort to make another epic and trying to match his incomparable Lawrence Of Arabia and The Bridge On The River Kwai  David Lean missed out on a more indepth and meaningful plot.The novel is more or less a love story that takes place during the Russian Revolution and the turmoil that this event inflicted on the human spirit. Boris Pasternak was basically calling things as he saw and experienced them since he witnessed this upheaval. While the movie is gorgeous and fascinating to look at and the music is superb adding to the haunting quality of the story and the characters the film fails to become a more intimate look at the people's lives and therefore is missing some of the crucial elements of the book. Not to demean the late Robert Bolt who was a very gifted screenwriter and he deserved the Oscar he received but he didn't or perhaps couldn't recreate the labor of love that Pasternak penned.It was wonderful to see Julie Christie and Tom Courtenay together again onscreen as they had such a smashing success with John Schlesinger's delicious Billy Liar 1963. However the love story of Lara and Pasha so sweetly detailed in the novel is relegated to pretty much a back story or a minor plot element perhaps to capitalize on Lara's destructive affair with Victor Komorovsky the late and wonderfully devious Rod Steiger and her upcoming facetoface encounter with Yuri Zhivago Omar Sharif. I saw the movie before I read the novel but even then I felt very sorry for the character of Pasha because we really were not given a lot of insight into him or what it was that turned him from such an adoring lover to Lara to the brutal Strelinkov and since his character dies offscreen I felt cheated out of a meaningful conclusion of that storyline. I was so touched by the book's information about their affection for one another and the way the book had Zhivago and Pasha meet and discuss the love of both their lives  Lara. The 2002 Masterpiece Theatre TV miniseries starring Hans Matheson Keira Knightley and Kris Marshall was much more faithful to the novel and presented something closer to the full story.Julie Christie is always lovely and magnetic and she obviously has an eye for great material. Her electric blue eyes and sensitive full lips often say more that the viewer has heard her say. Geraldine Chaplin as Zhivago's wife Tonya is sweet and gentle but you have to wonder why she was so endlessly understanding toward him even after he causes her so much heartbreak. The late Sir Alec Guinness is an interesting narrator to have for the story and he always worked well with Lean. Sir Ralph Richardson and Sioban McKenna come off well as Tonya's parents and Rita Tushingham excels in a small but pivotal role of the love child of Yuri and Lara. She was excellent in Tony Richardson's A Taste Of Honey and you have to wonder why she didn't have more of a career. Watch for the late Klaus Kinski in a brief but very effective portrayal of a man who becomes a prisoner of forced labor  his scenes on the train are riveting. Jack MacGowran has an interesting little part as well. Those 60s hairstyles do say something about the fashion then even in a period film. You have to love to hate the despicable Komorovsky who thought he was God's gift to women or something and in the miniseries Sam Neill is just as repulsively right in the role. Sharif's portrayal of Zhivago is impressive but doesn't it seem like he is always brooding or crying?It has its flaws but it is still romantic and I am still entranced with it especially for some strange reason during Christmas. It is one of the best made films of all time and it gives romantics a run for their money! Watch it but get out the Kleenex!".

	schema:reviewBody "Doctor Zhivago is a beautifully shot and told movie. The movie follows the main character for almost his entire life and a lot happens in that life! A bit too much perhaps for Doctor Zhivago is a long movie that is 3 hours long depending on which version you're watching. Best way to view this movie is in parts that's why I also have the feeling that the movie would had come better to its right if it had been made as a miniseries instead. Still Doctor Zhivago is a masterfully done classic that in some ways is also a quite revolutionary one from a movie technical point of view.The story is absolutely brilliant! I just love how in this movie lots of things and events are connected to each other. The story is truly what gives the movie an epic like feeling and is what makes this movie the classic that it is regarded as present day. Leave it up to director David Lean to tell and film a great story. Before this movie he already showed those skills with classic movies such as The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia which I regard as one of the best movies ever made.Visaully the movie is splendid. There are some good sets and beautiful landscapes that perfectly captures the mood and spirit of the time period the movie is set in. Further more the movie has some good makeup and costumes but the most brilliant thing about the look of the movie is the cinematography by Freddie Young and directorcinematographer Nicolas Roeg. Some of the cinematography is new and refreshing for its time and is truly an unique experience to look at.The movie is well casted. Omar Sharif is unforgettable as Yuri Zhivago and he plays the role of his life. Also unforgettable was Rod Steiger in the villainous role of Victor Komarovsky. Alec Guinness is also in this movie teaming up once more with the director David Lean.A lot happens in this movie and that's the reason why the movie feels longer than it even is. This is my only real complaint about this movie and is the reason that prevents me from rating this movie with a perfect 10 out of 10.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Highly overrated";
	schema:reviewBody "Imho this is the most overrated movie of all time. True the music is unforgettable and so are many scenes cavalry charges trains fairy tale ice palaces in themselves. Unfortunately this isn't enough to make a movie great. There are characters to be played psychologies to be developed tension to be sustained. In Zhivago all this is equally bad. There are movies good movies in which all the actors including the lesser ones outdo themselves. And there are movies bad movies in which even the good actors perform poorly. Zhivago is one of the latter. Alec Guiness and Rod Steiger are far below their usual level and Omar Sharif Julie Christie and Geraldine Chaplin are their usual selves i.e. very poor actors with the expressive powers of Roger Moore say. And literally everyone could play Pasha the way Tom Courtenay did. Julie Christie as an innocent seventeen year old schoolgirl is simply pathetic and her makeup is terrible! A love story against a background of war in which characters go through ordeal and are changed accordingly has made for some of the best literature in history. Not so in this movie. A seventeen year old beauty getting involved with her mother's cynical lover for instance is an interesting fact that a good movie maker could turn into a fascinating event. Here we are simply left with the superficial facts without anything explaining why all this happens in the first place and why things remain the way they are. And apart from her ironing nothing whatsoever explains why Zhivago falls for his nurse to the point of cheating his wife. In short as Zhivago and Lara bump into each other time and again coincidence being the main plot engine nothing whatsoever is explained. Neither passion nor love is made the least believable. Lara pregnant and well leaves Zhivago most resignedly behind and Zhivago's wife and child are kind enough to simply vanish from the plot. As for the story it is narrated in such a complicated manner that one simply looses track.There are also many technical flaws. Many scenes are set in an icy cold yet nowhere do breaths make vapour. And Pasha seems to have indestructible glasses surviving sabre cuts and shell explosions with equal ease.From the DVD extra's I learnt that critics were bad when the movie was released. I agree with them.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the mid1960s the giant epic had about run its course and Dr. Zhivago was one of the last true Hollywood epics that dominated the cinema in the 1950s and 1960s. Dr. Zhivago is a very large film that shows the triumphs and tragedies of its titled character Omar Sharif in easily his greatest role. The doctorpoet seems trapped in the awful Bolshevik Revolution of the 1910s and early1920s in his native Russia. While having no real political views of his own he just cannot escape a life of war and violence. We see him as a young boy and to his early adulthood when he marries who he feels is the love of his life Geraldine Chaplin but of course he falls later on for his one true love a very young Julie Christie. Naturally there is conflict though as Christie is little more than a slave to the cold Rod Steiger and keep in mind that the shady Tom Courtenay Oscarnominated is always around trying to create benefits for himself. Zhivago's halfbrother Alec Guinness tells the long and sad story through voiceovers and flashbacks. The film is very very long and it is not always a crisp running time. Sometimes spectacle gets in the way of the story and the actors and many times everyone just seems overwhelmed by the complicated screenplay and David Lean's opulent direction. Sharif and Christie are excellent but the lesser the part the more the others struggle through. Rod Steiger and Tom Courtenay seem to get in the way more than anything else and Alec Guinness has little more than a cameo appearance his character could have been explored much further. All in all the film is impressive but it cannot quite reach excellence due to several small holes in large areas. It is nonetheless a memorable cinematic experience. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "I expected some pretty great things from the film Doctor Zhivago not only is it on the American Film Institute Top 100 Films of all time but it has a pretty solid reputation as a good film.  Unfortunately I have to vehemently disagree with this opinion.Doctor Zhivago is set during the Russian Revolution a time when Socialism was rising and personal freedoms were diminishing.  This alone would be a fairly interesting topic if it was done well but this was a sweeping epic of a love story instead.  Zhivago Omar Sharif takes a wife Tonya Geraldine Chaplin and they have a child.  During these formative years of their marriage however Zhivago meets Lara Julie Christie who enchants him.  After resisting the attraction' for a while they meet up a couple of years later when Tonya is pregnant again and pretty much fall into bed within five minutes of reuniting.  Their affair is so obvious that when Tonya is looking for Zhivago at one point the members of the village where Lara lives all point her to his mistress' house.  Charming yes.I could have merely disliked the film because of the horrid romanticism' if the rest of the film had any merit but everything else is just as bad.  I have now seen three David Lean films and have really enjoyed two of them Bridge on the River Kwai' and Lawrence of Arabia'.  For this reason I was just stunned at how horrible this film is.  The scene changes in Zhivago' are positively laughable  many scenes are about thirty seconds long and end abruptly prompting me to internally and eventually externally when it became apparent that we were all exasperated with this film say That was a great scene' in the most dry manner possible.  It got to the point where we were expecting someone to walk in the door and say Hello' and promptly have a quick fade out.  There are too many things to support the ridiculousness of this film but one more notable moment was a scene in which Sir Alec Guinness who was sporadically narrating the film was talking about a moment when he was speaking to one of the characters.  He was narrating the scene and we are watching the action on the screen with the narrator in the scene.  It ended up looking absolutely absurd and seriously laughinducing.  Why Lean couldn't have just oh say done the scene without narration?  I will never know because there is no way after writing this review I even want to mention this film ever again so I am certainly not going to read about it.  I've passed the stage of morbid curiosity and have gone right to the denial stage.  I want to deny this terrible movie ever passed over my retinas.  I even indignantly confronted some family members at a recent family gathering who actually really liked this film and demanded they tell me why this is a good film and the first thing every one of them said was that it was romantic'.  Unfortunately I was almost thrown out on my ear when I said Romantic? Romantic?!  It's SLEAZY!!!'  Before anyone accuses me of fanatical piety let me remind any gentle readers that my favorite film of 2003 was Kill Bill Vol. 1 and I laughed until I cried at the bangup' ending of Intolerable Cruelty' so the moral police I certainly am not.  Dr. Zhivago was just ridiculously bad melodrama disguised as an epic because of its dramatic backdrop.  I expected a lot and received worse than nothing a loathsome story and really bad filmmaking.Shelly".

I was prepared to be enthralled by a work of high art with a meaningful message and I happily settled into my couch to watch. Three hours later I realized I'd just wasted three hours of my life. Zhivago is not epic nor is it high art nor does it deliver a message other than Man it's frickin' cold in RussiaWhy?1. Onedimensional wooden acting with all the depth of a remedial high school drama class. I expected better from Lean. He did not deliver. The only actor in the movie to even be nominated for an Oscar that year was Tom Courtenay likely for the wonderfully impressive wax scar he sports.2. Waaaaay too many deweyeyed close ups of Omar Sharif's cocker spaniel eyes. Oh wait! Sharif does manage to show a level of depth by employing two disarmingly complex Method Acting modes thoughtearyeyed AND moisteyed. Oh the drama. It would be interesting to count how many shots there are of Sharif looking off into the distance while tearing up. This could be a great drinking game if you took a shot every time Lean inflicted this poor excuse of character development upon the viewer as you'd be quite intoxicated by the end of the movie.3. A stunningly repetitive musical score that is jammed down the viewer's throat at every opportunityand I mean every opportunity whether it fits the scene or not. Many times the music simply did not fit the action yet it was forcibly played in order to remind us of something. Something....what? Oh yeah that you're watching this terrible movie. 4. Too many storyline coincidences requiring too much suspension of disbelief. 5. The use of mirror shotsat firstwas welldone. But then Lean went on and on using mirrors to show character's faces that it grew weird and tedious. Had his DP just graduated film school?6. The sound design was not welldone. I had a very hard time hearing dialog and eventually resorted to subtitles.Watch Reds if you want a great movie about the Russian Revolution. Dr. Zhivago was a great disappointment. I want my three hours back.".

An Israeli Muslim Arab finds himself in the middle of a families feud that turns into violence murder and revenge. An illegal Palestinian worker badly needs money to help his ailing mother.

One of the policemen lives his own tragedy his brother soldier brother disappears and is found later in Palestinian territory probably kidnapped and murdered by terrorists. All these disparate threads come nicely together towards the end and the intelligent script writing is the best part of the film.It is not a pleasant film to see and not designed to be so. The story is told from the perspective of the different characters it requires attention to follow and even if it has logic and all pieces of the puzzle eventually fit well the different angles and the jumps in time make the film difficult or at least demanding to see. Actors are directed towards a very natural way of acting improvisation and living the character seems to be the rule rather than careful rehearsal of the role  this gives a feeling of natural and chaos of life but it asks the viewer rather than the director to fill in with meaning what happens on screen. Last the colors and landscape is in many cases desolate and soulless dirty and brutal as the world the characters live in.This realistic piece of cinema succeeds to be both direct in its mode of expression and sophisticated in its storytelling. The average Israeli viewer is impacted by the image of a part of the country and social life that is close and far at the same time. The final offscreen words belong to one of the characters a child of the neighborhood who draws the comics representation of the story all along the film to become part of the drama in the final. 'Do not close your eyes'  this message may be part of the whole society as Ajami is part of the same world we all live in.".

The consensus was unanimous an excellently executed film showing the rawness and tensions simmering within Israel's Arab  Jewish populations.In his prescreening presentation the director correctly focused on one of the core reasons why Jews  Arabs continue to be suspicious of the other...in many ways it is down to the Jews not speaking Arabic and only a few of the Arabs speaking Hebrew. It is amazing that the Israeli government has yet to address this issue.This is definitely a film which needs to be seen twice in order to comprehend all the various nuances.

	onyx:emotionText "I attended a 'full house' screening at the Tricycle Cinema in London having invited a party of 6 people of different ages and backgrounds. The consensus was unanimous an excellently executed film showing the rawness and tensions simmering within Israel's Arab  Jewish populations.In his prescreening presentation the director correctly focused on one of the core reasons why Jews  Arabs continue to be suspicious of the other...in many ways it is down to the Jews not speaking Arabic and only a few of the Arabs speaking Hebrew. It is amazing that the Israeli government has yet to address this issue.This is definitely a film which needs to be seen twice in order to comprehend all the various nuances. Two scenes stood out for me...the Judgement scene at the Beduin elder...and Dando's family grieving.Well done!";

As they see the individual characters unwind the Arab store owner the Israeli cop things begin to get more complicated.The primary power of Ajami is in its mode of storytelling which correlates to the content itself. There are several chapters each telling a different story. What is most intriguing is how these stories fit. A character will appear two chapters later only for his intentions to be revealed then. A certain act of violence a consequence of violence etc. are not contextualized but only taken in the moment. The viewer may be tempted to judge or hold preconceived notions about the characters until the filmmakers often with great effect reveal the true intentions of these individuals.This can be applied to the whole of the IsraelPalestine situation. Each violence has its lasting impact on individuals and groups alike. In Ajami a murder is not only between the victim and the perpetrator. Likewise reading in the news about a killing can only tell a fraction of the truth. The filmmakers wisely adopted a very documentary like feel to this film similar to The Class and Gomorra. Characters names are only mentioned realistically. There is a sense of confusion as to who is whom for some of the sequences. At times it is frustrating because a Western audience may be more tempted to discuss the actual identity of a character than understand the point of the movie as a whole. Another issue is that this documentary video approach to filmmaking can sometimes feel problematic or trite. By the time the third and fourth chapters are reached there are several emotional climaxes. But these are immediately followed by more revealing. It works in most cases prompting me to give Ajami a very high mark.It is a film worth seeing for anyone interested or disinterested in the region. A highly potent character study that proves perhaps unintentionally the power of a filmmaker to show or to not show intentions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Old Jaffa bordered by the Mediterranean on the east and surrounded on the other three sides by Tel Aviv is still predominantly Arab and Ajami is one of its neighborhoods. This film which tells its several stories episodically and without drawing any explicit lessons conveys the hazards attending life in a place where Israeli Arabs and Palestinian Arabs both Muslim and Christian Bedouin and other criminal gangs rub up against one another under the sometimes watchful eye of Israeli police. Without summarizing the story to the point of revealing the plot it is about violence and the threat of violence about familial ties and codes about vengeance and deals to appease the avengers. It is very well acted and the subtitles make clear what is being said either in Arabic or Hebrew and occasionally both at once. The film makers have not had much experience. That makes it all the more remarkable that they have succeeded so admirably in telling overlapping stories from different vantage points and sometimes out of sequence without confusing the viewer. It is harsh but powerful film and well worth the two hours required to watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ajami is a first film by the team of Scandar Copti an Israeli Arab with a Christian family name and Yaron Shani an Israeli Jew. It gained recognition at Cannes and in Israel and is nominated for the Best Foreign Oscar. Using locally recruited nonactors shooting in the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa which has become a mostly Arab ghetto outpost of Tel Aviv 'Ajami' is full of improvisation and handheld camera work that give it an intense feeling of immediacy  and seethes with action disturbing enough to leave you feeling bruised. Israeli cinema is remarkable for a tiny country it's a pity more Arabs outside Israel can't see this film. Despite the myriad hostilities and misunderstandings 'Ajami' depicts  between Palestinians from the territories and Israeli Arabs Arab Christians and Arab Muslims Israelis and Arabs rich and poor old and young  there is hope in the fact that an Arab and a Jew could team up for such passionate filmmaking.'Ajami' interweaves multiple storylines with a documentary feel using a large cast and to make matters more complicated but also underline interconnections it's divided into chapters that are not quite in chronological order so some events are seen again from a different angle the second time. Most of the scenes are in Arabic but some are in Hebrew or a mixture of Hebrew and Arabic. All the location intertitles and the end credits are rigorously both Hebrew and Arabic  a practice not uncommon in Israeli cinema but especially resonant here.The action begins with a driveby shooting  of the wrong person. A young boy Nasri Fouad Habash who narrates the film his soft voice giving it a kind of clarity and delicacy is present when his cousin is shot while working on a car in the street. The hit man meant to get Nasri's brother Omar Shahir Kabaha as revenge for Nasri's uncle's killing of an extortionist. Omar is now clearly in mortal danger.The neighborhood leader and restaurant owner Abu Elias Youssef Sahwani arranges a dealbrokering among village elders at a bedouin camp where men bid back and forth as to how much protection or payoff money is required for Omar to stay alive. Omar can't possibly raise the sum finally arrived upon but he's indentured at Abu Elias' restaurant and there Omar turns out to be in love with his boss' daughter Hadir Ranin Karim a serious nono since her family is Christian and Omar's is Muslim. Next there arrives a brighteyed and innocent teenager Malek Ibrahim Frege who sneaks in from the occupied territories and is an illegal worker in the restaurant an Arab exploited by an Arab the harsh Abu Elias. Malek also has an impossible financial burden needing to raise many thousands to pay for a bone marrow transplant for his seriously ill mother.Eventually both Omar and Malek are drawn into trying to deal dope to raise money against the strong objections of Nasri and totally against the wishes of Abu Elias who wishes to appear to function within the law even if he doesn't.Meanwhile there are the Israeli and nearIsraeli parts of the story. Dishonest Israeli cop Dando Eran Naim appears both as a bastard when persecuting the boys who're clumsily attempting to sell cocaine and a softy when it comes to the disappearance of his younger brother from the army perhaps captured by Palestinians an event that devastates his family these are the allHebrew scenes. The Arab codirector Copti himself plays Binj a Palestinian who speaks fluent Hebrew and has a nonArabic speaking Jewish girlfriend. He is pressured by his Arab friends for this and his life turns tragic when he holds drugs for the others after his brother has stabbed a Jewish neighbor in an argument over noisy animals and the cops manhandle him with Dando on hand in his badcop role. This sequence about Binj seems to dramatize the futility of crossover dreams in this harsh world. The problems faced by Arabs living in a Hebrewspeaking Israeli environment has also been dealt with in the hit Israeli sitcom Arab Work. It doesn't necessarily seem as though Dando is more dangerous in a sense for the young Palestinians than the brutish Abu Elias who threatens to break Omar's bones if he continues his courtship of Hadir. Partly it is the elders who appear as the villains more threatening here than Israeli checkpoint guards.One has to grapple with all these plot elements to follow 'Ajami.' The intersections get complicated and the film is a bit underedited at two full hours but there is a wealth of cultural material that gets across along with the insistent problems and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness for young Arabs. There is great warmth among friends and family members of all stripes. But even fun moments seem framed in scariness like a birthday celebration for Malek which he's sent to by threatening him that the government  i.e. police is after him. Even the birthday present they give Malek an electrified tennis racket has an edge of menace. 'Ajami' doesn't stop for a breath or a moment of happiness it succeeds in convincing you that isn't possible.Further proof of that impossibility came early this month February 2010 and life imitated art when Scandar Copti's brother Tony a supporting actor in the film was arrested after Israeli police accused some Ajami teenagers of hiding drugs who said they were only burying a dog. This led to a brawl in which Tony Copti and another brother were arrested and hauled off to the police station for questioning according to a 'Haaretz' article.".

The film is pretty depressing and violentand I'd never recommend it to anyone who is depressed or who doesn't want to see a film like this. It's gritty tough and not something for all tastes. However it was recognized by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts  Sciences i.e the Oscar folks and was nominated for Best Foreign Language movie.This film is very unusual because it is seen from several different viewpoints. I never would have imagined an Israeli film where the main characters are divided up into chapters and each one stars such different peoplesuch as Palestinian Muslims Palestinian Christians as well as Jews. This is the best thing about the filmit humanizes everyone and shows motivation of everyone. None of them are evil exactlyjust people for good or for bad. As far as the story goes here's where it gets depressing. Different folks NEED money and need it fastsuch as the young man who must gather an astronomical sum to keep a violent gang from wiping out his family and another who needs to pay for his mother's lifesaving surgery. What these folks do to try to get the money as well as the sad story of the dead Jewish young man all make for a compelling but incredibly depressing story. Death abounds and life is cheap in this film. Overall it IS well made and the acting is quite nice. But I just found myself feeling awful by the time is was finished. Maybe you'll get more out of it than me...I dunno.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the count of three you'll open your eyes and find yourself in a different place one two three. Open your eyes. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film at the 2010 Academy Awards the outstanding Israeli film Ajami makes clear the human cost of decades of political and military strife between Jews and Arabs in the neighborhood of Ajami in Jaffa Israel. Here there is a seemingly impassible divide between Jews Christian and Muslims whose daily life offers no escape from the realities of poverty violence and oppression. In Ajami there are no heroes and no villains. Each religious and ethnic community is trapped in the same tunnel searching for a speck of light.Shot on location using mostly nonprofessional actors including neighborhood recruits directors Yaron Shani an Israeli Scandor Copti a Palestinian in their first feature capture the look and feel of a community in disarray with such remarkable detail and raw urgency that Ajami could easily be mistaken for a documentary. In Shani's words It was essential that we delivered reality as it is without exaggeration in its complexity. We had to capture the real language the real people the real mentality the way people are. The film is divided into five chapters each one shot from a specific perspective and each adding an extra layer of tension. As the film opens 13yearold Nasri Fouad Habash is prescient when he says I know I can feel what is about to happen. Shortly thereafter a driveby shooting kills an innocent fifteen year old boy when he is mistaken for Nasri's older brother Omar Shahir Kabaha. The shooting is in retaliation for the death of a member of their clan who was killed by Nasri's uncle. Though a truce is reached with the Bedouins aided by Abu Elias Youssef Sahwani a Christian community leader Omar must pay them 57000 to stop the fighting. In dire straits and desperate for money Omar falls into the underworld of drugs and violence.Meanwhile Malek Ibrahim Frege a sweetfaced 16yearold Palestinian boy living in the Occupied Territories comes to Jaffa to find work at the restaurant of Abu Elias. Fearful of being sent home because of his illegal status he works hard to try and pay for a bone marrow transplant that may save his mother's life but his need for money brings him into Omar's circle. In another subplot Hadir's Ranin Karim relationship with Omar crosses religious lines she is a Christian and he is a Muslim and is adamantly opposed by her father Abu Elias who forbids her to ever see Omar again even though she pleads how much she loves him.Events in the film come thick and fast Bing a wealthy Palestinian Scandar Copti wants to live with his Jewish girlfriend in Tel Aviv but a police raid looking for drugs puts an end to his plans an angry Israeli policeman named Dando Eran Naim searches for his missing brother who was drafted into the Army and is feared to have been killed by the Arabs a Jewish man is stabbed to death after complaining about the noise from sheep kept by Palestinians living nearby. According to Shani what unfolded although broadly scripted was spontaneous in its details  the hostility and the anger were real.Ajami does not offer any easy explanations nor any solutions to the neighborhood's unrest. It does however illuminate a problem that many would rather forget. The characters like the hijacker Sandro in the Brazilian film Bus 174 are driven by circumstances to do terrible things out of rage and futility. Neither Bus 174 nor Ajami justifies their actions however but makes them more comprehensible. Though the film is grim and strips away idealism it has a universal quality that begins and ends with the lovely song Eshkenakum by Maher Halabi music that could be appreciated by any culture. Ajami leaves the viewer with little to be hopeful about but the fact that a Jew and an Arab could collaborate on an intelligent and passionate motion picture based in part on their own experiences is an important step forward.Change however will not come easily to Israel. As one of the directors has said It's very very hard to change things  especially from an ideological point of view. Butonce you deliver different messages and things that surprise people and show them things in a different way and try to open their minds to things that they didn't think about or they never heard about before you can make a difference in their perspective. Shani may be telling us that when you are totally convinced that nothing is possible it is but a short step to everything is possible.".

But the ripples of that act of retribution affect the lives of many within the community including the innocent. Ajami has been written and directed by Yaron Shani whose previous film was the short Disphoria and first time director Palestinian Scandar Copti. The pair has used nonprofessional actors which lends a raw and natural feel to the performances. The film's central character is Omar Shahir Kabaha is a young Israeli of Arab descent who crosses some gangsters and has to broker a deal to save his family. Part of that deal involves dealing drugs which leads him into even more troubled waters.The film's creators suggest that there is no easy solution to the tensions and cultural divide of this area but still the film holds out hope for the future.".

In fact not only is this film not primarily about Arabs and Israelis it actually deals with conflict within the Israeli Arab world between Muslims and Christians.Written directed and edited by Scandar Copti Ajami is a twohour Crashlike drama which looks at several violent incidents some linked more than others and then focuses on one in particular from different perspectives told through the use of flashbacks. The movie takes awhile to get going but once the viewer catches on to the device it becomes more compelling. The young people featured in the recurring storyline are quite endearing and easy to empathize with. This could be a comingofage story set anywhere in the world.".

Ajami is an emotional roller coaster for certain from the very first scene it's bound to startle. It's a deeply charged film that speaks so much about life and death living amongst all the suffering all with so much prayer and religious belief intertwined no this film does not pound the viewer with religion ... which helps confound the viewer by asking where the heart of the problem is in that region in the first place?A great piece of filmmaking compels the viewer to dig deeper and find back stories and trivia. Ajami is such a film because I put my trust in the protagonists to believe their characters. They did not lose my belief from some unbelievable twist in plot or outcome. If you can handle the emotionally tragic story please seek out Ajami. If you're not sure strengthen your inner soul some day to watch this film. Absolutely top notch even with the difficult plot jumping that sometimes happens. If you feel puzzled the film will not let you down  you'll learn all you need in time to drop your jaw clear to the couch by the time the credits roll. Ajami is Amazing.".

The story is told in a clever 'Pulp Fiction'style with the same events seen from different perspectives as they feature in a variety of wider narratives. Unlike Tarantino's film however there's no selfknowingness here nor is this movie in any sense a comedy. It's nicely put together although at the start I found it hard to like any of the characters. Male ego seems to animate many of the conflicts which lessens one's sympathy for the protagonists on all sides of the religious divide who seem all equally unlikeable in spite of their misfortunes. But towards the end a little more of the underlying tragedy begins to show itself. It's an intelligent film and gripping to watch but don't expect too many easy answers to the questions it poses.".

These include Omar a Muslim Arab whose family are in danger after his uncle shot a Bedouin criminal Abu Elias a Christian Arab and pillar of the community Malek a Palestinian who is in Israel illegally to earn money to pay for his mother's hospital treatment and Dando an Israeli police officer whose brother has disappeared. As the film progresses we dip in and out of their lives frequently seeing the same events from a different perspective. These events are occasionally violent but this is not graphic just tragic.The characters speak a mixture of Arabic and Hebrew but as I had to rely on subtitles and aren't familiar with the languages I couldn't tell which languages was been spoken at any given time. The cast did a fine job it left like I was observing real people rather than watching actors performing. Writerdirectors Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani did a good job getting the most from this cast and expertly used real locations. The film isn't without its flaws though at two hours it seemed a little bit too long and the sound level was often too low... often I could barely hear that people were talking and only realised because subtitles were on the screen one might think this wouldn't matter but without hearing their voices properly it was hard to feel any of the emotion of what they were saying. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if it is on television and you want to watch something a little different.".

I've always been a Geoffrey Rush fan but in this movie I've seen a very special Rush who by the way his on screen persona goes thru a life changing metamorphosis creates a real daytoday living among us man with real life personal fears heartbreaking disillusions and self rediscovering. He makes us care for the very rigid and robotic Virgil Oldman in a way that surprises the senses. He is in the beginning a character who most people would find repelling by his uncomfortable attitude and bossy ways. But as the movie proceeds he is changed by this peculiar and frightful young woman who has a way of bringing him up and crushing him down within minutes in their dialog. I must say that director Tornatore wrote this amazingly beautiful story with a golden pencil I'm sure. This is not another love story. It's a life story set in the world of Arts where there's more to discover behind the colors of paintings and the still faces of sculptures than meets the eye. As the movie comes to an end you will face a difficult task to be thankful that such a story made it to the big screen or to desire that it would've remain only in the writer's mind and heart. I give it a full 10 with no regrets. Awaiting more from TornatoreRush team! They get along pretty well I see.".

It's refreshing to see a film with a unique universe grounded in the culture of our own with some bizarrely specific themes. While my only complaint is that the dialogue has this very written quality about it that is near impossible to deliver in a natural way it's at least consistent throughout.The story is constantly intriguing held together by a Hitchcockian mystery feeling and always pays off in a unique way. I'm not one for old man and young girl romance stories as they're rarely without uncomfortable perversion but The Best Offer completely justifies it with its well developed characters and themes. However what makes this film so special and strange is the dramatic turn in the third act. Heartbreaking not only for the characters but for the audience that the film changes so drastically. But this is what made the film stick with me so much. It's wonderful to have a film that you toss and turn in your head trying to figure out what it's all about.

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting and enthralling picture with stirring drama  ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . An epic story of a man who could do anything  except be ordinary . A story centered on an eccentric auctioneer  a great art lover  and his obsession with a heiresscollector . As the successful auctioneer called Virgil Oldman Geoffrey Rush becomes deeply passionate about a mysterious woman called Claire Sylvia Hoakes who suffers agoraphobia . Meantime  the fine art expert Virgil along with his younger friend  Robert Jim Sturgess  attempt to remake an ancient automaton .Colorful and moving film dealing with a solitary man who punches drunk love with a strange girl who resides at an Italian villa only attended by a handy man . The flick relies heavily on the complex relationship between an older man and a younger woman  but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . This captivating picture contains drama  intrigue  plot twists and nostalgia completely wrapped in an enjoyable love story between a lone winner and a locked girl . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility  the intelligent screenplay was written by Giuseppe Tornatore himself . Slightly underrated but excellent all the same time  the picture is both  enjoyable and entertaining  but overlong . Magnificent performance from Geoffrey Rush as virtuoso auctioneer who has never set his heart on real love  Jim Sturgess as his best friend and Sylvia Hoakes as the gorgeous as well as rare girl . Good acting from remaining cast  just like  Donald Sutherland  Dermot Crowley and Philip Jackson . Glowing cinematography in colorful scenarios and splendidly photographed by Flavio Zamarion who reflects marvelously the elegant restaurants  apartments  paintings  auction hall and many other things . Rousing and moving score musical by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone who achieved a deserved David Di Donatello .The picture was very well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and won six David Di Donatello awards  including Best Film and Best Director . Tornatore made other similarly attractive films  including good actors  such as  the excellent Cinema Paradise with Philippe Noiret  Malena with Monica Belucci   The star maker with Sergio Castellito  Legend of 1900 or The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean with Tim Roth  and Baaria with Raoul Bova  being his Englishlanguage debut feature titled The professor with Ben Gazzara . The best offer rating  Better than average  well worth watching for exceptional cinematography  firstrate acting and wonderful score .".

The sceneries full of sculptures paintings and other sorts of art works combined with the view of Italy are mesmerizing. Sylvia Hoeks is just so breathtakingly beautiful. The scene where she submerged herself under the bathtub water was just so picturesquely capture that it itself constructed a french portrait of a girl. The story is just too good to be true the atmosphere was built up to climax so perfectly that you can sense the doom is imminent. It left me wonder isn't it too harsh in the end?

	schema:reviewBody "Set in Italy but filmed in English The Best Offer is a highly unusual and unusually interesting tale of two lost and hurting souls reaching out to one another for meaning and salvation. Or at least that's what it wants you to THINK it's about. What it's ACTUALLY about may be something else again.A selfdescribed old man incapable of love the allegorically named Virgil Oldman Geoffrey Rush has kept pretty much the entire world  women included  at arm'slength for his entire life. He's a renowned if not entirely scrupulous art appraiser and auctioneer who has his entire mode of existence turned upside down when he meets a mysterious young woman named Claire Silvia Hoeks who pleads with him to come appraise the belongings in her home upon the death of her wealthy parents. The problem is that Claire who has been a recluse since the age of 16 seems to be suffering from a severe case of Agoraphobia and will speak with Virgil only through a wall in the house. Dismissive even irritated at first Virgil soon becomes obsessed with the faceless disembodied voice that floats to him through the dusky halls of a lonely villa.Virgil is so emotionally cut off from the world around him that despite the fact that he is physically able to come and go he is just as much a prisoner of his life as Claire is of her disease and of the decaying mansion in which she's chosen to entomb herself. Is Claire the unexpected someone who will finally provide that meaningful human connection that Virgil has avoided all this time? Or is she merely the vehicle through which he will finally be made to pay for the many professional transgressions he's committed over the course of his lifetime? Rush carries almost the entire weight of this film on his shoulders and he certainly shows he has the acting chops to see it through. Since Hoeks is largely offscreen for large portions of the movie her task is a somewhat less arduous one though her accomplishment is no less impressive for that. Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland are also effective in smaller yet highly significant roles in the drama.With a smart screenplay and lyrical direction by Giuseppe Tornatore The Best Offer is a haunting mesmerizing film that draws you into its world and keeps you guessing every step of the way till the big reveal at the end.".

	schema:headline " Very dense but mesmerising thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Geoffrey Rush's layered dominant performance is the thematic and emotional crux of this very dense but mesmerising thriller. In one of his best performances he plays his character Virgil Oldman with theatrical notes making the auctioneer an impatient and callous man who is suffering from rhypophobia. His antisocial behaviour and general disregard of other people signposts this as being a story about a man who learns to reconnect with people and to become a better person. Throughout the film Virgil does attempt to reconnect with the world by aiding an unseen woman named Claire Sylvia Hoeks who communicates with him through a wall as he helps her value the property of family belongings. This is a mere starting point as the rabbit hole of the narrative is far deeper.There is a distinct European temperament to the material courtesy of Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore Cinema Paradiso whose deliberate pacing of the story provides the narrative with time and spatiality to enhance the themes and characters. The central relationship between Virgil and the mysterious Claire has a fascinating basis not because of what it provides Virgil but how it challenges him. Who is this woman and why is she hiding? The suspense is Hitchcock in tone because we're intrigued by what we're not seeing off camera as much as Virgil's delicate actions. This mystery is trumped by story beats that dissolve into intense peaks of voyeurism enhanced by a Roman Polanski inspired feel for claustrophobic interiors.Virgil is a terrific character. As an art expert he has an eye for detail that provides with him the investigative senses of a detective. Watch his intensity increase as he talks to Claire on his mobile phone hearing the echo of noises around him and through the phone. He knows that she must be nearby. Their relationship is rich with irony a bond drawn from an aversion to sociality and people themselves. Tornatore's handsome interior stylisations reflect the internal psychology of his lead character. Scenes are filmed with a wide angle lens positioning Virgil as a smaller figure in the middle of large open room. This asserts his emotional distance and failure to understand people women in particular. As he grows mentally and physically closer to Claire and the wall that hides her the framing is purposefully tighter to assert their union of agoraphobic tendencies. Additional glimpses of his home life reveal a highly desaturated untouched and sterilised living quarters.Cleverly the film's tension levels are spread outside the main story and into two subplots that enhance the complexity of the relationships and the overall plotting. Virgil has two associates with vastly different motives. The first is his friend Billy Donald Sutherland who schemes with him on auctions. Virgil conducts the auction while Billy sneaks in a deliberate final bid. The other man is Robert Jim Sturgess who works in a workshop with mechanics parts. Robert forms an unexpected second mystery in the script. As Virgil asks him for advice on women and subsequently how he can grow closer to the Claire Robert's inner life comes to the fore. He is continually surrounded by various women when he is meant to be in a relationship. If his advice is genuine why is his personal life such a mess and what is the significance of the robot that he is constructing from various cranks found around Claire's family mansion?One of the theories Robert questions about the robot is whether there was someone once manipulating it from the inside. The same can be said about Virgil because of the artificiality of his life and the manipulation that occurs between these characters. One of the key lines in the film is there is always something authentic concealed in every forgery. Deception becomes Tornatore's concluding theme along with physical and mental disorientation. The idea is that as Virgil loses his bearings on time and space we do too so that we experience indistinguishable emotions about the real and fake. On top of this is a midget character with a photographic memory and a fast tracked timeline which makes for a confusing mindbending last quarter. I am still not entirely surely what happened but films that let you guess the ending by the second act are stale and boring. This will provoke discussion not only because it's strange and ambiguous but because of the complexity of the writing and the various layers of the inspired central performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "The cast and creative team endow this film with the promise of greatness. And indeed for the first 15 minutes or so the crisp cinematography coupled with Rush's authoritative characterization keep this promise firmly viable. In the first instance we have an endearingly dour refreshingly heterosexual dandy of an art and antiques dealer who likes to dabble in a little illicit personal procurement every now and then.So far so plausible. We'll even forgive that they called him Virgil. His professional services are enlisted by an elusive 20something yearold agoraphobe. She consents only to talk with him through a wall while he systematically itemizes the vast array of antiques housed within her parents' decaying villa in which she lives. Okay. But it's all downhill from there in a series of clichs 'notquite' plot devices and selfindulgent direction. Virgil's trusted mechanician and confidant Robert for example is an impossible combination of youth and exhaustive expertise rendered even more irritating by his British soapopera cad demeanor. The conversation between him and Virgil in which the latter explicates the significance of a particular 18th Century inventor is a cringeworthy exercise in obtuse Hollywoodised scripting. Film as a storytelling medium has no excuse to lug theatrical economy around with it when trying to relay such information. That's just lazy direction and screen writing. Nor should it require such overt acts as Virgil accidentally dropping his phone while spyingup Miss Agoraphobia from behind a conveniently erotic as if we were dumb enough to require further reminding of the dynamics incurred when a lonely old man enters into fellowship with some young feminine eye candy marble statue at the end of the room. It's the stuff of chick flicks.While the twists and halfturns because they weren't entirely unpredictable at the end of the film make for interesting potentially thrilling cinemafodder the payoffs ultimately suffer from clunky setup. Anomalies such as Claire  the girlgenius with a freakish propensity for remembering details or the alltooconvincinglyplayed groundsman Lambert beg more questions than they answer. And not in a good way rather in a way that alludes to a director who like Virgil was rather too concerned with aesthetics at the expense of something deeper and more gratifying.Unless of course you get a kick out of characters called Virgil Oldham transpiring to actually be a Virginal Old Man. Then you'll likely consider this film an intellectual masterpiece.".

Oldham is able to easily spot fakes but he also has an eye for deceiving desperate sellers regarding the worth of their forgotten masterpieces. Oldham is vain cynical fastidious and emotionally dry until he is asked to evaluate the furniture of a house being sold.

The film has been gorgeously shot on location in Italy Prague and Vienna by cinematographer Fabio Zamarion Respiro etc and the lush score by Tornatore's regular collaborator Ennio Morricone adds to the atmosphere.

	schema:headline " Conned Again";
	schema:reviewBody "Here we go round a familiar theme one more time. As with WriterDirector Giuseppe Tornatore's earlier film The Legend of 1900 we again have largely overblown characters in unbelievable situations. In both these offerings we have characters that similarly for one reason or another have supposedly never been completely part of the 'real' world. What is it that makes some audiences so ready to accept a movie as 'great' simply because it looks visually stylish? Pour enough money into a limp idea and it can look way better than it actually is. 'The Best Offer' primarily comes across as style over substance. The strongest aspect of this film is it's 'look'. Cinematographer Fabio Zamarion works hard to achieve above average nuances under Tornatore's call and this coupled with terrific production design and set decoration wins handsomely. It's just a pity they've been saddled with a script that stretches all believability till it cracks under the strain. If these stories are expected to be taken as fables then why are they given such deadly serious treatments taking them into the 'realistic' realm?Geoffrey Rush's character Virgil is a man of long term 'set' habits obsessive compulsive to the extreme wont touch anything without gloves avoids eye contact wherever possible yet within a few weeks we're expected to believe his near complete turn around. Off come the gloves he's now even primed to have raucous sex with a girl more than half his 60 years. This might have been OK if it were the only trait we had to overlook but the story features so many outlandish situations that if you pause just slightly to ponder them  you realize it's as fake as some of the art works this critic of world renown is supposed to be able to recognize.

	onyx:emotionText "Here we go round a familiar theme one more time. As with WriterDirector Giuseppe Tornatore's earlier film The Legend of 1900 we again have largely overblown characters in unbelievable situations. In both these offerings we have characters that similarly for one reason or another have supposedly never been completely part of the 'real' world. What is it that makes some audiences so ready to accept a movie as 'great' simply because it looks visually stylish? Pour enough money into a limp idea and it can look way better than it actually is. 'The Best Offer' primarily comes across as style over substance. The strongest aspect of this film is it's 'look'. Cinematographer Fabio Zamarion works hard to achieve above average nuances under Tornatore's call and this coupled with terrific production design and set decoration wins handsomely. It's just a pity they've been saddled with a script that stretches all believability till it cracks under the strain. If these stories are expected to be taken as fables then why are they given such deadly serious treatments taking them into the 'realistic' realm?Geoffrey Rush's character Virgil is a man of long term 'set' habits obsessive compulsive to the extreme wont touch anything without gloves avoids eye contact wherever possible yet within a few weeks we're expected to believe his near complete turn around. Off come the gloves he's now even primed to have raucous sex with a girl more than half his 60 years. This might have been OK if it were the only trait we had to overlook but the story features so many outlandish situations that if you pause just slightly to ponder them  you realize it's as fake as some of the art works this critic of world renown is supposed to be able to recognize. Rush is such a professional he almost pulls it off but I wouldn't be surprised if he wished he could have rewritten some sections Unfortunately relationships between many characters throughout this work also stretch credibility with way too much left unexplained.

They were deliberately left out for you. Directors don't give you a dozen clues to the ending and then expect you to be thrown.If you then go on assuming that the director wanted you to have doubts what you are left with is a very interesting concept. When did you make the jump from believing the relationship was real to believing it was fake? How many clues did you ignore? I can honestly say for myself that it was several. Just before the twist it's downright obvious what is going to happen. Somewhere along the line you went from believing the forgery was real to calling it fake. Did you abandon at the first false brush stroke? Or did you wait until you noticed a V in the eyeball of the painting?What people are upset about is that they wanted it to be real. They'd have rather lived a fantasy romance than a statement on how we believe lies we want to believe.If not for the pacing issues towards the end I might have given this movie a perfect score.".

The idea for this film was born when Dumont was in California desert and as he puts it I was afraid. It seems the time and space and the silence and the power of it all influenced him very much. Among other things he addressed the audience before the film started with if you become afraid when you watch this film just cover your face with hands.He also stated later that the film is an experiemnt at expressing his feelings and has no intent or narrative or message. The director is free to express himself and the spectator is free to see whatever she may in the film and take that away. The characters are stripped of anything that would make them likeable or dislikeable and generally of anything but the very primitive in order to make the experience pure.The characters are not the focus of the film sound and background are. Untreated location sound was used throughout the film and is very important for the director to convey the sense of the place and time. In one scene one could even hear the sound of lighting generator behind the camera which Dumont refused to edit out during the argument with the sound crew. Camerawork is also original and important in this experience.The serenity of transcendent scenes remind me of Zabriskie Point. Using explicit sex and violence remind me of Irreversible and I Stand Alone. Yet this is certainly not a following this is a highly personal expression which is designed to generate a highly personal experience for any viewer.Altogether NOT recommended if one is looking for normal filmgoing experience.".

These and other bizarre things show up in Twentynine Palms the latest film by Bruno Dumont La Vie de Jesus L'Humanite. It is essentially a horror film that might easily be called Scream 4. The opening scenes are beautiful and serene. David David Wassik an independent photographer from Los Angeles and Katia Katia Golubeva a young woman without work travel in a red 4X4 Hummer toward the vast California desert preparing to do a photo shoot for a magazine near the Joshua Tree National Park. The road leads to a motel in the city of 29 Palms a desert oasis that in the film consists of one gas station one hotel and a swimming pool. Dumont says that he filmed in the U.S. rather than his native France because he  felt the need to change space ingredients colors... and it is while filming in California that I had a true shock. The shock extends to the viewer as well. There is little dialogue or action in the conventional sense. The communication between the couple is complicated by the absence of a common language he speaks English she only speaks French. What conversation exists is trapped in a level of superficial banality. The lovers explore the desert in their 4X4 and are focused entirely upon their own pleasure seemingly defined by their sexuality. They swim in the motel pool watch game shows on television eat make love in the middle of the desert eat some more argue and make up then make love some more all shown in explicit detail. Everything is familiar a slice of typical Americana yet nothing is as it seems. Little by little the milieu becomes oppressive a quiet and incoherent fear begins to settle in an abstract fear because as Dumont says there is no reason to be afraid. At the end nothing can fill the emptiness but destruction. The contrast between the poetry of nature and the constricted range of the human experience is clear. In this world without a spiritual core the screams of pain and screams of delight are indistinguishable and anguish has the same meaning as pleasure. According to Dumont There is at the same time the bliss of pure happiness and absolute horror the capacity to generate the two extremes the hyper violence and the hyper pleasure. This is a couple that lives for pure pleasure and that will be led into abomination. One cannot be neutral about a Bruno Dumont film many people walked out during the Vancouver showing. His audiences are polarized between those who love and those that detest his films and the director seems disinterested in reconciling the two. I found this film extremely difficult to watch and even harder to be emotionally engaged with the characters. Dumont tests our endurance with scenes of brutal violence making no concession to our sensibilities. In bringing us face to face with our worst nightmare however he forces us out of our state of emotional detachment and compels us to react not with our minds or even our hearts but viscerally with the totality of our being. Far removed from the predigested package cinema of Hollywood Dumont has made an important statement about American values. The question must be asked however  with films like Twentynine Palms that are so offputting will there be anyone who notices?".

	schema:reviewBody "Twentynine Palms 2003 The basic plot outline for Twentynine Palms is that David a photographer from LA and his Russian lover Katia who speaks only in subtitled French are out in the California desert scouting out locations for an upcoming photo shoot at night they sleep in a motel room in the city of Twentynine Palms and by day they explore the desert in their red Hummer.First off there is very little dialog or action in this film it just flows naturally relying mainly on visuals and the bleak brooding atmosphere of the desert. The characters of David and Katia are basically hollow there's nothing for you to like or dislike about them they're nonentities. Their relationship is very intense and volatile but ultimately empty based purely on frequent bouts of animalistic f ucking in the desert sand on the rocks wherever. Constant long shots distance the viewer from what is happening on screen which adds to the overall feeling of isolation that the film emits.During one of their daily scouting missions in the middle of nowhere they are suddenly rammed from behind by a white pickup truck with blacked out windows they pull over and 3 men jump from the truck pull the couple from their Hummer and start to beat David's head in with a baseball bat. Then while one man holds Katia..s head forcing her to watch another of the men brutally rapes David while screaming in orgasmic glee after he comes he zips up and the men disappear as quickly as they arrived leaving the couple in the sand. They go back to their motel room where David sits on the bed completely traumatized. The next morning Katia goes out to get a pizza ?! and when she comes back David has locked himself in the bathroom she patiently waits for him to come out. Then suddenly the bathroom door flies open David bursts out screaming his head completely shaved and proceeds to viciously stab Katia to death. The final scene of the film is the abandoned Hummer in the middle of the desert David's dead body beside it and a highway patrol officer on his police radio calling for an ambulance.Twentynine Palms starts off as a cinema veritestyle road movie with stunning imagery stylish camerawork and a slow meditative pace but after the shocking ''climax'' you are left with one startlingly bleak and nihilistic film. Director Bruno Dumont has said his film has no intent narrative or message. He as a director is free to express himself on celluloid and we as spectators are free to take whatever we may from it. The characters are deliberately stripped free of any discernible traits therefore we cannot identify with them. Instead the focus is on pure sound and image. A fantastic piece of cinematic art. 1010 Highly recommended.".

The two characters and their relationship are described perfectly in short episodes and scraps of conversation.

I think the most convincing episode is that of the quarrel where the directing is just stunning.While the most part of the film is very realistic the ending is a bit superficial but contains a great metaphor David was raped in a manner he used to have sex with Katia  wild and rude. For some time they changed the roles she took care of him. He get closed in the bathroom just like she did. But he couldn't bare this state of things for long. He reestablished his masculine nature by letting out his hate for her and killing her note that he actually told her that he hate her earlier during the quarrel.

	schema:reviewBody "Well this one definitely isn't for everyone as you can tell by the comments. For awhile I liked this movie. I kind of liked these two driving around in the desert. The movie had that sort of dreamlike Zabriskie Point thing going on. In fact along those lines I'd mention that the film did feel like something from the 1960s in a good way.Katia Golubeva is a pretty enough girl and we see a lot of her.I know from regular trips to Death Valley that Europeans have a special respect for American deserts. At Badwater Junction in Death Valley you can walk out onto the salty flats and despite the fact that you're in a giant valley they know enough to whisper or remain silent altogether. It's a pensive respect for the desert I wish more Americans had.Here you get a lot of California desert always a good thing to me. I liked these two characters when they were getting along  there was a weird and charming sort of innocence in their sex life and affection for each other.Didn't fully get why they were constantly sniping at one another or why they kept having falling outs with each other. And that seems to be important to the overall point of the film and I'm still thinking about it. I wanted to slap them  especially David  when he was being a jerk. Because you should never take a sexually liberated French girl naked in the desert for granted that way Am I right?.The end is jarring and a metaphor for something but I'm not sure what exactly. Something I suspect about the fact that the two characters should have been a little more tender and appreciated each other more especially on the dude's part what with all the meanness and cruelty in the world and so on.This is not for everyone.

	onyx:emotionText "Well this one definitely isn't for everyone as you can tell by the comments. For awhile I liked this movie. I kind of liked these two driving around in the desert. The movie had that sort of dreamlike Zabriskie Point thing going on. In fact along those lines I'd mention that the film did feel like something from the 1960s in a good way.Katia Golubeva is a pretty enough girl and we see a lot of her.I know from regular trips to Death Valley that Europeans have a special respect for American deserts. At Badwater Junction in Death Valley you can walk out onto the salty flats and despite the fact that you're in a giant valley they know enough to whisper or remain silent altogether. It's a pensive respect for the desert I wish more Americans had.Here you get a lot of California desert always a good thing to me. I liked these two characters when they were getting along  there was a weird and charming sort of innocence in their sex life and affection for each other.Didn't fully get why they were constantly sniping at one another or why they kept having falling outs with each other. And that seems to be important to the overall point of the film and I'm still thinking about it. I wanted to slap them  especially David  when he was being a jerk. Because you should never take a sexually liberated French girl naked in the desert for granted that way Am I right?.The end is jarring and a metaphor for something but I'm not sure what exactly. Something I suspect about the fact that the two characters should have been a little more tender and appreciated each other more especially on the dude's part what with all the meanness and cruelty in the world and so on.This is not for everyone. It is slow moving beautiful to look at with characters who occasionally charm and occasionally irritate. The end sequence is disturbing and unpleasant.If you're a fan of mainstream Hollywood you might find this excruciatingly boring.

So this isn't a I don't understand art cinema and only like Hollywood kind of response. In fact I generally like arthouse cinema and older films much more than mainstream cinema.29 Palms however is utter drivel. Halfway through the film I was starting to wonder whether Dumont was making a satirical comment on these flaky pretentious and pointless characters. How else to explain that he could have felt that there could be any point in watching these incredibly boring characters. The film is nigh on unwatchable because the characters are such total dullards and nothing happens. There are times when inaction can be fascinating  Monte Hellman has a pretty good stab at a film about nothing happening in Two Lane Black Top. But I finally got the sense that Dumont felt that he was communicating some kind of grand human struggle with his characters. He isn't. He's just simply filming two stupid people playing stupid characters who act like children.When the action does kick in after an hour and half of utter boredom it is totally unsatisfactory. You get the sense that Dumont has no respect for horror films. The first hour and a half is perhaps supposed to elevate the horror elements into something sublime. But this isn't a subversion of horror clichs it's an obliterative film that takes all of the satisfaction out of the horror elements. There is a vast problem at the moment in that directors don't see the potential in genre films. Horror films these days are generally dumb or incredibly pretentious deconstructions of the genre.The problem with 29 Palms lies in the fact that without the action of the last half hour there would be no film. But because the first three quarters of the film is so unengaging the last quarter seems utterly pointless anyway. There is no buildup of tension towards the climax no atmosphere just bad performances. And the climax is so obtuse that it is mostly amusing. Many great films have covered the themes of 29 Palms. Dumont's film keeps its themes out of focus in an attempt to make grand statements. Ultimately it is says absolutely nothing about anything.After watching the extras on the disc it does indeed turn out that Dumont thinks that these characters are somehow fascinating. The main actor talks about his performance as if he invented acting. Dumont speaks as if actors have no understanding of the process that they go through. The 'Making Of' Documentary plays like Spinal Tap.This is a grossly misguided film by a pretentious and misguided director. People will read deep meanings into it but really this is dreadful filmmaking of the highest order. Absolute drivel there's no doubt about it.".

They don't speak the same language and the most palatable means of communication between them are gestures and looks. As soon as they arrive in this desert landscape they bicker then reconcile each other have sex wander in the surroundings. And an impending unshakable threat is just around the corner. One can feel it but one can't see it during almost all the film...I stand in awe for the French filmmaker Bruno Dumont who could be Robert Bresson's heir would it be only by his minimalist approach about the writing of a film and his way of filming. His two unique works la Vie De Jsus 1997 and l'Humanit 1999 which had a strong connection with le Journal D'Un Cur De Campagne 1951 revealed a new fresh auteur who delivered a thoroughly novel vision of the cinematographic genres the two quoted films belong to. This third offering as unsettling as its two precedent partners is very close to a mix of roadmovie and horror film. One thinks of the horrendous the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974. But like his precedent efforts Dumont won't follow the rules and will rather relinquish the codes of the genre.His experimental piece of work holds his own mark. First there's still this palpable sense of space which he has perhaps never tapped so well here. Anyway the scenery and the landscapes of this Californian desert were ideal for him to set out his stalls. This barren place has something both startling and eerie for it could be in the first place an equivalent of the garden of Eden. The sequence in which David and Katia are all naked on the rocks make inevitably think of Adam and Eve. This is a divine vision of a world which seems forever gone. These landscapes are also repulsive because dangerous. Nothing happens in them and danger could come out at any moment.There's no real storytelling in Twentynine Palms like in Dumont's debut la Vie De Jsus. It isn't really a handicap because the filmmaker knows how to grab the audience's attention with an unconventional courageous approach of cinematographic writing. The film includes quite numerous static shots with a painstaking work on the sound which often sounds dirty Basically the film showcases a love between two very different characters but this love and so this fusion between them is impossible. The scratch on the 4X4 is a concrete sign of this doomed love. Then what fascinates Dumont in this failed loving relationship is the animal side which sleeps in them. It's the filmmaker's duty to awake it and it better explodes during their wild sexual intercourse which inconveniences the audience like the scenes in the swimming pool and the motel bedroom.Twentynine Palms is also a typical work from Dumont because he wants the viewer to take part in his experiment. It means he wants him to arouse questions about what he can watch on the screen and especially about the main characters' thoughts. But also to bridge the different steps of the evolution of the film it would seem irrelevant to use the term story as there is virtually none here. Very simply Dumont wants to put this crucial premise of the cinema to the forefront a film is a link between its director and the audience and for Dumont it's up to the viewer to express his standpoint about the contents and form. Twentynine Palms is the antithesis of Dumont's second film l'Humanit. In this whodunit the main protagonist Pharaon De Winter was deeply affected by the woes and sorrow in which this humanity was steeped in but it didn't stop him from sharing their grieves. In the Dumont 2003 film humanity is virtually absent and even constitutes a danger perhaps the main one because it breaks the fleeting harmony of the couple. Consequences could be disastrous even gruesome.It is impossible to leave this film indifferent which leaves none glimmer of hope. It could occupy a prominent place in the category of the either you like either you hate films and if you're tired of watching films made in a trite manner this one is waiting for you...But beware! It's better to have nerves of steel to watch this work.".

The pacing of the film is rather artschool generic. The framing of the shots is unexceptional their beauty lying in the landscape not the direction nor the cinematography. A poorly made film despite my opinion of the content. Comparisons to horror films are appropriate as a reference to quality.

Many shots of the beautiful So. Cal. desert as contrast to a meaninglessly horrificpathetic humanity. A base I would use the word puerile if the content weren't so explicit view of humanity. The pacing of the film is rather artschool generic. The framing of the shots is unexceptional their beauty lying in the landscape not the direction nor the cinematography. A poorly made film despite my opinion of the content. Comparisons to horror films are appropriate as a reference to quality. All 'shock' no content well not quite Joshua Tree National Park is beautiful. Watch as you will. Peace.";

I have alerted readers to spoilers but the truth is there is so little action story line character development or writing there isn't much to spoil. A selfish arrogant jerk goes on a trip with his super needy girlfriend from Russia. They drive the arrogant jerks Hummer through the desert and have sex in various places with the guy having some impossible skull exploding orgasm every time. This happens continuously for the first 96 minutes of this 113 minute movie. In the last ten minutes they are pulled over by desertdriving thugs who force them to stop rape and brutalize the man while forcing the woman to watch. In the last minute they are both killed and the movie ends. Just awful. I suppose the artsy pseudointellectuals will talk about these things I thought the director had included. The stark contrast of the Hummer in the desert. The less than perfect communications between the man and the woman represent the inherent differences of the sexes. And finally it was not lost on me no more than getting hit with a sledgehammer was the male rape by the guy who had the bigger truck and as some king of insane plot thread the rapist has a similar very vocal orgasm during the male rape. Look I don't want to intellectualize over some antiHummer tirade by the director but this movie sucked and the panoramic vistas which some people think is the saving grace of this movie kind of in the wide open style of Kubrick in 2001but it simply did not work for me. For example some of the shots are so wide you have to scan to find the actors. Anyway pass on this film you have an hour fifty two minutes to do better stuff in your life.".

We see them fumble around with their own insecurities and idiosyncrasies an apology follows every foulup and fauxpas and it's clear they're still learning about each other. They're neither likable nor unpleasant they're just an average couple.Identical to director Bruno Dumont's L'humanite in that there's an irresistible hypnotic quality to the endless shots of people driving and walking the film also follows the same cyclical rhythm as L'humanite  except it has a much faster pace. It's beautifully shot with Dumont taking full advantage of the landscape. Often the subject whether it be a car or a person is just a speck in the midst of mountainous desert.The acting is not spectacular but it's very good and most importantly the couple have great chemistry that's not exactly dynamic but it's very believable. When it erupts into violence in the final minutes it's all the more painful because we know them so well. It's like one of those slasher films that make a point of letting us get to know the characters before the killing starts except in this case it's entirely successful.A masterpiece.

The most notable thing about it is the unnerving  disquieting atmosphere seeping out of the landscape and the shadowplay of the storyline. But generally it's soso.Near the end the couple gets attacked by a group of thugs a sequence reminiscent of Gaspar Noe's shock cinema the man is beaten up and raped while the woman watches.

However I was disheartened to find that it had a low average score on IMDb so I found it on Youtube didn't want to risk buying it hoping that IMDb was going to be proved wrong but unfortunately it wasn't.Bunshinsaba was extremely disappointing. I liked the creepy opening which immediately set the atmosphere and had me feeling for the main character but after that it seemed to be incredibly rushed through so I found it hard to get into. There are a lot of ideas pushed into Bunshinsaba that are skimmed over in a flash and not allowing for any sort of character development thus detaching you from the story. There's also no discourse markers to let you know that the film is going to move on to a different idea it just goes onto a different scene and it's as if a whole chunk has been cropped out.The ideas are also not wholly original. It relies on the longhaired whiteface ghost were creepy in The Grudge and The Ring but have become overused in Japanese horror films and now it seems the Korean's have started copying them. Although at least they had a go at constructing a fresh story instead of remaking one! There are also a range of recycled and overused ideas in ghost films you could count the clichs on your fingers We've got the vengeful spirit possession exorcism a secluded town etc. All that have been done to death and Bunshinsaba doesn't even try doing them in any new or exciting ways.However that's not to say that Bunshinsaba is a terrible film because it's not. Its strongest moments lay in the flashback sequences which take upon a slower pace which is much better suited for the film. The backstory is also genuinely interesting and I found myself gripped to those scenes. There is also some exciting moments dotted around the film I just wished it had been more original and had taken a slower and more meaningful approach.It also got a little too confusing at the end and I found myself just leaning back and watching what unfolds without really knowing what's going on because the film doesn't allow any time for the viewer to work it out. Bunshinsaba is an OK film and does pass the time on a rainy Friday night but it should not be the main aim of your life to see this film. It's nothing we haven't seen before and haven't seen done more effectively.".

In small doses at the right moment usually associated with creepy sounds or eerie score moving suddenly or with broken movements those outofthisworld presences have the power to scare to death the poor characters unfortunate enough to be in their path. Now ladies and gentlemen in Bunshinsaba you have the longest presence onscreen of the aforementioned longhaired female ghosts in the entire Asian horror history. If you have a better example please let me know.Now you think that will make this movie the scariest of them all? Errr...no. Bunshinsaba is a horror movie no doubt about it. But it's scare factor is average or even low. Despite some very short disturbing images it's hard to be really terrified. No unsupportable tension from Shutter no gruesomedeformed faces from The Ring. The last threequarters of the film we're dealing with the ghost whoas usuallyseek revenge. The main problem is that we have real difficulties to know who's the real person who's the real person possessed by the vengeful spirit who's the real spirit what's real and what's imagination and who's the reincarnation of the spirit. It's not easy to follow. Once invokedat the beginning the spirit move from person to person determining the subsequent behavior. Some commit suicide by putting a plastic bag over the head spilling flammable liquid over and set it on fire. Other girl throw herself out of window.About the standard mandatory longhaired girlnotice that I didn't said ghost As I said you will see a LOT of standard stuff. A face looking down and then slightly starting to rise the sight. Don't expect demoniacal expressions sudden scares in sync with loud sounds. Once is the real girlschool next time the ghost next another girl possessed by the ghost. Hmmm pretty twisted maybe a second viewing is necessary.Otherwise even the plot is relatively clear it is also pretty twisted. There's a lot of talk. All the girls are beautiful and in general the cast consist in pleasantlooking people. Unfortunately if you want to be really scared this is not the right movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arriving at a new boarding school a schoolgirl becomes fed up with the bullying inflicted upon her by a group of classmates and plays with a spirit board hoping for revenge only to unleash the ravenous spirit of a longdead student upon them and must save them before it's too late.This was an exceptionally enjoyable effort that really has a lot going for it. One of it's best features is the fact that it manages to contain plenty of strong and somewhat chilling ghostly encounters throughout here. From the opening boardgame where they play with the board in the brightlylit red light where the ghost is released to the numerous scenes of the ghost appearing around the school to the tormentors resulting in not only the fantastic scene of the ghost encouraging the one victim to commit suicide in front of the rest of the school but also getting to see the various flashbacks to the past that show how the original girl was tormented and killed the bullies seeking revenge. That is the rather fun part of this one as the various scenes showing the girl carrying out not only her revenge on the classmates as well as the several flashbacks that feature how the actions of the village affected the outcome of the future and set the curse into motion. With some brutal and enjoyable elements popping up in the finale to exact this retribution it has a lot to like with the ghost here. Likewise alongside the fantastic ghost action is the exceptionally chilling atmosphere that's nearly better than the ghost itself. The idea of the boardgame causing the curse itself isn't all too original but the fact that there's plenty of stellar sequences here showing the atmosphere around the classroom which is handled rather nicely. Not only does the events in the film's current time shown to interact with the events of the schoolbound ghost legend from the past but the reaction of the students which furthers that connection quite nicely. Even the scenes of her being bullied and tormented by the gang both in their oneonone confrontations as well as their attempt to kill her in the classroom which is one of the finer scenes in the film as a whole and all ties together to give this one the feeling of the curse coming together with the other storylines. Otherwise there isn't much else wrong here. Among the few problems to be had here is the fact that the film really makes it quite hard to invest itself in this story based on the languid and unnecessarily slow pacing. Although it makes out the cause of the problem early on and gets in some great ghostly activity in the first half this one still takes quite a while to reveal it's true purpose with the initial feeling of this one taking the route of a released entity preying on the classmates after their turn with the boardgame. It's not until late in the film that the full extent of the ghosts' actions are revealed which is due to the second minor issue here with the film relying more on flashbacks to fulfill the story more than anything. It's sometimes hard to keep track of everything because it's all revealed there rather than mentioned to everyone and then expanding on it in the flashback and the film is slightly disjointed in terms of pacing due to that. Its other flaw is the rather convoluted manner in which it plays out as it ranges from several possible storylines that could've worked separately without being forced into a singular film so it's a bit of an issue here with this scattershot approach. As these aren't that detrimental overall the work is quite enjoyable.Rated UnratedR Graphic Violence and Language.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bunshinsaba is your typical longhaired ghostgirl trope horror movie that runs out of steam really fast. It has a very good first act and is well directed well lit and does not rely on special effects. It also has an original premise and is well acted. I especially liked the opening which wasted no time to get right to the premise of the movie. The problem is that the movie quickly turns into a paintbynumbers of The Ring. A lot of the foreshadowing if you can even call it that is so obvious that if there were any surprises or twists in the second act they are long gone before you even get there. The movie also overindulges in dramatic lightning strikes during close ups and shows the ghosts way too much. This sucks the suspense right out of the movie. Halfway through the film it started to drag and I just wanted the movie to end. One of the movie's main problems is that there are no stakes in the third act. The main characters have no means of stopping the ghost and thus there is no tension. We're basically just watching the ghost kill a lot of characters that we don't like any way with no means for the main characters of stopping her. No stakes or likable victims means no suspense. It's a shame because the movie is well directed well shot and has great use of scene lighting. I even liked the music that played over the ending credits before it was interrupted by a standard Asian pop song. But I can't really recommend this movie. It's not bad it's just sub par.".

The ghost of Chunhee rearing her ugly face when her host is under hypnosis..those redlight hypnosis sessions are particularly eerie especially when Yoojin is under and her eyes blacken is especially creepy. And the suicides..and particularly Kim insook's terrible fate at the hands of torchcarrying angry villagersare truly memorable and shocking. I think director Byeongki AhnPhoneNightmareis at his best showing a village under a siege of fear completely overwhelmed by their own guilt and prejudices and feeling the effects of what they did to those not born within their community. I do think Ahn is a gifted filmmaker who can certainly develop scenes which give you the creeps and his technical skills are topnotch but he has yet to make that one film which defines himself as a bonafide storyteller. He as of now has made films which are closely related thematically to oftmade Asian horror hits that are..and have beenflooding the market for years now. I do wish this film was titled something better because Bunshinsaba..I watched it under the label Witch BoardBunshinsabareally is only used to invoke the spirit and isn't the focus of the story. The cast is superb right down the line very attractive and help lift the rather ordinary material. Overall Ahn's film will fulfill 90 minutes and has some visual spooks to offer but look elsewhere for originality.".

A high school girl and one of her teachers become possessed by the angry spirits of a mother and daughter killed by villagers 30 years before. The usual RinguJuon clichs are put through their paces here. The movie is handsomely produced and stylishly directed but because this genre is getting so played out there are few real scares and only a handful of effective scenes. Gorehounds will like the climax. Mainly it's just a case of been there done that. Worth seeing only if you're a completist on a mission to see anything in the horror genre that Asia produces.".

During the curse the girls are all told that whatever they do keep their eyes closed at all times or the spirit will enter them. Yujin of course opens hers and she is entered by a spirit. The next day at school one of the girls who Yujin had put a curse on seems to have killed her self by placing a plastic bag over her head dousing it in lighter fluid and setting it ablaze. It turns out that the spirit in Yujin is the spirit of a girl who had been killed by the villagers years ago in the same way.OK so this is another Asian ghost story so what makes this one different from the rest? Well to tell the truth not much. I really think that its time now that the whole girl with her hair over her face ghost was done away with now. It was great in Ringu and still pretty good in Juon but now its just overdone and predictable. There are still plenty of good things coming out of the far east but unfortunately this isn't one of them. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad film. It has some reasonably effective scares here and there but it is just nothing new.The film does boast some lovely camera work. Lots of great movement and nice angles make this a stunning film to watch and the acting is all pretty good. I have yet to see the directors other films including Phone but from what I hear this film isn't quite on par with that. The story line is all OK until about the hour mark where things start to get stale and a bit dull.This is a film that I would find hard to recommend. To your casual horror fan I would say check it out especially if you haven't seen to many Asian films. But to anyone with a keen interest in the Asian horror film genre I would say only watch if you have to see every film that comes out of the continent as you wont find anything new here.510".

This movie is just awesome and entertaining from the start to the end credits. The opening scene was very well done and scary. The ending was quite good. This movie probably is as scary as shows such as the shutter but did not scare me as much as ringu. The first half of the movie was terrifying the second half of the movie was not as scary but still entertaining. However this movie is really complicating somewhere around the middle and I have a hard time trying to figure out what was happening. This movie is similar to Reincarnation in some ways but it does not matter. This movie is extremely exciting and recommended. This is one of my Top 10 horror movies. Score 910".

Whereas Amelia has found love and is graduating for a professional career as a therapist Laura on the oder hand has found a job in a newspaper but her love life leaves a lot to be desired.Nicole Holofcener the director takes us to meet these two women as they go through their lives in present day Manhattan. Having seen this film when it made its commercial debut we decided to take another look after almost ten years of being released and we can report the film is still fresh and quirky as when we first saw it. The director whose Lovely and Amazing was also a worthy successor treats her subjects with a light touch and the result is a film that gives the viewer a good insight about human relations in a cinematic form.The best thing going for the film is lovely Catherine Keener who is an asset no matter what she is playing. Ms. Keener seems to be a natural for the movies. The camera loves this actress who has a style of her own and who in comedies such as this makes perfect sense as her directors clearly capitalize on her uncanny sense of how to play the quirky characters in which she has excelled.Anne Heche on the other hand makes a perfect Amelia come true. Ms. Heche is a good actress that always brings something to the roles she plays. Amelia the young woman in this film is at a point in her life where she has to make decisions about her relationship with Frank who clearly adores her and her own career as a therapist.The supporting roles are basically the men in the two friends' lives. There is Frank who is living with Amelia. He wants her to commit and marry him but she has doubts before she says yes. Todd Field makes a good impression as Frank. Bill the video store clerk likes Laura but feels betrayed when he hears a message Amelia has left on the answering machine where she calls him ugly he takes offense and decides to drop Laura. Kevin Corrigan is perfect playing this man. Finally there is Andrew an old flame of Laura's who has broken up with her some time ago but has remained friends. Liev Schreiber is good in this part.Walking and Talking shows a talented Nicole Holofcener at her best. The film shows us a director who knows a lot about the complicated balance of the relationship between two caring friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "this is what audiences need to see more of. Good characterization realistic dialog no slapstick cheap tricks farce etc. and capable actors.I have seen Friends With Money which was a disappointment compared to this and Lovely and Amazing. This film succeeds because we care about the characters Anne Heche as the therapist trying to control her wedding Catherine Keener as confused and disappointed single again friend. Andrew and Laura Schreiber and Keener Frank and AmeliaAnn Heche and Todd Field two couples just trying to make things work. They have to find humor in minor things. Kevin Corrigan adds humor as Keener's sometime date who finds out he is referred to as the ugly guy.Liev Schreiber adds a good element to the film. Keener's former boyfriend he is there for her even as she pursues Corrigan who works at a video store...Jeez look at him...I thought I could relax for once... Keener says as she wonders why he has rejected her.This has been compared to Sex and the City but there really is no comparison. A one hour TV show vs. film this film has resonance we will remember and want to see these characters again they are not cardboard cutout characterizations. TV has to be more polarized due to the medium and time limits hence the characters are more superficial and obvious.Could we picture Kim Catrall in this film I don't think so. I am surprised Nicole Holfcener has not surmised this and realized the casting mistake in Friends with Money if someone has a tooTV persona they do not necessarily translate to film. That was one of the problems with FWM.Also the performances in this film were not preceded by the personalities. Heche is believable amusing and sympathetic. Catherine Keener is quirky interesting and multilayered. Liev Schreiber is funny a good friend and we want to see more of him. Please Ms. Holofcener for your next film use film actors not people who had a high TV Q or were married to a film celebrity for a brief period. It makes a great deal of difference and the finished product proves this to be so. 910".

The dialog is bristling with insight and vigor unlike many films of that era that Hollywood mass produced as so called romantic comedies. Yet this film is much more than a romantic comedy. Inspired by Woody Allen's more intimate and smallscale New York films it adds its own voice to that tradition.

So if movies that are in the 'thirtysomething' mold aren't to your liking don't stop here. The star Catherine Keener even looks like she'd fit in perfectly on that TV show. On the other hand if you like nothing better than a film that revolves around characters and their relationships I don't think you'll go wrong giving this one a try.How you feel about the film will of course be determined by how much you care for the characters and I found them likeable enough to give it a positive rating. Amelia Keener is the confused one here who doesn't want any more than a platonic relationship with her longtime male friend and can't figure out why she can't get a worthwhile relationship going with any other man. Her best friend from childhood is Laura Anne Heche who seems to have everything that either of them wants as far as a relationship goes. Laura is soon to be married which doesn't help Amelia's frustration any.The movie doesn't ever get overly serious about things and stays enjoyable throughout. Keener is fine in her role and Heche seems to do well in every film she's in. This is a strong firsttime effort by the writerdirector Nicole Holocener. I think she made the film she set out to do. It will be interesting to see if in the future she has anything more or different to say.".

The characters though similar in many ways also have distinct qualities especially in the way they cope with their problems and the people surrounding them.Of course needless to say Keener fits all roles to the T turning in some of her best works.

It's the sort of film that some will think is the cat's meow while others will despise it like it's a child molester and both points of view will be valid. That's because while this movie is well done what it does is so blisteringly ordinary. Just about anyone who watches it will have moments of emotional recognition for what's going on in the story and most will spend the time in between those moments plaintively waiting for the talking and walking to go anywhere.Amelia Catherine Keener is a single woman in New York City. She has a lifelong best friend named Laura Anne Heche who's now living with a boyfriend Todd Field. Amelia doesn't have a boyfriend. She does have an exboyfriend named Andrew Liev Schrieber who hangs around like Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld. Amelia's also got a cat dying of cancer and a video store clerkhorror movie fan Kevin Corrigan who wants to bone her.As soon as Laura's boyfriend proposes to her she starts fancying other men. As soon as Amelia gets comfortable with settling for the video store clerk he dumps her for saying he's ugly behind his back. Andrew has a father with Alzheimer's and a pseudogirlfriend in California whom he wants to dump right after he has phone sex with her. Amelia feels abandoned by Laura not always being there for her and Laura can't always be there for her because she's actually gone out and gotten a life of her own.Now take all of that and coat it with 2  inches of well written but mostly inconsequential blather and you've got Walking And Talking. It'll work for you if you like the performers enjoy having a waterfall of very short scenes splash over you and appreciate examinations of humanity in utterly unexceptional circumstances. It'll feel like a potato peeler across your forehead if you want characters that are likable need a story to have some propulsion and don't want to watch a motion picture that's less interesting than your own life.Catherine Keener does a wonderful job playing a woman you really wouldn't want to know. Anne Hech is as good playing a woman you would want to know but would have a lovehate relationship with. Liev Schreiber is okay except for the fact that Amelia and Andrew's relationship is written as though Nicole Holofcener has never met a man let alone dated one. Exlovers can certainly break up and still find a way to be friends. That way is not going to be like it is here where Amelia treats Andrew like her gay best friend and Andrew behaves like he's her gay best friend. That's an odd way for exlovers to relate and requires a lot more explanation than it gets in Walking And Talking.Which is a complaint that could be levied against much of this script. While the film is already too long as 86 minutes the story feels like significant parts of it are regularly being skipped in order to show you scenes that would normally be cut out of a film to tighten it up. None of it's bad but you can't help thinking there's something more important you should be seeing.If you like dramas where the drama is muted comedies where the comedy produces more knowing grins than giggles and romances where you don't particularly care if the lovers get together or not give Walking And Talking a try. If you can take pleasure from craft for its own sake give Walking And Talking a try. If you want a movie that doesn't remind you of the inane conversations you've had with your own friends find something else to watch".

	onyx:emotionText "Walking And Talking is a lot more talking than walking. It's the sort of film that some will think is the cat's meow while others will despise it like it's a child molester and both points of view will be valid. That's because while this movie is well done what it does is so blisteringly ordinary. Just about anyone who watches it will have moments of emotional recognition for what's going on in the story and most will spend the time in between those moments plaintively waiting for the talking and walking to go anywhere.Amelia Catherine Keener is a single woman in New York City. She has a lifelong best friend named Laura Anne Heche who's now living with a boyfriend Todd Field. Amelia doesn't have a boyfriend. She does have an exboyfriend named Andrew Liev Schrieber who hangs around like Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld. Amelia's also got a cat dying of cancer and a video store clerkhorror movie fan Kevin Corrigan who wants to bone her.As soon as Laura's boyfriend proposes to her she starts fancying other men. As soon as Amelia gets comfortable with settling for the video store clerk he dumps her for saying he's ugly behind his back.

	schema:reviewBody "Even in her first film back in 1996 Nicole Holocenfer has always been the best at conveying so much feeling with so little.'Walking and Talking' is an impressive Nicole Holocenfer starter and possibly her best as it gets everything just right in that Nicole Holofcener way. It doesn't over due with the bonding motives drenched in the appropriate music that Nicole Holocenfer can't see the cheese in and has induced in her more recent films immensely. This first effort also spawns Nicole's signature comedy of finding the hilarity in smug annoying and odd strangerswho we all loathe and in the funny but horrible shallowness of her characters in which has made Nicole known for making comedic movies since then. The writing here is more raw and youthful with Nicole's feelings as a girl and a woman maybe because of the times but this makes for more original interesting and entertaining dialogue and performances.'Walking and Talking' unlike Nicole's later films also doesn't hit you over the head with the acts of one dimensional characters as each character properly goes through a vary of feelings and moods as they each go through various different situations of life more so like real people. With this unfortuantely unlike her other films she doesn't make the men in the movie side notes and props. They get a say too and convey almost as much emotion as the female characters. Nicole Holofcener's point in her movies maybe to make women the forefront of her movies and to make men the props but I personally find it insulting and typical to do this so it was perfect to see her first effort was true to everyone.Nicole's direction style especially with this entire tells us shes not afraid to make things wacky to convey a character's thoughts and emotions even in a story of reallife and with her camera direction as well she always makes things feel interesting to watch as characters appear on the screen and as scenes coming along with a simple pan although things going on in the movie are average life situations. And she never pushes a scene into a more sexually or exciting realm for interest of the viewer as she keeps scenes in the reality of what it is depicting which is wonderful because its real. She proves to be a big fan of the fade in and fade out into and out of sequences as its used here and in her later films but it makes more sense in 'Walking and Talking'and brings certain meaning to certain scenes as appose to 'Friends with Money' but the fade out was interesting in that movie nonetheless. This direction style with the soft awkward acoustic music to the scenes can be also seen as influential to the indie movie scene of 2000s with it's structure to movies like 'Juno'.This is a great 90's time capsule and even unrated as a definitive 90's movie with it's great 90's soundtrack and band references it's geektom fan fair and laidback lifestyles of the characters so significant to generation x.This first effort years ago shows that Nicole Holofcener gets like no other the awkwardness of relating to ageing family members and ageing in general. The feeling of being lonely and feeling that time is passing by and being wasted having your own ironic stupid superficial ideals hold you back from being with someone who wants to fill the void and who thinks your the belloftheball and that you don't know someone can make you happy until you give them a shot because you can't wait forever. This is also one of the most accurate films showing the jealously shared between to friends of one having someone in companionship and the other having no one in freedom. This is an importantintelligent and accurate film for females but at it's core its also a life study for men and women equally.May I also add that no wonder Nicole Holofcener has used Catherine Keener all these years.... Shes a great actress. And This is proof that Kevin Corrigan has always been amazing.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are independent movies that try to set the world on edge and try to revise the way that we view and use the medium. Sometimes you get a Being John Malkovitch where it all pays off. More often than not those end up like the films by pedantic pissant Harmony Korine you couldn't pay me enough money to watch Gummo again. On the other end of the spectrum though are filmmakers who just try to make movies about people. These are simple movies without fancy handheld camera tricks Vaseline coated filters or the use of unattractive actors simply to prove that the world is ugly One more time Harmony Korine I'm talking to you. They use actors who look like people perhaps a little more attractive but not much. And these people speak the way your friends talk not the way a bunch of film school graduate students talk. Nicole Holofcener's Walking and Talking is a perfect example of the latter kind of film. Frankly it doesn't aim very high but then again it never feels forced obnoxious or pretentious Last stab at you Harmony Korine.Walking and Talking is frankly about just that the movement of life and the conversations we have along with way conversations with people we love people we hate and people we want to love. It has a wonderful awareness that sometimes good intentions go bad that sometimes jokes hurt and that sometimes dull doesn't mean bad.Amelia Catherine Keener and Laura Anne Heche are like sisters. Former roommates they've always told each other everything but now Laura is engaged Frank Todd Field and sometimes Laura who works as an obviously pretty awful therapist tells Frank secrets first. Amelia on the other hand is looking for love. She's proud that she can now be friends with her exboyfriend Andrew Liev Schreiber and that she can find attractiveness in the ugly video store clerk Bill Kevin Corrigan. None of these characters are 100 successful at anything they do and they all seem to be living with illusions that there's something better out there for them. But rather than going looking for it they rent videos shop and talk of the phone. And yet as Holofcener makes clear there's nothing unusual tragic or pathetic about this lifestyle.Holofcener's greatest skill is that she doesn't judge any of these characters and she does a wonderful job with the actors making their performances seem real. Unlike so many movie characters you don't leave Walking and Talking wishing you had friends that were this cool. You leave realizing that your friends are very similar. Holofcener doesn't force any of the action displaying no particular personal directing style in both the best and worse senses of the phrase. She doesn't do much to move the story along but she also never distracts you.Since this movie came out we've gotten to know all of the actors better. Anne Heche became something of a media generated star. Catherine Keener was nominated for an Oscar. Todd Field featured prominently in Eyes Wide Shut Liev Schreiber was in Screams 2 and 3 and Kevin Corrigan has been in 22 TV and movie projects in those 4 years. Several of these actors have resorted to schtick in other films mostly Heche and Corrigan here but in Walking and Talking they all seem casual and correct. It's a pleasure to watch them.Walking and Talking is very slight but it's also memorable for the performances the unforced writing and a nice depiction of New York City that doesn't seem overly familiar. This is a solid 710 a good rental that loses nothing on the small screen.".

It's a very creative and insightful story utilizing slight comedic elements to show the destructive forces of petty professional jealousy within a family.Most parents wish for true happiness for their children. If the professional success of their offspring far exceeds their own ... it is a reason to swell with parental pride. But what happens when father and son choose similar paths? What happens when animosity builds as the father's life work 30 years of research is deemed unnecessary and irrelevant? What happens when the son becomes publicly revered and adored for his populist writing? Well in the case of father Eliezer Shlomo BarAba and son Uriel Lior Ashkenazi we get strained relations and a thesis on the pitfalls of pride and ego.All of that is sufficiently fascinating for a story but here we get an even more severe test of human nature. The father is erroneously informed that he has won the prestigious Israel Award providing vindication and meaning to his work and well his being. See the award was supposed to go to the other Professor Shkolnik ... yes his son. This much is shown in the trailer but the true guts of this story is what happens after this mistake.There are a few tremendous scenes in the film but two really jumped out for me. In an early scene the son is receiving yet another reward and he is attempting to provide some credit for his father's inspiration. However the words seem to add credence to the irrelevancy instead. The best part? The camera never leaves the face of the father and he sits quietly listening in immeasurable pain. The other scene takes place in a beyond cramped meeting room for the Award committee to discuss the mistake with Uriel. The manner it is filmed and the choreography more than make up for the fact that the group of brilliant people never thought to find a more suitable meeting place.The score of the film is one that I would appreciate more without having the film playing. The music is wonderful but often distracting to the moment. It is interesting to note how it changes along with the posture and walking pace of Eliezer after he is informed of his award. One need not be an academic researcher or writer to understand the damaged relationship between father and son ... and how it has impacted wives mothers and sons. That's a story that is painful in any language.".

	schema:headline " Enormously clever depiction of rivalry between fatherson Talmudic scholars despite heavyhanded ending";
	schema:reviewBody "'Footnote' is an enormously clever film by an American born Israeli filmmaker Joseph Cedar. It concerns the rivalry between fatherson Talmudic scholars Eliezer and Uriel Shkolnik. Before seeing the film I assumed that this was going to be a film about insular Hasidics chronicling the rivalry between Talmudic scholars in an ultrareligious community. However that's not the case at all we soon learn that the two principals are actually academics in the Talmudic department at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Uriel can best be described as either a Conservative or Modern Orthodox Jew and Eliezer seemingly completely secular as he does not wear a yarmulke.Utilizing intertitles crosscutting and an intrusive musical score that some have compared to Shostakovich Cedar offers up an amusing back story for both father and son during the first ten minutes of the film. We learn that Eliezer has been toiling in obscurity at the University engaging in arcane research that few care about and teaching one class a year in which only one student attends. In contrast Uriel heads the Department and is insanely popular with the student body and the community at large. Eliezer's problem with his son is that he deems his research as bogusthat he's only interested in providing modern interpretations of serious Talmudic passages familial relations in ancient times is one research area that Uriel has garnered accolades for which his father regards as a joke.There's much more about Eliezer that comes to light that places him firmly in the camp of the confirmed curmudgeon. His grand claim to fame is that he's mentioned in a footnote in the work of a famed Talmudic scholar Feinberg who Eliezer regards as his mentor. Eliezer also spent years interpreting more recent texts to reconstruct a lost manuscript from the Middle Ages. When a rival scholar Grossman found the original manuscript he refused to share it with Eliezer and published his own findings thus extirpating years of Eliezer's work now deemed irrelevant by the Talmudic academic community. All this has made the curmudgeon bitter magnified of course by the community's acclaim for the ever popular son. Nonetheless the humor stems from Eliezer's perseverance in the face of total ostracism despite his complete lack of social skills and meanspirited demeanor.If Eliezer's narcissism is a tad bit psychotic Uriel's can best be described as a lesser neuroticism. His colleagues at the University make it clear while talking amongst themselves that Uriel needs constant stroking and any kind of dissent will result in retaliation on his part. Nonetheless Uriel shows depth of character in the film's defining moment. That occurs when the prestigious 'Israel Prize' is awarded to Eliezer instead of Uriel due to a clerical error. In a very amusing scene a committee at the Ministry of Education meets in an extremely small file room with Uriel in order to maintain secrecy explain their 'mistake' and request that he inform his father of what has transpired.Despite all of the Eliezer's jealousy and contempt for his son Uriel defends the father in front of Grossman who is head of the Prize committee and who insists that the award must be rescinded and given to the true intended recipient Uriel. Things get so heated that Uriel punches Grossman in the nose but then apologizes. Eventually Grossman caves in but with two demands Uriel must write the judge's considerations and never accept the award for himself ever again.The emerging scenes are perhaps the best in the film. While writing the judge's considerations Uriel keeps amending his text and upon further reflection realizes Grossman was right about his father all alongthat he really is a mediocrity and doesn't deserve the prize. Eliezer who regards himself as a philologist ironically shows his mettle by realizing utilizing his text investigatory skills that Uriel was responsible for composing the 'judge's considerations'. Eliezer finally recalls the original conversation in its entirety where he believed he had been awarded the Israel Prize with his memory clearer he finally figures it out the prize was obviously intended for Uriel and not him!While Cedar utilizes a comic tone for most of the film the denouement unfortunately veers toward melodrama in the closing sequences. This can be seen when Uriel grows sour on the idea that he's been cheated out of the Israel Prize and takes it out on his teenage son who he demands to make something of his life. Cedar does nothing to develop the teenage son's character and Uriel's sudden transformation into a sour puss just like this father does much to ruin the clever humor of the earlier scenes.While Eliezer wasn't much of a likable character to begin with you could at least laugh at him for most of the film. But when he realizes through his true philological talents that the Israel Prize was not meant for him he's poised to accept the Award as a last petty spiteful act toward his son. What we needed there was some kind of twist. Perhaps either Eliezer's underutilized wife could have stepped in or both the wives could have come up with some kind of plan to 'save the day'. The way it stands now Eliezer's 'victory' is a Pyrrhic one and the estrangement between the father and son is worse than when we saw them at the beginning of the film.Despite the heavyhanded ending I enjoyed 'Footnote'. It not only ridicules the pettiness found in academia but goes deeper by exposing the narcissism in familial relations. The conflict between Talmudic scholars is not an easy topic to be made into a fulllength film. Cedar has for a good part of his film delivered a most clever and eyepopping experience.".

However Uriel soon gets a phone call that will shake things up even more.Unfortunately Footnote does not deliver a satisfying conclusion at least not a memorable one. The tension is slowly built up really well as the film cuts deeper into the plot yet when the time comes for a huge clash the film ends up kinds of just floating around not knowing the right time to fade out.

It's just that I do not believe that this will happen and of course I wish to be wrong and I also believe that out of the four Israeli films that made it in the final selection of the category in the last five years Footnore is maybe the one that deserves less as it is simply not as good as the previous three including director Joseph Cedar's own Beaufort.Just to make clear Footnote is not a bad film and it has its moments of real beauty. Many of these turn around the letters of the Hebrew alphabet the words and their meanings the buildings block of the language and of the Jewish wisdom and of the sacred text of the Bible. This is probably one of the elements that fascinated the jury of the Academia and made them decide to shortlist the film and include it in the prestigious final selection for the Oscar prize. The film is before all the story of the dramatic relationship between a father and a son who are unable to communicate in and within the terms of real life but they do communicate and understand each other in codes of words. As with the famous or infamous Bible codes stories the letters and words of the Hebrew language hide a story hidden beyond the first layer of perception available to us the other mortals. But even if we set aside the element of exoticism that is not that striking for the Israeli or Hebrew knowledgeable viewer we are still left with the exquisite acting of the two lead characters Shlomo BarAba and Lior Ashkenazi with strong supporting roles from Aliza Rosen and Micah Lewensohn and with a mix of styles which is sometimes daring like the description of the career of the son using techniques of 'professional' publicity juxtaposed to the restrained way of presenting the work of the father in the style of commentaries on text. It is in the conflict between the world of ideas and the material world in the lack of acceptance and integration of the character of the father with the universe dominated by the obsession of the security showing respect not for the essence but to the superficial ceremonies it is here that lies much of the ideology that motivates the story in the film.Yet at the end I also felt a feeling of dissatisfaction. Part resulted maybe not directly from the film itself but my own experience of living in Israel where religious studies are not and exotic element but one of the key pillars at the foundation of the social and cultural life. There is much to be told about this world which is full of wonders and miracles but also of cheating and demagogy. Cedar's film left me with the feeling that while trying to approach the problematic aspects of this field of life refused to take any position or insert a critical comment beyond the sin face. Then the openness and the lifelike ambiguity which in many other films works wonderfully is taken here in my opinion one or several steps too far. We never know whether the research of the father had any real value we are left in the dark with the roots of the conflict between the father and the head of the prize Israel jury and a character like the wife and mother could have been better developed. The strong story of the relation between the son and the father and the son's sacrifice which here goes in different direction than usual remains suspended.

	schema:reviewBody "FOOTNOTE is an appropriately titled sparklingly intelligent and entertaining film written and directed by Joseph Cedar. With a small cast and a focused story this little film form Israel is not only a pleasure to watch as a story performed as shared by brilliant actors but it is also one of the most visually artistic and creative venture of cinematography to be on the small screen in a long time the genius cinematographer is Yaron Scharf. Add to this a musical score that enhances every moment of the story  courtesy of composer Amit Poznansky  and the film simply succeeds on every level.In a most ingenious way we are introduced to the two main characters  father and son both professors in the Talmud department of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The film opens on the confused and somewhat unattached facial expression of the seated father Eliezer Shkolnik Shlomo Bar Aba as he listens to his ebullient son Uriel Shkolnik Lior Ashkenazi being inducted into the prestigious Israeli academic union. Uriel's acceptance speech reflects his childhood when his father informed him upon questioning that he was a 'teacher'  an occupation the young Uriel found embarrassing at the time but now honors his father for this guidance. After the ceremony we slowly discover that there is a longstanding rivalry between father and son. Uriel has an addictive dependency on the embrace and accolades that the establishment provides while Eliezer is a stubborn purist with a fear and profound revulsion for what the establishment stands for yet beneath his contempt lies a desperate thirst for some kind of recognition his only clam to fame after long years of intensive research is that the man who published his findings mentions Eliezer in a footnote. When it comes times for the Israel Prize Israel's most prestigious national award to be awarded a clerical error results in a telephone call informing Eliezer that he has won while in reality the award was meant for his son Uriel. How this error is resolved open all manner of windows for examining family relationships fame pure academia and forgiveness.The film is an unqualified success. Lior Ashkenazi so well remembered from 'Walk on Water' and 'Late Marriage' among others gives a bravura performance and that of Shlomo Ben Aba balances it in quality. The supporting cast is strong. Joseph Cedar has produced a fine film very much enhanced by the brilliance of the cinematography that tells the story as much as the dialogue. Grady Harp".

The film opens on the confused and somewhat unattached facial expression of the seated father Eliezer Shkolnik Shlomo Bar Aba as he listens to his ebullient son Uriel Shkolnik Lior Ashkenazi being inducted into the prestigious Israeli academic union. Uriel's acceptance speech reflects his childhood when his father informed him upon questioning that he was a 'teacher'  an occupation the young Uriel found embarrassing at the time but now honors his father for this guidance. After the ceremony we slowly discover that there is a longstanding rivalry between father and son. Uriel has an addictive dependency on the embrace and accolades that the establishment provides while Eliezer is a stubborn purist with a fear and profound revulsion for what the establishment stands for yet beneath his contempt lies a desperate thirst for some kind of recognition his only clam to fame after long years of intensive research is that the man who published his findings mentions Eliezer in a footnote. When it comes times for the Israel Prize Israel's most prestigious national award to be awarded a clerical error results in a telephone call informing Eliezer that he has won while in reality the award was meant for his son Uriel. How this error is resolved open all manner of windows for examining family relationships fame pure academia and forgiveness.The film is an unqualified success. Lior Ashkenazi so well remembered from 'Walk on Water' and 'Late Marriage' among others gives a bravura performance and that of Shlomo Ben Aba balances it in quality. The supporting cast is strong. Joseph Cedar has produced a fine film very much enhanced by the brilliance of the cinematography that tells the story as much as the dialogue. Grady Harp";

That makes it all the more satisfying to see Joseph Cedar's Hearat Shulayim Footnote in English. The movie focuses on a father and son both of whom are professors at the Talmudic Research department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Despite the father's extensive studies the Israel Prize committee refuses to recognize his work while the son has garnered a lot of respect. One day the father receives a call announcing that he's winning the prize. There's just one problem the committee meant to call the son.The movie makes sure to avoid tabloidstyle situations. It takes a serious approach to the situation. Probably the most effective scene is when the son meets the Israel Prize committee in a cramped office and reminds them of the hypocrisy of their decision to deny his father the prize. Nonetheless the tension between father and son remains. In the end it's a really good movie. I haven't seen many Israeli movies but now I would like to.".

	schema:reviewBody " www.Ramascreen.com FOOTNOTE is an Israeli film that's Oscarnominated this year for Foreign language category and I can see why it received the nod. It's quite possibly one of the funniest rivalry stories I've ever watched and what makes the dilemma even more complicated is that it's between father and son. I think it's a wellmade film it's funny it has its charms you'll enjoy writerdirector Joseph Cedar's way of telling you the backstories of each character some of the scenes interestingly move like microform reel those of us who didn't grow up knowing anything about Talmud or Jewish culture would get a slight education on one of some of the things they regard highly over there but halfway through the film it loses its attraction it doesn't engage you enough and ultimately it ends itself in somewhat of a tactless mannerEliezer is the father and Uriel is the son and they both share the same last name and that's where the misunderstanding plays its card. Both individuals dabble in the same literature but the father is oldschool and stubborn and even though the film doesn't come out and say it he may also suffer from some kind of autism or something that keeps him from desiring any social contact unless it's meant to celebrate him or perhaps he's just introverted to the extreme. The son is more progressive people are fond of him and he enjoys the success that his father has always wishes he had. So when a certain prestigious award mistakes one for the other Uriel is faced with the dilemma of what is the right thing to do. After he makes his decision his father goes off and discredits his son's work. It's a pretty sad and tough family dynamics if you think about it because on the father's case it's envy that turns into bitterness that turns into gloat on the son's side it's wanting to live up to his father that turns into generosity that turns into feelings betrayed. Writerdirector Cedar designs it so that things would escalate to the point where there is no other option but to openly confront each other although oddly enough the film never gives us that luxury.The comedy aspect of it is very enjoyable Cedar takes us through awkward room sizes and you'll get the giggles from watching Elizer putting on his giant headset shutting everything around him down just to get some silence and for the old professors roles Cedar casts actors who look just like the stereotype they look unintentionally amusing. Embedded in the competition is also a the theme of whether or not you are your father's son or if you are your own person. Uriel seems distraught and offended when his own son doesn't make any effort to win his love like he used to do with his own father. Both Eliezer and Uriel are obsessed with the idea that success can only be found in one's achievements and accomplishments and the recognition from your peers and how one can be better at that than everybody else so much so that they're missing out one what's truly important each other. I think FOOTNOTE is a very unique family dynamics film that deserves attention at the very least. www.Ramascreen.com ".

Footnote is listed as a comedy however I found it to weigh more toward the dramatic side with a peppering of comedy that is well done and not overly utilized. The story is about a father and son who are prominent Talmudic scholars in Israel and who are competitive in the academic world where they both work. Shlomo BarAba plays Eluezer Shkolnik the older of the two and his performance is filled with struggle and empathy that pervades the film. The son is played by Lior Ashkenazi and he too provides a convincing portrayal as well. The family relationships are weighed heavily and transcend the entire movie which takes place in Academia. The film is rich in tradition and the music complements it with great synchrony. The ending is abrupt and it encourages some extra time thinking about the content. However it also induces satisfaction in knowing that the cultural display of relationships and social intercourse are well documented on the screen. Some of the film dealing with comedy is not a belly splitter but it is way of lightening the mood and noted to be a well recognized mechanism of writing even in Shakespeare's writings. Although the relationship of the father and son is a strained one throughout the film it also is a transcultural one that exudes with emotion and intellectual curiosity. This film is well worth a trip to the cinema or one can just wait for the Blu Ray DVD to be available.".

He looks at the at the rest of his colleagues with an insufferable air of intellectual superiority and believes he hasn't been recognized to the extent that he deserves yet the movie hints he is a bit of a fraud himself his main claim to fame is having been thanked in a footnote in a book by a famous Talmudic authority. The more successful Uriel Lior Ashkenazi who usually plays young macho men but here plays a middle aged academic against type is the son. The film lampoons Uriel for being a lightweight scholar and for being too attracted to the media spotlight yet he seems to be the more psychologically rounded of the two. The tense relationship between father and son finally comes to a bitter confrontation when the elder Shkolnik is mistakenly awarded an important academic prize that was meant for the son I'm not going to reveal anything else about the plot.I'm also obviously not going to reveal the ending but it seems underwhelming and unrealized as if the director Joseph Cedar didn't knew how to end the movie. Thus what was a fine film until then ends in a curiously unsatisfying way. Nevertheless this is a fine movie with many great scenes. I especially liked two scenes one is set in a small but tightly packed conference room and ends when one academic shoves another to the wall. In the second scene a very pretty female journalist goes to the home of the elder Shkolnik to interview him and manages to get him to say very nasty things about his son.".

	schema:reviewBody "He'arat Shulayim Footnote is an Israeli 2012 Oscar contender a 2012 Cannes screenplay award winner and altogether a very highly praised movie. It tells a story about Eliezer and Uriel Shkolnik a father and son both Talmud scholars but with different amounts of public recognition. Eliezer devoted all of his life to comparing different versions of the Talmud but never published anything since his colleague beat him to it leaving as his greatest achievement a footnote in his mentor's book. On the other hand his son Uriel wrote a lot of books on all kind of subjects and got praise for all of them. As a matter of fact the movie opens with Uriel getting accepted to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities the honor which his father never got and it's immediately clear that Eliezer doesn't take it well. The plot thickens when Eliezer finds out he won the Israel Prize the most prestigious national award after 16 consecutive failed nominations and Uriel learns that it is he who should get it and his father got notified by mistake.The profession of the characters could really be anything it isn't of much relevance. What the film talks about is how easily people get infatuated with greed jealousy and the imagined importance of their work. It also talks about the fatherson relationship not just through the example of Eliezer and Uriel but Uriel and his son Josh too. It shows the difference between generations but also the inevitability of our family ties. It is all well displayed in the behavior of Uriel. He tries to be a better father than his own but still makes some of the same mistakes. He also tries to help his father despite of the contempt Eliezer shows for his work but can't help being angered by it.The movie is very precise in depicting how an academic community functions. It is all about prestige. Who will publish something first or who's work will be cited in a footnote. It is unbelievable but true what would people do just to get their name mentioned or written somewhere. A colleague of mine told me today It's all about immortality.. But what does that really mean? A hundred years from now someone will be reading something and my name will be there. So what? Neither of us gets anything from that. But let's get back to the movie. In the beginning you sympathize with Eliezer. He has been working hard for years and just because someone got lucky it turns out it has all been in vain. But as the movie goes on we learn that he's no better than everybody else. He just wants the spotlights on him. In the end it's even suggested he realized that the award shouldn't go to him but he accepts it anyway. It isn't shown explicitly because the movie ends just before winners get on the stage but I can hardly imagine any other outcome. And because of that we wound up feeling sorry for Uriel who won't get the deserved award and can't even get nominated ever again part of the deal with the president of the committee because of his selfish father.The acting is very good. Shlomo BarAba in the role of the father and Lior Ashkenazi in the role of the son give subdued but impressive performances. Cinematographer Yaron Scharf did a good job showing libraries and houses crowded with books emphasizing in that way the absurdity of wanting for your name to be mentioned just to be lost in a heap of others. Probably the best part of the movie is editing done by Einat GlaserZarhin. In the first part of the movie narrator lists things we should now about Eliezer and Uriel and it's a joy watching those sequences. The movie balances between serious drama and a little less serious comedy and is greatly helped in it by Amit Poznansky's amusing soundtrack. He often uses tense music to create a comedic moment at the same time keeping us aware of the seriousness of the whole situation. The only thing that got me disappointed was the most lauded one screenplay. While it has some great moments like the one in which a numerous committee holds a meeting in the tiniest of rooms it feels stretched and unpolished in places which decreases the overall impression.There's one more thing. The movie talks about many things. Greed excellence compassion jealousy revenge dedication fear happiness and more. But I just can't figure out what's the point. What did the author Joseph Cedar want to say with it. Just to be clear this isn't one of those movies where people are wondering what is it all about. It's all very clear it just doesn't feel like Cedar had a point to make. Maybe he just wanted to show how the things are functioning without drawing any conclusions. If so I would find a documentary a better way to show it. If not...I don't know. Maybe I'm just too demanding. It's best you see it and decide for yourselves.More reviews at httponlineimpressions.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Eliezer Shkolnik is seated at a ceremony honoring his son Uriel Shkolnik's admission to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities an honor that has never been accorded to him. He appears uncomfortable barely forcing himself to rise to his feet in perfunctory applause before quickly sitting down. Hence begins Footnote the brilliant Israeli 2011 Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film. Both Shkolniks are Talmudic researchers at Hebrew University in Jerusalem but that is where the similarity ends. Eliezer is an obstinate traditionalist and loner who rejects new ideas and the establishment that embraces them. As a result he is relegated to obscurity by his colleagues who deny him any recognition beyond the dusty footnote he received in the book of an old revered scholar. Uriel on the other hand is popular and adopts the changes his father despises. One day Eliezer receives a phone call informing him that he is the recipient of the Israel Prize. What he doesn't know is that the call is a mistake. It is his son Uriel who is the intended recipient. The roles of father and son are beautifully played by Shlomo BarAba and Lior Ashkenazi respectively. Micah Lewensohn is excellent in a supporting role as a rival of Eliezer's who refuses to relent in his dislike of his old academic adversary. The screenplay by director Joseph Cedar was inspired by a real life incident in which he received a phone call notifying him of an award he suspected was really intended for his father. Anyone interested in something fresh at the movies should find this film compelling and thought provoking. Footnote asks us how much does a father owe a son and vice versa. It also asks us to think about the different ways we have of arriving at the truth and how much we're willing to sacrifice for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though Joseph Cedar's Footnote is a look at the Israeli academic community's insularity and hubris the problems it raises are universal and the film could most likely take place anywhere in the world. One of five nominated films at this year's Oscars in the Best Foreign Film category Footnote allows us to take a peak behind the hallowed walls of academia and it is not a pretty sight. With its exposure of political maneuvering egotism ambition and tightly controlled orthodoxy the film makes clear its point of view that professors who are out of the mainstream are marginalized and passed over for recognition by their peers.The film centers on Eliezer Shkolnik Schlomo Bar Aba an aging Talmudic scholar and philologist who has become a bitter and aggrieved man after having been passed over for the prestigious Israel Prize for twenty years. Eliezer arrogantly denounces the selection committee for the Prize as people who have forgotten the meaning of true scholarship. He has spent his career researching corrupted Jewish texts that deviate from the original Talmud but whose only recognition has been a citation in a footnote.Ill at ease in the hallowed walls of academia and in relationships in general Eliezer sleeps in his office and only ventures out to go to the library. He continues to schedule classes even though as little as one or two people enroll. His relationship with his wife Yehudit Alisa Rosen appears strained and distant and when he is at home he blocks out the world by putting on gigantic yellow earphones. His behavior is contrasted with that of his more sociable and outgoing son the bearded Uriel Lior Ashkenazi who is also a Talmudic scholar but one whose work is more attuned to popular tastes. His father unfortunately is generally disdainful calling him a folklorist and a scholar subservient to the prevailing academic status quo.The film opens with Eliezer sitting in an auditorium with a dour and rigid look on his face as Uriel is being inducted into a scholarly academy an honor which the father has never received. Despite the downbeat beginning the first part of the film is fairly lighthearted with Cedar entertaining us with intertitles describing the background of the characters and Amelielike cutesy cinematic tricks bouncily scored by Amit Poznansky. Halfway through however the film takes a more dramatic turn when Eliezer learns that he has finally won the Israel Prize after waiting for twenty years an event that threatens the resentment he clings to so obsessively.Unfortunately a ridiculous fauxpas by the Nominating Committee only serves to place more obstacles in the fatherson relationship. It is unfortunately not an easily correctable mistake but a true ethical dilemma and one that precipitates a confrontation between Uriel and the academic committee in a tiny room an absurd scenario that would be funny if it did not have so many potential disastrous ramifications. The brunt of Uriel's attack is directed towards Yehuda Grossman Michah Lewesohn a scholar who has either rejected or ignored his father's work and whose publication of his own Talmudic discovery undermined all the meticulous research Eliezer had been doing for years. In the film's most dramatic sequence the confrontation escalates into highly articulated personal attacks ultimatums and even a bit of physical violence.While Uriel is defending his father at the committee meeting Eliezer is doing the opposite criticizing his son during an interview lumping him in with those whose Talmudic studies he considers to be shallow and superficial. Needless to say this even further exacerbates their troubled relationship. Footnote is an engaging film marked by exceptional performances by Lewesohn Ashkenazi and Bar Aba and you can enjoy it whether or not you care very much whether or not the current version of the Talmud correctly reflects the original ancient texts. The depiction of Eliezer however is onedimensional and the father's incessant selfrighteousness turns the film into a sour and mostly unpleasant affair. In addition to its depressing tone numerous plot points are introduced and then dropped without further comment.Eliezer is seen talking to another woman a sequence that leads to a bedroom discussion of the event between Uriel and his wife Dikla Alma Zack but soon morphs into an argument its purpose obscure. Also in another thread that goes nowhere except to add to the general unpleasantness Uriel's son Josh Daniel Markovich goes on a hiking trip and comes home having to confront his father's anger at his ostensible lack of ambition or goals. Although the film's loose ends are particularly annoying we are caught up in its very compelling scenario. Cedar knows how to build up the tension and we eagerly await some sort of resolution but as is the trend of late the director feels that his film is more valuable as a gigantic setup than as a satisfying resolution and the result is a film that leaves us thinking that the projectionist inadvertently cut out the best part of the movie.".

In my opinion there is nothing special about it really but that of course does not make this a bad movie to watch as well.It's simply an enjoyable and light little movie that doesn't ever get too heavy handed even though it could had easily gone that way. And I thank the movie for that but at the same time it's also giving too little in return. The movie is taking a more comedy approach to its buildup but with as a problem that there isn't really any true comedy in this movie. It sort of reminded me of a Wes Anderson movie. They are supposed to be comical movies without anything comical ever happening in it really. It's just not my favorite style of filmmaking but I know I'm probably a minority on this so to most people this won't be a complaint at all.It's a movie with a good enough story that ensures that the movie keeps going at all time.

	schema:headline " Strong drama over not terribly important Academic research in Israel";
	schema:reviewBody "FOOTNOTES 2012 Hearat Shulayim was the opening film of the Budapest Israeli film week on Dec. 1 2016 A tale of father and son as Talmudic rivals. Director Joseph Cedar. 103 minutes. Stars Lior Ashkenazi and Shlomo BarAba. This unusual subject matter about academic bickering over obscure Talmudic research was an indication that things to come might be contrary to expectation. The film extremely talky and overloaded with extreme facial closeups was all about a batty old scholar Eliezer Shkolnik who has spent his life making notes on the Talmud  and is basically out of it to the point that he doesn't even understand what security guards are for at checkpoints and is a candidate for a major national prize. Hieever this highly prestigious award is mistakenly given to his handsome charismatic but more superficial professor son Uriel who has certain guilt feelings about the misaccreditation and struggles to set things right against the stonewalling opposition of the awards committee. The bulk of the picture is taken up with internal academic bickering over whether or not Papa should ultimately be recognized or not. Basically what we get is dramatically charged father and son rivalry tale cum inquiry into academic chicanery. The primarily HungarianJewish audience was enthralled but to me it was a shrill shaggy dog story basically the making of a mountain out of a molehill. Aren't there more important things to worry about in Israel than who should get the credit for marginal notations on the Talmud?. The father was played by Shlomo BarAbba 66 and the son by Lior Askenazi 43 both well known Israeli actors.Roger Ebert in one of his last reviews focusing on the father son relationship gave this film a rave review mentioning that it was to be seen as a comedy. I personally saw nothing comic in it at all and while somewhat impressed by certain scenes was not quite as swept away as Roger. To me it was too much of a talkathon with too many extreme facial closeups. Nevertheless interesting for the portrayal of internal academic politics and backbiting which is not a topic often addressed in the current cinema. PLOT Talmud scholar Eliezer Shkolnik Shlomo BarAba has worked in obscurity for years at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. In contrast Eliezer's son Uriel Lior Ashkenazi also an academic has published many books received numerous accolades and is something of a social celebrity. Eliezer looks down on his son's achievements and pursuit of fame and so the pair have a rocky relationship. Their rivalry comes to a head when Eliezer receives word that at long last he is to be the recipient of the prestigious Israeli Prize. Yes in the end Dad will get the prize but not everybody is happy about it.image3.jpeg".

He toiled in his work alone. His class has one student. His most noteworthy accomplishment is a footnote in an important textbook. The father and son relationship has traveled a long and problematic road. Eliezer covets the Israel Prize above all else and one day he gets a calls from the Minister of Education congratulating him. It is big news and then Uriel is told by the Ministry that the call was a mistake and he is the real winner. The head of the committee Grossman is an old foe of Eliezer.This movie takes a small world and shows how the people in it treat this world as life and death. The opening sequence with Eliezer and the security guard is very compelling. Eliezer is a quietly bitter old man and that scene sets it all up. The problem is that he's not that charismatic as a character. Urien's struggles are more compelling. It's an intriguing premise but I don't find Eliezer lovable enough.".

	schema:headline " An interesting if insular look at a fatherson rivalry";
	schema:reviewBody "FOOTNOTE is the second Israeli film I've seen and while it felt rather insular in the cultural sense it did explore some interesting themes and had a great sense of humor. The story is about a father and son both professors of Talmudic literature. The father has largely been forgotten his only significant achievement being a mention in a footnote in someone else's book while his son is more celebrated. However the dynamic between them changes when the father is selected errantly to receive the prestigious Israel Prize for his life's work. One thing the film does really well is explore the sometimes contentious relationship between parent and child. Eliezer father and Uriel son Shkolnik both have the same profession yet the son's success in light of the father's failure certainly must have weighed heavily on both of their consciences. And when Eliezer is mistakenly nominated to receive the Israel Prize his son comes to his defense since it would vindicate the decades of work for which he had previously gone unrecognized. There was also the subtle element of comedy and selfdeprecating humor that seems to be part and parcel of the Jewish experience. It wasn't exactly laughoutloud hilarious but there was some excellent situational humor as well as some ribbing on cutthroat competition in academia. Still given the subject material it was a little hard for me to get into the film completely. The single element which I did connect with was the idea that a parent at some point might give up on their child as I have had similar fears in the past. The film also had a somewhat unsatisfying ending although it probably didn't have to show everything in order to be effective. The film was subversive enough without seeing what you know is coming. If there's one actual complaint I have it's that the score was a little overpowering at times. Sometimes more is less. Overall the subject of academia is something that's a little too inside baseball particularly when it's about the Talmud I'm not a Jew but FOOTNOTE has some interesting themes that allow you a way into this story about a fatherson rivalry.".

An excellent reflection of families and societal intricacies.The viewer quickly develops sympathy towards the eccentric old professor Shkolnik because life treats him unfair. Thirty years of painstaking research and no prize to show for it. He's outperformed by his much acclaimed sociable son who's also a professor in Talmud studies. Then miraculously the father receives a phone call informing him he's won a national academic prize! But there's a mix up the prize is intended for his son...The director lets the viewer guess about the reason why  a reflection on miscommunication which both characters study? After playing squash the son finds his sports bag including his mobile phone missing. Later it is hastily mentioned he could not be reached so the assistant probably mixed up phone numbers. Was the bag taken on purpose? The prize committee offers a little clue the publication in the newspaper is in rather odd wording... An outsider has leaked it to the press. Could this assistant be the gray haired lady who seems to play a pivotal role?The only occasion the old professor steps outside of his autistic character is when he's in the garden with her. Accentuating the fact when people are treated with respect they behave normal. A stark contrast to his own family whom's interaction is poisoned by his bitterness for being overlooked all these years. Even his corpselike wife defrosts slightly when she learns of the prize and for once crawls into bed with him. Emphasizing the importance people attach to prestige.The director touches on a taboo the father's envy and rivalry for his son's achievements. In his greed for academic recognition he cheats on his own integrity which he claims to hold in the highest esteem. He publicly humiliates his son in an interview proving he is the better scientist of them and does so again in private when he discovers the letter of recommendation was written by his son.But the son is empathetic and loyal towards him honor thy father. He let's prize pass him by. To take the prize away from him would kill him he says. He even thinks his father is 'courageous' for having an extra marital affair with the mysterious lady risking his whole reputation. Although if the father was truly courageous he would reject the prize. And how cowardly can the son be if he stood up to chairman Grossman the name! risking his own career and reputation?However the condemnation by the father for the son is something both are guilty of because the younger professor treats his own son with disdain when he aggressively pushes him to choose an education before he can only loathe him like his own father loathes him. In a hysterical 'backroom lobby'situation the marionette members of the esteemed prize committee are crammed together in a tiny office and everyone has to stand up to get the door closed. But when the chairman leaves the door magically has enough space to open. Indicating that whatever the chairman wants he gets. Prestige will only befall those whom he likes. Sound painstaking research is surpassed over favoritism. Is the mysterious lady the reason the chairman holds a grudge against the old professor?At the ceremony we see the son looking down at her. The significance is not clear to me. Has the son involved this woman in a conspiracy to get esteem for his father so he can look up to him? After all he did mention he was unable to admire his father's profession as a mere teacher. Or does he see her as the mistaken hallmark of courage?Well depicted symbolism old professor Shkolnik walks down a white hallway towards the light finally going to heaven! at the prize ceremony. But the peristaltic shape resembles the inside of an intestine inside dirty world of the elite. He's given instructions sit here stand up shake hands etc. The university institution as a dirty beast where one gets rewarded if one kisses behinds and does as one is told. But if you stay true to your own wayward principles your accomplishments are ignored or at best you might be mentioned in a footnote.The prize is a trap for the ego a travesty to integrity complete with smoke screens and 'commedia dell'arte'actors. The old professor realizes this as he stands in line to receive the prize. The enlightenment he hoped to receive is a farce and thus in the very last screen shot blue light shines on his face.The film contains an abundance of symbolism but you might need a second viewing to catch it all.".

But if you stay true to your own wayward principles your accomplishments are ignored or at best you might be mentioned in a footnote.The prize is a trap for the ego a travesty to integrity complete with smoke screens and 'commedia dell'arte'actors. The old professor realizes this as he stands in line to receive the prize. The enlightenment he hoped to receive is a farce and thus in the very last screen shot blue light shines on his face.The film contains an abundance of symbolism but you might need a second viewing to catch it all.";

And that tells a lot about this movie.It is so sad that the movie is so very shallow because by looking at the picture it is obvious that there were many talented and ambitious people involved.That it not to say that the movie is bad. In fact you will probably have a good time at the cinema and leave it very amused. There are some fresh jokes very good actors and an incredible production design that gets the sixties right by not making it too glamorous although it sometimes looks a little too polished.Unfortunately the plot does not have anything to do with the Munich sex film industry at all as the tagline and the production material would like you to think. And this is where the movie gets disappointing. Instead of really dealing with this industry which would probably make for a very funny movie in itself the film follows a bunch of losers who would like to make a movie LIKE the Munich sex film industry. Neue Constantin Film has done a lot of these movies as well in that time so there should be a lot of material in the archives that could have been used for reference but instead after the compilation scene mentioned earlier the movie does not have anything to do with that business at all.There was just so much potential here and instead of using it the producers went for the easiest route which makes this film ultimately shallow and irrelevant.I want to point out two things that I found especially distracting and disappointing.a Mousse T. has been hyped as having delivered his first movie soundtrack here. His music is actually quite good a very enjoyable soundtrack. BUT it is completely wrong for this movie. While the beats seem to be reminiscent of the sixties it is not at all reminiscent of any German music of the time. Sure people listened to soul and music like that but for a movie like this it would have been more appropriate to remix some of the typical music found in German movies of the time. I guess that choice would have seemed too risky for the producers.The soundtrack choice is a typical example of this movie that makes fun of the sixties from our point of view with an attitude that seems to say Aren't we so much more advanced today? There is also a scene in which a naked woman walks across the room with a ridiculous amount of pubic hair. Instead of letting the comedy come out of the fact that the scene is witnessed by a young guy who has never experienced sexual freedom the movie chooses to make fun of the fact that women did not shave their pubic hair at the time. A movie like Sonnenallee made fun of life in the German Democratic Republic of the seventies by showing its oddities but it never showed modern audiences as more advanced or superior. this movie chooses this point of view which somehow leaves a bad aftertaste.b This is a typical movie where in the end the plot is completely pushed aside to make way for the relationship of the protagonists. I don't spoil too much by saying that this movie has the typical ending where one character has to declare his love to the other in front of a large group. And as if this isn't enough he has to do it TWICE in front of two different groups until the other person finally gives in. If you had your eyes rolling at the clich the first time around you will stark shaking your head at the second time.But I am making the movie sound worse than it actually is. In fact apart from the ending nothing about this movie is really bad it is just never as good as it could have been. It is fun while it lasts if you don't think too much about it. I was especially surprised by Benno Frmann who often seems to act a little wooden but comes across well here as goodfornothing Freddie. But I bet that you will forget the movie shortly after you walk out of the cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only reason I am giving this '80's hormone comedy romp a five is because it didn't take itself seriously just aiming for an occasional laugh. I mean how can you take a film with Eddie Deezen in it seriously? The film centers on a spineless wimp played well by Peter Scolari who is offered the job of managing a motel owned by Christopher Lee  who plays Scolari's prospective fatherinlaw. He and his girlfriend Colleen Camp venture down to Florida to take charge of the place not knowing that Lee has set Scolari up for failure. He has already planned to torch the motel to collect insurance money while devising a cunning plan to make Scolari look the loser that he is so his daughter won't marry him. Laughs come occasionally but not nearly as often as the bare breasts shots. Comedies of the 80's had one thing going for them and that was the endless supply of nakedness.VIOLENCE  This isn't an action film so you shouldn't go into it expecting to see any violence or bloodshed. However the man who Christopher Lee hires to torch the motel has constant runins with fire and bombs.NUDITY  On parade here! Evil Toon's Monique Gabrielle sheds her clothes on several occasions as well as the other nameless actresses who play the bellhophookers. Believe when I type this it is all gratuitous. There is a scene with a fused out Vietnam veteran not played by Bruce Dern surprise  who conducts a formation of nude women armed to the hilt with weapons. Colleen Camp manages to keep her clothes on so all of you folks who drooled over her in Clue  sorry she teases us again here.STORY  Nothing great. Colleen Camp seems to run the motel but makes Scolari feel like he is calling the shots. I wondered why she was with such a useless guy since she is the daughter of a welltodo Christopher Lee. The pairing made little sense in this film. The main premise of the film is to see if Scolari can win over Lee before the motel is torched. Needless to say the plot is threadbare but still moderately enjoyable.ACTING  The acting here isn't that good. Deezen and Fran Drescher have their fanbases but I don't see why anyone would want to watch them act. They can't help but be annoying. Scolari and Camp do alright with their roles but Christopher Lee is wasted. The story centers around Scolari and Camp and doesn't flesh out Dracula  or Mr. Lee. The two original bellhops offer a few laughs as the two guys try every maneuver in the book to score with the hookerbellhops. However as a whole the acting was slightly below average for the genre.".

Evil Toon's Monique Gabrielle sheds her clothes on several occasions as well as the other nameless actresses who play the bellhophookers. Believe when I type this it is all gratuitous. There is a scene with a fused out Vietnam veteran not played by Bruce Dern surprise  who conducts a formation of nude women armed to the hilt with weapons. Colleen Camp manages to keep her clothes on so all of you folks who drooled over her in Clue  sorry she teases us again here.STORY  Nothing great. Colleen Camp seems to run the motel but makes Scolari feel like he is calling the shots. I wondered why she was with such a useless guy since she is the daughter of a welltodo Christopher Lee. The pairing made little sense in this film. The main premise of the film is to see if Scolari can win over Lee before the motel is torched. Needless to say the plot is threadbare but still moderately enjoyable.ACTING  The acting here isn't that good. Deezen and Fran Drescher have their fanbases but I don't see why anyone would want to watch them act. They can't help but be annoying. Scolari and Camp do alright with their roles but Christopher Lee is wasted. The story centers around Scolari and Camp and doesn't flesh out Dracula  or Mr. Lee. The two original bellhops offer a few laughs as the two guys try every maneuver in the book to score with the hookerbellhops. However as a whole the acting was slightly below average for the genre.";

But as the narration points out the important things are not what makes us different from people like cannibal Oliver Hartwin but what makes us the same.As Hartwin Thomas Kretschmann does a great job in a role that can be described in a mastery of understatement as difficult. He plays a man who fantasizes about eating human flesh. He finds the yin to his yang in Simon Groembeck Thomas Huber equally superb a man who's veritable truckload of I.S.S.U.E.S. see him abandoning his GQ model boyfriend to be eaten by a guy with a Herman Munster haircut and a predilection for beige. Go figure. They hook up over that great haven for all the demented and depraved  the Internet. Go team! Kerri Russell narrates the film in a somewhat unnecessary framing device. Quite frankly what I found most irritating about the film were the most over obvious attempts to sell it internationally  Russell is the known face but the majority of the cast is comprised of German actors. Why not film it in German? Why not drop Russell altogether and instead focus on the relationship between the two men? A relationship which is in its own way oddly affecting. For as the title implies...this is a love story.Well come on. How many movies does Hollywood churn out annually based on the central premise of a woman once upon a time Meg Ryan lately her minime Reese Witherspoon and a man preferably Hugh Jackman but Mark Ruffalo or one of the Wilson brothers in a pinch who are made for each other? When you really examine it this film is based around the same premise. These are two men who are in Russell's own words as she drably narrates a perfect match. Far too much screen time is given to Russell poking around Hartwin's farm house and looking generally freaked out at the expense of the developing of the relationship between two true oddballs. This is not monster and victim  these are two lonely men who have found each other and not nearly enough time is devoted to the why of it all.In it's look the film very much honors it's subject matter to great effect. It is shot mostly in muted tones yet avoids the trap similar films have fallen into  namely looking too dark and leaving the audience wondering if they need to turn the contrast on their TV up. Very much a 1970s horror movie feel. Clever tricks abound  we see a grisly horror film being enjoyed by Hartwin reflected on his eyeball in an extreme close up while in an earlier flashback the camera travels under the sheets to watch him reading under his bedclothes as a child. The running time is concise a mere hour and a half with the majority of the film's most difficult to watch scenes occurring in the final twenty minutes. There is the odd unexpected moment of black humor  yes you feel guilty for chuckling  while the bare bones script is stripped of exposition and all the better for it. On the whole it is a well made movie not what you'd call entertaining but a worthy watch none the less.".

	schema:reviewBody "Both this film and Marian Dora's Cannibal were inspired by the unbelievably inhuman yet reallife horror case of Armin The Rohtenburg Cannibal Meiwes. Meiwes was a lonely and introvert homosexual who placed an internet add looking for volunteers to get slaughtered and consumed by him. It didn't take that long before he got a response from Bernd Jrgen Brandes another homosexual who treasured a lifelong dream of having his penis chopped off and eaten. Like the script states at several occasions these two formed a perfect match. Even though both films remain faithful to the grueling and sickening facts they are two completely different viewing experiences. This film is more like a 'light' version of the facts but mind you still shocking enough to upset people with a weak stomach whereas Cannibal is a downright brutal and uncompromising film. Grimm Love supposedly takes place after the facts and the story is reenacted via the research and profiling of an American psychology student Keri Russell residing in Germany to work on her thesis. This wraparound story is actually rather redundant since Russell only appears on screen in order to link together all the flashbacks that build up towards the two men's fatal cannibalistic meeting. Unlike Cannibal this film dedicates a large amount of time digging up the men's backgrounds and illustrating their personalities. The voluntary victim Bernd Jrgen Brandes renamed Simon Grombeck forcefully hated the reproduction organ between his legs and apparently blamed himself for his mother's suicide because she once caught him and another boy playing doctor. Armin Meiwes renamed Oliver Hartwin had issues with his mother as well but she was more of a dominant and overly protective type. He developed cannibalistic tendencies after she died and eventually the endless opportunities of the almighty internet brought these wandering souls together. I find it praiseworthy that both films especially considering the gruesome themes succeed in clarifying to the audiences that this is in fact primarily an unusual love story rather than a gratuitous exploitation flick. It's a portrait of two men who're social outcasts due to their unacceptable sexual desires. This was even clearer in Cannibal since the two men shared all the screen time together as from the opening sequence but even Grimm Love successfully reflects the affectionate and deeper relationship between the two 'monsters'. However this movie suffers from a handful of dreadfully tedious moments and it sadly remains too vague about the disturbing things that happened after the castration. Meiwes stored Brandes' corpse on a meat hook in his basement and continued to eat his pal for several more months after the actual killing. This film only briefly mentions this little detail somewhere at the beginning. The cinematography is pleasingly dark and depressing and the slow pacing and grim setpieces contribute to the building up of an overall uncanny atmosphere as well. Martin Weisz' direction is subtly creepy and he clearly doesn't aim for sensationalism here. The German actors are very competent as well even though they are for some reason forced to speak their lines in hesitant English My main complaint regarding this production as stated by other reviewers already as well is the international character of the film. Why the involvement of a fictionalized American student character working on a psychology thesis? Why narrate the story through flashbacks for that matter? Russell's role is entirely redundant and her character isn't even plausible anyway. For someone who has been obsessed and fascinated with the case for more than 3 years she really sucks at watching graphic cannibalism on tape.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Martin Weisz and writer T.S. Faull created this movie adaptation ROHTENBURG GRIMM LOVE of a famous crime that is so bizarre it deserves a summary from the legal aspects in order to appreciate the quality of the film. Names have all been changed including the spelling of the title  'Rotenburg' or 'red castle' is the name of the small village where this grisly event took place. The facts of the case are as follows 'Armin Meiwes born 1 December 1961 is a German man who achieved international notoriety for killing and eating a voluntary victim whom he had found via the internet. After Meiwes and the victim jointly attempted to eat the victim's severed penis Meiwes killed his victim and proceeded to eat a large amount of his flesh. Because of his deeds Meiwes is also known as the Rotenburg Cannibal or Der Metzgermeister The Master Butcher. Looking for a willing victim Meiwes posted an advertisement at a website The Cannibal Cafe whose disclaimer mentions the distinction between reality and fantasy. Meiwes's post stated that he was looking for a well built 21 to 40yearold to be slaughtered and then consumed. Bernd Jrgen Brandes answered the advertisement. Many other people responded to the advertisement but backed out Meiwes did not attempt to force them to do anything against their will. As is known from a videotape the two made when they met on March 9 2001 in Meiwes's home in the small village of Rotenburg Meiwes amputated Brandes's penis and the two men attempted to eat the penis together before Brandes was killed. Brandes had insisted that Meiwes attempt to bite his penis off. This did not work though Meiwes was able to burst both of Brandes's testicles by biting them. Ultimately Meiwes used a knife to remove Brandes's penis. Brandes apparently tried to eat some of his own penis raw but could not because it was too tough and as he put it chewy. Meiwes then sauted the penis in a pan with salt pepper wine and garlic he then fried it with some of Brande's fat but by then it was too burned to be consumed. He then chopped it up into chunks and fed it to his dog. According to journalists who saw the video which has not been made public Brandes may already have been too weakened from blood loss to actually eat any of his penis. Meiwes read a Star Trek book for three hours while Brandes lay bleeding in the bath. Meiwes apparently gave him large quantities of alcohol and painkillers 20 sleeping pills and a bottle of schnapps and finally killed him in a room that he had built in his house for this purpose the Slaughter Room. After stabbing Brandes to death in the throat he hung the body on a meathook and tore chunks of flesh from it he even tried to grind the bones to use as flour. The whole scene was recorded on the twohour videotape. Meiwes ate the body over the next 10 months storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes and consuming up to 20 kg of the flesh.' These are the facts of this case. In order to make this film 'palatable' the writer and director introduce a new character  Katie Keri Russell is an American Psychology student who travels to Germany to explore the depths of the dark interstices of human behavior. It is though her eyes and imagined flashbacks visiting the places of the childhood and adulthood the two people involved that she offers the audience the understanding of this act. Oliver Hartwin Thomas Kretschmann is first seen as a child Rainier Meissner and the seeds of his strange behavior are briefly identified. We also meet Simon Thomas Huber learn of his background and his relationship to his mother Helga Bellinghausen and meet him with his lover Felix Marcus Lucas in what appears to be a healthy relationship. But Simon surfs the internet finds Oliver's curious invitation to cannibalism and decides to become involved in a fantasy he has always had. The two men meet and mutually agree to take part in the act of Oliver's slow cannibalistic murder of Simon. Many of the aspects of the real case are included but the writer and director know when to hold back and also know when to leave the story alone without the trial or follow up that leaves the audience shocked but also somehow makes the entire story seem more like a nightmare than an actual deed. Kretschmann and Huber both are extremely fine actors and have found that thin thread of inner fear and selfdoubt that makes us able to understand the bizarre act we are watching. Keri Russell is very good in the tiny part she plays the deleted scenes on the DVD show her role was originally larger adding a bit of a reality touch for the audience helping us through this story. There are technical problems with the film cinematographer Jonathan Sela uses scratchy developing for the flashback scenes which are not always suitably inserted and the musical score by Steven Gutheinz is often too dependent of the pipe organ fright tactics of horror pictures. It is a difficult subject to watch but in all the film presents a bit of reportage in a watchable manner. Truth is stranger than fiction. Grady Harp".

It is not sensationalist nor particularly exploitative and it is based on the true events. Wishing to watch or even make a film about a gruesome murder does not mean you necessarily have a sick mind.The problem I have with Grimm Love is the pathetic back story of the American student. Why does a very strong and intriguing story about two German men need to be framed by and told through the eyes of a fictional attractive female American? Well the answer is pretty simple I guess she'll look good on the poster and in the trailer and give the film some chance of success in the US. However this is a MAJOR flaw of the film.This character adds absolutely nothing to the story and only serves to waste about 20 minutes of screen time which could have been cut completely from the film or used to go deeper into the actual story of the two men. Not only is this character boring and unnecessary but she acts irrationally throughout the film.For example she breaks into the house where the crime occurred  this was highly unconvincing and only served as a means to start some flashbacks to the actual events. Secondly she is able to locate the actual video of the crime which has never been found even by the police by posting a single message on a cannibal website! This was so laughable it was beyond belief. This lost video must represent something of a holy grail to the cannibal community so the idea that an outsider can simply stick a request for it on a forum and be sent a copy free of charge a few days later is ridiculous.It's a real shame about these elements which surely anyone with even a basic understanding of script writing could have pointed out would scupper an otherwise serious attempt at film making.".

No Steven Soderbergh Gus van Sant or Spielberg as director nor would they ever dare touch this kind of subject matter. The photography is appropriately dark somber. Having the main characters speak English with a German accent i.e. have German actors was an okay choice too the alternatives being AmericanBritish accents or German with subtitles bad options. The idea of having Russell as a sort of physically existent narrator was okay as well. The story is written as a drama which then of course turns into horror. However no graphic showings of severed limbs or penises flying through rooms which would have cheapened the overall effect. Fans of Saw should stay away from this it is not an idioticillogical thriller about torturing innocent people. GL hasn't got quite the level of realism of the terrific Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer but it's headandshoulders above the vast majority of wannabe gloomy movies that are out there in this regard. GL is also surprisingly brief under 90 minutes. Considering how much there was to this case perhaps a little short but on the other hand it's tight and never dull.".

It is framed within a story of an American student in Germany writing her master's thesis on the topic from a psychological perspective.Names have been changed for the movie but we meet both characters in their childhood. Simon the willing victim was a tormented homosexual boy who is traumatized by the suicide of his mother presumably because she caught him with another boy. He is now in an apparently fulfilling relationship with Felix but still consumed by guilt. The cannibal Oliver was never allowed to develop as a man because of his overbearing and controlling mother. As a child he meets another kid and they spy on butchers slaughtering pigs and gets into watching real death films. Cannibalism becomes his sexual fantasy and on message boards he solicits someone to become his meal. Some who are interested back off before he takes their lives. Until he meets Simon who thinks he can find peace only once someone removes his piece.Presumably everything we are told is true in particular how events unfold when the two meet as the cannibal actually filmed their encounter. That tape is the only thing that gives importance to the story of the American student. Someone offers her a copy of the film and once she sees it it's more than she asked for.Grimm Love a changed but effective title making reference to the horrific children stories by the brothers Grimm with which all German children have been terrorized is a very good movie. It is not pleasant to see though. There are a lot of homosexual scenes and some gruesome scenes at the end. But the movie humanizes the characters. It's not a movie that seeks to make cannibalism cool or that delights in gore or that wants to demonize the cannibal even though the monster in him can't be eliminated. These two characters are tormented traumatized suffering souls who never managed to overcome their childhood pain in particular Simon. The tone of the movie is mild and slower. Oliver is calculative but gentle if one can say that. The movie is mostly filmed in tones of yellow and brown and is rather dark looking. Direction and acting are excellent. This movie is smart and succeeds at giving you insight into the darkest of dark places of the human being and of life. A recurring question is just how was it possible that these two people with such unique but matching preferences were able to meet. An astonishing event indeed.".

It was soon relevant that this film was going to be disturbing to watch. I am currently reading Interview with a Cannibal by Gunther Stampf which is a book documenting exactly what happened. The facts come from several interviews with Armin Meiwes. As for the film it does stick to the factual events rather closely. Towards the end of the film I began to be horrified at what I was watching. I did however feel a compulsion to see it through to the end. I have to admit that it is the single most disturbing piece of cinema I have ever encountered. I would definitely recommend being fully prepared before watching this film. The movie does stick to the main facts and I find it to be sufficient enough to tell the main story. As a psychology student I also am fascinated with Armin Meiwes although I will not follow the same path as the unlucky student in the film. It is definitely worth watching but only if you are fully prepared for the horrors you will see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just a few quick sentences to register what a complete pile of trash this film is. Based the true crime story of a German man who cannibalizes another man he meets online this film never manages to justify it's making. The victim is supposedly a willing participant and the grotesque act is videotaped. In this film and in actual fact the victim's judgment was severely impaired by massive levels of drugs and alcohol and some degree of mental illness. Using these sensational facts the screenwriter and director then attempt to inject into the motives and actions of both men deep feelings of loss guilt and passion. The crime is imbued with a sense of fatalism and yearning that one would normally associate with tragic love. In this case it looks like a ridiculous attempt to justify a film that should have never been made and was only made so that it could show one man eating another man. Using a grotesque event like this to imply some kind of kismet coupled with sexual dismemberment decapitation and cannibalism is worse than macabre. It's embarrassingly desperate for attention. Some true crimes are just crimes you hear about on the news and nothing more. They don't need to be made into movies because they don't deserve or require that level of examination. Especially when that examination is on such a false level as this one. This is just a gory news item on a slow news day. Trying to turn it into a feature film by inventing a romantic subtext rings hollow and insincere. How about next exploring the inherent romantic angles of rape? This movie should not be seen by anyone. There is absolutely nothing to be gained by giving up two hours of your life for this garbage.".

I think this is where Katie sees the error of her ways and comes to terms with the fact that no matter how you would like to psychoanalyze deviants and understand what makes them tick the repulsion in the perverse sickening activities of these people are all too real..she begins to cry and look away as Oliver hacks away a rude awakening needed so she could snap out of her quest to find humanity in the dark natures of mankind's most fiendish.Despite the appalling subject matterI'm referring to the cannibalism and those interested in it GRIMM LOVE is beautifully photographed by Jonathan Sela and has strong performances from Kretschmann and Huber as the protagonists. As Simon and Oliver we are witnesses to their upbringing the miserable loneliness thanks to absent fathers who didn't love them and how their homosexuality was a burden when they were children both the objects of bullying.

I realize that Russell's role may seem unimportant since she really isn't the subject of the movie but Katie does tell us their story visits Oliver's home and communicates to the viewer as an outside voice trying to establish a reasoning for why two men would agree to carry on with such a grisly agreement one to die knowing he would be eaten the other more than willing to carve him up and chow on his flesh.".

	schema:headline " A heavyhanded sympathy piece Part 1 of 3";
	schema:reviewBody "This was inspired by the real life case of Armin Meiwes who put an ad over an Internet site looking for a willing victim to be slaughtered and their flesh consumed. What made the case so unusual was he was not only serious but another man named Bernd Jurgen Brandes obliged apparently without being physically forced as a share of the event was captured on videotape. Grimm Love is a tale that paces as a dark narrative drama with a fictional college student named Katie Armstrong played by Keri Russell returning to where these two lived in Germany in an attempt to get inside their heads for a research paper.Instead of concentrating on horror and shock the filmmakers switch back and forth between the present with Ms. Armstrong and also in the past with the two men who eventually meet up in a kind of twisted interconnected fate. Oliver based on Meiwes is shown as far back as adolescence with his father leaving trouble fitting in at school as well as having no life apart from taking care of his ailing mother. He's alone and looking for companionship though his way of connecting with people isn't hugs kisses or long conversations but instead a longing fixation of consuming the flesh of someone special to feel stimulation and closeness.Simon based on Brandes is a homosexual who fears showing his feelings in public out of misunderstandings and ridicule. He has severe depression and searches for a sense of belonging through some normal and not so normal ways. He looks at extreme fetishes on an Internet chatroom as a way of feeling alive from a life that never accepted him. In 2003 Gay Chinese actorcomposer Leslie Cheung was successful but still committed suicide by jumping off a building likewise Simon also has things going for him though it's too much and he wants to meet his end with symbolism that directly severs ties with his burdensome sexuality that gives him a guilt complex from his mother's suicide at an early age.Dodging the pulsepounding route of Silence of the Lambs this comes across more like Kalifornia by hearing the thoughts and experiences as they come through with narration. It also flows as slow as Cronenberg's Spider in an attempt at an onthesurface character study of these atypical individuals' thought processes and motivations. Though the college student's montages about how these two men affect her take up extra screen time away from finding out more. There are metaphors and poetic wordings interspliced to sway the audience towards deep sympathy for these two fractured individuals. Sometimes making you think with introspection but at other times being desperate to make a point and forcing their way in like some of Keri Russells' obvious voice overs instead of letting the camera do the talking.Grimm Love isn't going to be like watching a biopic on the History Channel by just stating the events as is as the filmmakers are doing select reporting to be more convincing towards a certain compassionate sentimental way of thinking than letting your own thoughts flow free. To some it's going to be touching to others it's going to be sympathy for the devil. The heavy leaning towards the first here can take away from the experience as it feels written with a prior agenda in mind not to mention before all things were considered in the case as the real events took place in only 2001 and an overturned verdict came in 2006 when this came out. I like the angle of diving into their background even if it breaks psychology down for the layman though this would have worked better as a biography with anecdotes from relatives friends and experts. Or if a story is to be had something like the route taken with Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer where the director of that film said he feels that he shouldn't have to decide a stance for the viewer that that's up to them.This isn't an exploitation film that takes advantage of real events such as Men Behind the Sun did as it's more suggestive than showing candid nudity and bodily infliction like Cannibal about the same events. Though by the time it closesright after the infamous scenario between the men that's akin to the real life events in In the Realm of the Sensesit can't seem to decide what it wanted to be. In the beginning and middle it was going out of its way to reason with the audience that these guys aren't just a couple of kooks with mental issues like the media sensationalized. Though by its close they left the story up in the air and ambiguous with the young woman being either deeply moved or having a change of heart. It makes me believe she was only included as a ploy for the writers to speak through her and then at the end decided it was time enough to let the audience choose. Not to mention at an inopportune time as it ends abruptly and doesn't show what happened next. See my profile and click chronological for the second review of Cannibal or the third review Downloading Nancy. Also submitted on httpfromblacktoredfilmreviews.blogspot.com".

It played here in Seattle as part of the Seattle International Film Festival SIFF at the Seattle Center and i thought it would be a subtle investigation of the two men. My first surprise came when the audience was addressed by a festival employee who told us that although the movie was German the dialogue was English. Good for me because I think I need new glasses. The second surprise was that Kerri Russell was in it huh?. I'd like to preface my comments by stating a few things I am in my twenties and therefore have grown up in an age violence and moral deprivation and consider myself to be desensitized sometimes to an alarming degree. The interest I have in abnormal psychology particularly sexual is deep and passionate and although I am pretty well adjusted my curiosity borders on the creepyeven to those that know me well. I am also extremely liberal in politics and as close to an atheist as someone as spiritually apathetic as I can be. This movie made me ill. Physically. The grad student that Russell played was although annoying in the beginning the one saving grace in this movie because the character acted as a device that separated the viewer from the actions taking place. Yes these were sad people who had shitty lives but it is not in me to be sympathetic. In and age where people can find each other on the internet via a chat room surely one of them could have found a descent therapist. The made for each other aspect that attempted to romanticize the story was sickening and pathetic. I know that they were not trying to make it into a beautiful love story but reallywhere was the psychological analysis? This film is irresponsiblethe ideas that the viewer is exposed to are not easy to forget when given this sort of treatment. It rushed to the climax and then dragged out the gore for what I can only assume was shock value and media provocation. Cannibalism is the one taboo we have left on this planet and this movie dealt with the subject with all of the subtlety of the rock Russell throws through the window. I think that people should be allowed to explore the darkest sides of their shadows without shame but the desire to eat another human and the desire to be eaten are not sexual perversions they are severe mental illnesses. Human frailty is not something to be mocked and stylized. This was simply a movie about suicide and murder. I wish I had never seen it.".

But he backed out. But that man was covered in plastic and labeled which part was which. Example Thigh's were stake.But then this other fella named Simon wanted to have his penis bitten off. So while the movie is playing this College student named Katie was studding on them and the psychological minds. Like what caused them to do that. She went around the town taking pictures of where things happened. But as she was taking the pictures they would show flash backs. Honestly it confused me at first. Then Katie heard there was a tape to it. So she went of the web site that Oliver did to find his tape. But somebody did have the tape and she got the tape and watched it. Oliver did care for Simon though. But Simon had a lover named Felix. My opinion of this movie is that it was good. I do recommend it but not one for the younger ones to see or for people that are homophobic or have problems with cannibals".

	schema:headline " Sink this 'Bismarck'!";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1940 film 'Bismarck' was one of the Staatsauftragsfilme the 'stateproduced films' of the Third Reich which were clearly meant as Nazi propaganda. Rather than blatantly extolling Hitler these films typically chose a powerful figure from German history and depicted him favourably careful to stress similarities real or invented between this protagonist and Adolf Hitler the founder of the Third Reich. In this particular film the similarities are more obvious than elsewhere ... as the protagonist of 'Bismarck' is the diplomat who founded the Second Reich.'Bismarck' is a selective recounting of the life story of Otto von Bismarck the prime minister of Prussia who achieved military victory over Austria humiliated the French government and proclaimed Kaiser Wilhelm the First as the Emperor of Germany. Early on in this long movie we get a feeling of what we're in for as Bismarck addresses the Landtag. Speaking directly into the camera actor Paul Hartmann as Bismarck tells us The great questions of the present will not be solved by speeches and parliaments but by iron and blood. He doesn't say Sieg heil! but you get the message ja?This film carefully sets up parallels between Bismarck and Hitler. As soon as Bismarck becomes prime minister the next scene shows him building up the army that will create a German empire. Hitler did much the same as soon as he became chancellor. Figures in Bismarck's life are presented as equivalents of figures in Hitler's career. Although Bismarck installed Wilhelm as emperor this movie shows Bismarck challenging the Kaiser's authority and urging him to form a military nonaggression pact with Russia to strengthen Prussia's eastern flank. Wilhelm is depicted as a man who has outlived his usefulness who should step aside for a stronger and greater leader in other words he's the equivalent of Paul von Hindenburg the president of the Weimar Republic who was displaced by the ambitious Hitler.The period detail in 'Bismarck' is excellent and the production values are impressive ... but then Germany's UFA film studio was able to use cheap labour in wartime. In the central role Paul Hartmann gives a lacklustre performance. Not much better is Friedrich Kayssler as Kaiser Wilhelm. Kayler was murdered for political reasons less than a week before Hitler committed suicide. In the role of the Empress Lil Dagover is darkly beautiful ... still looking remarkably like the pale heroine she depicted in 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari' and 'Destiny'.Many of Nazi Germany's propaganda films had some genuine artistic merit and interesting scripts notwithstanding their political agenda. But 'Bismarck' is long on Nazi agitprop and short on redeeming features. The most interesting thing about this movie is its sequel 'Bismarck' was a huge hit at the Third Reich's box office reaping a profit of nearly two million reichsmarks. The propaganda office straight away commissioned a sequel 'Die Entlassung'. This is a much better film than 'Bismarck' with the same director but with a much better actor taking over the role of Otto von Bismarck the great Emil Jannings. I'll rate 'Bismarck' 2 points out of 10.".

Klaybler doesn't always understand Bismarck's reasons but he's real satisfied with the results.The Nazi authoritarian state is very justified in Bismarck. The parliamentary politicians are shown as naive quibblers it's Bismarck with his blood and iron that is building the German nation. With scenes of German military might just overrunning everything due to the policies of the far seeing Bismarck what more could Joe Goebbels want for a propaganda justification for some of the current German military activities?For a German audience schooled in this view of the world this was great stuff. Unless you've studied 19th century European and German histories a lot of this you won't understand.Not one of Herr Goebbals better efforts but I'm sure audiences in 1940 in the Third Reich ate this one up.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suspect that the other reviews of this film are poor or tenuous because their writers felt compelled to write them as such due to the period the film was made in. This naturally is unjust and irrelevant so this review will be honest and free of political intimidation. If you have any background knowledge of the setting whatsoever you already know what this is about the German statesman that saw the big sponge of German states become an iron block the mighty Kaiserreich. However this is marked as containing spoilers because of the amount of detail it goes into and just to be safe. Approaching the film I had high expectations. It is a film about Germans made by Germans and free from the political spin of their rivals. Not to say there is not spin but more on that below.I thought the film was very well made. The castingchoices are good for the actors fulfill their roles competently and are sufficiently remarkable to distinguish from one another even for a viewer who is not a native speaker. Now the entire film is pervaded with imagery nationalistic patriotic and militaristic. Personally I enjoy this sort of thing very much especially since I recognise all of the aesthetics and melodies used. The parade of the Prussian military at 1 hour and 4 minutes in is one of the best displays I have ever seen in a movie especially the march sequence with Preuens Gloria and piercing step. It is exceptional and inspiring an example for all military aesthetic to follow.However not all of the movie resonated so well with me. The only part that truly came close to boring me was the ballet scene. I understand it was important as it contains the political intrigue that inevitably accompanies such things but it is hardly the centrepiece of the film. Absolutely worth mentioning is one of the last scenes where the Battle of Kniggrtz is depicted. If anyone is familiar with the background of the Kniggrtzer March it was composed for this event so hearing it play in one of the most climactic moments of the film was an incredibly pleasant surprise. The buildup to that scene was very well done too especially the conversation that the Kaiser and Bismarck have about the Crown Prince leading the Second Army. He could be relied upon to arrive and relieve in the Battle Bismarck argued because crown and country depended upon it.The whole film overall is a veritable masterpiece. If another film were made of the Kaiserreich today it would be negative antipatriotic and disrespectful. I repeat this film of Germans by Germans and for Germans treats its subject matter respectfully and lovingly. That is more important than a revisionist's idea of historical accuracy. After all that last item is a strawman I saw no historical discrepancies at all let alone ones that are sufficiently grave to interfere with the film.".

	schema:headline " Did not manage to attract my attention";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a 1940 German movie about famous politician Bismarck. If you know the very basics of history you will realize that this was made during the early years of World War II. And yet there is not that much propaganda in it as you may have seen on several other films from around that time. Here and there it has a bit but it's not particularly antisemitic all in all compared to other films that were made roughly 75 years ago. And just like today it was a common trend to make films about people who had a severe historical impact no matter if friend or foe. The film is in blackandwhite of course and was directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner. And even if this name is probably hardly known to anybody today he directed over 100 projects until his death in the 80s. If you count his very early years as an actor he had a career lasting over 50 years. He was not the most prolific writer compared to his work behind the camera but here and there he also worked on the scripts for his films. Bismarck is one example.The cast includes Paul Hartmann and Lil Dagover who you may have heard of if you have quite an interest in German cinema from the first half of the 20th century. Or maybe you also read about the latter in crossword puzzles where they occasionally ask about her first name. Anyway to me personally this film was not too appealing but that is just a subjective attitude. I myself enjoy a good politicallythemed film here and there but the years before World War I or maybe even World War II never really interested me particularly and this film did not get me interested in this ear either. It's certainly an interesting watch taking into account that this film was made in Nazi Germany and how Bismarck was seen and displayed there but that is pretty much it. You can be very sure that Joseph Goebbels had great influence on which scenes were shown in this film and which weren't. A core topic in this film are turf wars. I won't go a lot more into detail about the action but you really should not watch this film without a great historical interest in the times depicted here. Otherwise it will be as underwhelming for you as it was for me. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "June 1886 Munich...a new life in freedom has begun for a unique man...the streets of the city see mournful processions flags trumpets and bells proclaim the tragic death of the Bavarian king. The impressions among the audience are diverse...their dilemmas touch us was he a great man 'too good for his times' or merely an eccentric not capable of ruling? A rose placed on his coffin by a beloved soul seems to whisper the story bringing us through a wonderful flashback to the heyday when everyone was so young so joyful so musical and the dream that night would shine one day seemed so promising...The figure of Ludwig II together with his elaborate castles built in Bavaria is mostly associated with Luchino Visconti's 1972 masterpiece. And deservedly so because maestro's film develops the psyche of the 'fairy tale' king together with his motives for weird isolations and discoveries of his own sexuality. Thanks to its length the use of details music contrasting images of white vs. black of snow vs. darkness and the entire development of the mental states Visconti's film remains unique and stays away from the traditional view of a feature film. Yet fewer people know that a long time before 1972 this wondrous German film had been made the film that still leaves a visual impression in the viewer. Although Kaeutner's film is made in the spirit of the postwar 'Heimatfilms' the result has little to do with the saccharine sweetness that has often undeservedly been 'baptized' as 'kitsch.' This film still proves a certain variety of reasons why it is highly worth viewing.The aspect that touches us most are the exquisite images camera shots that leave more sensitive viewers breathless. Valuable cinematography by Douglas Slocombe and elaborate sets of authentic castles where the events actually took place lavish wardrobe and bright colors make the film a visual feast. That aesthetic merit of the film is also beautifully executed in many romantic scenes that depict Ludwig's spirituality. There is also an excellent use of juxtaposing images that clearly portray the reality vs. fantasy  an aspect that played a decisive role in the king's life.That aesthetic merit leads to the key quality of any movie...performances. O.W. Fischer a renowned German actor of the time does a terrific job combining a sympathetic personality with the eccentric mind enthusiasm with isolation link of an artist with the separation of the character. He appears to be at two levels here as being himself on his own and as a reflection of the love of his life  Empress Elizabeth widely known to viewers as Sissi Ruth Leuwerik. To understand him we are led to understand Sissi  from the very beginning we are supplied with this perspective two similar loving souls. In their scenes Ludwig's thoughts are manifested and Ludwig's feelings are conveyed. A must see is the scene at Schloss Berg a very romantic one when they are together their thoughts are mutual their desires are similar and the two clouds in the sky occur to 'seal' their common mutual existence 'in Gedanken in den Wolken' in thoughts in clouds. Another very symbolic scene is at the theater when they hold their hands. Of course the performance of Ms Leuwerik is not comparable to Romy Schneider's portrayals of Sissi but actually the actress offers us a very intelligent glimpse of the character  'Kaiserin' as seen by Ludwig through his perceptions his dreams.Mr Fischer as Ludwig alone gives an insightful performance. He is a man like hardly any man a king like hardly any king who has no time for war...he wants to be alone...he loves nature...he adores beauty and art...he has his world his passions and his idol Richard Wagner portrayed by Paul Bildt. He is moody...he desires silence but above all he desires ULTIMATE FREEDOM. Insightful and psychologically claustrophobic as it may seem the portrayal has certain limits which makes watching the film a pleasure because the thoughts do not become too intense. We empathize with the king we do our best to understand him and recognize something of ourselves in him. Helmut Kautner and O.W. Fischer seem to impose that limit not to make the portrayal unendurable. Another reason is the fact that difficult films were not so popular those days when the depressing images of WWII were still fresh in people. Among the supporting cast the actress that is a lovely discovery for me is Marianne Koch as Princess Sophie. Her portrayal shines with special charm she is lovely as a young woman who loves Ludwig who wants to marry him...yet her mother's warning about true happiness in their family gives a new unexpected standard. The turning point is the moment when she enters the theater with Ludwig and...they are alone...no audience whatsoever! The mesmerizing power that Ludwig captures while listening to Wagner's Rheingold occurs to be unendurable for the young princess. The music is so enchanting so mysterious so magical such a blissful moment that seems to touch the very depths of human soul...yet she cannot stand it. How memorably you can read the intense emotions from her face...tragic desire with tremendous fear. A lovely German actress whom I discovered so late thanks to my best friend.Finally a mention must be made of Wagner's music. Since the music had a lasting impact on the king throughout his life we are supplied with the bits of these specific tunes that seem to touch us overwhelm us influence us...13 June 1886...a new way began for the fairy tale king. No matter if we see it as an act of despair or a dream of utopia...he was a thought provoking figure. This movie is no masterpiece but an important German tribute to the unique personality. A pleasant enjoyable aesthetic production.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a generation divide as always with cinema and it is obvious with regards the Visconti's film and the earliest Kutner's version. In the modern times when it is commercially fashionable to insist on the more prurient aspects of one's biography and when crude obscenity has replaced suggestiveness it is quite understandable that younger generations should far prefer the eroticism and nauseating aestheticism of Visconti. As a man in his seventies I must say I was deeply moved by the Ludwig portrayed by Kutner. The camerawork is excellent the Wagnerian musical background sublime and the rendering of the end of the King quite gripping. It is a great injustice to compare this film with the Sissi series.".

In the modern times when it is commercially fashionable to insist on the more prurient aspects of one's biography and when crude obscenity has replaced suggestiveness it is quite understandable that younger generations should far prefer the eroticism and nauseating aestheticism of Visconti. As a man in his seventies I must say I was deeply moved by the Ludwig portrayed by Kutner. The camerawork is excellent the Wagnerian musical background sublime and the rendering of the end of the King quite gripping. It is a great injustice to compare this film with the Sissi series.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ludwig II Glanz und Ende eines Knigs or Mad Emperor Ludwig II or just Ludwig II is a West German 110minute film from 1955 so this one already had its 60th anniversary last year. The title is a perfect information what the movie is about the life and times of Ludwig II. The director is Helmut Kutner and he filmed a script by 3 screenwriters that I am not familiar with. But Kutner is among the most known directors of his time here in Germany. The lead actor here is O.W. Fischer also among Germany's most respected actors back then and he received a German Film Award for his portrayal here. Klaus Kinski had only very little screen time but it was enough to score a nomination in the supporting category. The film generally received some decent praise was also nominated in Cannes back then. I personally enjoyed the watch. The film delivers convincingly in terms of costumes and sets and we should not take it for granted. But the heart and soul of the movie is Fischer as the lead. I can see why he received a lot of praise and this is probably the most known work of his career more than a decade after his death. He is everything that Tambrea wasn't in the fairly recent take on the story. And even beyond acting and visuals aspects that were helped a lot by the fact that this is a color film this film is worth a watch as it delivers an interesting history lesson in terms of Ludwig's preference of the arts his relationship with Richard Wagner and his mysterious death. This movie only dragged very rarely and that's decent achievement as it comes close to the 2hour mark. I recommend the watch. Thumbs up.".

The closest Technicolor factory was in england. You still had to rent that bulky camera with the prism requiring 3 film magazines . You had to test the scene before you can shoot it it was called the Lilllie that and the expensive processing plus waiting on the dailies which could of taken up to two weeks shipment from england back to Germany proved too impractical besides they had agfa color that was expensive enough . Well in 1953 Kodak came up with a way to shoot a single strip of color film and then have dye transfers to be made in the laboratory aka 3 strips. This made it no longer necessary to use the bulky camera. Firefox 1955 was the last film to use the bulky camera. the cost reduction made it more affordable in Germany .The plunge was made. although the first Agfa color feature to be printed in Technicolor was American made shot in Germany  by R.K.O. starring Ann Baxter and George Nader Ludwig was Germany's first. As we all know Ludwig was gay but also had skitzophrenia. This film version disguises this as male affection. He holds men hands hugs them kisses them on the cheek. This was to get by with the now hypocritical homophobic German audiences. Princess Sophie played by Marrianne Koch recognizes his illness when she confronts his theater devoted to Richard Wagner. It makes her sick and she calls of the engagement. His true love was Sissie but she already married so they can only be friends.

The color was better than the one that was used in the Sissie series. The acting and story was good too. Helmut Kuntner rented the museum for this movie. but due to the expense of the process still it didn't cause German filmmakers to drop Agfa. that was cheaper.

You act like you all got hit in the head with a horse!Top spaghetti western list httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849907Average SWs httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849889 For completists only bottom of the barrel httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849890";

	schema:headline " one of the worst Italian westerns";
	schema:reviewBody "Not really a spaghetti' western though filmed in Italy. No one wears a duster and it's not really very violent till near the end. The movie has a weird European feel to it as if the makers had no idea what the Wild West was really like. The villagers of Silvertown have an Old World style festival for instance everyone polkaing and playing happy music that would have been perfect for Oktoberfest. Other errors are rife. One of the heroes claims to come from Czechoslovakia!? A nation that didn't exist at the time  anyone who came from the area would have said they were from Bohemia Moravia or AustriaHungary. Bullets are stopped by thin wooden slats. Pistols outshoot rifles. Guns can't hit a man less than 30 yards away because he's too high up. A guy is hit by a bullet wound right in the middle of his left chest and the wound is declared to be not serious. A saloon singer sings and behaves like a European cabaret star. A western stable names a horse Taras Bulba. It's unintentionally hilarious.Sadly when the movie tries to be funny it catastrophically fails. The humorous biblequoting crook has a long unfunny scene with a group of kids that makes no sense at all in my dubbed version. Maybe it was funnier in Italian. There are also errors of plot. Lee Van Cleef is first seen on horseback. But a major theme for the next 45 minutes of the movie is how he needs to get himself a horse. There is a big scene where Van Cleef defends the dubious virtue of a dance hall girl but then he never picks up on a potential romance with her. She just gets discarded along with other plot points. Van Cleef is fun to watch as always. The other actors are varying degrees of suckitude and the movie in general makes little sense. There are a couple of reasonably good scenes which I guess is reason enough to watch this if you got it in a pack of 20 Westerns which I did. But it sure as heck isn't worth looking up on its own unless you are writing a book on Lee Van Cleef or something.".

It is an Italian movie made by Italians with a few Gringos in the leads Lee Van Cleef Lionel Stander and Bud Spencer who was a Brother but never mind just like a Spaghetti yet is decidedly traditional in it's nature. If it wasn't for the comparatively excessive violence  lack of Native American characters this could have been made with Randolph Scott and Robert Mitchum on the Universal backlots over a few weekends.There was a period of time when Italy was making films that were an obvious attempt to compete with the Bfare Westerns coming out of the states and BEYOND THE LAW sort of straddles the divide between that time of Italian made Cowboy Movies SHOOTOUT AT RED SANDS the overlooked FURY OF THE APACHES GRAND CANYON MASSACRE and MINNESOTA CLAY and when the Spaghetti mystique took over in the wake of successes like THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY DEATH RIDES A HORSE not to mention the SARTANA and DJANGO films  All of which come from a different cultural sensibility that stressed style and delivery rather than trying to mimic John Ford. It was really with the walloping masterpiece of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST that the Yanks were forced to sort of sit up  take notice of people like Sergio Leone Ennio Moriconne Antonio DeTeffe Gianni Garko Franco Nero and Enzo G. Castellari. After about 1970 European made Westerns didn't concern themselves much with square dance scenes romancecomedy subplots and scenes where dozens of riders chase a stagecoach.So BEYOND THE LAW is a sort of throwback film to 1965 or so with the great Lee Van Cleef excellently cast as a scruffy two bit chicken thief who turns lawman to help an utterly square uncorruptable and interminably cheerful young mining executive just off the boat from Europe Antonio Sabato also very well chosen for his role protect the payroll and silver from a mining community from ... himself. And his two crony con men Stander and Spencer both excellent plus a pack of hyenas led by a caped madman Spaghetti legend Gordon Mitchell obsessed with stealing the loot that inconveniently turn up to give Van Cleef a chance to not only be selected as the community's new sheriff but allow Van Cleef a chance to finally find himself in the role even if he was first handed the star as part of a puton in an elaborate swindle that just didn't work out the way it could have.So BEYOND THE LAW is not just a Euro Western but a Caper Movie about a Heist an ActionAdventure Buddy Film with touches of ComedyRomance as Van Cleef finds himself responding to the admiration of the local burlesque queen gorgeous Graziella Granata who even gets time to belt out a rowdy stage number and a Fish Out of Water dramedy as Antonio Sabata goes from a cultured immigrant to a coldblooded if unusually polite killer It is his sheer earnest cluelessness that finds itself eating away at Van Cleef's otherwise rotten heart who goes from an unwashed dirtbag to the hero of the community in 90 minutes whether or not he wanted to  Sabato simply charms him over and makes his character realize that destiny has oddly thrust itself upon him and he takes up the mantle of lawman with a grim chagrin that is actually quite amusing and sort of gets you right there thump when all is said and done Some law is better than no law even if it comes from the strangest places.Such is the lesson learned by Van Cleef and it's interesting to view his character here as sort of a prequel to the jaded disillusioned  cynical lawmanbringer of justice he would play in so many movies afterward and a couple before even. This is no Douglas Mortimer but a totally different person  A fine testament to his qualities as an actor which is something that most folks overlook in favor of a black clad total badass who is the best shot in the Carolinas or whatever. Fans of his work are hereby admonished to seek this movie out and give it three or four screenings if that's what it takes. Yeah it's trying to look and sound like Hollywood not Cinematalia but after ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST Italian Pasta directors stopped trying to prove they could do John Ford and this film stands of a relic of when that was still an ongoing proposition.Now finding the RIGHT version of this film may take a couple tries Brentwood Home Video and a couple others of those 'Bargain Bin Box Set' issuers of Public Domain Movie fare DVDs are circulating an almost colorless 85 minute version which is too bad Diamond Entertainment and some outfit known as Quality Digital Productions both have a digitally colorrestored 105 minute version that while fullframe  squishy in spots from the improperly lensed transfer contains every last minute described for an English language presentation  Almost twenty minutes longer including the burlesque scene and a good old knock down drag out barroom brawl that has more in common with THE WAR WAGON than it does with THE FORGOTTEN PISTOLERO.

Actually it plays out more like one of those Western Westerns that are made in the West with John Wayne in them!Lee Van Cleef is a stinking thieving homeless bastard with a heart drifting through America with his equally smelly but much more wonky eyed sidekicks Lionel Stander and the other guy. Between them they steal a bunch of miner's wages from under the nose of Czech immigrant Antonio Sabato which gets him into stick with the mine's owner Bud Spencer without a beard! Thing is Lee's ended up striking up a huge Bromance with the nave but resourceful Sabato and feels kind of guilty for robbing him but not enough to try and rob him again. Somehow he ends up fending off some much more violent would be robbers and ends up sheriff of the town and mine !. This doesn't bode well with his mates who are in two minds and four different eye directions about whether to steal all that lovely silver that's being dug out of the mine.Throw in bigfaced evil bad guy Gordon Mitchell with sidekick Romano Puppo who also want the silver and are willing to kill kids and women for it and also throw in the romance with the girl who makes Van Cleef take a bath and put some decent clothes on. He's so scummy he doesn't know how to dunk a rich tea biscuit in some tea! That's a lot of plot up there and that doesn't leave time for gun fights and what not. There's a fairly big one at the end but we're talking at the end of a nearly two hour long film. Luckily Van Cleef's conflicted personality carries the film whenever he's around as he's torn between a life of being poor and free or being settled with a roof over his head. I guess the ending is kind of sad when I think about it.Nice looking film too I guess if you're looking for more character development this film might be for you. If you want endless shoot outs you might want to try something else.".

	schema:headline " Beyond the Law";
	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Law as it is also known as is a poorly made Spaghetti Western starring Antonio Sabato who portrays an immigrant from Europe named Ben Novack who has journeyed out west to lend his knowledge to a silver mining company. Lee Van Cleef plays a thief named Billy Joe Cudlip who along with his partners Preacher Lionel Stander and Al Al Hoosman conspire to rob the payroll from the stagecoach and the silver from the mine. Bud Spencer who later gained fame in the Trinity movies plays the mine owner named James Cooper. Additionally bandits led by Burton Gordon Mitchell come along and rob kill and create chaos in general. Anyway having given the basic details of the plot I would just like to say that this is one of the worst westerns I have ever seen. The acting for the most part was abysmal the script was weak the character interactions were disjointed and the scenes had no rhythm or flow. Now it could very well be that one reason for the incoherence between scenes was due to extreme editing after the film was shot. But even so this was a dreadful movie completely lacking direction and expertise. For example in one scene the townsmen have set up an ambush for the bandits. Yet the ambush is conceived so sloppily that they leave a hill open with plenty of cover and concealment for the bandits to take up a defensive position and return fire. If that wasn't bad enough both sides prefer using pistols at long range rather than rifles. Even more incredible is the astounding accuracy all the main characters seem to have shooting these pistols at moving targets who are running and scampering all over the place. It defies common sense. Anyhow in spite of the major flaws in this film there were a couple of elements which were slightly positive. I thought Lee Van Cleef and Bud Spencer gave decent performances in their respective roles. Likewise Graziella Granata Sally Davis was very goodlooking. But other than that I see nothing worthwhile in this film.".

	schema:headline " A great cast and interesting plot in this spaghetti western";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's an example of the spaghetti western genre at its finest with a complex and twisting plot multiple characters good action and some of the finest actors that the genre has to offer. The combined result makes for watchable and entertaining viewing with a movie that always has something interesting going on. Things start off predictably enough as we are introduced to the eminently likable Lee Van Cleef as a cheeky thief who steals the payroll belonging to a mining corporation which is brought to town by a very younglooking Antonio Sabato. Van Cleef finds himself on the right side of the law for a change as he befriends Sabato and helps fight off a gang of ruthless bandits who are also after the money. He even finds himself made the town sheriff. However when the bandits turn up led by the ruthless Gordon Mitchell and kidnap the town's womanfolk Van Cleef finds himself leading a fullscale battle against the enemy.The biggest fault is probably with director Giorgio Stegani who is at the opposite end of the talent spectrum from master director Sergio Leone. His film totally lacks style or charm so it lies on the actors to make things entertaining. Thankfully Fernando Di Leo's script is fairly complex with some degree of characterisation and there are lots of interesting people in the tale who interact with each other in different ways. The plot is fastpaced and while there are no really impressive or memorable shootouts or gundowns a wealth of actionorientated scenes keep things moving and the fullscale battle at the film's close is both wellshot and exciting.The cast is what makes this film really good. First of all we have genre icon Lee Van Cleef in the likable leading part of a character who begins the film as a ruthless bad guy and undergoes a complete transformation into becoming a goodnatured heroic sheriff! Van Cleef is excellent in the part and really sympathetic especially in his doomed relationship with the exceptionally pretty Graziella Granata. Secondly we have Antonio Sabato as the freshfaced European stranger who comes to take care of the town's mining operation you can't help but like his character and he does well with what is a rather underwritten and onedimensional part. There's solid comic support from Lionel Stander and Herbert Fux as a pair of greedy robbers who figure in the film's surprise twist ending and the aforementioned Graziella Granata is fine as the female romantic interest. However stealing the show is one Gordon Mitchell who has a really impressive and sinister entrance as the scary chief villain Burton. It's surprising how much he resembles Peter Cushing in TWINS OF EVIL in his part and he relishes the opportunity to kill innocent folk and snarl orders at his men  a really nasty role. The casting and the story combine to make this a mustsee for spagwest fans.".

There's a few good plot twists along the way and also has a little comedy in some parts which I found myself chuckling at so hats off the people who made this film. It doesn't have the real seriousness that the Man With No Name trilogy and many other Westerns have but some times you just want to watch a Western that's a little bit more laid back. A real fun watch with plenty of action and I found the ending to be really nice. The copy I watched didn't have the greatest picture quality but the film is old now so I can deal with that. I'd be interested in trying to find a better copy some where to give this another watch and enjoy even more.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining if Flawed Spaghetti Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to popular belief the American west wasn't some lawless prairiedesert where only the strong like John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn and Clint Eastwood's man with no name could survive. While the likes of Jesse James and Butch Cassidy made the headlines the average day in the life of an American westerner was pretty dull. The majority of people who lived west of the Mississippi lived in urban areas not out in the boonies. Gun violence was actually less common in the western territories than back east and the majority of those who went out west were first generation immigrants not idealistic white folk provoked by called for manifest destiny. Beyond the Law 1967 is a movie that may not dispel the myths of the wild wild west but like many Spaghetti Westerns it does put a new spin on things.Lee Van Cleef stars as Billy Joe Cudlip a craven thief who steals the payroll of a mining community from a nave Czechoslovakian payroll clerk named Ben Antonio Sabato. He is of course helped by his gang of thieves and conmen Preacher Lionel Stander who dresses like his name to get rubes to trust him and James Bud Spencer a black man with a friendly face. Things go according to plan until Billy befriends Ben and is shoved into helping the locals recover the money. Preacher and James see this as an opportunity to steal more loot but things get further complicated when a rival gang of thieves led by Burton Gordon Mitchell comes into town.Now Beyond the Law is far from a perfect movie. The acting ranges of the supporting characters range from okay to terrible and the cinematography is simplistic. Directed by Italian director Giorgio Stegani Beyond the Law or The Good Die First brings to mind less severe Spaghetti Westerns. Rather than go the path of A Fistful of Dollars 1964 Stegani and his international crew made a movie closer to My Name is Nobody 1973 and My Name is Trinity 1970. It has the tendency to be funny and even unintentionally goofy at some points with Lee Van Cleef showing he can make the best out of a paycheck that bills him with nonEnglish speakers.If you're a western buff who's easy to please then Beyond the Law may be a perfect little surprise for you. It's a movie that is comfortable in its own banality. The story itself is strong partially written by prolific Italians writers Mino Roli and Fernando Di Leo and the feel of the film is small but unique. The film was made only a year after Van Cleef's appearance in The Good the Bad and the Ugly 1966 and helped make Bud Spencer a star in his own right. It should at the very least be considered a decent Bmovie.If you're interested try finding the 105 minute version through Diamond Entertainment and look to avoid imitators with bad digital transfers. There is a colorless butchered version that you can likely find at a bargain bin somewhere and there's a decent letterbox version you can find online. Go check it out before the ghost of Red Ryder comes back to remystify the west.httpwww.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com".

The film itself is a modest affair involving Van Cleef Lionel Stander Bud Spencer and the still active Herbert Fux in a caper to abscond with a silver shipment. Though the film was rather blandly shot by cinematographer Enzo Serafinwhether intentionally or otherwise it's drenched in browns and yellows lending it a rather dusty appearancethe proceedings are immensely improved by Riz Ortolani's majestic score.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think there is another film in the history of cinema that examines the lives of seniors including  gasp!  their sex lives with such honesty poignancy and yes accuracy as Wolke Neun Cloud Nine. Those characters on the screen could be your parents or grandparents and there they are still grappling painfully with the problems of love after all these years. This is a powerful film that is about much more than a mere examination of old people fing. Despite the typical stress on the nonexplicit sex it is a film more about the discovery of first love by a woman well advanced in years a woman who should have known all this stuff or so the theory goes 45 years before. Hats off to directorcowriter Andreas Dresen for giving us this honest courageous film that can upset and depress you at the same time as it can ultimately uplift you. Ursula Werner provides a shattering bravura performance as the besieged 66yearold Inge a married woman who is strongly attracted to a man ten years older Karl played by Horst Westphal. She engages in an affair with Karl while still proclaiming her love for Werner Horst Rehberg her husband of 30 years. Inge cannot understand the startling turn of events or why they happened but she discovers she loves Karl.Inge says again and again 'I didn't want this!' but the camera forces the viewer to challenge her. This woman has lived a life hidden from herself she has spent 30 years being protected by Werner who helped to raise her child. After a sheltered life dotted by drudgery and routine she goes on aimless train trips to please her trainloving husband she sings methodically in a church choir we see Inge coming to the painful realization that she is finally emerging as a real person at the age of 66. She begins to understand with tortuous internal conflict what love really is. There is a riveting scene in the film when the sublime Werner Inge stands by railroad tracks in cascading rain. With her back to the camera she screams at the earth or is it at herself? then turns and walks towards us we see then a face of boundless anguish a face that has realized something for the first time after all these years it is for her a terrifying and devastating discovery.There are flaws in this film we know little about Karl or Werner for example but I still highly recommend it. This is a first in cinema an adult film about REAL 'old people' and we'll probably not see another like it for a long time to come. Finally seniors in cinema have been given a genuine authentic voice. It is a tribute to Germany and perhaps Europe in general that a film like this could be made. It's a work that would never repeat NEVER be considered in the dumbeddown juvenile cartoonish world of Hollywood which prefers to massproduce movies that have little to do with the reality and pain of everyday human existence.".

Great actors in front of a patient camera that either stands still to let action evolve or focuses on the faces. There is hardly any dialog in the first half of the film character development occurs through the camera. It's the cinematic language that brings to mind Mike Leigh's films. As to the buzz about old sex  it's true Mr. Dresen has broken into new realms showing elderly people making love good and proper with lots of detail but never once overstepping limits of good taste. This movie concerns every one of us.

	schema:reviewBody "The people in Cloud Nine are not motivated by middle class psychology such factors as relationships with parents and emotional deprivations in childhood. Rather their motivations emerge from their basic characters. To a surprising extent their characters reflect elemental types. Inga a sixtyseven year old woman is a feeling type who works as a seamstress and is a member of a choir. She has been married for thirty years to Werner a thinking type who likes railroads and timetables. Their daughter Petra is a sensate type. She has young children and favors practical solutions. Karl Inga's lover is an intuitive type who impulsively makes love to her when he tries on a pair of trousers that she has mended.These types are not pure or absolute. As in everyday life aspects of people's characters continually rub against themselves and against aspects of other people's characters. This rubbing is what the movie's about. Inga a bright shining and moderately overweight woman is delighted by her affair. Contrary to her daughter's advice she tells her husband about it. He considers their marriage a happy one we see nothing to contradict this and finds it incomprehensible that she would want another lover. Inga and Werner separate. Inga moves in with Karl. Werner kills himself.Cloud Nine's plot is the structure within which its characters interact. All dialog is improvised. The improvisation is by skilled actors who have a full understanding of the relationships among their characters. In terms of naturalness this approach is highly successful. In a few instances things that we expect to be there are left out. When Werner says to Inga that he assumes her affair is with a younger man she does not tell him that Karl is nine years older than her. And no one states explicitly that Werner has killed himself. As would happen in real life we assume it because of the way people act.Many comments on this film both by reviewers and by people I've talked to involve its portrayal of nudity and sex among people in their sixties and seventies. The many closeup depictions are both graphic and discreet in ways that would be inconceivable in a Hollywood movie. The scenes stay with the viewer. Old and less than perfect bodies can be admired without cosmetic enhancement. Death's sting is unavoidable but can ultimately be accepted. The cloud nine on which Inga lives is not in outer space but is a beautiful part of nature.".

Inge a woman in her 60's who has been married to Werner for over 30 years has a spontaneous affair with Karl who is 76. Their sexual encounters are portrayed in graphic detail and I can't think of a film which has depicted such explicit sexuality between elderly characters. Although Inge feels a certain comfortability with Werner she is slowly realizing that their life together is nothing more than marking time until death. Inge is awakening to the fact that she just might be entitled to a bit more and Karl seems to provide the change for which she has been yearning. Andreas Dresen the director has provided a plot however all of the dialog was improvised by the actors while filming. Little background is given and the film explores the intensity of the sexual encounters and the ramifications of these interactions. In depth narrative detail is sacrificed for the vividness and drama of the emotional consequences. CLOUD 9 clearly targets a mature audience and for a small budget film which addresses a rather taboo subject it is quite heartfelt and poignant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wolke 9 German film title for 'Cloud 9'. The subject may not be so novel it's about love and marriage or you might say relationship 101 revisited. Yet the aspect of falling in love afresh for a woman at 67 discovering her erogenous zones and feelings with a new beau of 76 and thereafter certainly made us open our eyes and care for the persons involved. What does one do back at home with the husband of 30 years of marriage? What is the husband like? She tries to fight it as social norm expects but this falling in love again feeling is irresistible. It's enchanting passion. It's an opportunity to take a look at what's really happening to one's stage in life at hand. And is the 76year old lover worth the 'trouble'  what is he like? And we are also introduced to the daughter  what does she thinks of her mother's secret? Director Andreas Dresen who cowrote the screenplay with three other writers has given us a natural happenstance of love affairs exceptional in the sense that the story exclusively revolves around 'older' maturingage people  a theme seldom seen on screen. It's heartening to be able to appreciate the straightforward approach to the lovemaking scenes that are intimately explicit accepting the anatomy of matured bodies wrinkled or soft. Any nudity scenario is not at all gratuitous but simply befitting to what's happening at the particular moment of the 'storyline'.Inge our 67 year old heroine of the story is portrayed with impressive naturalness and emotional depth by Ursula Werner  best actress awards welldeserved. Karl the refreshing energy source for Inge is remarkably played with vitality by Horst Westphal  yes we want to go cycling swimming attend racing events and run in the rain with him. Werner the husband is played restrainedly effective by Horst Rehlberg demonstrating how listless his life has become in spite of occasional cuddling affection in bed with Inge spending time with grandchildren visiting his father at convalescent home even listening to 'choochoo' train are just dull routines that raise no smile. He does seem so tired  of life? Inge's affair probably makes his head hurt  does he have to make extra effort to enjoy life? The story centrally revolves around Inge hence besides the emotional ups and downs we get to follow her going about with daily activities including the added touch of belonging to a women's church choir participating in rehearsals and singing songs together  comfortable camaraderie detected. In the press kit  available on Cannes 2008 online under Cloud 9 page  director Dresen's comments are included and he mentioned that it was Ursula Werner who suggested the 'choir' aspect of Inge's life. 'Cloud 9' is worthwhile viewing and highly recommended.Films by association I recall the Brazilian film by Marcos Bernstein The Other Side of the Street 2004 contains a tender exchange scene between two older persons making love Fernanda Montenegro as Regina and Raul Cortez as Camargo which was sensitively delivered unabashed. Paul Cox's film Innocence 2000 with Julia Blake as Claire and Charles Tingwell as Andreas also marvelously depicts a married woman falling in love again in her 'later years'  not an impossible or improbable scenario at all.

It is a truly remarkable performance from Ursula Werner. The scene when she learns of the death of Werner is wonderfully moving. The direction is excellent and subtle. I liked the scene of the morning after she tells Werner and the camera is static as she walks around their flat not knowing whether to disturb him finally knocking on his bedroom to find we presume he has gone out. She no longer knows what he is doing. And the scene at the funeral where Inge is frozen with true grief as people line up to formally comfort with. It is a very real film. All the actors distinguish themselves. I found this film compelling from the beginning to the end. It is genuine heartfelt.

After some arguing she decides to choose her new boyfriend and leave her husband for 30 years. After that her husband dies probably of suicide. That is really not explained. This all takes a very long time. Except for the songs of a choir there is not really a soundtrack. This makes it more difficult to understand the emotions and also makes some very long scenes very boring. What stands out for me is that this woman decides against her love for life even though she still loves him for a life of sex. And that her daughter agrees with her and even encourages her to continue. If that were my mother I would certainly advise against a thing like that.While some acting was good others was not very convincing. I especially think the directing lacked coherence. The use of rain and colors did not clearly add to the meaning of the film. Perhaps the lack of a score did really make this movie really appear empty. This is reinforced at the end when the new couple hold to each other shortly after the tragic event. All this adds up to a very poor movie. Definitely not recommended if you want to have an enjoying evening.".

She's 67 years old. The film proves that older people like Inge are still sexually active. It's hard to imagine our grandparents being so sexual but this film helps us to dispel the notion that older people aren't sexually active anymore and have problems in their relationships as well. The film's message is that women may get to be grandmothers but they are still capable of sexuality and the need to be loved and affectionate in their years. Anyway the film is quiet understated but I'm not used to German films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wolke 9 or Cloud 9 is a German movie from 2008 so this one will have its 10th anniversary next year. The writer and director is Andreas Dresen one of Germany's most successful filmmakers and possibly the most successful from the former GDR right now. The title of this movie is a play on words and numbers with the German Wolke 7 where you find people that are in love so the translation Cloud 9 is not accurate at all as it should be Cloud 10 or 11 perhaps. Anyway this movie here is about a woman slightly under the age of 70 who has been married for a long time but falls in love with another man. This has drastic consequences of course on her life on her husband's life and also on the new guy's life. This film received major awards recognition at several prestigious ceremonies such as the Cannes Film Festival or the European Film Awards. At the German Film Awards Dresen won for his direction Werner won for her lead performance and the movie itself was picked as one of the top three of the year.I personally felt as if this film needed quite a while to get going and become interesting. But from the moment on when her husband finds out about the affair even if that is already pretty late in the movie things get better quickly and I was mostly underwhelmed before that. I would also say that i was not too impressed by Werner here. She did what she had to and she wasn't bad but it was nowhere near such an awardsworthy turn in my opinion. I guess they honored her because of her courage as she is in nude and sex scenes despite her age. The film is much more about the script here than about individual performances. The depiction of life and sexuality above the age of 60 is something that is just not done frequently in film maybe because many don't find it too much of an interesting let alone aesthetic topic. So it's okay that Dresen did it I guess. But being different is not the same as being good so you should not appreciate a film merely for the reason that it elaborates on a subject that has not been elaborated on that much. You still have to deliver quality. For example there are hundreds of Nazithemed films out there and occasionally they still manage to make convincing new ones despite the quantity of films existing already from this corner of the movie genre world.Anyway all in all I recommend Wolke 9 as it was a decent watch and there were no real weaknesses about the film. At 95 minutes it is already pretty essential even if it dragged on some occasions in the first half of the film. What I also liked however were the musical interruptions here that provided a strong contrast to the more serious scenes that came before or after these. Freude schner Gtterfunken is always a joy for sure. I give this movie a thumbsup but just a cautious one and I think the awards attention really may have been far too much.".

The film's reason for existence seems to be just an opportunity to exploit the idea of old person sex.";

The woman falls is love with another man and faces a terrible choice to stay in her boring relationship or feel alive again with her new man. I won't spoil the ending but it was very moving and at the same time disturbing. A real gritty drama that shows life as it is without any Hollywood style gloss. It's not just young love that has it's agonies!!! To all young couples and the middle aged. Don't think you're past all turbulent times you never know what is around the corner.".

	schema:reviewBody "A reviewer referred to this catatonic movie as a feminist horror story. While I wouldn't disagree with that I'd prefer to call it a plotpoor yawnfest melodrama with a cretinously banal storyline. Old people's lovetriangle Bumsfest romantic drama? That works too. Or I could simply refer to this pseudocinematic drivel as GILF porn. The hideous actress who toys around with men and very fittingly looks like one too is naked throughout the movie. Yes it's such a deep involving artistic story isn't it. Actually all these different descriptions could be merged into one simple term rubbish.Pretentious rubbish. Note the absence of music  aside from the inane superfluous choir scenes which somehow are needed to remind us that she is indeed old and not 18. You see the absence of music means the director bows down to his knees and then chintoground to Lars Von Trier's Pretentious Dummies 95 manifesto which basically instructs its blind and emptyheaded not to mention talentfree adherents not to utilize music because somehow a soundtrack makes the story insincere or some such rubbish I don't pretend to know much about this cretinous artfart Eurotrash movement aside that it's absolute horseshit for birdbrained film students and impotent obese film critics. One of the other tenets of the 95 bowel movement is that porn is not only acceptable but that dangling or upright male genitalia represent another highly artistic step toward more sincerity. Yes I know. We all know Lars is a degenerate pompous ass. And European cinema still wallows in its own selfindulging ineptitude laced with sexual obsessions most of which are perversions. No I don't mean old folk having sex I mean full frontal nudity of an underage girl a scene which the lustful filmmaker somehow managed to squeeze in despite that being the only scene in which any minor appears and despite that girl being wholly irrelevant to the plot. The old sneakabush tactic. Or was this some tiny New Age feminist commentary about how progressive the nympho's daughter is to have her kids running around naked in the garden? European filmmakers know their audiences alltoo well give them naked underage kids incest or bondage and your moviefestival rating as an artist with a unique vision goes through the roof. The story? An amazingly stupid old nymphomaniac woman who looks like Gary Numan after years of alcoholic binging screws her husband  literally and metaphorically  by cheating on him with an even older geezer. Now it's not as if she develops a romantic touching unintentional spontaneous relationship with this other guy over a period of time. No. Like a hormonallychallenged teenybopper she has him humping her within minutes of meeting him for the first time. No this is no joke. Nor am I joking when I tell you that the woman's adult daughter LAUGHS and then SMILES and then APPROVES of her affair when her mother confesses about it. Her daughter  ever the ungrateful skank but viewed sympathetically through the filmmaker's immoral feminazi prism  actually encourages her mother to continue the affair because after all the man she is cheating on is only her stepfather who only sacrificed his best years to bring her up another man's offspring as his own so why the hell not right? She warns her mother to keep it secret though. She does have THAT much common sense at least. So not all female characters in the movie are necessarily utter imbeciles only partially mentally and morally impaired. However in the filmmaker's eyes they are not moral degenerates at all.Alas her daughter's advice is not heeded by the choirsinging floozy who turns out to be beyond daft. To selfishly unburden her sense of guilt the fat ugly cow tells her hubby about how she's been shagging this other guy. As expected her hubby is outraged becomes depressed and concludes that his wife of 30 years is a moron. It is at that point that the audience in the theaters rapture into a spontaneous applause yes man she is soooo dumb!Oh but I kid. Of course no audience applauded nor would I ever watch this trash in a cinema. No not because most of audience are feminazi zombies but because most of them were snoring by this point. You see this movie is so saturated with padding. It's so full of unnecessary Euro artfart BS that if you'd compress this sexfilmimpersonatingaseriouscharacterstudy into its plotrelevant scenes you'd get something like 10 minutes. So yes the movie WOULD be a 10minute GILF porn clip with a touch of generic drama if only there weren't all those fabulous scenes of German landscapes and parks which are intended to give the typical hipsterhatwearing coffeesniffing artfest filmgoer a chance to MUSE over the incredible philosophical ramification of a fat nymphomaniac having sex over the ridiculously underdeveloped characters or simply a chance to go for a leak.If only the lazy filmmaker had had the common sense to make her husband impotent. At least that could've served as some flimsy but somewhat credible excuse for the affair. But no. Her husband is still sexually active AND she enjoys the sex with him whereas it's the new boyfriend who can't always get it up! Sure in many ways this has all the hallmarks of an Ed Wood classic.Her husband  very very very predictably  ends up committing suicide shortly after being ditched by his perpetually wet wife and that's it. What's the point? The message dare I say? Well in terms of feminist logic the message is girls enjoy yourselves indulge your hedonism and by all means screw over your loyal partner if your vagina ever gets that nympho need. For the rest of us the message is more like all you fat ugly selfish bitches should keep your affairs secret  IF you're going to cheat on your husbands.Want more laughs? Read the comments section.".

That said...Without trying to spoil anything it seems that Paul Anderson had no idea where to go with this sequel thus throwing everything out from the last film I wont go into detail while shoving small things from the video game in just to fill time and justify the 'Resident Evil' title. It falls flat and leaves many of the scenes feeling unneeded and forced.My MAIN grudge against REA is the lack of plot. I do like to see a good mindless actionhorror film Machete and Piranha are on my top 10 list already! but this film took itself way too seriously and forgot where the hell it was going at times. Taking a look back at the movie it seemed like nothing happened throughout the whole 96 minutes! The action scenes in my opinion were lame tame dull overdone and the slowmotion wasn't impressing anyone. It came off once again as forced and corny.I'm a fan of the RE videogames and do nitpick but at the same time I've taken the movies for what they are. The first film was great second meh third bad but this one was downright horrible. I'm really not sure I saw the same movie as most of the reviewers here because what I saw was a flashy dull pointless entry in an already dead series.

I'm really not sure I saw the same movie as most of the reviewers here because what I saw was a flashy dull pointless entry in an already dead series. Time to give it a rest Paul.Resident Evil Afterlife gets a 310 's";

The story line confused me again and again.How come Alice survive in that plane crash? She was normal human already! And where is Wesker when Alice leave the crash site? Since when Alice learn to fly? And where is the fuel? Food? Makeup?? The building in LA keep burning for 4 years? The armory has a shaft of something take you to the roof top? Wesker can dodge bullets ok fine he is a superhuman but can't dodge the knife? Here comes the most ridiculous part....what kind of selfdestruction bomb is that? I mean look at the size no way it can blast a ship that huge! OK even it is some kind of alien technology if it was designed to blow the ship would you mount it on a corridor where everyone can touch? Not even you can touch it you can just dismount it with ease and dump it like a grenade?? WHAT KIND OF SELFDESTRUCTION SYSTEM IS IT??? What were they thinking??? Not to mention there is a couple of helicopter there and Claire knew which one Wesker will go aboard! And She knew Wesker will came back after she and Chris punch hundred of holes on Wesker and shut the gate. In conclusion don't pay to watch this movie rent it on DVD or watch it online!".

Adding shallow characters mediocre acting and an incredibly insulting script does not make it better.RE used to work as a zombie movie. While this has arguably gotten a bit old Afterlife is just without purpose. In hindsight it seems to be set up as Alice vs. Wesker or the other way round but it does not work at all. 1. The action scenes do not follow any logic create no climax and are mostly pointless. Some style elements such as matrixslowmotion etc. are placed randomly across the movie without purpose.Start Alice infiltrates Umbrella headquarters killing the first guards close combat. This is about the only decent scene in the whole movie. Reinforcements are then just annihilated by her superpowerlook along with devastating the entire area. Which makes the initial effort to kill people onebyone feel pretty much effort. After that suddenly she has countless clones of herself for support who conveniently all die in a fire when the complex finally explodes. WHAT THE.. !?!? OK. Let's ignore the script it just fails.2. SuspenseCut There is no suspense at all. Things happen. Any chance for suspense is muted by the insane script and the incredibly bad cutting where the scene switches EVERY TIME as soon as anything remotely exciting could be about to develop. 3. VisualsCGI Afterlife has no feel to it. The Umbrella stuff is always brandnew shiny tech and of the outside world we do not see much at all. At the end when they enter the tankerlike ship it promised to be some dark grungy place. Instead EVERYTHING was bright white. Except the helicopters which were just black. Actually it looked like the CGI budget ran out but it could also be that silly intentionally. 4. ActingCharacters Cheesy and generic. Not totally annoying at the best times. Kim Coates wasn't bad in the 2 scenes he got this is not the type of movie he should be in but he is at least interesting.I feel this movie was only pieced together lovelessly to generate some new video game sales.".

	schema:headline " What did you expect?";
	schema:reviewBody "To even begin to describe just how right people were to doubt Mr. Andersons ability to write a script and direct would be a book in itself. His inability to capture the imagination to remain consistent to his own plot to develop characters and a story line that coincides with the overall story even understanding the term continuity is a feat for Hercules alone  obviously. Mr. Anderson's lack of creativity and possibly suffering from short and long term memory loss is abundantly in effect with this farce he's created. He claimed it would 'pull the audience in' when in truth all it did was make people walk out  and people are usually easily pleased but not from where I was sitting.Battle field Earth marries matrix and has an affair with ultra Violet the end result is the bastard child he calls Resident Evil Afterlife.I will pull out just an example of how terrible the plot was by quoting the goof's section and adding a few of my own spoiler next During the final confrontation with Wesker Chris and Claire enter the scene. Wesker addresses them by NAME and states they have become quite an inconvenience. How and when did they do this? Chris has been locked up since the outbreak of the virus and Claire had no impact on Weskers operations in this or the last movie WHATSOEVER.In Andersons mind this was a 'salute' to the fans. THE PROBLEM Mr. Anderson is that when a character has no idea who is who and has NEVER encountered them before the dialog makes absolutely no sense and the 'confrontation' is redundant. Not to mention the entire story is warped. Quite a HUGE thing to escape his mind and I wish it ended there. But the man did not just develop a huge plot hole the entire movie was nothing but plot holes INSIDE plots holes. I never even knew that was possible until now. His only focus was the 3D CAMERA with his wife as the 'little piggy'.Marysue is back and is now the living embodiment of an oxymoron which also isn't possible tech but there you go  and an utter clich. She loses her powers but can still leap 20 feet in the air and kick a tray of sharp objects with absolute accuracy not to mention take blows from GIANT Ax's full on and get up with not even a broken rib let alone a bruise. Oh and there is a stabbing but you'll mistaken it for a tooth pick because it seems even when a blade is run right though the arm of Ms mortal Marysue all you get is a GUH! and it's business as usual.The acting WOODEN and the stunts are ridiculous! Considering it's apparently the real world with no 'jacking into' a massive computer world where basic physics don't apply it's hard to sell and digest just about most of the stunts. The OC meets the Resident Evil characters and the movie is one god awful fan fiction. With plenty of WTF moments and FTS even Micheal Bay would be LHAO as the terribly created explosions and gun shots.

	onyx:emotionText "To even begin to describe just how right people were to doubt Mr. Andersons ability to write a script and direct would be a book in itself. His inability to capture the imagination to remain consistent to his own plot to develop characters and a story line that coincides with the overall story even understanding the term continuity is a feat for Hercules alone  obviously. Mr. Anderson's lack of creativity and possibly suffering from short and long term memory loss is abundantly in effect with this farce he's created. He claimed it would 'pull the audience in' when in truth all it did was make people walk out  and people are usually easily pleased but not from where I was sitting.Battle field Earth marries matrix and has an affair with ultra Violet the end result is the bastard child he calls Resident Evil Afterlife.I will pull out just an example of how terrible the plot was by quoting the goof's section and adding a few of my own spoiler next During the final confrontation with Wesker Chris and Claire enter the scene. Wesker addresses them by NAME and states they have become quite an inconvenience. How and when did they do this? Chris has been locked up since the outbreak of the virus and Claire had no impact on Weskers operations in this or the last movie WHATSOEVER.In Andersons mind this was a 'salute' to the fans. THE PROBLEM Mr. Anderson is that when a character has no idea who is who and has NEVER encountered them before the dialog makes absolutely no sense and the 'confrontation' is redundant. Not to mention the entire story is warped. Quite a HUGE thing to escape his mind and I wish it ended there. But the man did not just develop a huge plot hole the entire movie was nothing but plot holes INSIDE plots holes. I never even knew that was possible until now. His only focus was the 3D CAMERA with his wife as the 'little piggy'.Marysue is back and is now the living embodiment of an oxymoron which also isn't possible tech but there you go  and an utter clich. She loses her powers but can still leap 20 feet in the air and kick a tray of sharp objects with absolute accuracy not to mention take blows from GIANT Ax's full on and get up with not even a broken rib let alone a bruise. Oh and there is a stabbing but you'll mistaken it for a tooth pick because it seems even when a blade is run right though the arm of Ms mortal Marysue all you get is a GUH! and it's business as usual.The acting WOODEN and the stunts are ridiculous! Considering it's apparently the real world with no 'jacking into' a massive computer world where basic physics don't apply it's hard to sell and digest just about most of the stunts. The OC meets the Resident Evil characters and the movie is one god awful fan fiction. With plenty of WTF moments and FTS even Micheal Bay would be LHAO as the terribly created explosions and gun shots. Because even gun fire is digitally created badly resembling old Japanese English dubbed movies with the lips moving and the dialog happening a few min later! WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY GO when making this movie?! the answer 3D.....3D.....THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Slow motion thrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeee deeeeeeeeeeeeeee Really Mr. Anderson if you wanted to molest the camera there are cheaper ways of doing so than getting a production company to cough up millions of dollars rent you their staff and devote more minutes to agonizing slow motion scenes instead of developing THE ACTUAL STORY  and cheat people out of their hard earned money which we desperately need in these hard times.SHAME ON YOU.To those readers who want a good time SAVE YOUR MONEY for marvel and DC because Capcom has seriously misjudged Andersons professional integrity and ability to deliver the only thing he's achieved is proving his doubters right he is a hack.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge fan of Milla Jovovich and the Resident Evil movies. The last one  Resident Evil Extinction  I thought was a great movie and the best in the series so far.So I had to see this latest installment what a disappointing and mediocre movie it turned out to be. The 3D was so fuzzy and distracting throughout the film but even if it hadn't been in fuzzy 3D it still was badly directed and poorly written with hardly any of the signature action scenes and all the actors were very pitiable and amateurish with an exceptionally lame lead villain. Most of the action was blah and boring in routine slow mo cuts. Don't go to see this movie if you want good or creative action scenes or an interesting story.Most of the actors made no impression whatsoever with the exception of Milla and Wentworth Miller of Prison Break fame. And even Wentworth Miller was given little to do he didn't have but a handful of lines in the movie and it was a waste of his considerable talent. I really hope that he does better movies and roles in the future. I think he could become a major movie star but not with appearing in crappy movies like this.I am giving it a generous 5 rating and that is from a fans perspective. If I wasn't a fan I would give this movie a 3.Please let the next Resident Evil have a different director than this sub par effort had and please let it not be in horrifying 3D.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a huge fan of the video game series I've played  completed every Resident Evil game there is and I have 100 trophies of Resident Evil 5.I loved the previous Resident Evil movie trilogy although many fans were disappointed by them because it wasn't to close to the games and Alice is the main character who isn't in any game. The filmmakers can't please everyone when it comes to movies based on video games because if the movie is very similar to the game then people will say that What is the point of the movie when it is just as same as the game? but if it is very different then people will complain that it is not related to the game in any way shape or form. What Paul W.S Anderson has done is created an original story and had the setting of the game in the first film  in this one as well. Which is the best thing to do and he has proved that he is a terrific writer  director he may not be the best filmmaker ever but he does know how to make good movies based on games and he is one of my favourite directors. His two movies Mortal Kombat  Resident Evil are both the best video game adaptations to date.The plot of Resident Evil Afterlife is that it takes place after Extinction and Alice is continuing to look for survivors in world that has been infected by TVirus that has turned into flesh eating zombies plus she wants to take revenge on Albert Wesker and this time she if fully prepared with her clones telekinetic powers and awesome weapons. Fighting Wesker isn't an easy task because he is superhuman himself just like in Resident Evil 5. This instalment is very close to the games and particularly Resident Evil Code Veronica  Resident Evil 5. Those who have played the 2 games will get flashbacks while watching the movie.This was the most anticipated film for me this year and it absolutely did not disappoint me at all. I loved every minute of it right from start to end. Resident Evil Afterlife was relentlessly entertaining exiting and a perfect popcorn movie at the cinema kind. The movie had a great blend of action horror scifi and thriller. This one had a much more postapocalyptic look than in extinction and has amazing special  visual effects in just in a 60 million budget. The monsters were just like in Resident Evil 5 e.g. the zombies look like the majini's with their predator like mouth the executioner and the dogs that split their heads open with teeth inside it. So it was fascinating to see that.The cast was great Milla needs no introduction  is fantastic just like always and she is improving in acting stunts and she doesn't struggle to get the job done because she can do it. Shawn Roberts was a much better Albert Wesker than Jason O'Mara in Extinction.Overall it's not an Oscar winning kind movie  it doesn't need to be. It's a movie for the fans not for critics so ignore their negative reviews but I had a really good time watching it since I am a fan and check it out if you're looking for an entertaining movie and it's a must see if you are a Resident Evil fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alice the eternal Mila Jovovich is back and in multiple copies. Her prime target is the Umbrella Corporation and the now Tvirus enhanced Albert Wesker Shawn Roberts. After a full frontal attack the Umbrella base is left destroyed but the whole batch of Alice clones get blown skyhigh when Wesker manages to fly away unscathed and detonate the plant. Conveniently for the movie the original Alice survives unscathed as a castaway onboard the plane. During a skirmish with Wesker Alice gets injected with a antidote that turns her back to being human but somehow she still manages to survive a terrible plane crash unharmed and keeps her overthetop fighting abilities largely intact. With Wesker dead and Umbrella disposed of Alice returns to the States to search of her friends who left for sanctuary in Alaska only to disappear in mysterious circumstances.In general a much improved instalment of the series and if anything the whole series remains enjoyable if uninventive. In this part Anderson actually outdoes himself and instead of thinking up something original he starts borrowing scenes from other movies. Wesker looks and fights like Neo's twin brother the new zombies bring to mind Blade 2 whilst The Executioner has a disturbing familiarity to Pyramid Head of the Silent Hill franchise. Nonetheless some of the scenes are very memorable with the combat with The Executioner a real highlight for the movie especially given the abrupt ending of the final fight.There may be a bit too many generic elements with this movie but that has never stopped the franchise from being mindless slashemup fun. Even if a somewhat weakly scripted one. Also Alice remains a very likable heroine so no matter how bad the script if she gets proper screen time and a couple of intriguing fights than the movie just never seems to feel like a waste of time.".

The bad guy looks like 'agent Smith' from the Matrix dodges the bullets the same way and pretty much uses the same lines. The scenes on the ship looks fake.

Also don't storm out of theaters right after the credits stay for few minutes and see a MAJOR clue. Milla Jovovich yet again surprises us with her charismatic hardcore action. I cannot imagine anyone else for the role of Alice besides her. Ali Larter didn't had a major role but she also kicked butt! And offcourse if you like Zombies this one has more than the previous parts. The soundtracks of the movie were breathtaking. They literally gave me goosebumps! I'm just not happy that it wasn't long enough. I was hoping for it to be at least 120mins but it was instead 90mins but I guess they are saving it for the next chapter. And yes believe me there will be a next one! I cannot wait to own this movie in BluRay.Go watch it you will not be disappointed!!!".

But for me the games and the previous 3 films had all being about atmosphere this has none at all. It just rambled along until the next slowmotion just for the sake of it scene of which there are a lot id guess 20mins of the film is slow motion.I just don't know what happened to the series as I said I am a huge fan of both the games and the films barred this one of course and can't understand how people can be so happy with this poor rip off of a film. There are so many direct rip off bits from the matrix the obvious ones being the trinity style jump out the window from the trailer and even Wesker looks and moves like an agent.But this said the easiest job in the world is being a critic. I am just so disappointed that it turned out like this but I will just cross my fingers and hope against hope the nest one is a lot lot better.".

I love seeing gorgeous women kick ass I love seeing ridiculous gore I love being smart enough to see that this movie is NOT supposed to be Oscarworthy. If anything this film was more fun than the previous installments there was humor great action and hot chicks. Seriously folks you should have figured this whole film series out after the second one. Don't come in with high expectations. Go with a group of friends and have a good time. If there's one thing that's absolutely incredible it's the 3D. Probably the best since Avatar.

After seeing this one though I think the series is starting to go downhill again. The movie delivers basically what you could expect tons of zombiekilling action some cardboard cutout characters and a useless story. Afterlife succeeds in all of this.Aside from the lead performance by Jovovich I could hardly care less for any of the other actors. One of the unfortunately bad performances actually goes to Wentworth Miller who played an agonizingly hollow Chris Redfield. And the story needed a complete redo because it was almost pointless. One example is the use of the Executioner from the game series. Though I thought his fight with Alice and Claire was cool I was completely puzzled as to what his purpose in the movie was.It does do well in the action sequences including an awesome though short standoff on a rooftop. But some of the action is overdrawn thanks to the ridiculously large amount of slowmotion. If they ran the movie without slowmo I bet the movie would lose half of its running time. XD I also liked the soundtrack by media boys tomandandy and the film's use of 3D really helped during some of the more intense moments.Overall it does have its perks and the 3D's good but this is nothing more than a onetrick pony.

	schema:reviewBody "The script of this ghoulish horror anthology is Robert Bloch at his diabolical best. I only saw this recently I've wanted to see it for quite some time but circumstances conspired and I had to wait for the DVD release. But it was worth it! This film is cartoonish throughout and constantly winks at the audience but it also has an unwavering serious side. It's very sparing on special effects and saves most of what little there is for the last segment and is much more dependent on its actors. From the beginning there is an outrageous overthetop quality that is very reassuringit's confident that it will deliver the horror its audience wants to see. Even the funniest segment starring John Pertwee manages to be rather disturbing. The box says Rated PG  For Scary Images and I must say the sight of a vampiric Ingrid Pitt floating magically through the air towards one of her victims is a very scary image.One of the things I like most about this movie is the way the humor and horror COEXIST in the film. The humor doesn't negate the horror or turn it into a joke. The horror doesn't spoil the humor or make it unfunny. Both elements are able to be taken seriously. Many horror comedies especially modern ones can't demonstrate such deft handling of their own elements. But this one moves in a surefooted way and that's all Robert Bloch. It's clear to me at least that he enjoyed his work because such clear thinking is a sign the writer is having fun.A surprisingly effective horror film from the early 70's that still packs a punch today. I have seen the other Amicus anthology films and they're good but this for some reason is the instant favorite.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another anthology from horror studio Amicus The House That Dripped Blood features four macabre tales written by Psycho author Robert Bloch with a wraparound story in which Detective Inspector Holloway John Bennett investigates the mysterious disappearance of a famous horror moviestar and learns of several other cases all linked to a creepy old house.The first case is that of Charles Hillyer Denholm Elliott a horror novelist who moves into the house to write his next novel Dominick the Strangler. As Hillyer gets stuck into his work he becomes convinced that the titular character from his latest book is stalking him. It's a solid way to kick off the film with Elliot putting in a fine performance and director Peter Duffell delivering plenty of suspense and chills helped no end by Tom Adams as grinning loon Dominick who looks convincingly deranged as he lurks in the shadows.Tale number two Waxworks is my least favourite which I find surprising since it stars Peter Cushing one of my alltime favourite horror actors. Cushing plays retired businessman Philip Grayson one of a pair of old love rivals who lose their heads after paying a visit to a Museum of Horror where one of the exhibits bears an uncanny resemblance to the woman they both loved. Duffell does his best to make something of the weak material using strong red and green lighting to add a sense of the unreal but the result is still rather forgettable.Another horror legendChristopher Leeturns up for tale number three but like Cushing he is unable to turn what is a rather predictable tale into anything special. If you can't guess how this one is going to end by the halfway mark then you clearly haven't seen enough horror films. Lee plays the frightened father of a young girl with a secret Nyree Dawn Porter is the teacher who cannot understand what he is so scared of.For my money the final story offers the most entertainment value and here's why a the story is fun and delivers quite a few genuinely amusing moments with a couple of neat injokes for horror fans b Ingrid Pitt's cleavage is fantastic and c it stars both Worzel Gummidge and The Crowman Jon Pertwee and Geoffrey Bayldon AKA Catweazle. Pertwee is wonderful as pompous horror actor Paul Henderson who buys a cape from Bayldon for his latest role as a vampire the only problem is that whenever he wears the cape he becomes a vampire for real.Pertwee and Pitt pop up again as vampires in the last part of the wraparound tale to attack Holloway who has payed a visit to the house against the advice of estate agent A.J. Stoker John Bryans. Stoker closes the film by finally revealing the secret of the creepy property but the explanation for the supernatural occurrences is something of a damp squib.5.5 out of 10 rounded up to 6 for Pertwee and Pitt.".

	schema:reviewBody "contains very minor spoilers I'm sure the back of the box gives away more!Peter Cushing Christopher Lee Joss Ackland Jon Pertwee...hey this is one heck of a Bmovie cast! All my British friends together in the same horror anthology. Bliss. Mind you I'm generally not too crazy about Amicus films they're more screwedup and cynical than their charming Hammer counterparts. But this time Amicus got it just about right. The quality of the stories is uneven but each has merit.Story 1 is a pretty dull tale about a horror writer played by Indiana Jones' buddy Denholm Elliot who is haunted by one of his fictional creations a strangler called Dominick. There are some interesting twists yeah but the characters are such stereotypes that it's hard to care much about them. And there's really nothing more tedious than writers writing about themselves! Stick with it though there's better stuff to come.Story 2 is probably my favorite. The newlyretired Peter Cushing is haunted by a waxwork figure in a horror museum it bears a striking resemblance to the late love of his life. An old friend played by Joss Ackland a very natural and likable performance arrives and also falls under the wax girl's spell. I didn't really understand this story when I was ten probably because I had not yet learned to pine for inaccessible women. However since then I've been convinced that a wooden figure in a playground was modeled on an ex of mine so suddenly this really resonates! A wonderfully sad lonely tale.Story 3 is also great. Christopher Lee gets to play a sortof good guy a rare treat for his fans his daughter as it turns out is a little sorceress. The contrast between her sweet appearance and evil aims works rather well.Story 4 is...ahem...rather silly actually. It stars Jon Doctor Who Pertwee as a flamboyant horror film star. There's a lot of metahumor in this one for example Pertwee's character complains about having to star in cheap horror movies within the context of...a cheap horror movie called The House that Dripped Blood! Doctor Who was cheap too so one wonders if Pertwee was secretly complaining about his own career. But apparently he was actually spoofing Christopher Lee. The humor is this segment works but it's strange to end such a dark movie with a goofy installment. I also don't know quite how to feel about seeing Jon get hoisted up on clearly visible wires during a flying segment.After a somewhat dodgy epilogue with more Pertwee facingmaking the whole thing wraps up nicely with some cryptic remarks from an estate agent. On to the next British horror cheapie! By their very nature these anthology movies are mixed bags but this is definitely one of the strongest. It's worth a look for the cast alone and the middle two installments are definitely superior horror shorts.".

	schema:headline " A great Amicus anthology but with a few flaws!";
	schema:reviewBody "THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series this would make eight movies. Although that movie is very different from the others.I look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in my teens. My feelings for them today are just as strong.I spent many years trying to track down this movie. The synopses of the stories was so appealing that I went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when I eventually found a copy. As great as though the movie is I did feel a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It wasn't quite as good as I was led to believe. Whilst better than its two predecessors it's nowhere near as good as its four successors as I shall demonstrate.The linking story sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house. His journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants. The linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house. Whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any Amicus anthology. I couldn't help but get the feeling that John Bennett is a poor man's version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role. We could have even had both here  one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent. They could and I believe would have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better.The movie contains four stories each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house.The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories. He is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing. Soon after he begins seeing visions of his own creation. Some excellent direction by Peter Duffell particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script. Elliott's performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story. The story ends with a semitwist but I couldn't help get the sense of a script which didn't allow it to live up to its potential.The second story sees Peter Cushing move into the house. He is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of. Cushing's performance really brings this emotionallymoving story to life. He is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on Cushing's loneliness. This is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside Cushing's mind. Anyway Cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl. Naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing.The third story and easily the best sees Christopher Lee  my favourite horror actor of all time  move into the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here. He shows no love or attention for his daughter at all. He even brings in a school governess to educate her. The governess played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her superb performances tries to find out what is wrong. Without giving too much away I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. Christopher Lee's presence is truly electrifying in every scene he's in. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie. The movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story.The final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that's what matters. Jon Pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house. He is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies seeing everything as cheap and fake particularly the costumes. So he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells Pertwee an ancient cloak. When Pertwee puts the cloak on he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire. Pertwee's performance has to be seen to be believed. It truly is hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger.The linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story. This is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for Pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house. The rest you'll be able to work out for yourself. As weak as the linking story is it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending.I'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with Peter Duffell the director who really does his best with what he's got. I think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies.Overall THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD despite its flaws is a mustsee for fans of the Amicus anthologies fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies.

	onyx:emotionText "THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series this would make eight movies. Although that movie is very different from the others.I look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in my teens. My feelings for them today are just as strong.I spent many years trying to track down this movie. The synopses of the stories was so appealing that I went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when I eventually found a copy. As great as though the movie is I did feel a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It wasn't quite as good as I was led to believe. Whilst better than its two predecessors it's nowhere near as good as its four successors as I shall demonstrate.The linking story sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house. His journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants. The linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house. Whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any Amicus anthology. I couldn't help but get the feeling that John Bennett is a poor man's version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role. We could have even had both here  one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent. They could and I believe would have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better.The movie contains four stories each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house.The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories. He is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing. Soon after he begins seeing visions of his own creation. Some excellent direction by Peter Duffell particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script. Elliott's performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story. The story ends with a semitwist but I couldn't help get the sense of a script which didn't allow it to live up to its potential.The second story sees Peter Cushing move into the house. He is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of. Cushing's performance really brings this emotionallymoving story to life. He is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on Cushing's loneliness. This is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside Cushing's mind. Anyway Cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl. Naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing.The third story and easily the best sees Christopher Lee  my favourite horror actor of all time  move into the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here. He shows no love or attention for his daughter at all. He even brings in a school governess to educate her. The governess played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her superb performances tries to find out what is wrong. Without giving too much away I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. Christopher Lee's presence is truly electrifying in every scene he's in. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie. The movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story.The final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that's what matters. Jon Pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house. He is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies seeing everything as cheap and fake particularly the costumes. So he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells Pertwee an ancient cloak. When Pertwee puts the cloak on he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire. Pertwee's performance has to be seen to be believed. It truly is hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger.The linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story. This is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for Pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house. The rest you'll be able to work out for yourself. As weak as the linking story is it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending.I'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with Peter Duffell the director who really does his best with what he's got.

	schema:reviewBody "Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. I'm not very fond of them myself but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of British horror cinema. The House That Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a Scotland Yard officer by an estate agent.This film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema Peter Cushing Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt whom horror fans will recognise as one of Lee's costars in the greatest British horror film of all time The Wicker Man.The first segment of the film titled Method For Murder tells the story of a horror storywriter whose creation a strangler named Dominic is brought to life by his own imagination. This story builds suspense very well through his girlfriend he and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination. This story certainly isn't very original but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise.The second story titled Waxworks stars Peter Cushing and is my least favourite of the four. This tale follows the story of Phillip Grayson Cushing a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in. Inside he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess. Quite what the woman's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details. Cushing is later joined by his friend Neville Rogers played by Joss Ackland and that's when the tale really starts to pick up. The setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isn't a new idea the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent 1966 horror film Chamber of Horrors. Although the one here isn't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia brought about by the limited area of the museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch and seeing him avoid an axewielding madman is a treat for the horror fan. Despite being my least favourite this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down.The film continues with Sweets for the Sweet which is without doubt the best of the omnibus. This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out. It leaves the audience guessing we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter but we don't know who or what it is. Christopher Lee as usual portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll and the fact that she isn't allowed to go to school or have any toys. The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end epitomised by the truly chilling line in which Lee tells his babysitter that he is in fact afraid of his daughter. The ending to this section is superbly played out in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told and will stay with you long after the end credits roll.The omnibus finishes with The Cloak which is definitely the most comedic of the four. This tale is about a hammy horror film star that unimpressed by his latest film's technical side goes out and buys himself a cloak. Naturally this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak. Unlike the other three tales this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs. That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. The ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film. Also look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula. A nice touch I think.Overall if you want a horror omnibus you really cant go wrong with The House that Dripped Blood. The third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical Scotland Yard investigator Holloway John Bennett as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped blood.One can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is The House That Dripped Blood'. This Seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers. Incredibly the number of depictions of violence onscreen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence. In a rare feature of early Seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless from the faultless performances of the starstudded cast featuring the legendary Peter Cushing Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of Peter Duffell and master of the macabre writer Robert Bloch the author of the novel Psycho'. The only real complaints that one may have with The House That Dripped Blood' are the somewhat asinine plottwists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.The first segment entitled Method for Murder' tells the story of Charles Hillyer Denholm Elliott a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel. While working on the novel Hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality. Elliott's performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability. The key to this segment as with the others is the mystery surrounding the events that take place. The viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of Dominic is merely a hallucination a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there. Duffell's direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthralling.The following segment features Peter Cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house. During a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in. While there he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him. Cushing's character Philip is then joined by his friend Neville Joss Ackland who also wishes to visit the museum much to the dismay of Philip. In this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark. There is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story. Duffell's direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting Waxworks' is still a delightful entry into the film.Waxworks' is followed by what is in my opinion the greatest of the four segments  Sweets to the Sweet'. Christopher Lee stars as John Reid the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny Ann Norton Nyree Dawn Porter. However John appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family. Sweets to the Sweet' is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer. Throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place. This is the best example of how Duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great. Accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack Sweets to the Sweet' is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease. Personally I believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and I would give this segment a rare 1010.The film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in. Jon Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie. Pertwee's character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries. However strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst. This segment which places the inspector amongst the events is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology. Although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is in a way what makes the story so enjoyable. Unfortunately there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features. Horror buffs should definitely look out for Pertwee's brief comment on Bela Lugosi's and Christopher Lee's portrayal of Dracula. This slightly comical and lighthearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspensedriven horror.To sum up The House That Dripped Blood' is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast great stories and above par direction. There are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely. My rating for The House That Dripped Blood'  810.".

This slightly comical and lighthearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspensedriven horror.To sum up The House That Dripped Blood' is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast great stories and above par direction. There are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely. My rating for The House That Dripped Blood'  810.";

The last is an out and out comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt both chewing the scenery and a cape that turns people into vampires! There's also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula.This is a good horror anthologynothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills. Also the fourth one is actually very funny and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire! Also the house itself looks beautiful...and very creepy. It's welldirected with some nice atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual movie score too. All in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out. Try to see it on DVDthe Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fun horror anthology film from Amicus. I love these types of movies and this one is especially good thanks in large part to the terrific cast. It begins with a wraparound story about a Scotland Yard inspector investigating the disappearance of a movie star renting an old country house. The inspector hears stories about the house's history from a real estate agent and those stories are the different segments of the film.Method for Murder is the first one. It's about a horror novelist Denholm Elliott who overcomes writer's block while staying at the house. He creates a strangler character that will be the focus of his next book. Things get crazy when it appears the strangler has come to life and is trying to torment the author. A good story to start with. It has a fine performance by Elliott some nice atmosphere and a creepy makeup job on the strangler. The ending is great. In the second story Waxworks Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland play friends who become obsessed with a figure in a wax museum that resembles the woman they both loved years before. This is the weakest segment in the movie despite nice performances from Cushing and Ackland. The story builds to a disappointing ending. The third story Sweets to the Sweet has Christopher Lee hiring a private teacher for his young daughter. The teacher Nyree Dawn Porter disapproves of the harsh way Lee treats the girl. But soon she comes to realize there's more to this little girl than it appears. This is a good segment. Lee's always enjoyable to watch and Chloe Franks does a great job as the daughter. The Cloak is the final and best story. It ties back into the wraparound directly telling the story of the missing horror movie actor Jon Pertwee that the inspector is searching for. The actor buys a black cloak from a strange shop to wear in his next movie where he plays a vampire. Turns out the cloak has a dark power over its wearer. Jon Pertwee is terrific and sexy Ingrid Pitt is easy on the eyes. This story is lots of fun with a nice amount of humor throughout. On the whole it's a good movie. The music score is especially nice. It's not the best horror anthology movie Amicus put out but it's entertaining enough. If you enjoy these types of movie I'm pretty sure you will like this one.".

It had been preceded by Dr. Terror's House of Horrors and Torture Garden and would soon be followed by Asylum Tales From the Crypt Vault of Horror and From Beyond the Grave. Here a Scotland Yard investigator searches for a missing film star and listens to four stories concerning the quaint old country house that he had been leasing.

A surreal dream sequence and the film's most grisly windup are the hallmarks of this section. In Sweets to the Sweet Christopher Lee Mr. Tall Dark and Gruesome who sadly shares no screen time in this film with Cushing is the house's next occupant a widower who lives in mortal fear of his pretty young daughter the remarkable child actress Chloe Franks...and as it turns out for good reason! Finally in The Cloak we learn of the fate of that missing film star Jon Pertwee who buys an actual vampire cloak to assist himself in a new production and soon changes into a...guess what? This segment is easily the most humorous of the bunch and contains the film's single funniest line when Pertwee compares Bela Lugosi to this new fellow.

	schema:reviewBody "Amicus Studios was the biggest competitor to Hammer in the heyday of British horror during the 60s and 70s. While their movies never quite achieved the same cult status as Hammer's Amicus cared themselves out a niche at producing excellent horror anthologies that are still some of the best ever produced. Unlike some of the later Amicus anthologies which were created by using the works of EC Comics this movie was written by Robert Bloch a wellknown horror writer at the time who is best remembered for penning PSYCHO.This movie stands out from many other anthologies for a few reasons. For one I don't see a weak link segment. Most any anthology you can think of had a throwaway part or two mixed with some excellent work but the stories are all of a good caliber in this movie. The other thing that really stands out is the cast which is comprised of a slew of Brit Horror allstars including Peter Cushing Christopher Lee and the luscious Ingrid Pitt along with Indiana Jones' best buddy and a former Dr. Who.The drawback of the movie in my opinion is that it is often very stage bound. There aren't many extravagant sets and locales here and nothing that approaches the lavish sets of Hammer's movies. You often get the feeling that you're watching a stage play but the directing and acting are able to elevate the work beyond those confines.Of course you have a wraparound framework story here involving a Scotland Yard detective who's investigating a murder at the titular house. For the interlocking segments this amounts to nothing more than brief interludes but the story provides the movie's last big shock. Amicus would provide better framework stories in some of their later anthologies.Method for Murder is the first segment with Denholm Elliot as a horror writer with a case of writer's block who rents the house for inspiration and gets more than he bargained for. It actually has quite a bit in common with the Johnny Depp movie SECRET WINDOW. It's held back due to a poor makeup job on the killer and a bad clich twist with your standard backstabbing wife.Waxworks stars Cushing who is excellent here as he is in every role given to him. Two old friends rivals find a small wax museum and become obsessed with a statue that reminds them of their lost love. Cushing saves the segment from becoming nothing more than a clone of HOUSE OF WAX.Sweets to the Sweet is an evil child story starring Christopher Lee in a rare nonvillainous role. It's probably my least favorite segment in the movie as it takes a while to get rolling and leads up to a fairly boring climax as well.The Cloak is the best segment involving an aging horror actor John Pertwee who really takes on his role. It's more than a little campy and has a PG vampire tone but it's fun and well worth it if for nothing more than Ingrid Pitt.Amicus would produce better anthologies in the years to follow this including their best work TALES FROM THE CRYPT but this works very well as a Saturday Midnight movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is good for what it is and unpretentious I wouldn't watch it twice however I am a Peter Cushing completist and that's why I watched it. The best asset of this movie is BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar movies it does NOT drag its feet forever as each of the four plus one segments lasts under 30 minutes with the last under 10. Good uncanny vibes. In the first segment horror writer suffering from 'writer's block' relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration. He finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen. Plot contrivance similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of the pointofview twist is the writer getting mentally ill...or as the ending shows his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband's phobias to drive him mad  secure his estates...yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan?In the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth which had once separated them. From the Gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer...or was she?The third segment was the less interesting to me.The fourth shows a horror movies actor who thinks he's the best of all sunken to the depths of low budget C movies. Seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire he gets the real deal. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two.Acting is fair with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it. Good movie taken with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing nor Lee...but worth watching.".

He finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen. Plot contrivance similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of the pointofview twist is the writer getting mentally ill...or as the ending shows his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband's phobias to drive him mad  secure his estates...yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan?In the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth which had once separated them. From the Gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer...or was she?The third segment was the less interesting to me.The fourth shows a horror movies actor who thinks he's the best of all sunken to the depths of low budget C movies. Seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire he gets the real deal. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two.Acting is fair with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it. Good movie taken with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing nor Lee...but worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is another horror anthology.  It is rather good but it could have used a bit more.  I compare it to Doctor Terror's House of Horrors though in this one the title fits.  It has four stories all somewhat connected by a house.  The first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in.  He creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house.  This one is sort of predictable but it does throw a few twists in the end.  The next story is a bit more unpredictable and you really do not know where the heck it is going.  This one features Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch.  This guy buys the house but it is not the house that takes center stage but a rather strange wax museum.  The third story starts out rather good and features Christopher Lee.  This one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter.  The problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough.  It drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion.  Then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop.  The actor really gets what he paid for.  Then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened.  Though I was not very satisfied with the explanation as I don't think it really explained Cushing's story much at all.  I think they needed a bit more back story for that one.  All in all though it was an interesting set of stories.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Delightfully Macabre Horror Anthology From Amicus";
	schema:reviewBody "The British production company Amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies and this great omnibus called The House That Dripped Blood is doubtlessly the finest Amicus production I've seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that I have yet to see though. The House That Dripped Blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion. These four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully Gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable. Peter Cushing Christopher Lee Cushing and Lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as Denholm Elliott and the ravishing Ingrid Pitt star in this film  so which true Horror fan could possibly afford to miss it? No one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast. The House That Dripped Blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening. In four parts the film tells the tales of four different heirs.The first tale Method For Murder tells the story of Horror novelist Charles Hyller Denholm Elliott who moves into the House with his wife. After moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation... The first segment is a great kickoff to the film. The story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good.In the second story Waxworks retired businessman Phillip Grayson Peter Cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious Wax Museum in the nearby town... The great Peter Cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good. The tale is delightfully weird and the secondbest of the film after the third.The third tale Sweets To The Sweet is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four. John Reed Christopher Lee moves in with his little daughter. The private teacher and nanny Mrs. Norton whom Mr. Reed has employed to instruct his daughter is appalled about her employer's strictness towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective father's views on upbringing may have... This best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot. Christopher Lee is as always superb in his role. Nyree Dawn Porter is also very good as the nanny and my special praise goes to then 11yearold Chloe Franks. This ingenious segment alone makes the film a mustsee for every true Horrorfan.In the fourth segment Horroractor Paul Henderson Jon Pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistresscostar Carla Ingrid Pitt. This fourth story is satire more than it is actually Horror. It is a highly amusing satire however and there are many allusions to other Horror films. At one point Henderson indirectly refers to Christopher Lee who stars in the previous third segment...All four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere. As stated above the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous Horror tales that every Horror lover should appreciate. An igenious atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a mustsee. In Short The House That Dripped Blood is an excellent Horroromnibus that no lover of British Horror could possibly afford to miss. Highly Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS included This film surely is the best Amicus production I've seen so far even though I still have quite a few to check out. The House that Dripped Blood is a horroromnibusan anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious hellish house in the British countryside. A common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate talesPeter Duffel's film wisely doesn't pay too much attention to that. It simply handles about a Scotland Yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before. All four stories in this film are of high qualitylevel and together they make a perfect wholesome. High expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch! Yes the same Bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone Psycho' We're also marking Peter Duffel's solid and very professional debut as a director. The four stories  chapters if you will  in the House that Dripped Blood contain a good diversity in topics but they're almost equally chilling and eerie. Number one handles about a horrorauthor who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book. This starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination. The idea in this tale isn't exactly originalbut it's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising. The second story stars Hammer horrorlegend Peter Cushing as a retired stockbroker. Still haunted by the image of an unreachable and longlost love he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her.  Cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of Wax Museums isn't new  this story looks overall fresh and innovating. This chapter also contains a couple of delightful shockmoments and there's a constant tense atmosphere. It's a terrific warmup for what is arguably the BEST story number 3. Another legendary actor in this one as Christopher Lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father. He's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world. Not without reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo. Besides great acting by Lee and the remarkable performance of Chloe Franks as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere! The devilish undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror. The fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampirecloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that. There's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to costar Christopher Lee in the Dracula series! Most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous Ingrid Pitt! The cultqueen from The Vampire Lovers' certainly is one of the many highlights in the filmher cleavage in particular. No doubt about itThe House that Dripped Blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans. I truly believe that with a bit of moodsettling preparations this could actually be one of the few movies that'll terrify you and leave a big impression. Intelligent and compelling horror like it should be! Highly recommended. One extra little remark though this film may notrepeat MAY NOT under any circumstances be confused with The Dorm that Dripped Blood'. This latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film except for the title it stole.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nononsense Inspector Hollaway a solid turn by John Bennett investigates the disappearance of a famous thespian and uncovers the wicked past history of a creepy old house. First and most mundane tale Method for Murder  Successful author Charles Hillyer nicely played by Denholm Elliott is haunted by images of the murderous fiend he's writing about in his latest book. Although this particular outing is too obvious and predictable to be anything special it does nonetheless build to a real dilly of a genuine surprise ending. Second and most poignant anecdote Waxworks  Lonely Philip Grayson the always outstanding Peter Cushing and his equally lonesome friend Neville Rogers the splendid Joss Ackland both become infatuated with the beguiling wax statue of a beautiful but lethal murderess. Third and most chilling vignette Sweets to the Sweet  Quiet reserved and secretive widower John Reid a typically terrific Christopher Lee in a rare semisympathetic role hires nanny Ann Norton the fine Nyree Dawn Porter to take care of his seemingly cute and harmless daughter Jane a remarkably spooky and unnerving performance by the adorable Chloe Franks. This standout scary episode is given a substantial disturbing boost by the exceptional acting from gifted child actress Franks who projects a truly unsettling sense of serene evil lurking just underneath a deceptively sweet and innocent angelic veneer. Fourth and most amusing yarn The Cloak  Pompous horror movie star Paul Henderson delightfully essayed to the haughty hilt by Jon Pertwee purchases a mysterious cloak that causes him to transform into a vampire whenever he wears it. This item makes for good silly fun and further benefits from the awesomely pulchritudinous presence of the luscious Ingrid Pitt as enticing vampiress Carla. Director Peter Duffell working from a deliciously macabre and witty script by noted horror scribe Robert Bloch maintains a snappy pace throughout and does an ace job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere. Kudos are also in order for Ray Parslow's crisp cinematography and the shuddery score by Michael Dress. Highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare.".

Franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since Martin Stephens in The Innocents. This installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring offscreen is a moment of purest horror.Method of Murder is about a horror novelist Denholm Elliott who is menaced by one of his own creations the creepy Dominic. This episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror. Dominic may or may not be real so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. The brief shots of Dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting.The original poster art featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding Peter Cushing's severed head was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear.".

It's a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly oldfashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates all tied together by a wraparound story about a Scotland Yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star. It starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film starand what he does to the inspector. It's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing Christopher Lee Denholm Elliott Joss Ackland Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just don't answer the phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the English countryside".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a remake of the classic Joe D'amato George Eastman film Anthropophagus. The movie is about a man wife and child who are shipwrecked out at sea. After days without any food the man goes crazy and eats his family. Upon return to his home town the little boat they were on somehow brought him back he murders and eats everyone in the town. Sometime later a group of tourists come to the town only to discover the horror of what has happened.This was a good remake in many ways and a bad in only a few. First I should start with the gore. The original film was gory for the time but pales in comparison to a movie like The Beyond or Zombi 2. The remake however is one of the goriest films ever. Schnaas takes the role of the beast in the movie and kills people in many innovative ways. For instance he bashes someones face in literally with a rock and then disembowels him. Then a later scene he gains the power to remove a womens head with his own hands making it look pretty easy. And of course two of the most controversial scenes are in the movie taken right from the original.Second the acting was actually not bad for a movie filmed with what looks like a camcorder. The main stars of the movie play their roles appropriately even if the script is a bit dry.Now my only complaint with this film was it was missing the utter dread that made the original movie so good. This movie is not creepy at all. Although I will say it's always dreadful to see someone being chopped to pieces with an ax but I am mainly talking about the atmosphere. It was very bland but the movie more than makes up for it with the gore scenes which lets's face it make this movie.I would have to say I love this film and recommend it to anyone that is a shockgore fanatic. 810 stars".

I've heard a lot about Schnaas but this was the first film of his I've seen. He's got quite a reputation for gore and the film doesn't disappoint on that level. There are all sorts of insanely violent scenes with tons of gore but the special effects are so incredibly poor that you can't help but laugh at them. It's that laughter that gives this film its charm ala an Ed Wood movie. Technically speaking everything here is pretty horrid and doesn't hold a candle to the original flick. The famous abortion scene is also done here but not nearly as well.".

The here here is so fact and frantic that there's little stopping it from unleashing a multitude of fine gore effects from the next one as these scenes manage to setup the absolutely amazing finale that oneups the original in excessive gore combined with the big action that comes along throughout here as this has a fine series of scenes that build up really well. There's some excessively fun action scenes in here that makeup the blistering pace here with several great escape chases through the abandoned town and out into the surrounding woods where they get into close encounters here even managing several scenes here that outdo the original as the pregnant friend slaughter the great brawl with the killer as the remaining friends engage in a long showdown and the wraparound here in the caves gives this a great sense of fun. Along with some rather fine Gothicflavored suspense scenes these hold this one up over it's few minor flaws. The main problem here is the same prototypical problem the other German splatter efforts feature as the ludicrously lowbudget effects here give themselves away on nearly every occasion as the use of plastic mannequin heads for the bodily dismemberment rarely matches up with the performer in terms of facial features while the rough edges and plastered skin look ridiculously fake before the fake blood and intestines get featured.

	schema:reviewBody "Anthropophagous 2000 is a German movie from 1999 so two more years and this one will have its 20th anniversary here. If you read the name of director Andreas Schnaas you already know what you are in for with this one even if he isn't the writer this time. This is a mix of horror and thriller about a killer who takes out the good guys one by one or at least tries to. Admittedly you need to say about Schnaas' effort that he maybe isn't the worst component here. The actors were abysmal at times with their line delivery. There is a certain kind of approach to the word amateur filmmaker that makes some people appreciate it but being called as such is certainly no achievement especially if you have been in film already for a decade or longer as was Schnaas when he made this one. And after all amateurish is not exactly a description you wanna go for as it's an entirely negative association. Now about this film here this is a tribute by Schnaas for the death of another filmmaker Joe D'Amato from Italy and I don't know how bad or good the original Anthropophagous was but honestly it may have been good that D'Amato did not live to see this really horrible film we have here. It really sucked in all departments. Anything positive I can say? That it only runs for 75 minutes and this already includes credits. Oh yeah and that Asian redhead chick early on was pretty nice. Obviously not enough to make up for all the flaws. Stay far far away from this one.".

When Andreas Schnaas is good he is very good but when he's bad he's rotten.The film has its strong points 1 The atmosphere is creepy and suspenseful. 2 The violence is brutal and plentiful. 3 There are enough surprises to keep viewers interested especially if you are familiar with the original Joe D'Amato classic. 4 Andreas Schnaas is very good as the Grim Reaper at least he tries his best to make a solid performance.But there are also weak points. To name the most important ones1 The major letdown is the lack of realistic gore. The gore effects in Anthropophagous 2000 are of very uneven quality some are quite impressive while others are cheesy to the point of offense to the viewer. Was Schnaas distracted by other projects while he was making this or did he run out of money or did he simply lose interest?2 The sex scenes are laughable. How people are supposed to have sex with their under and outerwear on and how we are supposed to believe they're having sex is beyond me. I'm not asking for Andreas Bethmann type explicitness but those scenes just don't work.These drawbacks aside Anthropophagous 2000 is a nice effort. It's brutal it's gory and it's definitely worth a look  or maybe two. But it could have been better.".

The dare I say dialogue is laughably bad and sometimes totally inaudible. After the scummy sex scene they are both murdered by our main antagonist Nikos Karamanlis. The sex is ugly the gore is over the top and the acting is ludicrous but you knew that already.The question is is it worth it?No. D'Amato's films were pretty terrible but like many other video nasties and exploitation films from that time they have a certain twisted charm especially some of the soundtracks.'Anthropophagous 2000' has virtually no redeeming qualities. You will probably laugh a few times but I doubt that was Schnaas intention. The exposition delivered by the titular cannibal in particular is just unbelievably bad.Not uncommon for Schnaas.

Even if its contemporary satirical intent is perhaps overstated the film is a real pleasure to watch  most notably for poor Lizzi Waldmueller who was killed by shellfire towards the end of World War Two and who here sings the film's catchy theme 'You have luck with the girls Bel Ami' surrounded by a bevy of cartwheeling cancan dancers.

	schema:reviewBody "The Fruit Is Ripe isn't a bad quality film about a sexy and bold student who isn't afraid to be naked around rich Daddy's friends or flash her breasts at passers by or anyone for that matter. Instead of going back to college in Munich our little beauty Patricia trades her airline tickets to a more needy couple at the airport and it's off to Greece with rich Daddy and Mummy's spondouli. There's a really great use of locations in this film particularly the Greek Isles where most of the story is set. Some shots are ultimately breathtaking you almost feel you are there or wish you were there. This is worth the watch alone. But back to our story Our naughty and cute Patricia steals a middle aged playboy from the airport with her wife running after him in tow. Back at his lavish home basking in the sun naked on a lazyboy she makes out with the guy. A cute moment is when she disrupts a pre kiss by asking him Are you married. Of course he's gonna say No. Anyone would. Now half naked from the waist up she hails a taxi causing a collision. She steals a car from two sex hungry studs then parks it illegally causing them some pretty hefty fines. She helps herself to a couple's food while watching them make love in the dark. Ultimately our brazen little tease falls in love with a handsome sailor and from there the story kicks in. I'm not gonna disclose anymore but this is one of Roadshow Vibrant Video's better titles. Verges is such a tease though I did find her annoying at times. May'be it was her flamboyance or she was just too much I'm not sure but you can't help liking her character. It's her independence that most viewers would envy. The sex in this is restrained. It's more nudity and what a beautiful site Betty Verges is from the moment she slips out the pool at the film's start. I think the underlying message in The Fruit Is Ripe is 'Be who you are go for it and don't let anyone hold you back'. Deep down we all wanna be like Patricia but the majority of us just haven't got the guts to admit it and sadly never will. A high point that stays with me in this film is the male of that couple Patricia befriends as he sings Leaving Traces in the Sand while they sit around the campfire.".

Back at his lavish home basking in the sun naked on a lazyboy she makes out with the guy. A cute moment is when she disrupts a pre kiss by asking him Are you married. Of course he's gonna say No. Anyone would. Now half naked from the waist up she hails a taxi causing a collision. She steals a car from two sex hungry studs then parks it illegally causing them some pretty hefty fines. She helps herself to a couple's food while watching them make love in the dark. Ultimately our brazen little tease falls in love with a handsome sailor and from there the story kicks in. I'm not gonna disclose anymore but this is one of Roadshow Vibrant Video's better titles. Verges is such a tease though I did find her annoying at times. May'be it was her flamboyance or she was just too much I'm not sure but you can't help liking her character. It's her independence that most viewers would envy. The sex in this is restrained. It's more nudity and what a beautiful site Betty Verges is from the moment she slips out the pool at the film's start. I think the underlying message in The Fruit Is Ripe is 'Be who you are go for it and don't let anyone hold you back'. Deep down we all wanna be like Patricia but the majority of us just haven't got the guts to admit it and sadly never will. A high point that stays with me in this film is the male of that couple Patricia befriends as he sings Leaving Traces in the Sand while they sit around the campfire.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm normally pretty indulgent with these 1970's European subEmannuelle softcore sex films but this one is even more stupid than usual and pretty annoying to boot. I watched it mainly for Olivia Pascal but she doesn't show up until more the halfway through playing a nude model with whom the main protagonist is working and with whom she hatches a cockamamie plot to convert a handsome but gay photographer. The main protagonist is played by one Betty Virges. She is a nineteenyearold college student first seen skinnydipping in a pool while the local priest is over for tea who is vacationing in Greece with her parents. Her indulgent parents both give her money and send her to the airport to return to school in Munich but she gives away her ticket and embarks on a mostly sexual odyssey around Greece narrating the whole thing on her portable tape recorder.Virges has a very nice body which you get to see a whole lot of but she is saddled with a truly stupid and annoying character. She comes on to a lot of unattractive middleage guys for instance for no real reason then complains into her tape recorder about how lecherous they are. She stupidly hops in a car with two creeps and is very nearly raped. She falls in love at one point but after her supposed lover gets jealous about a Greek guy that's showing her too much attention and storms off she proves him right by immediately going to bed with the guy later she also takes a bath with her beau's roommate for no apparent reason and makes fun of the poor guy's equipment. This movie seems to want to be some kind of freespirited swinging feminist thing in the spirit of Emmanuelle Arsan or Erica Jong but the character is mostly just hateful coming across as both a malicious tease AND a braindead slut. And I don't even want to talk about the horrible music on the soundtrack. . .See this film if you must but I would recommend instead any of the Emmanuelle films especially the ones with Laura Gemser Vanessa with Olivia Pascal or Avere Vent'anni which has a very similar plot to this one but is infinitely better. I enjoy these kind of films generally but I can't recommend this one I'm afraid.".

But the really embarrassing play on words in the title here already gives the direction of this film it is very much trash probably only a good watch if you are horny and find lead actress Betty Vergs attractive. This was her first work and looking at her performance here in terms of range and talent it is not a surprise at all that her career as an actress was really shortlived. You see some boobs here and sex scenes but it is all not too explicit so I would not categorize it as porn really. But it is not an artistic achievement by any means either and I personally did not like that the film relies on one actress completely. Maybe some hot scenes with other actresses would have been nice for diversity. Overall it is a pretty weak film from the sexual revolution in German filmmaking. I give it a thumbs down.

	schema:reviewBody "This was a poor movie. Heather Graham did a very poor role. During the movie i didn't even once feel her character. She acted like a psycho from the start to the very end. The soundtrack of the movie was plain and boring. The other actors were quite good and convincing. Mia Kirshner did a very good job as a supporting actress.

For whatever reasons nerdy gore loving teenage boys never really bit down on 'Teeth probably because that movie's gay male director and writer infested the flick with too much yeasty pretension and not enough potent gore.Miss Conception to its credit for a movie of its type written by two women presumably heterosexual has no pretensions at all. It's a thoroughbred chick flick and makes no apologies for itself. There is nothing tentative about it and the only guilt it seeks to induce is the guilty pleasure of its post feminist schlocky plot. That concerns a 34 year old successful business woman who owns a construction company believe it or not about to undergo a precocious menopause and her frantic quest to mate when the last egg drops.After she visits a quack gynecologist who tells her that her next period will be her last one she carefully plans how she will manage to impregnate herself with typically improbable screwball results. A beautiful woman has four whole days to get bred and all she can manage to land as prospective bedmates are gay men and her hunky foreman whose been rendered sterile by the mumps. Even her vial of mail order sperm winds up misfired by a turkey baster onto her 34th birthday cake in a really silly scene. Her last hope is her former boyfriend whom she really loves and wants to father her child. She dumped him earlier because he doesn't want kids only now she makes one last attempt at getting his pee pee inside her unsheathed before time runs out. That turns out to be really hard because he goes to Ireland to shoot a movie and will be gone the whole four days unless she can get him on the phone and stop the bimbo female producer with him and after him from pulling out all her stops to make sure he never gets back in time to put in.This movie views as silly as a synopsis of the plot reads.

Here is no exception the premise could have been unique but is not it could have brought about some very genuinely funny moments but does not in fact like Heather Graham this film does nothing more then it's simple story requires. In fact what is scary is that in most romantic comedies I feel it's the pointless supporting cast the can kill a film a take screen times away from your leads.

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently Georgina Salt's biological clock has been ticking a great deal faster than she ever could have imagined. For upon visiting a fertility clinic the attractive young woman Heather Graham learns that she has only two weeks to go before her ovaries dry up rendering her forever unable to have a baby. The problem is that her longtime boyfriend Tom Ellis has no desire to be a daddy so Georgina is forced to look elsewhere for spermdonor options. Her search leads her to employ all sorts of desperate measures including advertising for a lodger picking off mourners at a funeral hooking up with a musclebound exotic dancer succumbing to the advances of a horny employee pressuring her gay best friend to perform the service and when all else fails even turning to a semenfilled turkey baster to get the job done.Directed by Eric Styles Miss Conception is a modestly amusing little British comedy filled with pleasant moments and droll performances though frankly nothing in it is quite as teasy or clever as its punny title. On a sociopolitical level the movie squares things with the feminists in the audience by counterbalancing Georgina's obsession with having a baby with the fact that she runs her own construction company. The onenote premise does lead to some contrivance and repetitiousness in the plotting but the performances and consistently upbeat tone offset some of the movie's weaknesses.".

Yes it's embarrassing and awkward. Yes it's corny and predictable. But it's a British sitcom. What do you expect? I initially saw a little of this film via a very poor quality download. It was frankly unwatchable. That was about three years ago. As it starred a couple of my favourite actresses Heather Graham and Mia Kirschner it's been nagging me ever since.So I tried to track it down and found that it's unavailable in the UK. There are no Region 2 copies in existence. As far as I know it's never been on the telly. It recently came to mind again so I checked Amazon and discovered that I could import it from the States for less than the price of a typical DVD in the UK.So my question is this? Why do I have to import a film from across the Atlantic when it's set in London and Ireland and where the majority of the actors and the director and crew are British? To add to the irony the two main British characters are played by Americans and an American character is played by a Brit! Just crazy!Despite being a pukka DVD the picture quality has that strange jerky motion as if it was being received from a transAtlantic satellite. Other than that technical irritation I liked the photography and the music and the fauxBritish accents are not as bad as some people say they are  honest! The plot is cringeworthy and could have been resolved at several points along the way if it weren't for ridiculous hurdles placed in the way as a device to make up 104 minutes.It deserves more than 4.5 out of 10.Knowing my luck after importing the DVD it'll be shown on UK TV in the next couple of weeks.Edit I forgot to add that there are no British men called Zachary. Zak is an American name. Feel free to prove me wrong but I'm right. ".

Since she has been in love with a nice man Zak Tom Ellis for six years she has a fathertobe in waiting. But horrors! At a gathering of relatives to celebrate the birth of Zak's sister's daughter Georgina is appalled that Zak is less than enthusiastic about his new niece and that he blames a broken bit of sculpture on his preschooler nephew instead of confessing his own guilt. Once back in the car they fight and Zak moves in with a friend. The next day Georgina relents knowing her desperation for pregnancy and tries to contact Zak. But alas he is on assignment at some remote island without cellphone reception and WITH a pretty coworker. Now Georgina has to find a new man fast so her friends help her plot out some ideas. From heading toward the funeral of a young skydiver placing an ad to sublet her apartment to a young male or looking twice at the burly man at work Georgina is racing against her biological clock. Can she succeed in getting what she wants? This is a fine view for romcom fans everywhere for the plot is funny and clever. Just watching Georgina hook up with her handsome coworker only to find out at a critical moment that he has had the mumps and is now shooting blanks is truly comical. But that's not the only good mo as the plot is one zany encounter after another. The cast is really nice with Graham Ellis Mia Kirchner and others doing a great job. What a treat to see Nicholas Le Prevost as the infertility doctor years after his nice turn in The Jewel in the Crown. Sets costumes direction and productions niceties are also fine. So if you love those funny tales of love be assured that you will find this one to be a hit and not a miss. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stolen Kisses for me has got to be one the most beautiful film ever made. All of the films in the Antoine Doinel cycle are brilliant even the halfbaked Love On The Run is still quite enjoyable. But Stolen Kisses hits a spot which films seem to never hit. It captures an age of awkwardness that seems to be ignored...the early twenties. Not like a typical high school or after college film ie Risky Business or Graduate Stolen Kisses is about learning the survival skills to make it to adulthood whether it's keeping a job or making it in love. Antoine Doinel is in the third cycle of the series 400 Blows and Love At Twenty Antoine And Collette being it's predecessor and Antoine has just been dishonourably discharged from the army for being of unstable character. Antoine haphazzardly begins to go through jobs trying to find his nitch in life while being obsessed with love. He begins as a nightwatchman of a hotel to being a private detective of Blady's which puts him as a planted spy in Monsieur Tobard's Shoe Shop and finally settling down as an accident prone TV Repair man. Antoine is the awkward antihero youth of the sixties. During the 68' Paris riots which were unbelievably carrying on during the filming the youth of France had a sort of displaced position in the work force. Antoine superbly played by JeanPierre Leaud typlifies this kind of youth. He is full of nervous energy politically working class is love lorn and uneducated. He is full of human qualities that are real and relateable. He lies he loves he fails and he succeeds. He is just as much as the everyman of France as Jimmy Stewart was in America. But interestingly where he has once resembled director Francois Truffaut in the earlier works he now was metamorphasising into JeanPierre Leaud's character but resembling Truffaut more in look. Antoine Doinel was never meant to be just Truffaut but Leaud as well. And the confusion of this identity is brilliantly displayed as Antoine confirms his identity by manically reciting his name in a mirror displaying his search for identity to the point of near madness. The beautiful Clade Jade gives an underated performance as the hip bourgoise student that makes Antoine's obsessiveness seem somehow justified. The girl that is loved best by Antoine when out of reach. The film also has a theme about the differing strengths of love. When Antoine is in love with Christine she doesn't love him. When Antoine loves Fabienne the shoe shop's owner's wife Christine is in love with Antoine. Every character is immersed in a love triangle. And asks the question Does love really ever exist on an equal basis? But aside from the romantic cynicism also lays some of the most romantic cinematic moments in history. The scene in which we follow up the stairs to find Antoine and Christine laying in bed peacefully and the morning after where Antoine purposes to Christne with what looks like a fancy spoon or bottle opener taking the place of a real ring? is one of the most poetic moments in film history. The music score is fantastic as well as the cinematography gentle and sweet. For some the ending is somewhat confusing and abrupt. But only shows that the man that now stalks Christine with such passion is now looked at by Antoine as resembling his once passionate feelings for her that no longer burn with the same intensity. A bittersweet opening to the followup Bed And Board. This film is a classic on all accounts!!! A must see and my favourite film of ALL TIME!!! I rate it a 15 out of 10!!!".

Stolen Kisses  remembered now almost thirty years since I first saw it  tops the others. Bed and Board is the third amusing even wise in a way but not nearly in the same league with either Skin or Kisses.This film is one of a handful which confirmed me as a lifelong cinephile first seen in my early twenties. It's Truffaut's happiest film which might damn it to many people in a way prevent it from being regarded as a great film. Who cares? It's tremendously amusing the young actors are beautiful to watch women may find other leading men more handsome than Leaud but men won't other young ladies more beautiful than Claude Jade to my mind. But  even better  this baby moves. It's lively and full of great odd plot developments. It's easy to miss the sheer genius of the writing the filming  tremendous inventiveness is evident in both. This film led the way it's as wild as some of Woody Allen's goofier earlier films but without anywhere near the level of neuroticism. I could go on and on. I've seen it at least six or seven times. There's nothing else like it truly. A few of Alan Rudolph's films begin to explore this vein a bit but then they came much later. Stolen Kisses  a beautiful film for young lovers to see for a first date perhaps and for more mature lovers too. For everybody young and old. A perfect Valentines' Day film but not mere fluff either. There's Paris women's shoes detectives lots of scheming a triumph over shyness lots of flirting and plenty of stolen kisses of many varieties including a few to be kept and sealed away forever.".

Though Francois Truffaut broke into the film industry with his debut The 400 Blows depicting the young misplaced Antoine Doinel as a youth attempting to find his way amidst the chaos of Paris Stolen Kisses might be a more mature and understanding film to its protagonist. Like Antoine Truffaut has grown up.This adventure follows Antoine's departure from the army and his attempt to find steady work in Paris that gorgeous and timeless city with the ethereal Sacre Coeur looming in the background. He goes through a number of professions all of which are completely captivating in their interest to us the audience and Antoine himself. Tying all this together is his constant affection for the girl he left for the army Christine who very well may hold the key to his heart. What is so endlessly fascinating about this film is the stark simplicity Truffaut films it in. Like his previous work this film has remarkable fluid camera movements as he gives us a breathtaking view of the eternal city and the journey Antoine is on in hopes of discovering his place. We are dropped into various situations such as a small hotel a private detective agency and a TV repair truck all of which are Antoine's attempts to find stability in a most unstable of times Paris 1968. What must be said about this remarkable film is that it is at its core a most personal story. Clearly Antoine represented Truffaut in The 400 Blows and he does here. From adolescence to teen angst to young adulthood Truffaut has shown us in three examples an everyman many of us can relate to. He is selfconscious anxious awkward around women yet tries to do the best he can. In Truffaut's eyes and ours this is the source of his innocence and charm.".

What amazes me even more is that the other films of Antoine appeals more to me than the original one although I love and rank them on the same level.In the most comical film of Doinel series Stolen Kisses JeanPierre Laud playing his unforgettable character is discharged from the army and needs to find a new job. He starts as night watchman something ridiculous happens and then he's out of work. Later he works as a private investigator having an unique talent for the job and getting himself involved with some bizarre investigations and one of them takes him to his new fake job as a stock boy in Mr. Tabard's shoesshop when this guy wants to know why nobody likes him and Doinel must find the reason. While there he falls in love with Tabard's wife who also seems obsessed with him Doinel has other things to investigate and other female interests and of course he meets Colette and Christine again women presented in Doinel's other films.Here's what Truffaut makes he takes this hardworking character puts him in strange humored yet very realistic situations of the daybyday brings back some connections of the previous films too and the result is a nice funny beautiful film that gives a positive light to Antoine Doinel a man only trying to survive in the best way he can. It's very surprising how he can manage to do so many things in different lines of work specially if you consider that in The 400 Blows he hated school he hadn't patience to sit and learn the same thing happen in the beginning of this film the reason why he was discharged of Army yet he can do lots of things a multi task man for all seasons. Truffaut succeeds in doing what Woody Allen sometimes tries so hard to do and that is make something really funny with a sense of realism and absurd going altogether hand in hand. It's a perfect romantic comedy too since Doinel is seen chasing women and all the funniest date he has is with a woman so tall that makes him feel like a midget next to her this moment can be seen also in Love on the Run.Laud is always brilliant playing the director's alter ego he's very funny charming very good looking. The story is all good with great and hilarious dialogs and insights unforgettable sequences and plenty of humor. And who could possibly predict that Doinel's life would be THAT good? Certainly not me not him or anyone else. Here's a surprising and lovely film and one of the most funniest I've ever seen. 1010".

Later Christine attempts to guess Antoine's latest job amusingly tossing out wayoffthemark guesses like cab driver or water taster.  It is a ticklish scene but also hints that Christine as of yet doesn't think so highly of Antoine's employable skills.  By the film's end Antoine has become a TV repairman.  He has been holding a grudge against Christine so she wins him back in a fetching manner.  She calls his company for service even as she is removing a component from her TV.  The company sends Antoine who is then forced to stay for hours trying to fix an irreparable TV.The best romantic scene in the film however is a quaint breakfast scene one morning in Christine's kitchen.  Christine is busy teaching Antoine how to butter toast.  Antoine for his part wishes to pose a question to her. Too embarrassed to express himself in words he writes his question on a notepad instead and hands it to her.  She immediately writes her reply and hands it back to him.  They continue in this manner for a few more exchanges before Antoine withdraws a scissor from a nearby drawer and hangs it on Christine's ring finger.

	schema:headline " Antoine Doinel P.I.";
	schema:reviewBody "After a stint in the army Antoine Doinel is released from active duty because of insubordination and ineptitude. The releasing officer does not have kind words for the soon to be civilian young man. As he comes out from the place he does not take long to find his way to have sex with a prostitute and to reclaim his humble abode in a run down apartment.Antoine is lucky in getting a position at a hotel thanks to the parents of Christine his on and off girlfriend. It is obvious Antoine is not fit for the position as he bungles a situation where a cheating wife is surprised with her lover in a room where the reception clerk is duped by the older P.I. behind the case. The older detective feels bad for having caused Antoine's the loss of his job and recommends him to apply for a job with his agency.The detective agency proves to be no different from Antoine's previous experiences. His best success in a case is when his superior asks him to infiltrate the shoe store owned by M. Tabard who feels his employees simply hate him and wants to find out what is he doing wrong. No one is happier to meet Antoine than Fabienne Tabard the stylish wife of the owner she sees in Antoine a man she can seduce and who will appreciate her charms. Stolen Kisses is a continuation on Francois Truffaut's take on the character that first was examined in his 400 Blows. It is a picaresque comedy because the way Antoine sees the world around him a society where he does not fit snugly. Mr. Truffaut made a few films around his Antoine Doinel and this one even 44 years after it was released still is enjoyable to watch. It is light in tone as the inept young hero of the story goes from one occupation to the next without not knowing where his future will take him. His girlfriend Christine Darbon is an afterthought in the narrative although by the end Antoine gets serious about getting more involved and in a way settled with the lovely young lady.It would have been inconceivable to think anyone else but JeanPierre Leaud the original Antoine of a few years before not playing him again. Mr. Leaud had a good working with Mr. Truffaut as they collaborated on different projects together.

	onyx:emotionText "After a stint in the army Antoine Doinel is released from active duty because of insubordination and ineptitude. The releasing officer does not have kind words for the soon to be civilian young man. As he comes out from the place he does not take long to find his way to have sex with a prostitute and to reclaim his humble abode in a run down apartment.Antoine is lucky in getting a position at a hotel thanks to the parents of Christine his on and off girlfriend. It is obvious Antoine is not fit for the position as he bungles a situation where a cheating wife is surprised with her lover in a room where the reception clerk is duped by the older P.I. behind the case. The older detective feels bad for having caused Antoine's the loss of his job and recommends him to apply for a job with his agency.The detective agency proves to be no different from Antoine's previous experiences. His best success in a case is when his superior asks him to infiltrate the shoe store owned by M. Tabard who feels his employees simply hate him and wants to find out what is he doing wrong. No one is happier to meet Antoine than Fabienne Tabard the stylish wife of the owner she sees in Antoine a man she can seduce and who will appreciate her charms. Stolen Kisses is a continuation on Francois Truffaut's take on the character that first was examined in his 400 Blows. It is a picaresque comedy because the way Antoine sees the world around him a society where he does not fit snugly. Mr. Truffaut made a few films around his Antoine Doinel and this one even 44 years after it was released still is enjoyable to watch. It is light in tone as the inept young hero of the story goes from one occupation to the next without not knowing where his future will take him. His girlfriend Christine Darbon is an afterthought in the narrative although by the end Antoine gets serious about getting more involved and in a way settled with the lovely young lady.It would have been inconceivable to think anyone else but JeanPierre Leaud the original Antoine of a few years before not playing him again. Mr. Leaud had a good working with Mr. Truffaut as they collaborated on different projects together. Best thing in the film is the elegant Delphine Seyrig playing Fabienne Tabbard a sophisticated seductress that captures Antoine's vivid imagination. Claude Jade appears as the sweet Christine the woman Antoine desires. Michael Lonsdale is also perfect as M. Tabard the shoe store owner. Stolen Kisses remains among Francois Truffaut most best comedies which seen today evokes a bygone era and the atmosphere of a bygone period in Paris which was lovingly photographed by Denys Clerval with a musical score by Antoine Duhanel.";

I know Stolen Kisses takes place nine years after but something wasn't right.  Maybe it was that this film was more comedic maybe the character was different maybe the world was different.  I don't know.  It is like the Antoine of Bizarro World.Standing by itself Stolen Kisses is a terrific film about a mediocrity. Antoine can't hold a job and he can't even hold a woman.  He kisses his girlfriend as he would kiss a prostitute  awkward and rough.  Upon meeting a private detective modeled after Andre Bazin  Truffaut's mentor Antoine gets a job spying on the workers of a shoe store owner who claims everyone hates him.  There he falls into lust with the bosses highsociety wife.At the end of the film Antoine is forced to compromise and marry his old girlfriend for whom he may or may not feel any true love.  The point is that she is there to support him and love him.  He is the elevated statue of desire to her just as the shoe store owner's wife was to him.All in all this movie is exceedingly well done by the Great Truffaut but I just couldn't get past the fact that Antoine was the same boy I last saw escaping from a juvenille hall and running to the ocean in a moment of personal victory from a society that didn't really want him.  Something in this film did not match up with the previous one.".

What movie was he watching??? I tell you there is absolutely NOTHING touching about this movie. The movie is emotionally uninvolving. And there wasn't one funny moment in the entire picture  unless you consider French humour funny. In fact French humour is so unfunny that it is difficult for the nonconnoisseur to even identify which bits are supposed to be funny. Maltin was probably referring for example to the early scene when an elderly detective catches a customer's wife cheating on him with another man. Is this supposed to be funny? Good Lord if this is funny what isn't? It's a badlydirected scene with bad acting absurd reactions by the characters haphazardly put together. And that's funny Maltin further informs us that the dweeb is inept but likable. Likable?! This man is so charismatic he makes the likes of Kyle MacLachlan seem like Sean Connery of Clark Gable by comparison. In another movie catalog I am informed that the dweeb is moreorless Truffaut himself i.e. the movie is autobiographical. Fair enough. If Truffaut was a dweeb that's his problem. I am also informed by BOTH reviews that this movie is considered as Truffaut's best by many!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What are his other movies like then Don't get me wrong. The movie is by no means a disaster. It is watchable which is the most important thing and the photography is solid. But there is nothing here that will make you laugh unless you laugh at other French films and there is certainly nothing touching here. The dweeb sleeps with prostitutes falls in love easily flirts for years with a girl who is probably frigid and played by an actress who is probably even less interesting than he is. A stonefaced actress. Which brings me to the acting. Some of the cast aren't particularly good. And Truffaut the great director occasionally offers us scenes that are for want of a better word off. There is clumsiness in the editing and clumsiness in scenes with many characters.If you could just forget that this was done by one of the supposed greats of cinema and watch this without knowing anything about the movie you'd have to be lying if you thought this was anything but an average movie.By the way Maltin also calls this one of the best treatments of young love ever put on the screen. This comes from a man who thinks that Teenage Caveman is a better movie than Blade Runner. 'Nuff said.Sick and tired of bad European dramas?

He gets a telling off from his superior office about the youth of today. Antoine pulls funny faces at this point to highlight his nonchalant attitude. Antoine then proceeds to steal his uniform go back to Paris and have sex with a prostitute.Antoine then goes to see his onoff girlfriend who he has not written to to for some time when he was at the army. We suspect that she is seeing someone else and we later note that she is also being followed.Antoine who is uneducated lacking a lot of skills even common sense haphazardly goes through a series of jobs. He becomes a night watchman at a hotel which lasts one night because he was blagged by a private detective. Luckily the detective gets him a job at his detective agency. Although he learns some skills he is still inept but he is planted at Tobard's shoe shop as the boss wants to know what his staff think about him. Like the film The Graduate the boss's older wife has designs for him.All the time he has this onoff relationship with bourgeois beautiful girlfriend Christine which blows hot and cold. She seems aloof and distant one minute and desires him the next. He also has trouble relating to her I never understood why he never wrote to her for months when he was in the army. At one point Antoine takes her out to a stakeout when following a magician and leaves her behind at a club.For someone who was a detective Antoine does not realise that Christine is being stalked by someone else.The film is a screwball comedy about love and obsession and two young people getting together awkwardly at a time when the young people of France felt displaced.Again Franois Truffaut is well served by his alterego Antoine Doinel who has the boyish charming and goofy quality that brings out the humour. His persona is different from The 400 Blows where we felt that he might end up being a petty criminal lost in some underclass.".

Antoine then proceeds to steal his uniform go back to Paris and have sex with a prostitute.Antoine then goes to see his onoff girlfriend who he has not written to to for some time when he was at the army. We suspect that she is seeing someone else and we later note that she is also being followed.Antoine who is uneducated lacking a lot of skills even common sense haphazardly goes through a series of jobs. He becomes a night watchman at a hotel which lasts one night because he was blagged by a private detective. Luckily the detective gets him a job at his detective agency. Although he learns some skills he is still inept but he is planted at Tobard's shoe shop as the boss wants to know what his staff think about him. Like the film The Graduate the boss's older wife has designs for him.All the time he has this onoff relationship with bourgeois beautiful girlfriend Christine which blows hot and cold. She seems aloof and distant one minute and desires him the next. He also has trouble relating to her I never understood why he never wrote to her for months when he was in the army. At one point Antoine takes her out to a stakeout when following a magician and leaves her behind at a club.For someone who was a detective Antoine does not realise that Christine is being stalked by someone else.The film is a screwball comedy about love and obsession and two young people getting together awkwardly at a time when the young people of France felt displaced.Again Franois Truffaut is well served by his alterego Antoine Doinel who has the boyish charming and goofy quality that brings out the humour. His persona is different from The 400 Blows where we felt that he might end up being a petty criminal lost in some underclass.";

	schema:reviewBody "Review In A NutshellStolen Kisses is about a young man who was discharged from the army due to constantly being absent without permission and has first taken up a job as a night watchmen before eventually delving into the profession of a private detective.It was truly stupid of me to start off with this film as I have found out after watching the film that this is the third film of a trilogy that started with The 400 Blows about the character Antoine Doinel. This is the main reason why I felt kind of slightly detached with the character and not comprehensively understand the intentions that Truffaut was trying to push with this film. Luckily though I still was able to enjoy this film as I found the protagonist and the adventures he goes on to be highly fun and quirky. I loved watching him attempting to succeed in areas that are clearly not meant for him and at the same time watch him becoming distracted by the women in his life and how they affect his career. The most interesting was definitely the relationship between him and Catherine as they both don't seem to agree on their current feelings for one another that it becomes complicated to have things run smoothly for them. Truffaut doesn't romanticize the relationship though he keeps it highly respectable but still retains that sense of quirkiness which I also found in the previous film I have seen from the director Jules and Jim. As I have said the film's protagonist came off intriguing as Truffaut handled it in a very interesting way and definitely someone I would love to explore more deeply.One can justify that this film is a romantic comedy as those elements are definitely clear when watching this film but I personally felt like there was more to it than just that. I felt that the film was trying to say something about useless men that have been ejected from the army to show us how difficult it is to make a living for yourself and to feel incompetent to society but it feels buried deep into the film that could be easily accessed if one has seen the two films that preceded this. The film also explores the idea of obsession though not as dire as what Hitchcock presented in Vertigo but in a comedic and slightly more realistic kind of way. I am not sure whether or not Truffaut was conscious when he has made the reference but I do see some of the resemblance then again this may just be me. Nevertheless these themes don't interfere with the tone and style that Truffaut was going for and can still be enjoyed at a superficial level.The film's camera work was satisfying creating that light and comedic mood that makes the film feel easily accessible and digestible. There were times particularly during the shots that capture Antoine walking around the streets of Paris where the filmmakers are trying to suggest that sense of monitoring like as if someone is watching your every move. Even by the end of the film a character who suddenly reveals he to be a watcher has shown us that one can't truly be safe. The film's score was quite pleasant to listen to particularly the opening track as it creates this warm sweet feeling that I haven't felt about in a song played during a film for a very long time. The orchestral score on the other hand plays out the same feelings in me as the opening track light and sweet doesn't try to play with your emotions but instead highlights the personality of the characters and the comedic tone of the film. One can't help but grin a little when little moments happen in the film and some of the commendation belongs to the film's music.The acting in this film was wonderful boasting a strong performance from JeanPierre Leaud. He played his character with such ease that I can't help but feel impressed as other actors who play characters like this try to come off as quirky and funny but end up either overwhelming or underwhelming in their performance. Leaud was able to incorporate comedy in almost all areas of his performance physical and verbal with some showing subtlety while others are plain obvious but the lack of subtlety in some of his physical performance doesn't hurt his performance in the film at times it actually makes it funnier that he has shown such commitment in making his movements look and feel hilarious. This is primarily Leaud's film so the other actors were only present to support our perceptions of the character so I would leave my critique for the other actors in my second viewing of the film.Stolen Kisses is a delightful film from Truffaut that definitely would have benefited me if I have seen the films that preceded it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first full length sequel to The 400 Blows is bound to suffer by comparison to the masterwork preceding it. The 400 Blows is one of cinema's greatest achievements an indictment of child abuse and neglect that's hard to shake. Its followup Stolen Kisses is a breezy unfocused farce that at times seems hastily assembled. Reviewing the film I am reminded of the danger of undertaking a task of reviewing The Great Films. My dislike of them or failure to get them is more likely to reveal my ignorance than the film's flaws. I fear that I will be exposed as a Philistine. But here goes.Stolen Kisses is not a bad film. But it is not a great one. Jean Pierre Leaud returns as the romantic Antoine Doinel and it is a testament to his charisma and charm that we continue to watch the series with interest despite its decline in quality. Doinel is still running everywhere unlucky in love bad at life and still dreaming big. As noted before the fact that Doinel emerged from The 400 Blows a relatively happy person is both a relief andpossibly this reveals a cruel streak in this authora disappointment. Blows closing note of doom and sadness is bleak but perfect and we can't but help feel that the film's coda is undermined by a sequel.While Blows was wistful Kisses is comic. It features the wacky misadventures of Antoine Doinel and more than a little mugging by Jean Pierre Leaud. We get to see him fail miserably as a private detective hotel porter and television repairman. These scenes of professional failure are often played broadly and Truffaut's direction seems at times rushed and uneven. The film's heart lies in Leaud's relationship with Christine Darbon Claude Jade. As with Collete in the previous installment Antoine is doted on by Christine's parents. Through them he finds a semblance of the parental bonds he never had.Christine and Antoine's relationship gives the film heart. It is pensive and sweet the anxious Antoine attacking the demure Christine all while trying to figure out romance. While trying to snag Christine Antoine will also find himself involved in an affair with a married woman who also offers him a lesson in romance and the fairer sex. This is the coming of age chapter of the Doinel cycle and it never quite coalesces into a pleasing whole. It's choppy and disappointing in light of its predecessor. Yet the performances by Leaud and Jade recommend the film and those who grew attached to Antoine in Blows will desire to follow his story further.".

My dislike of them or failure to get them is more likely to reveal my ignorance than the film's flaws. I fear that I will be exposed as a Philistine. But here goes.Stolen Kisses is not a bad film. But it is not a great one. Jean Pierre Leaud returns as the romantic Antoine Doinel and it is a testament to his charisma and charm that we continue to watch the series with interest despite its decline in quality. Doinel is still running everywhere unlucky in love bad at life and still dreaming big. As noted before the fact that Doinel emerged from The 400 Blows a relatively happy person is both a relief andpossibly this reveals a cruel streak in this authora disappointment. Blows closing note of doom and sadness is bleak but perfect and we can't but help feel that the film's coda is undermined by a sequel.While Blows was wistful Kisses is comic. It features the wacky misadventures of Antoine Doinel and more than a little mugging by Jean Pierre Leaud. We get to see him fail miserably as a private detective hotel porter and television repairman. These scenes of professional failure are often played broadly and Truffaut's direction seems at times rushed and uneven. The film's heart lies in Leaud's relationship with Christine Darbon Claude Jade. As with Collete in the previous installment Antoine is doted on by Christine's parents. Through them he finds a semblance of the parental bonds he never had.Christine and Antoine's relationship gives the film heart. It is pensive and sweet the anxious Antoine attacking the demure Christine all while trying to figure out romance. While trying to snag Christine Antoine will also find himself involved in an affair with a married woman who also offers him a lesson in romance and the fairer sex. This is the coming of age chapter of the Doinel cycle and it never quite coalesces into a pleasing whole. It's choppy and disappointing in light of its predecessor. Yet the performances by Leaud and Jade recommend the film and those who grew attached to Antoine in Blows will desire to follow his story further.";

These epic events don't engage Doinnel at all.

	schema:headline " Stolen Kisses";
	schema:reviewBody "Granting for himself a certain allowance for nostalgia Francois Truffaut set out to continue his Antoine Doinel series with his 1968 film Stolen Kisses. This time Truffaut caught up with his alter ego just as he is being discharged from the army desperately trying to become part of a family and attempting to build a relationship. Stolen Kisses would be an interesting departure for Truffaut as it would represent a deviation from the tightly worked scripts he had used up to that point. After two highly structured screenplays in a row Truffaut sought a more improvisational take on small events inspired by his own life including his visits to brothels and the end of his military service. The structure of the film was looser than Truffaut had ever used before but he was more concentrated on who he wanted Antoine Doinel to be. Up until this point Doinel represented Truffaut almost entirely in Stolen Kisses though Truffaut wanted Doinel to be 50 Truffaut and 50 JeanPierre Laud. JeanPierre Laud had brought to the role his unique spirit expertly bringing Doinel to life in his previous films in the Doinel series and Truffaut wanted to insert even more of Laud into the character of Doinel. Inspired by Honor de Balzac's The Lily of the Valley and a song by a favorite musician Charles Trenet Stolen Kisses Truffaut attempted to create a blend of his own persona and that of the young man he had developed a mentorlike relationship with collaborator JeanPierre Laud. Still drawing heavily from his own life Truffaut began Stolen Kisses with Antoine Doinel being discharged from the military similar to the way Truffaut was discharged. Truffaut was completely humiliated while facing his superiors each of them knowing he was only being discharged due to Andre Bazin's influence and although he was desperate to leave the military he surely could have done without being talked down to in such a way. Being shot with an almost entirely new crew Stolen Kisses would mark a new endeavor for Truffaut perhaps that is the reason there was so much nostalgia drizzled throughout the film. Drawing inspiration from Lubitsch and Renoir Truffaut made a light and comical yet touching continuation of Antoine Doinel. Being inspired by a full page ad for a detective agency which he incorporated into the film as a means for Antoine to discover his new career Truffaut decided to have Doinel explore the career of a private eye. Truffaut even collaborated with a private eye throughout filming for added realism. Whimsical music opened Stolen Kisses setting the stage for a more lighthearted tone than was present in Antoine and Colette and certainly The 400 Blows. In addition to the music being more light and playful the acting was also much more physical and comedic than I had previously seen in a Truffaut film. Exaggerated gestures and gags reminiscent of silent film canon gave Stolen Kisses a relaxed yet experimental feel. The rapid cuts and innovative editing techniques proved Truffaut was staying true to the movement he had ushered in. Even in the lighthearted and comedic moments of Stolen Kisses it was obvious that Antoine was still searching desperate to fill an obvious void in his life. Antoine was repeatedly trying with incredible diligence to be accepted into Christine's Claude Jade family. Antoine was more intent on being accepted into Christine's family than he was on being accepted by Christine. In one of the dinners that Antoine shared with Christine's parents he admitted that he did not have a close relationship with his parents. Sensing his need for familial connection and understanding of their daughter's uncommitted attitude toward Antoine the Tabard's Fabienne Delphine Seyrig and Georges Michael Lonsdale would nurture Antoine in one way or another. Fabienne would often act motherly toward Antoine often by encouraging him to eat or address his feelings. Georges too would help Antoine by finding him work and teaching him how to dress so as to be taken seriously especially by prospective employers. The love Antoine received from the Tabard's seemed to be exactly what he was searching for as he desperately wanted to become part of a family. Romantic love also eluded him as he was unable to gain the courage necessary to express himself to Christine and be honest with her of his desire to take their friendship to another level. Antoine even struggled with the various prostitutes he would attempt sexual relations with making it clear that Antoine's longing was for much more than carnal urges. Perpetually lost we see Antoine's immaturity and longing through the funniest moments in the film. Truffaut expertly shows the emasculation of Antoine bookended with lighthearted comedy in order to better feel the multiplicity of Antoine's pain. Not only does Antoine feel like less of a man because of his difficulties with women sexually but he also feels like less of a person because of his difficulties with maintaining a job and a relationship. This relates back to Antoine's struggle with his parents and his troubled early life. Antoine has traversed most of his life without someone to guide him and without proper examples of how to grow and foster relationships with people. At this stage of his life Antoine can be guided like the Tabard's attempt to guide him but he will not know what to do at each successive step because he has never seen each step play out. Without a model from which to draw inspiration Antoine is endlessly meandering throughout existence desperate for someone to take the journey with him and help him learn about life along the way. Love is a driving force for Antoine he longs for the love in adulthood that he was robbed of through childhood. Antoine seems to possess a romantic conviction that love can overcome the tragedy he has experienced and by finding someone to love and to love him in return he can change his meandering life into one of purpose. Just as Truffaut struggled to shake his own regretful childhood and to develop the strength to give himself in friendships love and cinema we see Antoine attempt to withstand his upbringing by learning how to develop relationships and navigate the working world a struggle not unknown to any of us.".

He admitted I must have slept through the only joke in this film. And he was right. No one was laughing. Bohnensuppe must have been in a different film but not in 1 12 Ritter. Ritter Til Schweiger shows his saure Gurken face all the time while Herzelinde has to smile all the time. Best actor according to my neighbor  Rick Kavanian whose DANEBEN is the best joke of the film . That's why they showed him in the trailer. Looking at IMDb voting for 1 12 Ritter  the 1s have it. Go and see another Til Schweiger film because this one is certainly his most boring.".

Even the plot was promising but i don't know what happened. Some sequences were way too long the beginning was lame and funny scenes weren't that funny. And this movie is NOT for the whole family my advice please leave your kids under 12 years at home because an important topic is sex. I wished there were more funny moments in it. There is no spirit in this movie. Of course there were some points where i had to laugh mostly when the character called Erdal was on screen. This was not a good German comedy.".

The movie is not spectacular in its story or plot and has a classic happy end but the mix between let's say full medieval scenery and very contemporary culture I found interesting and funny enough. For sure there is some sex but more as sound than image and on the level of relatively modest western moral standards but I would say that adds to the fun of watching this movie. So why this movie? The photography is done very well very nice to look at spectacular fighting scenes sometimes beautiful characters and clothing. It can be slow at times and indeed never really hilarious but actually I find that more of a compliment than when it would have gone over the top there. When you do not want a Hollywood film once again don't want to be annoyed but instead just have entertaining watch time this movie is a good choice.".

Anyway I've spent a very entertaining moment and I wasn't able to stop before the end nor did I want to do so though this has happened to me countless times for other movies lately.

	schema:reviewBody "There isn't even a year between this and the release of Til Schweiger's previous film Keinohrhasen Rabbit without Ears. Thankfully he didn't write the script this time around so in the evergrowing Schweiger canon this film stands out Instead of making a romantic comedy about an irresponsible manchild who learns to commit to a meaningful relationship by the end this one is a broad medieval comedy. It has therefore more in common with similar German period spoof films like the 7 Zwerge 7 dwarfs movies or the earlier films by Michael Herbig although none of these are set in medieval times. A big advantage of Schweiger giving screenwriting duties to other people is the fact that he plays a different character than in all his other movies. His stale performance in Keinohrhasen didn't convince me of his acting talent but I found him rather enjoyable here. He is still sloppily mumbling through his lines and his face muscles rarely move but put a silly wig on him and write him as somewhat socially awkward and you can make his role kind of funny and refreshing. All the other players in this movie most of them television personalities rather than actors don't venture out of their comfort zone and are therefore not as refreshing. The casting of Thomas Gottschalk as King Gunther is technically spoton but unfortunately Gottschalk takes his role far too seriously. Same for Udo Kier. The only genuinely good performance comes from Rick Kavanian but that doesn't mean he made me laugh. That's because the script is painfully unfunny. Some of the comedy bits are lifted from better films and stupid pseudogags are extended way beyond what is appropriate. Which might be the reason behind the long running time. There is no justification for this movie being almost two hours long it just makes its glaring writing and pacing issues even more apparent. Many movies like this feature some anachronistic jokes which often makes it hard for me to develop some interest or belief in their fictional worlds but those jokes are often reserved for quick one liners and since these films are typically quite fastpaced they don't take me out of the story. In 1 12 Ritter however the pacing is painfully slow so there is nothing to compensate for all the jokes that don't land or take you out of the movie. The performances as described above are very lowenergy so even they don't compensate for the lack of genuine comedy writing. Compare this to the movies I listed as comparisons above which mind are no masterpieces either. As a director Schweiger is clearly out of his depth directing action scenes. A movie like this doesn't need good action because unlike most historical dramas the story doesn't require extended fight scenes but that didn't stop Schweiger from including them anyway. And because he apparently couldn't afford a stunt double to perform some good choreography all of them consist of rapidly edited closeups of Schweiger going hrrrng! and violently punching his enemies. As for improvements At least the pictures in the film have a little more colour in them than in Keinohrhasen the camera work in general is pretty good and the soundtrack is wellplaced and might even be listenable if you listen to it independent from the movie.".

He got help from two codirectors including Torsten Knstler with whom he already worked on several movies. And of course Schweiger also stars in it. It all comes down to rescuing princess Herzelinde and the ending is of course Schweiger's character and Herzelinde being a couple. The only thing I found kind of amusing is Thomas Gottschalk as the King. Everything else is really not funny although down to the smallest roles this cast features very well known actors from Germany as it's usually the case with Schweiger movies. And even the New Kids on the Block give a performance.The humor on this film is mostly based on mixing Middle Ages logic with references to today's modern world. One early example would be a knight tournament with a modern sports broadcast commentator. However it gets repetitive pretty quickly and quickly isn't funny anymore if it ever has been. Also there is some suggestive humor included here and there with not so great wordplay gentlyput. The antagonists are played by Udo Kier and Mark Keller as we find out later in the film. All in all it's a disappointing effort possibly the biggest failure in Schweiger's career. But you can only partially blame him for that. The script was just a huge mess and maybe this movie is one of the main reasons why he has written his own movies afterward again. Also with a running time of almost two hours it did drag at times. Not recommended.".

Not to be redundant but as a kid you are easily impressed and scared by things like talking dummies or evil dolls.Joey isn't meant to be scary and now as a grownup I can only recommend it for a younger audience or for fans of movies involving dummies.Still I am pleased with the good memories I have towards this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review contains some SPOILERS.Way back when we first got a VCR about 1987 my sister and father rented some movie about a boy and a possessed ventriloquist's dummy. I happened to see a few scenes of it before wandering off to do other things. Trouble is the scenes that I did watch got embedded in my memory and I couldn't shake them out. Ever. And it wasn't until a year or two ago when I finally found out the title to this mystery movie Making Contact' and then recently I found it available for rent. Finally I could put some childhood demons to rest. Had I know the bad experience I would eventually have put myself through I never would have watched those few scenes back in 1987.Joey is an unpopular little kid going through the ordeal of having recently lost his father which we are thrust into from the very first scene. No time for scenes with the dad before his death just start right in on the funeral. But the death of his father makes Joey realize an inner power he has. He has the ability to move objects and bring his toys to life. He also starts talking to his dad on his toy telephone. He tells his classmates and becomes a laughingstock worrying his teacher. One day he wanders into a nearby abandoned house and discovers the ventriloquist's dummy of the house's previous owner. It comes to life and proceeds to rant about how the ventriloquist's ghosts wants to control Joey. So Joey must enter the old house once again and face the evil force within. People have been comparing this to E.T.' There is some truth to the comparison but what I kept noticing were comparisons to some Twilight Zone episodes I saw awhile back. Particularly the kid talking to his dad on the toy telephone. But that stuff doesn't matter much. The movie still isn't very good. Roland Emmerich's direction is very murky and his writing is very poor. Here's a few headscratchers for you should you decide to sit down and watch this movie  Joey has the power to give life to his toys but he doesn't seem able to actually control them. His little toy robot seems to have developed a mind and personality of its own. But it is the only toy that behaves in this way.  Is it just me or does Joey's dad resemble Gabe Kaplan from Welcome Back Kotter?  Listen very carefully to the broadcast when the dummy conjures up the television set. The ventriloquist's back story is fascinating what you can hear Joey and the dummy keep talking over it defeating the purpose of it all. The broadcast suggests there had been a series of child murders in the 30s. I wish it had gotten into this more but perhaps Emmerich thought it would be too scary for kids. And of course the intrigue of the ventriloquist is erased in the final moments when we know the truth. Its all very disappointing.  It's funny how both the mother and teacher just accept Joey's power. They don't seem too concerned about what he might do with them should he get angry. And it is really hilarious when all those scientists come barreling down with thousands of dollars in tax payer's money at their disposal with no proof other than an elementary teacher's word that it is all legit.  Funny how the strange force doing all this is so powerful that it can build its vast underground maze full of surprises yet it can't stop Joey from using the SolveAllYourProblemsExitDoor even though it is right in front of him when he does it. I may have took home nothing from the substance of the movie but at least that childhood demon is put to rest. Now if I can only track down that one horror movie about the underground albino people I will be free of them all. And it couldn't be as unrewarding as this children's ghost story was. Zantara's score 4 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joey is an American  West German coproduction from 1985 and the language is German. This film had its 30th anniversary last year. The director and one of the writers is Roland Emmerich still a pretty big name in Hollywood these days and this 95minute film we have here is from his early days as a filmmaker around the age of 30. The premise and idea in this film are actually not too bad. A boy mourns over the death of his father but somehow he keeps being able to talk to him. the reason is a strange demonic creature in the form of a dummy with a very dark past. And if this is not enough already for 1.5 hours there is more supernatural in here in terms of all kinds of toys who manage to keep walking around and acting on their own.The real problem here is that this film is basically nothing more than a collage put together from snippets in terms of plot and character that were used in very successful films from the 10 years before this film came out. And that is why I would basically call it nothing more than a copy but not of one movie but about half a dozen. It lacks creativity and uniqueness entirely and if it is true that there is a film that had zero individual genius attached to it then it is this one. Of course every filmmaker is somewhat inspired in his creativity by the works of other artists but this one here feels like it has no individual note attached to it at all. The good thing is that at least you can maybe somewhat enjoy it if you are not aware of or have not seen the films that this mix of fantasy horror and family movie is shamelessly copying. I never thought Emmerich was the most creative filmmaker and sadly this work here confirms this theory. There is not really to say too much about the cast here as there are no big names attached to this movie. Lead actor Joshua Morrell who plays the title character never appeared in another film before or after that and maybe this was a good decision as he is not really great in here. But neither are the supporting players. All in all this was a mediocre film at best and I give it a thumbsdown. Only worth seeing for the biggest fantasyhorror lovers but then again these may be the ones who despise it the most. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "9 year old Joey Collins Joshua Morrell is a sad and lonely kid living in the city of Virgina Beach with his mother after his dad died. He discovers one night he has gained telekinetic and psychic powers which makes his toys come to life and even gain the power to communicate with the spirit of his dad on a toy phone which gives him love and hope he's a unfairly unpopular kid at school cause he told them his secrets yet they think he's crazy as he has only one friend and of course his pet robot Charlie. One night while walking his dog and robot he stumbles into an old abandoned mansion that belong to a famous magicianventriloquist named Jonathan Fletcher and finds an old yet creepy ventriloquist dummy named Fletcher Voiced by Jack Angel in the U.S. versionas he takes it home with him only to later find out it's possessed by a demon. It terrorizes young Joey into not believing that the person he is talking on the phone isn't his father but the boy refuses to believe it yet the little creature threatens his mom friends and even some of the folks in his city with demons from another dimension for only Joey can put an end to it's reign of terror.Very entertaining fantastic and highly underrated yet overlooked German supernatural horror fantasy drama from Roland Emmerich Independence Day Stargate and The Patriot long before his Hollywood career. The film incorporates themes about life and death including the power of how to cope with it even though we sometimes can't wish that we need to bring that person back but how to live with it i think the film's acting is surprisingly good even for the young lead. Some people accuse this of being a knockoff to some of Spielberg's and Lucas's movies like Star Wars E.T. Poltergeist etc. but IT ISN'T a ripoff it's a tribute and homage as Mr. Emmerich uses playful nonmean spirited references that taps into the mind of a child's imagination on their obsession with movies they love on how sometimes they would like to have a special friend kind of like E.T. and how they could bring their Star Warsesquire fantasies to life. The dummy Fletcher himself is one creepy little doll whom rivals Fats from Magic as the scariest ventriloquist dummy to hit the screen i remembered watching this movie on HBO when i was young at the age of 5 in 1987 as it scared the hell out of me. Then later in my high school days i adored the movie yet the dummy still gives me the willies i think it's a wonderful and kind of dark supernatural modern fairy that is a well done and eerie tale of death and magic. The German version of this movie known as Joey is the better version then the U.S. New World Pictures English dubbed version Making Contact for it has scenes that were cut out of the U.S. version and has a much better music score.If you want a different yet imaginative movie that combines horror fantasy and even drama that is also a tearjerker with a moral then i highly recommend checking out this fascinating underrated cult gem.Also recommended Poltergeist Ghost Pan's Labyrinth The Gate The Shining House 1986 Silent Hill Magic House By The Cemetery The Exorcist Akira Spirited Away My Neighbor Totoro Star Wars Saga The Mummy Trilogy Dead of Night 1945 Tourist Trap Puppet Master Ghostbusters 1  2 The Dark Crystal 1408 Twice Upon a Time The Devil's Backbone Pet Sematary Scanners Carrie Firestarter Suspiria Phenomena Inferno Mother of Tears Hellraiser 1  2 Final Destination Trilogy Willow A Nightmare on Elm Street Stephen King's IT The Frighteners The Neverending Story City of Lost Children Harry Potter Saga Child's Play Series Trilogy of Terror Devil Doll 1964 The Monster Squad The Goonies City of the Living Dead a.k.a.

I know the movie is a bit farfetched but what do you expect when you rent or buy this type of film? A documentary? Anyway ...

	schema:headline " Good but better for the kids";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Roland Emmerich is nowadays best known as the man behind blockbusters such as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow big budget sciencefiction films where he has shown a mastery for the use of grandiose and aweinspiring visual effects. While he may not be the most original and artistic director Emmerich has truly developed a style of his own a style that owes a lot to his spiritual guides the great 80s masters of fantasy George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and as this little early film named Joey proves it's a style that Emmerich has been developing since the early years of his career back when he was a young director in his natal Germany many years before his first big hit Universal Soldier.Joey known in the U.S. as Making Contact is the story of a 9 years old kid named Joey Joshua Morrell who after the tragic death of his father begins to experience psychic powers allowing him to move inanimate objects with his mind set things on fire and even to communicate him with his dead father. However not everything is good for Joey as his newly gained powers accidentally awake an evil supernatural force that is contained inside the body of an old ventriloquist's dummy that Joey found in an abandoned house. The supernatural Dummy shows similar powers to Joey's and soon he puts the lives of everyone near Joey in danger as the evil Dummy has dark plans for Joey's special powers.Written by Emmerich himself along with Hans J. Haller and Thomas Lechner Joey is pretty much a supernatural horror movie on the lines of Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg's Poltergeist but done with the approach of a fantasy movie for children like E.T. also by Spielberg. The premise is very original but sadly the script's development is quite typical of its time although to be fair with it the German version of the film that runs 20 minutes longer is a slight but noticeable improvement over the dubbed U.S. version. Focused on Joey the film works more as a creepy adventure film than a horror movie mainly because the story is written in a way that highlights the main character's fight versus the evil force instead of the horror created by the Dummy. While the movie focuses on the action and adventure this is not to say the film doesn't have good creepy moments as it is packed with some very good for the budget visual dark imagery that forecasts Emmerich's taste for big budget special effects. It's really interesting what he does with his minimal resources and one can say that at this early point in his career he knew the kind of films he wanted to do in the future. As with the script the German uncut version allows a better picture of Emmerich's direction that while not really masterful it's competent and effective for the kind of movie he was trying to make. The similitude with E.T. and Poltergeist is not gratuitous as nods to both Spielberg and Lucas are very common in the film this just shows how much the young German director admired his heroes.The cast is really average and this is really one of the film's weakest points as the lack of experience of the cast specially of the kids becomes increasingly notorious given the fact that the director was at this point unexperienced as well and being honest directing actors has never been Emmerich's strongest characteristic. Anyways Eva Kryll is the only actress with real experience and as such delivers the best performance of the film although her character is really small and doesn't really have enough screen time. Also I guess one can say that the casting of Joshua Morrell was truly inspired as the young actor really looked natural in front of the camera.As written above the unexperienced young cast paired with the unexperienced young director is likely a deadly combination for any film and Joey has this as its biggest flaw. However Emmerich manages to pull off a nice entertaining adventure of this that while not perfect is a lot better than what could had been. The script isn't really amazing and at times shows up some serious plot holes but nothing really to worry about. Joey was intended to be a children's horror movie and in that aspect it succeeds as this movie is the perfect introduction to the horror genre for young children.I can not recommend this movie to everyone as definitely it won't be attractive to the average horror fan but I'm sure the kids will enjoy it a lot more as the movie has a nice mix of horror adventure and comedy. Joey like Emmerich's other early films The Noah's Ark Principle and Moon 44 shows the young talent of a visionary master of visual effects that while probably not a very accomplished director manages to make entertaining and attractive films that deliver good doses of entertainment. Joey or Making Contact is definitely one of the best horrors to enjoy with the kids although it doesn't really offer something for the grownup crowd. 610".

Not only that but you can see he has Sesame Street curtains. He has a toy robot with a mind of it's own that looks a bit like R2D2 with arms and eyes.

He tries to bury it but his stupid teacher sees him running away and returns the doll. Anyway he learns Joey's secret and calls in people from the local college to investigate this unexplained happening. Well the bullies aren't gonna let him get away that easily.

Is this film supposed to be a horror film? All I saw was a lawsuit waiting to happen since it showcases or rather steals the creativity and genius of such classics as E.T.The Extraterrestrial and Poltergeist. If you're looking for laidback horror film to enjoy with your friends on a casual Friday night this isn't it! This is by far one of the most boring and stupendous pieces of work I have ever seen! It is deserving of 100 Razzi Awards! Before I start to puke I must sign off and get this disgusting nogood film out of my head. But before I do I'd like to make a brief comment for the wonderful yes I'm being sarcastic! Mr. Emmerich 'Please for the love of god! For the love of Hollywood! Spare us a sequel to Godzilla! I wouldn't know how to cope!'".

Little things that are usually enjoyable even in bad films are stripped of anything decent 80's clichs fail to bring back fond memories painfully bad acting fails to elicit any laughs and the convoluted story fails to surprise or interest the reader.

Joshua Morrell played Joey very well for a 9 yr old and was a bit emotional at times in the film the Ventrilliquist dummy did scare me when i was a child but thats just me but when you see it close it was scary but love the Star Wars effect in the movie thats why i give it 1010. I can watch this again and again and not get bored with it the story line was spot on as well with the eerie music to go with it.

	schema:headline " Positively surprised here";
	schema:reviewBody "David is a West German Germanlanguage movie from 1979 so this one will soon have its 40th anniversary already. The director here is Peter Lilienthal and he is also one of the several writers who worked on this project. The outcome was a movie that runs for slightly over 2 hours and received a pretty solid deal of awards recognition namely at the German Film Awards but also at the Berlin Film Festival. You can check out who and what were awarded for yourself. The reason why this film is not more popular today is probably that the cast does not really include any big names even if German film buffs will certainly recognize Horwitz Zischler and Mattes. Another reason may be that the film is from the exact same year that the Oscarwinning Die Blechtrommel came out and both take place during the days of Nazi Germany even if the approach and subject is entirely different I guess. My opinion about this film here is that it did not really look German. I have seen many other films about these dark years in Germany there are really more than enough and I personally found it looked more Polish or Czech perhaps. But maybe this is also because it is a film from the 1970s. We should not forget that.Overall the film is a war drama and even if it did not touch me as much as I hoped it would it was still a decent informative watch. The argument that it does not bring anything new to the subject really is not valid in my opinion because we need to keep in mind that all the stuff you have seen is probably from way later way after 1979. The performances were solid the story was interesting too and some of the characters were pretty memorable even. For a film that crosses the 120minute mark it was delightful how it had almo0st no lengths at all and this time looking at the quantity of writers it was no case of too many cook spoiling the broth. Okay admittedly I also would not say it is one of the defining films of the genre or one of the very best Nazi Germany films I have seen but it is a good watch without a doubt and in my opinion it is even better than the highly overrated Die Blechtrommel. I recommend David. Thumbsup for everybody working on this project. This is certainly a criminally underseen film.".

Indeed a love story is the vehicle used for this extraordinary epic recounting the three decades between the Berlin Wall's first barbed wire and its fall. Some critics forgetting what a historical epic requires dismiss the film as clicheridden. Well of course War and Peace Gone with the Wind Dr. Zhivago were successful due to the use of composite characters or cliches. These are necessary to explain history in a medium like the cinema. Ms. von Trotta is to be congratulated not only for this and other great political films i.e.Rosa Luxemburg but for being one of the only German filmmakers to tackle the controversial topic of German reunification. A declared socialist from Western Germany Ms von Trotta lends the film a point of view that is as unbiased as I can imagine. Don't miss it. A lot of people did because of the film's timing. The last thing I guess most Germans wanted to see at the movies in 1994 was a reminder of the results of reunification.

This remains to be seen but if so is that a good reason to come up with this dim tepid and obligatory romantic drama that is predictable from scene 1? A drama in which the viewer no cliche spared?The film looks more a kaleidoscope of political events in which the two main characters just happened to be a part of. The film never is a real drama and lacks every dramatic tension. The two main characters are simply boring people not helped much by the casting all other characters are onedimensional. Some bad writing is also present some characters like the aunt simply disappear from the story. As to direction and filmmaking there are plenty of uneasy moments as well. In the Prague scene the girl waits on the wrong spot for her friend well they just wait but then pop a short scene in which she asks where this or that place is and then pop yes there he is! The scene of the father in hospital also just seems to come from nowhere.It all looks like as Von Trotta really wanted to show how very very concerned she was about the 28 years of history and by that overplaying her hand. She should either have elaborated the drama more or have taken the trouble for a more thorough interpretation of the political situation.

But one particularly touching scene stuck most in my memory Alexander from West Berlin brings a toy panda bear to his halfsister Elizabeth in East Berlin. He suggests they could go to the Western Zoo to watch a live animal. But Konrad their father knows this isn't possible at the time and suggests the Eastern Tierpark instead  but they don't have pandas there only brown bears. So at night he takes the panda from sleeping Elizabeth's arms and paints it brown...Just retelling this little part of the film makes tears well up in my eyes again.".

But one particularly touching scene stuck most in my memory Alexander from West Berlin brings a toy panda bear to his halfsister Elizabeth in East Berlin. He suggests they could go to the Western Zoo to watch a live animal. But Konrad their father knows this isn't possible at the time and suggests the Eastern Tierpark instead  but they don't have pandas there only brown bears. So at night he takes the panda from sleeping Elizabeth's arms and paints it brown...Just retelling this little part of the film makes tears well up in my eyes again.";

To my generation the Berlin Wall remains part of history I was only five when it fell so we have to rely on movies like this to understand the whole thing.

It is another of the Sauerkraut Westerns the GDR's approach to the popular West German Winnetou movies and just like with all the others the title character is played once again by Gojko Mitic. Two directors and three writers worked on this film which made it especially disappointing for me that it turned out so forgettable. I guess it is another example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. You cannot really blame Mitic. He is certainly among the better actors from the cast and I also believe he is better than Brice even if that's nothing special. However the writing here is so mediocre and not memorable at all that nothing stays in the mind except the solid nature photography. But you can also watch a documentary if you want to see that. The film runs for 100 minutes approximately and I lost quickly interest in the plot and story. The consequence was that this movie dragged a lot. It's only worth seeing for the very biggest western film fans. Everybody else should better skip it.".

However the writing here is so mediocre and not memorable at all that nothing stays in the mind except the solid nature photography. But you can also watch a documentary if you want to see that. The film runs for 100 minutes approximately and I lost quickly interest in the plot and story. The consequence was that this movie dragged a lot. It's only worth seeing for the very biggest western film fans. Everybody else should better skip it.";

They take temporary refuge in an empty building and there she has a chance meeting with her exfianc. He offers to put her upthat is hide herfor a few days. He's now married a professional who lives in an idyllic suburb reached by a trolley that runs through the woods. His wife seems more committed to putting up the fugitive than he is. The story involves the neighbors the building owner who avoids involvement and seeks solace in classic poetry and the super and his suspicious wife.This is certainly one of Wajda's major films but it apparently did not get a favorable reception from any faction Jews Poles etc. and one can see why. It isn't an easy film it tackles a difficult subject and doesn't provide any facile answers or try to provoke a simple emotional response. And the characters are not especially likable.The central character is a man who knows what's right and even DOES what's right at the cost of his life but still isn't very sympathetic. He has no zest for taking a principled stand and he has a certain lack of empathy. A key scene is where his younger brother romantically attracted to the underground goes off to his possible death fighting in the ghetto. The husband doesn't understand why his wife is crying and only sees his pesky younger brother's unexplained to him departure as a relief. In short he's like a lot of us. In films where characters are faced with strong moral choices right and wrong are usually clearly defined. Wajda understands that it's not as simple as that. I saw this film 9 years ago but this character often returns to my mind.Wajda is not badly represented in the DVDtape market but the emphasis is on his earlier films. This is one of the later ones that's sadly not available. It deserves a wider audience.".

However when they arrive in Singapore they meet Mima.  A first the two use her for free labour then they want their freedom from a woman but then they realise that they both want some time with her and compete for her affections.The first of the successful Road movies is the foundation on which the others were build basically meaning that this is straight to formula without the shine and added touches that we got with the middle movies before they just got silly towards the end.  The plot is stronger as a result but it does feel a little ordinary in comparison to some of their later hijinx.  However the film is weakened by far too many musical numbers I don't mind about 2 or even 3 but here it was pushing up to about 5 in a 80 minute run time.  While these do give the film a more general entertainment value I prefer the out and out comedy of Hope and Crosby and the songs took away from that.This is not to say it isn't funny but just that the duo seem to be finding their feet still.  The jokes are good and the banter is sharp without being too knowing.  Crosby plays the playboy very well and Hope is more controlled than usual  he is actually operating within the bounds of the film and not doing any knowing gags.  This is a bit of a surprise for me as I'm used to hope being bigger than the film and interacting with the audience but I still enjoyed it he even worked better in the serious parts. Lamour is more understated than later films but it is strange to see a woman so clearly white portraying a woman supposed to be of ethnic origin  but I guess that's the period.Overall this is an enjoyable film but not the Road series at it's best. Instead this is the birth of the series and the formula is in place with a solid plot and songs personally I preferred the middle movies where they let rip with the comedy a bit more but not to the point of silliness.".

	schema:reviewBody "ROAD TO SINGAPORE Paramount 1940 directed by Victor Schertzinger marked the initial pairing of crooner Bing Crosby. and funny man Bob Hope in what was to become the first in a series of Road adventures revolving around a guy a pal and a gal. With no sequels originally intended its popularity truly relies most not on the slight screenplay by Don Hartman and Frank Butler nor the few comedy routines but the fine chemistry brought out by its leading players Crosby Hope and Dorothy Lamour. The story revolves around Josh Mallon Bing Crosby in a role suited for a much younger actor a freespirited young man whose seriousminded father Charles Coburn wants him to carry in the family business of his multimillion dollar establishment Mallon Steamship Company as well as to settle down and marry an heiress Gloria Wycott Judith Barrett. Josh very much prefers spending time bumming around with his boyhood pal Ace Lannigan Bob Hope who enjoys having him around for laughs. Following a social function where Josh and Ace entertain the snobbish guests soon developing into a fist fight riot. The boys break away from civilization by boarding a ship bound for Singapore where they live as carefree bachelors in a bungalow near the port of Kaigoon. While in a cabaret Josh and Ace witness the gaucho dance performed by Cesar Anthony Quinn and Mima Dorothy Lamour. Due to Mima's attention towards the young Americans a fight ensues between them and the jealous Cesar leading to another riot. As the boys leave they take Mima with them. As Mima takes the position as their housemaid the boys resent her changing their carefree style with orders and keeping the bungalow neat and tidy. Eventually they find themselves falling for her and do whatever pranks possible to get her to themselves. More problems arise when Papa Mallon and Gloria track down Josh to take him back with them to the states much to the dismay of his friends.As Bob Osborne host of Turner Classic Movies mentioned in his profile on the the making of the film in its January 28 2010 presentation SINGAPORE was initially scripted for George Burns and Gracie Allen and revised for Fred MacMurray and Jack Oakie before the screenplay finally went to Crosby and Hope. Worked into the script were songs by Johnny Burke and Victor Schertzinger including Captain Custard sung and performed by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope The Moon and the Willow Tree sung by Dorothy Lamour Sweet Potato Piper sung by Crosby Lamour and Hope Too Romantic sung by Crosby and Lamour Kaigoon by James Monaco and Johnny Burke sung by natives and Too Romantic sung by Crosby. Too Romantic is the love song theme slow in tempo suited for the style of Crosby and Lamour while the lively Captain Custard number demonstrates how grown men can still get by acting like mischievous little boys clowning around and making eyes and chasing pretty ladies in the process. As much as these guys are full of fun their on screen party guests think otherwise. Look fast for TV character actress Elvira Allman as a homely woman. Other members in the cast include Pierre Watkin Morgan Wycott Gaylord Pendleton Gordon Wycott Johnny Arthur Timothy WIllow and Benny Inocencio The Native Boy As fate would have it this simple and innocent story proved far more success as anticipated paving the way for a series of Road comedies by reteaming Crosby Hope and Lamour in different character portrayals different locales but similar situations involving two guys and a gal. Unlike their ventures that lead to ZANZIBAR 1941 MOROCCO 1942 UTOPIA 1945 RIO 1947 BALI 1952 and HONG KONG 1962 this initial entry contained nothing to the hilarity of injokes constant adlibs by its principals unbilled guest stars subtitles and or talking animals. There are two instances where the script allows for wild comedy one where the trio enact a medicine show that turns disastrous with Jerry Colonna the one with the mustache loud voice and big rolling eyes and as its prime victim and another during the native festival where Bob and Bing dress up as natives in order to get some free food. SINGAPORE has rare distinctions where it provides some background to its two characters Crosby as a millionaire's son whose happiest being away from responsibility an Lamour the native girl who teams up with a dancer Quinn following the death of her parent. There's not much background pertaining to Hope's character except for being a sidekick who fails in specializing in medicine shows. He shows the sentimental side to his nature in one somber moment between him and Lamour quite unusual for a Hope comedy. The major ingredient SINGAPORE has that would be used in most subsequent films is Hope and Crosby's paddy cake routine and of course Lamour enacting as their straight woman. During its cable TV era SINGAPORE was shown on American Movie Classics 19922000 before traveling over to Turner Classic Movies where it made its debut August 3 2004. TCM also has in its library a 1931 Warners drama bearing the same title starring William Powell but that ROAD TO SINGAPORE bears no resemblance to this edition. Over the years MCA Home video distributed it to home video in the 1990s before shifting this and the series to DVD. Regardless of being the lesser item in the series ROAD TO SINGAPORE which will never have the distinction of becoming part of American Film Institutes 100 Greatest Comedies as ROAD TO MOROCCO 1942 did but is one relatively known as the movie that started it all with Crosby Hope and Lamour and their journey to adventure into comedy music and romance.

SINGAPORE has rare distinctions where it provides some background to its two characters Crosby as a millionaire's son whose happiest being away from responsibility an Lamour the native girl who teams up with a dancer Quinn following the death of her parent. There's not much background pertaining to Hope's character except for being a sidekick who fails in specializing in medicine shows. He shows the sentimental side to his nature in one somber moment between him and Lamour quite unusual for a Hope comedy. The major ingredient SINGAPORE has that would be used in most subsequent films is Hope and Crosby's paddy cake routine and of course Lamour enacting as their straight woman. During its cable TV era SINGAPORE was shown on American Movie Classics 19922000 before traveling over to Turner Classic Movies where it made its debut August 3 2004. TCM also has in its library a 1931 Warners drama bearing the same title starring William Powell but that ROAD TO SINGAPORE bears no resemblance to this edition. Over the years MCA Home video distributed it to home video in the 1990s before shifting this and the series to DVD. Regardless of being the lesser item in the series ROAD TO SINGAPORE which will never have the distinction of becoming part of American Film Institutes 100 Greatest Comedies as ROAD TO MOROCCO 1942 did but is one relatively known as the movie that started it all with Crosby Hope and Lamour and their journey to adventure into comedy music and romance.

Brilliant songs are featured once again including Too Romantic' and The Willow and the Moon'.ROAD TO SINGAPORE essentially is a romantic comedy with mass complications of playboys with serial pattypan punching techniques cheating people with soapsuds cleaner and both falling for Dottie. The slapstick gags featured are not as hilarious as the definitive film of the series ROAD TO MOROCCO but due to the enormous success of SINGAPORE the trio's comedy skills allowed for a continuing series in which the progressing films became zanier. Generally good direction an agreeably funny script and a supporting cast headed by Charles Coburn only amounts to part of the fun.However once again Paramount and in a more generalised context Hollywood itself displays its lack of understanding for foreign culture. Singapore or the island in question which isn't actually Singapore looks like an extremely undeveloped Malaysia. The natives don't actually convince one of being native nor do any of the ceremonial activities trick for one second. Dorothy Lamour although an exquisitely beautiful actress does not resemble an islander native although it isn't exactly her fault.In the same manner some people may find this film offensive or any of the ROAD films because they are not a true representation for any culture. But most movies made during this period simply didn't have much regard to exact details of foreign lands. And in such a brilliant comedy it doesn't really matter.Rating 1010".

Unfortunately the film just doesn't have much kick to give.On the whole it's a rather dull affair that only attempts one or two comic set pieces and pads out the rest of the film with some pretty unimpressive dialog. The only bit that even brought a smile to my face was when Hope and Crosby trying to con a native crowd into buying their sham cleaning products recruited the hapless Jerry Colonna and proceeded to decimate his immaculate white suit. The writing is entirely bythenumbers with very little flair for the comedic wasting Charles Coburn as Crosby's father. Lamour is charismatic and lovable as the dancer that Hope and Crosby rescue from an abusive showman but she doesn't get much to do besides look pretty and dispense maternal affection. I wish she'd been allowed to do a little comedy but then the boys don't get to do much of it either at that so I suppose that's a bit of a moot point.I'm a big fan of musicals from the 1930s but the obligatory songs in The Road to Singapore are pretty flaccid and uninspired. Like those in a Marx Brothers picture you spend too much time just waiting for the singing to be over. Of course the Marx Brothers got back to their hilarious routines when the musical numbers ended but nobody remembers to do that in this movie.Most of the love for this series seems to be centered on one or two of the various sequels. I liked the cast of The Road to Singapore but the problem was the material so if future outings prepared them with a better script then I'm all for checking them out.

All the HopeCrosby films had musical numbers but ROAD TO SINGAPORE had just too manyespecially the big production numbers that studios absolutely loved during this era. Try watching the early Abbott and Costello films and you'll see what I mean! This along with less comedy make this an enjoyable film but not among the better films in the series.The film begins with Bing Crosby having an absolutely awful life. He comes from an immensely wealthy family and a hot rich lady is aching to marry himso naturally he runs from this as fast as humanly possible! I personally thought his character was certifiably insane but no one else seemed to think this! Anyway he and his good buddy Bob Hope disappear just before Crosby's wedding and they set out for a place where they can sit around doing nothing. This search for nothing leads them to Singapore though some of the native dress and culture seems very strangely out of place. What also seems a bit out of place is Dorothy Lamour though she later explains that her parents were not from Singapore so at least the producers recognized that making her Southeast Asian would not work.While Crosby and Hope are avowed bachelors who like the simple life naturally they both soon are taken with wonderful Dorothy and her sexy ways. Just before Crosby makes his move and asks Lamour to marry him up pop Crosby's dad Charles Coburn and his hottie fiance Judith Barrett. Considering everything guess which one smooth ol' Bing chooses in the end? Overall while not a great film its simple end easygoing style is very endearing and the characters are quite likableeven if Bing is insane!! Try ROAD TO ZANZIBAR or ROAD TO MOROCCO and you'll find a similar film but with a bit wackier sensibilities and more laughs.By the way compared to later films of the series Bob Hope's character is a lot tougher here. In later films he's a confirmed coward.".

Who remembers the actual winners It's a Blue World or Waltzing in the Clouds?Lamour of course provides the film's romantic focus whilst Hope and Crosby joined briefly by Colonna supply the slapstick the clever banter and the perfectly timed repartee. So well do the principals play in tandem you'd think they'd been acting together for years. It's hard to credit this is the first film in the series. True the humor is not quite as crazy as in some of the other entries but is that a disadvantage?Beautifully photographed with excellent production values The Road to Singapore adds up to exceptional entertainment.Although the critics were lukewarm the public found this initial teaming of Crosby Hope and Lamour impossible to resist. And no wonder. The film has a joy a carefree spirit an antimaterialistic edge and yet is so glossily and expertly presented that there don't seem to be any categories of picturegoer to whom the film would not appeal.

Of course the alleged Singapore setting isn't at all believable it looks like some tropical island filled with dozens of topless tanned men as toned as the sarong clad girls are laced with flowers.It's obvious to me that this wasn't planned as a series but with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby as the top new screen comedy team of 1940 along with Abbott and Costello a series was inevitable although other than gag guest appearances from Crosby in a few of Hope's films they never appeared on the screen together in anything but these 6 Road films.This has a rather ordinary plot set up with Crosby trying to get out of an engagement and out from underneath the thumb of his domineering ship magnate father Charles Coburn. It's not easy though to hide from the world when you've got sidekick Hope constantly getting them in all sorts of trouble. They meet up with Dorothy Lamour saving her from hot tempered Anthony Quinn. The gags are there but the tongue in cheekiness and self congratulatory inside jokes are not. By the time of the second film the writers realized the magic they had and the scripts were changed accordingly. A couple of nice musical numbers ads the romance with the audience certain from the Starr whom Lamour will end up with.".

Of course the alleged Singapore setting isn't at all believable it looks like some tropical island filled with dozens of topless tanned men as toned as the sarong clad girls are laced with flowers.It's obvious to me that this wasn't planned as a series but with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby as the top new screen comedy team of 1940 along with Abbott and Costello a series was inevitable although other than gag guest appearances from Crosby in a few of Hope's films they never appeared on the screen together in anything but these 6 Road films.This has a rather ordinary plot set up with Crosby trying to get out of an engagement and out from underneath the thumb of his domineering ship magnate father Charles Coburn. It's not easy though to hide from the world when you've got sidekick Hope constantly getting them in all sorts of trouble. They meet up with Dorothy Lamour saving her from hot tempered Anthony Quinn. The gags are there but the tongue in cheekiness and self congratulatory inside jokes are not. By the time of the second film the writers realized the magic they had and the scripts were changed accordingly. A couple of nice musical numbers ads the romance with the audience certain from the Starr whom Lamour will end up with.";

	schema:reviewBody "It is with the opening shot that director Robert Klick defines mood and genre  a long shot of an exhausted man in a dusty twobit suit carrying a suitcase and a gun approaching camera coming out of the desert like some sort of gangster Moses. He passes out to die when Charles Dump Mario Adorf finds him and with him the suitcase that turns out to be filled with money. Dump takes him where he lives the dilapidated remains of a mining camp and a cat and mouse game begins.It's pretty obvious that the script and by extension the entire movie was tailored to fit the found locations. The deserted mining town with the old buildings dust seeping through the empty window sockets adds a livedin quality and production value no set can even come close to touching. We're talking about a superb location  ideal for the kind of bleak and atmospheric modern spaghetti western Deadlock wants to be. It's like some sort of mythic settlement left by its inhabitants for years to rot on the edge of the desert and forever vanish from memory.The place tries to pass for some hole in North America  and the illusion is quite good even the English dubbing is excellent by European bmovie standards. If Deadlock attempts a genre crossover between crime and spaghetti western it's always done with the same wideeyed fascination for America's mythic underbelly most Italians carried. And it's all the better for it.After watching an interview with the director it turns out that this mining camp was found in the Negev desert somewhere between the borders of Israel and Jordan in the Middle East and the movie was shot during or a little after the Six Days war with a lot of military tension in the region. Klick is right when he asserts that part of that tension and sense of adventure found its way in the actual movie.Klick's direction is just as good. The cinematography and shot selection compliment the genre character of Deadlock  in many ways this is a tribute to maestro Sergio Leone and the spaghetti western scene in general. The sweaty faces sweeping panoramas dust blowing through the wilderness extreme long shots and closeups it's all here. And what's more it's as bleak and violent as the best of those movies  it would certainly be in good company among Sergio Corbucci's ouevre. There's even a chaotic freakout near the end that is even worthy of the dinner scene in the original Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE in terms of schitzoid paranoia and violence.However the bad and ugly in Deadlock come from the same place as the good. That it is a bmovie quickie tailored to accommodate for a superb location. While the acting is decent all around Mario Adorf easily stands out and gasp he doesn't chew the scenery at all the script leaves a lot to be desired. The cat and mouse games between the main characters become predictable and tired when you realize they serve no other purpose than moving the movie towards its inevitable climax. Even the addition of a third character an accomplish of the kid called Sunshine that came to split the money does little in terms of variety. Now we have three characters trying to betray the rest and get away with the money instead of two. The middle section amounts to little more than a series of they did this then this scenes but the explosive opening and closing acts that bookend the movie really make up for it.While no masterpiece which it could have been at its heart Deadlock is grim raw and honest. It will be just as easily enjoyed by spaghetti western afficionados as followers of 70's visceral crime cinema  Peckinpah's BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA comes to mind. Fans of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN will certainly find something to appreciate here  even if it lacks the philosophical musings of McCarthy at least on first look. I'd even go as far as say that for bmovie fans that live for the kick of discovering hidden gems Deadlock is a mustsee.".

The middle section amounts to little more than a series of they did this then this scenes but the explosive opening and closing acts that bookend the movie really make up for it.While no masterpiece which it could have been at its heart Deadlock is grim raw and honest. It will be just as easily enjoyed by spaghetti western afficionados as followers of 70's visceral crime cinema  Peckinpah's BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA comes to mind. Fans of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN will certainly find something to appreciate here  even if it lacks the philosophical musings of McCarthy at least on first look. I'd even go as far as say that for bmovie fans that live for the kick of discovering hidden gems Deadlock is a mustsee.";

	schema:headline " A Sort Of Modern German Version Of The Good The Bad And The Ugly";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1970 it seems as if Roland Klick set out to emulate Sergio Leone's The Good The Bad And The Ugly mixing it with Michelangelo Antonioni's Zabriskie Point to create a modern Sauerkraut Western without horses but rather a truck and a car. The story stars three characters Marquard Bohm as the Kid The Good Siegurd Fitzek as Mr. Sunshine The Bad and Mario Adorf can be seen in Dario Argento's The Bird With The Crystal Plumage as the reclusive cat eating painter as Mr. Dump The Ugly who again plays a reclusive man who lives in a dump??. The story begins with the Kid who has just pulled off a heist with a bullet wound in the arm and is carrying millions of dollars in a case. Wandering aimlessly through the sunbaked desert he finally passes out and is left for dead until Mr. Dump drives along and finds him and the money. Once back at Mr. Dump's residence a sort of abandoned junk yard the Kid warns Mr. Dump that Mr. Sunshine who apparently is the ringleader of this heist will be coming for his money. Thus begins the cat and mouse story of who will get the case of money. Mr. Dump also has two neighbors an older and apparently sexually crazy woman and her pretty but feral daughter who is obviously sexually curious of the Kid.The film is set in what looks to be a wasteland desert which could have been a forerunner for films like A Boy And His Dog and Road Warrior. Yet the film maintains a complete Sergio Leone feel to it. You get all the great close ups of the characters sweating in the sun and the typical double crossing that took place in his westerns. The Kid in this movie also kind of resembles Charles Bronson's character in Leone's other masterpiece Once Upon A Time In The West. But on the flipside this film also kind of reminded me of Antonioni's Zabriskie Point in the surreal desert filming. Also the use of Kraut Rock band Can who's music score will remind one of Pink Floyd's music score for Antonioni's film. The inspired use of Can as the music score was a great choice because though at times it does remind you of Pink Floyd it also reminds me of Ennio Morricone's music score as well. The Kid's theme song seems to be Whiskey Man by Can and this reminds me of the way you hear that unforgettable Clint Eastwood whistling theme or the accompanying harmonica for Charles Bronson. Can's score embodies both stylizations perfectly. The film is pretty obscure and there was very little information that I could find on it. But it's worth searching out if you have an interest in different cult type movies from the late sixties or an interest in Can. But the pacing is a little uneasy and the finale was a tad unclimatic yet somehow downbeat. Though it's a German production the English dubbing will remind you of the Spaghetti Westerns as well. Cool but very weird.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deadlock is a German Englishlanguage film from 1970 so it had its 45th anniversary last year. The writer and director is Roland Klick and after having seen his most known works basically he really does not feel German at all in his approach to filmmaking. This is neither a positive nor a negative statement but it is a negative statement that most of his works did so little to me so I guess his success with awards bodies is mostly due to him really being somewhat different compared to other filmmakers from his country. Here he unites Mario Adorf Marquard Bohm brother of Hark and Scottish actor Anthony Dawson Dr. No for a German western movie. Quite a challenge. All in all I must say not a successful challenge unfortunately. I would not really blame any of the acting trio but the writing mostly. Adorf was probably the standout here and his strong physical approach to acting as well as his whole looks thing fit perfectly into the world of western movies. Had he been American and not Swiss he may have ended up as one of the huge stars of the genre. Bohm was almost entirely wasted in my opinion especially from that moment on when it became a threeman show and not a twoman show. He really did not manage to hold his own against the other two and he also did not have the material so it is really difficult to understand and appreciate the ending with him being the great winner. Dawson did fine with what he was given but it was all too generic and stereotypical in my opinion. His sadistic approach got old really quickly and the longer it went on the more it just became a film lacking any action except Adorf's character being pushed around and humiliated by Dawson's. Quite a shame. I felt that Klick had a lot more at his hands to make this a good film the potential is there but the execution is just so underwhelming that I would only really recommend it to the most diehard western fans. Then again these may be the most disappointed here. Still to end the review on a more positive note another thumbsup for Mario Adorf channeling his own Eli Wallach while looking a lot like Bud Spencer. But a thumbsdown for everything else. I don't recommend the watch.".

There's a cartoonish element to most murder in the movies but the first part of this movie rather emphasises how difficult it is to kill someone how you have to go against all the hardwiring in your head that says not to. So when the violence does happen it hits home pretty hard.

The message is in the story and a surprise ending is the last thing this charming story needs or thankfully has.Oh and since I used to be someone exactly like the Reeves character is the start of the movie I can relate to what it is to discover that there is more to life. His character is real alright but in the surreal sort of way that only those who have actually been there and escaped truly understand. Now if only I had had someone as charming as Ms. Theron to show me  Anyway this is not an epic film or even a great film  its just a film with a story a few messages and some excellent performances that will tug on your emotions  not altogether a bad thing in a cynical age.".

The message is in the story and a surprise ending is the last thing this charming story needs or thankfully has.Oh and since I used to be someone exactly like the Reeves character is the start of the movie I can relate to what it is to discover that there is more to life. His character is real alright but in the surreal sort of way that only those who have actually been there and escaped truly understand. Now if only I had had someone as charming as Ms. Theron to show me  Anyway this is not an epic film or even a great film  its just a film with a story a few messages and some excellent performances that will tug on your emotions  not altogether a bad thing in a cynical age.";

This is not really a comedy per se as there is a dramatic element to it and the performances should not be so easily dismissed.Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves look good together Keanu is not playing a superficial action role so the focus is not on him. This is a good thing especially as we can then appreciate Charlize Theron's performance as Sara Deaver a quirky girl who Nelson Keanu meets at the DMV in San Francisco. San Francisco is an interesting backdrop the positive aspects of it are emphasized and it becomes another character in the film.Jason Isaccs plays Chaz Cherry the local crossdresser who is Theron's friend and confidante. He does well in this and last night I actually saw him in Friends With Money wherein his talent was literally wasted. Liam Aiken portrays Abner who is quasiadopted by Theron and Reeves as their relationship develops.There are some funny scenes like where Greg Germann Reeves' coworker at an ad agency orders cappuccino and is told off by the waitress. Also where Reeves is presenting an ad campaign for hot dogs and he eventually flips out.The film works because it is not a gushing romance film I am not a big fan of Reeves but he was very good in this film. Theron was excellent as always and there are some beautiful shots of the Bay in San Francisco a nice backdrop for a bittersweet romance.".

First I never saw the original second I normally do not care for romantic movies and third I am a big fan of Keanu Reeves. The reviews are quick to call Nelson Moss a self absorbed workaholic. The movie does bring out a little of Nelson's past explaining how he feared he would end up like his father and the rest of the neighbors on his block. Combine that with the high pressure in today's society to get ahead and you can understand why Nelson is obsessed with work.  Sara is very original and entertaining and makes you wonder if she's all there or what is she up to.  After almost 90 minutes into the film you will see why Sara is the way she is and maybe enjoy the movie.  Keanu does a good performance with Nelson creating a believable image of a single focused Ad Executive.  One can see many women saying typical male and many men thinking of Nelson as a typical best buddy. As is true with many things in life Nelson goes from one extreme to the other. In the end Sara becomes his single focus in life. Trying to find the middle road is a central theme in many of Keanu's movie roles. I liked the acting in this film. It wasn't too dramatic nor was it bland. It was right down the middle.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS Sweet November gets off to a bumpy start.  Charlize Theron's character is first established as sort of a...well...borderline psychopath.  Theron bumps into Keanu Reeves during a DMV exam.  The two of them have a weird encounter in the parking lot.  Later on that night she shows up at his apartment. He doesn't know how the hell she got his address.  Since she failed the DMV exam she asks him for a ride.  Now at this point he should be terrified at this woman!  He barely knows her and suddenly she asks him for a favor? After a long period of arguing he finally succumbs to this favor.  Then she breaks into this building and steals a dog.  At this point Keanu should be even more terrified!  But he keeps driving her.  She invites him up to her place for cocoa.  Again a conflict he finally succumbs to.  She explains the whole Spend a Month With Me and I'll Change Your Life deal.  Of course at first he says no.  He's a workaholic with no time for this crap.  He makes a bad presentation for his advertising firm he loses his temper and his job. Then he thinks What the hell.  I'll go to this crazy btch's place and see what this is all about.  He obviously can't stand her at first.  The way she lives such a simple life totally contradictory to his.  Night falls things heat up and the two of them are already in the sack!  Now that's just a cheap attempt to have two hot actors heat up the screen.  Keanu's character can't even stand being near her yet he's suddenly ripping her clothes off and tackling her to the couch?  Another one of those onlyinthemovies moments.Luckily the film's appeal increases as it goes along.  The performances by the two leads are strong though I can't help but feel Charlize was a little miscast.  For some reason I don't picture her nebbish character as a beautiful woman with no facial blemishes.  I mean even Gwyneth Paltrow was convincing in Bounce because they didn't try to make her look beautiful. Half of the film she's wearing hardly any makeup.  But that's a flaw I was able to look over.  The point is the two characters are so likable and the two actors have such a cute chemistry that I couldn't hate this movie past the 30minute mark.  The moments they share are genuine and though I don't think Keanu's character arc would've been generated quite so successfully I was willing to look that over as well.  Yes this is moderately standard Hollywood fluff but it works.  And I was oddly captivated.I also wish I could've been given a better explanation about Charlize's whole Spend a Month With Me deal.  It's a pretty strange concept and something that should've been explained with more detail.  You mean EVERY month she can actually get a guy to live with her no strings attached? As if she's a guardian angel and she just patrols the streets of San Francisco looking for her next customer who seemingly needs help?  And I'm sure out of all those guys Keanu is not the first one she had actual feelings for. Women are more libidinous than you think.  I also wanted a better explanation of the Jason Isaacs character.  Was he gay or what?  Maybe I misinterpreted but did him and Charlize use to go out?  Is he bisexual? And what was that whole family crisis that Charlize had to deal with? There's a good deal of loose ends in this story that were either not clearly explained or not explained at all.  And this is not a Hitchcock thriller so you can't tell me the characters and plotlines were meant to be enigmatic.I have to say I did appreciate the ending.  It wasn't overly sentimental and I still found it sad and touching.  And it sort of left things openended.  One of those Where Do I Go From Here? conclusions.  But someone did point out something interestingthe trailers almost ruined the film!  You see in the ads Charlize lying in hospital bed with her face completely pale.  Geez I wonder what to expect?  I assumed the plot was Charlize was dying and she wanted to spend the last days of her life with Keanu.  It's times like this I wish they stuck with the teaser trailers.Sweet November is not a great movie but it's sad touching sometimes funny and contains two fine performances.  It has an odd appeal to it. One of those films you want to keep on watching for no explicit reason.  You don't know why you're into it you just are.  Maybe it's a guilty pleasure maybe not.  Who knows?  But I'd be a lying pretentious snob if I were to say I didn't like it.  This is just my take.My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Sweet Autumn in New York in November";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember when my best friend and I wanted to see a movie this is strangely enough the first movie we ever saw together sad start as this was just a pretty bad movie. Sweet November is another predictable pointless romantic movie that is trying too hard on the saps. Now I love Chalize Theron and Keanu Reeves Charlize is an academy award winning actress with an awesome career Keanu well woah. Their chemistry was on in The Devil's Advocate so I guess they were looking for a similar chemistry in a more sappy movie. The problem is that we had the movie Autumn in New York that same year Sweet November was released also A Walk to Remember Love Story they're all the same exact scripts with different characters.Nelson Moss is a typical businessman who devotes his life to his career. He meets Sarah a woman very different from anyone else he has ever met. His arrogance and ignorance leads to her failing her DMV test and she decides to track him down to make him pay for what he did. She continually asks him to spend a month with her to be her November on the promise that she will change his life. That night she sleeps with him and the next day another man arrives in the apartment a friend of Sarah's who is able to identify Nelson as Sarah's November. Nelson believes quite rightly that something strange is going on and leaves. Sarah then runs after Nelson and finally convinces him to stay with her for as long as he can. Throughout the course of November the two experience very happy times together and some breakups. But there's more that Sarah is hiding from Nelson then he realizes other than just being her November.I don't mean to bash the movie so much just these movies do tick me off where like I said it just seems like they're insulting our intelligence and taking old scripts using a red crayon and scratching out the names and changing them just to pass by. Charlize was very adorable as Sarah but these characters really don't have many redeemable qualities as they're very self absorbed and selfish. No matter what the motivation was I wasn't feeling the romance and I wasn't feeling sorry for any of these jerks. I wouldn't really recommend this movie I promise if you've seen any of the other movies I mentioned then you've already seen Sweet November.210".

	schema:headline " The script was two dimensional not the acting!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was shown over the free channel last Sunday. I read up on the reviews for preparation to be unbiased and fair to it.I think the problem with this movie is a tired plot and a terribly two dimensional script. Keanu's and Charlize's performance was what helped to lift it out of a 410 rating for me. Jason Issac as a cross dressing flatmate was a heartwarming portrayal of how friendship does not always come in neat little packages hemmed in by our expectations. His loyalty and support for Charlize's Sara was the real cruncher in this movie for me. Nelson's initial shock and reaction on seeing Jason's Chaz in a loud dress was hilarious only because it does mirror the general population's.The other part of the movie that I find strangely revealing and therefore very endearing was when Nelson decides Christmas should come a month early for Sara. He pops into her house via the window while everyone is having Thanksgiving and proceeds to give her twelve gifts for Christmas. Each gift and especially the last one was obviously well thought out in relation to his feelings for her and their relationship throughout that November.I have read snippets of how Keanu is very fiercely protective private very loving and giving as a person to those he cares deeply about and that entire scene made me realize this is less acting the part but more a lingering snapshot of a small part of who he really is.I have so far watched Speed A Walk in the Clouds and the Matrix Trilogy all of which showcases Keanu as a leading man. I must say that I do catch glimpses of what looks like the real Keanu popping up every now and then. So it's no wonder that Sandra Bullock should say that she was very taken by the way Keanu looked at her just before he kissed her at the end of Speed.I think that many people are quick to rubbish Keanu's acting as wooden because they fail to notice that bit of his soul often very obviously displayed on the screen just because it usually isn't displayed on his face.Enjoy the movie for what it is a simple love story with a bittersweet ending and you won't be disappointed.".

I have about 300 channels Kindle Video etc. The only reason it probably was off my radar was that my son was only six months old at the time. I am a sucker for love stories and believe me I've seen my share of rotten eggs masquerading as a love story and paid for expensive theater tickets because critics said it was a good movie and then got disappointed. I saw this as a suggestion on my kindle and it intrigued me so I watched it. I can't understand WHY THE CRITICS DISLIKED THIS MOVIE. Chaz Keaneau acted the part exactly as it was supposed to be. An insensitive workaholic who never got a mirror shoved in his face. The Character Sara Charleze Showed just as much compassion as desperation to make a change in someone's life as well as trying to live her life to the fullest. I don't think I'd blame her because I think a lot of people would do the same knowing the percentage of the cure of her diagnosis. Her choice was to stay in a hospital bed and hope for a miracle or try to live her life without remorse right up to the end. I worked in a nursing home once and saw people being kept alive much longer then their quality of life which was drug induced pain induced machine extended time machine as they waited for their lives to end. I wept like a baby at the end. I think the critics hated it because it didn't have a Disney ending like most love stories do ie The Notebook the Time Traveler You've got mail which I thought the premise of that plot to be entirely ridiculous etc. There was some awkwardness in a couple of scenes but in the entirety of the movie I really didn't consider it important. I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND BOUGHT IT THE DAY AFTER I RENTED IT. If you like love stories like Somewhere in Time. You'll love Sweet November.".

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently SWEET November is a remake from a movie originally made in 1968. I still haven't seen the original and when I recently went into this 2001 version I expected a rather superficial romantic comedy about a girl who changes boyfriends every month. Unsuspectedly I got much more out of it even on a personal level. The movie begins fairly lighthearted but near the end you'll have to endure some pretty heavyweight drama. The good thing is None of it all ever becomes cheap. But if you're an emotional human being it's almost a 100 sure that at one point or another you will feel the urge to shed a tear. Although the ending itself is the most obvious part that will cause viewers to swallow or make their eyes go all watery my moment of feebleness was when Keanu Reeves brought back the little puppy to Charlize Thereon as a surprise gift.I'd describe this film as a moving romantic drama with touches of comedy. The screenplay itself is like a softly rippling stream that takes you on a gentle ride. And it never changes its ways... No storm will take you by surprise... No whirlpool will suddenly drag you down... But slowly dark and ominous clouds will darken the sky above you. So indeed Nelson Moss inevitably discovers the real reason why Sara Deever wanted him to be her November boyfriend. My idea is that most people will see this coming from miles away for one thing because of several subtle hints both in the screenplay and visuals are being given. And I also believe that the movie intended it that way. But what probably wasn't the intention was me figuring out at the 36 minutes mark exactly what was wrong with Sara Deever even down to the exact nature of her condition. It was in the scene where Sara was making eggs for breakfast after their first night together it suddenly hit me. So that was sort of a little bummer there me knowing it from then on. Instead of fully enjoying all the romantic stuff between them and witnessing how they grew towards each other a part of me was constantly waiting for the 'signs' to reveal themselves.Still it didn't spoil too much. However there was one big 'partypooper'scene. I won't go into it but... how the hell did Nelson manage to walk out of a hospital unseen carrying a terminally ill patient who was on a heartmonitoring machine in his arms without one single person of the medical staff noticing him? It was the one and only moment that I 'went out of the movie' and just shook my head going Yeah right.... But gladly I quickly got over it and enjoyed the rest of the movie. The ending is just damn good. Even though some part of me didn't want it to end that way it still was the only way I wanted it to end. And I'm aware that saying this might make me sound like as if I'm a barrel full of contradictions but just see the movie and you'll understand it.I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the performances of the whole cast. Charlize Theron especially shone in this one and even Keanu Reeves was enjoyable in every way from the gogetter he was in the beginning of the movie to the likable and caring person he became at the end. As far as the comedy aspects go in SWEET November that scene where he explained his new hot dog campaign during the meeting was simply hilarious. I even rewatched that one scene the next day and was grinning all the way through it.So yep I think this is a very good movie and it sure was a pleasant surprise for me. I'd probably be rating it even higher if it wasn't for those one or two little funspoilers I mentioned earlier... Hmmm... and maybe I also missed one truly hot and steamy sexscene between Keanu and Charlize there. But still SWEET November is a movie for all to enjoy except maybe for those of you who have this way too cynical look on life and love. To them I can only say Lighten up you're deteriorating the quality of your life and the lives of people close to you.Have a nice day! Thanx to this special person who wanders around on this site often for recommending this movie to me. She knows who she is and I dedicate this review to her.".

Thanx to this special person who wanders around on this site often for recommending this movie to me. She knows who she is and I dedicate this review to her.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have never seen the original 1968 version of Sweet November but I have a hunch it was better than this.  It had to be.  The 2001 update starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron is downright awful!  It is about a woman who invites a new man to live with her every month and introduces them to a radical new style of living don't worry it's not too radical that mainstream audiences won't find it 'cute'.  All of a sudden one November she welcomes in Keanu and surprise she falls in love with him and doesn't want to let him go!  Now a twist in the story develops but you probably already know if from the television trailers that made it a point to advertise only the end of the film.Even if you find the setup interesting it's hard to find the execution of it all more than contrived.  The performances are less than convincing and Charlize doesn't exactly sizzle with Reeves.  Definitely one of the more forgettable films of the year.".

With Mr.Stoneface not faced by anything and the obnoxious bohemian chick is never a match made i heaven.Let me list the things that are just so unbelievable in this movie and what really would have happened.  At the DMV Sara coming in with her bags spilling stuff all over the floor result She would be asked to leave.  Nelson asking her for the answer to no 9. result She would not answer him instead she would focus on her own test.  Sara get called to the desk and they rip up her paper. result She points a finger at Nelson saying HE CHEATED! Possably telling the entire class the answer to no. 9 giving the deskguy the finger and then walk out.  Sara sitting on Nelsons car. result He'd have hissyfit and tell her to get off it.  Nelson offering Sara a month pay. result She'd take it!  Sara showing up at his house. result He'd call the police. before or after talking to her  Sara asking him for a ride. result He would give her cab money.  Sara breaking in stealing dogs. result He'd call the police. Sara inviting him upthreatening him to come back. result He'd tell her to foff and drive away. and possibly have to call the police the next morning  Sara asking him to move in. result He'd tell her to foff and drive away.  Sara sending him a dog and a key. result He sends the dog back possibly alive and call the cops.Now even if all this STILL would lead up to him ending up at her place for a night of sex...  Sara giving away his clothes. result He slaps her across the face and leave.  Sara trying to introduce him to everyone on the block. result Sara I just don't give at sht.  Nelson leaving Saras place and going home and get bored. result He would download porn watch some and go to sleep.Now if all of these things still would result in him returning to her to live...  Living together... result No one have a job  no one pay rent.. And besides from sex what do they have in common??  Sara telling him about all the guys she had. result He'd leave. Make a doctors appointment and check for STDs.  Sara taking him to the boatrace. result He'd be on the phone.  He pay the guy to help out and having Sara telling him it was wrong. result Fine you stuck up bitch. Is there anything I do that is 'good enough' for you? Who died and made you queen of everything?  Sara being selfrightious about everything. result He'd pack up and leave.  Abner telling him to come to fathers day while Sara is just released from the hospital. result He'd tell the kid to ask his mum who his real daddy is and go bother him.  Nelson getting an interview with the Price. result Priceless! He would never turn it down!When Sara finally tell him about the illness he would pay the hospital bills out of guilt and when she tells him to leave he would. There is no chance in hell that these two people would have a future together even if she wasn't sick. They have nothing in common and the fact that he give up his life to marry her is just not possible. I feel sorry for Angelica wasting her time on him and for his pet goldfish that no one fed for a month and died wondering what he did wrong.. in his aquarium with one lousy plant and no sand.This is by far one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. It get two stars because of the soundtrack and ... There was a cute pet in it. The rest just plain sucks.".

I'm watching Sweet November for the first time on TBS. Wait I've actually seen this before and forgot about it. I only forget movies when they are unremarkable. But seriously Keanu's acting... Oh my god... I remember really bad movies. Why the hell did I forget about this one? Wanna know the all time worst movie of all time? The Faculty with Elijah Wood. I won't forget Sweet November again either.Charlize Theron is extremely attractive as always probably the only good thing about the film and fairly well acted. The general logic of action is completely well illogical and the dialog is corny as hell. I think I'm just watching for Charlize! But also... Ya know when there's an accident or train wreck and you can't help but look? It's like that. I can't help but continue watching...The acting of many actors is just unnatural in general. Emotions and feelings are communicated verbally rather than through body language and it seems so fake and unrehearsed! Did they shoot this thing in a week or something? There are too many characters not enough depth or development for any of them way too many events and the pace is just too fast for a drama. And Enya singing on the soundtrack? Nice touch of the dramatic but it seems out of place on this film. The slow music just clashes with the fast story. This director tried to squeeze way too much into a small duration of time and did a horrible job instructing the actors! It's kinda sad to see professional actors doing work that is just so below their abilities. The flow and progression of events is disconnected and haphazard. And then Keanu singing? They really should have done a voice over...OK I didn't plan to write a review for this movie but it was just so bad that I had to complain in some way. I couldn't help but notice that the director of this movie Pat O'Connor has not had a directing job since this movie and that he used to direct TV. Coincidence that he hasn't made a movie or worked since? Yeah that's a tough call...".
