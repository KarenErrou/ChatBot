The use of intertitles is limited and works well. The cast here is good Carl Brisson who would later become the fatherinlaw of Rosalind Russell and Anny Ondra who Hitchcock would use again in Blackmail however some of the plot lines are not fully developed and one rather important element is left unsaid in the story's ending.

However while that earlier boxing drama eventually pulled its punch excuse the pun The Manxman is a far harsher affair with a ruthless disregard for its characters' fates that prefigures film noir.As was Hitchcock's style from his earliest works his aim here as a director is to place the audience inside the scenario no matter how uncomfortable it makes them. The film is almost entirely composed of pointofview shots and an unusually large number of them in which an actor looks straight into the camera. Time and time again Carl Brisson's big innocent face stares out at us as if implicating us in the guilt of the other two leads.This also happens to be one of a small number of Hitchcock pictures which is very beautiful to look at. There are plenty of exquisite location shots and great use of natural lighting in ironic counterpoint to the darkness of the story.While not quite the best of them The Manxman is perhaps the most confident of Hitchcock's silent pictures. Whereas the majority of his silents relied too much upon rather obvious expressionist camera techniques The Manxman is shot much more straightforwardly and yet it still has a smooth flowing style and isn't cluttered up with too many title cards.

	schema:reviewBody "For me this movie was an education in silent cinema.It is crucial to see silent movies in a good print. The Studio Canal Manxman is not pristine but is as good as any movie that old is ever likely to be. Because I wasn't peering through scratches at jumpy faded fuzzy images I could finally appreciate how good even very early cinematography was and that silent movie acting wasn't just crude gesticulating. Anny Ondra is a revelation and the movie is worth watching for her alone. However...The movie is a love triangle. Innkeeper's daughter Kate is in love with lawyer Phil but agrees to marry his boyhood friend Pete who then goes abroad to seek his fortune. She learns that Pete has died and gets closer to Phil. Pete unexpectedly returns and marries Kate. They have a child. Although Pete is a good husband and father she continues to pine after Phil. Finally she leaves her husband but Phil will not commit himself to her. She tries to reclaim her daughter revealing that Pete is not the father. He refuses to give up the child and in despair she tries to commit suicide. She ends up in Court where Phil is now the presiding magistrate. His role in the affair is revealed and he resigns his office to go off with Kate and their child. Pete is left distraught.This is not a typical Hitchcock movie and he was always dismissive of it. He had no reason to be. It is a finely wrought melodrama with many effective and moving scenes and is as well made as any of his more characteristic films of the era but it also illustrates the limitations of silent cinema as a dramatic medium.I haven't read the book on which The Manxman is based but I suspect its whole thrust is quite different to this movie.Phil loves Kate but feels marriage to her would damage his legal career. With Pete away he becomes increasingly infatuated with her and eventually seduces her. He ought to marry her but is still torn between love and ambition. When he learns that Pete is alive and coming home to claim his bride he uses loyalty to his friend as an excuse to evade his responsibility but is still tortured to see her marrying another man. He goes away to pursue his legal career and achieves his ambition to be made 'Deemster'. When Kate leaves her husband he still prevaricates. It takes Kate's attempted suicide and his denunciation in Court to force him into the decision he should have taken years before.It is really Phil's story and his moral dilemma is at its heart.All of this can clearly be glimpsed in the movie but doesn't drive it. For example Phil's Aunt warns him against an imprudent marriage but it is never clear that he is ambitious enough to heed her warning so when he helps Pete to court Kate it is not obvious that his pain is largely selfinflicted he actually comes across as a sad romantic Cyrano de Bergerac figure.Later when he steps aside in favour of Pete the duplicity of his motive can be inferred but isn't really shown. Rather he seems both honourable and generous. Even when Kate has left her husband his internal conflict is not fully realised. His indecision seems almost accidental the telephone always seems to be ringing at the wrong time.Because the movie cannot quite get to grips with Phil's story it becomes Kate's story by default.I don't think this is simply a failure of Hitchcock or his scenarist. It is also a failure of the medium. There are many great scenes in the movie Phil helping Pete woo the woman he secretly loves himself Kate's unexpected reaction to news of Pete's death Phil's misreading of the situation when Pete wants to tell him that Kate is pregnant Pete's discovery that his wife is missing and many more. These are the sort of scenes that silent movies did best so it is inevitable that the movie organises itself around them. But it also means that Phil's story loses its specificity and its central role.A whole generation of movie critics bitterly regretted the passing of the silent cinema and its 'universal language' but I think they misread the situation. By the early Twenties moviemakers were becoming more and more ambitious and they were soon trying to tell stories that could not be told adequately in pantomime. They wanted to make drama but the medium was always pushing them towards melodrama.One clue to their dilemma was the tendency to overuse title cards to explain the more subtle and complex stories they were now trying to tell. For example The Hunchback of Notre Dame has some great visual images but is so peppered with title cards that you end up reading the movie rather than watching it. The problem for silent cinema is that people talk that is what they do  most of the time! When The Manxman was made silent movies had long been crying out for sound.The silent cinema had a universality that sound movies lost but it was bought at a heavy price. Silent cinema may have been a universal language but it was not much more than a pidgin language. Pidgin languages are useful for passing a few simple ideas across a language divide but they cannot convey the richness of thought that natural languages can.The issue here is not that you cannot make great silent films. Clearly you can. People did! It is that most stories don't make good silent films  and those were the stories moviemakers increasingly wanted to tell.I am belatedly coming to appreciate the considerable achievements of the silent cinema but I cannot regret its passing.".

For example Phil's Aunt warns him against an imprudent marriage but it is never clear that he is ambitious enough to heed her warning so when he helps Pete to court Kate it is not obvious that his pain is largely selfinflicted he actually comes across as a sad romantic Cyrano de Bergerac figure.Later when he steps aside in favour of Pete the duplicity of his motive can be inferred but isn't really shown. Rather he seems both honourable and generous. Even when Kate has left her husband his internal conflict is not fully realised. His indecision seems almost accidental the telephone always seems to be ringing at the wrong time.Because the movie cannot quite get to grips with Phil's story it becomes Kate's story by default.I don't think this is simply a failure of Hitchcock or his scenarist. It is also a failure of the medium. There are many great scenes in the movie Phil helping Pete woo the woman he secretly loves himself Kate's unexpected reaction to news of Pete's death Phil's misreading of the situation when Pete wants to tell him that Kate is pregnant Pete's discovery that his wife is missing and many more. These are the sort of scenes that silent movies did best so it is inevitable that the movie organises itself around them. But it also means that Phil's story loses its specificity and its central role.A whole generation of movie critics bitterly regretted the passing of the silent cinema and its 'universal language' but I think they misread the situation. By the early Twenties moviemakers were becoming more and more ambitious and they were soon trying to tell stories that could not be told adequately in pantomime. They wanted to make drama but the medium was always pushing them towards melodrama.One clue to their dilemma was the tendency to overuse title cards to explain the more subtle and complex stories they were now trying to tell. For example The Hunchback of Notre Dame has some great visual images but is so peppered with title cards that you end up reading the movie rather than watching it. The problem for silent cinema is that people talk that is what they do  most of the time! When The Manxman was made silent movies had long been crying out for sound.The silent cinema had a universality that sound movies lost but it was bought at a heavy price. Silent cinema may have been a universal language but it was not much more than a pidgin language. Pidgin languages are useful for passing a few simple ideas across a language divide but they cannot convey the richness of thought that natural languages can.The issue here is not that you cannot make great silent films. Clearly you can. People did! It is that most stories don't make good silent films  and those were the stories moviemakers increasingly wanted to tell.I am belatedly coming to appreciate the considerable achievements of the silent cinema but I cannot regret its passing.";

It would be normal for her to marry the laughing sailor. The lawyer is actually above her station. When news comes that he betrothed has died it would be natural for her to marry the lawyer. However he is fraught with contradictions. His father was a failure and he is in line for a judgeship. He gets her pregnant but won't fess up. The sailor returns from the sea. News of his death was incorrect. So now we have the problem. She loves the lawyer. She doesn't love the sailor. But she has given her word to wait. Instead of being honorable the lawyer wants it both ways. it has a pretty harsh ending which I won't spoil. I thought for a film of 1929 this was pretty good".

The settings and photography are excellent the acting is generally good and the story's setup is believable and had possibilities.The best part of the movie is the setting on the Isle of Man which is done very nicely with wellchosen settings and terrific photography.  The setting is woven into the story very well and many of the scenes are given backgrounds and props which reemphasize the distinctive setting andor give useful symbolism to the events in the plot.  Fishing boats an old water mill and the island's rocky beauty are all used effectively.The characters are presented well and you quickly get to know them and sympathize with them.  The first part of the story moves quickly and efficiently establishes the lovetriangle theme.  The three leads Carl Brisson Anny Ondra and Malcolm Keen are all quite good in this part.Unfortunately the rest of the story is rather a disappointment moving very slowly at times and often painful to watch because of some notable flaws in the ways the characters act.  All this really detracts from the continuing good direction and camera work.  There is a very nicely conceived jump cut at one point that could have been very powerful if the story were better and the climactic sequence does hold some real irony and suspense but it just doesn't have the impact that it could have had.  Hitchcock does his best with things but it's too bad that he did not have a freer hand with the material which was apparently based on a novel that for whatever reason had acquired a certain popularity at the time.Ultimately this movie is just average.  But there are still some strengths here and it is probably worth a look for silent film fans who especially appreciate good blackandwhite photography or for devoted Hitchcock fans who will appreciate the touches he added to an otherwise unsatisfying story.".

No the thing that struck me again and again as I watched this sudsy rubbish was the bad casting. The girl a popular European 27 year old actress of that era looks intentionally I think like a ditzy 18 year old version of Jean Harlow. 18 may be a good age for a girl in trouble in traditional British lower class society but it makes it hard to understand why the much older Philip would be in love with her or why after her girlintrouble problem is solved she would be so much in love with him as to push the love triangle into tragedy. The emotion flow doesn't make sense in either direction.For the role of Philip  good lawyer unreliable friend and lover  we see a man clearly in his 40's who looks old enough to be the girl's father. The third node in the triangle is Danish actor Carl Brisson 34 when this was made  whose most often used talent in this film was his ability to grin glassy eyed into the camera showing us two enormous dimple lines.Despite the limitations of the casting and Pete's acting ability the performance qualities aren't too bad. For example when the town doctor comes down to announce the birth of the girl's child he first asks Who's the father? as if he was the only person in a small fishing village who wouldn't know. Philip stands up excitedly and is about to claim the honor but realizes that he can't give himself away so he makes a small gesture to point at Pete. Nicely handled.Bottom line is that there's very little evidence of Hitchcock's later more polished style and not much other reason to rent this movie.".

Anyway word comes from Africa that Pete has died leaving Kate and Philip free to declare their love for one another  something neither had felt able to do when poor old Pete was alive.Of course this being an opera of the soapiest kind it turns out the jungle drums got it wrong and Pete isn't dead after all! He returns to the Isle of Man a wealthier man instantly making himself more acceptable to Kate's father. Now this is where you'd think Kate and Philip would come clean  after all they thought Pete was dead  but instead they keep quiet about their affair and Kate marries Pete out of a sense of obligation.There's plenty more plot to follow but suffice it to say that a lot of handwringing and soulsearching follows. And either Kate and Phil were still at it after Pete returned from Africa or Pete's too thick to do the maths and release that he was still oceanbound when his loving wife conceived.The plot summary above actually makes the film sound more interesting than it really is. Everyone overacts terribly and all the characters are too shallowly drawn to be of much interest. The plot grows increasingly silly as coincidence is piled upon contrivance and the downbeat ending proves an inadequate payoff.".

And either Kate and Phil were still at it after Pete returned from Africa or Pete's too thick to do the maths and release that he was still oceanbound when his loving wife conceived.The plot summary above actually makes the film sound more interesting than it really is. Everyone overacts terribly and all the characters are too shallowly drawn to be of much interest. The plot grows increasingly silly as coincidence is piled upon contrivance and the downbeat ending proves an inadequate payoff.";

The girl they were after was a knockout even in today's standards commented earlier. Hitch ended the silent era with a bang minus the ending and everything after the attempted suicide. It got a little confusing and matters could have been resolved with the pregnancy happening after Pete is reported dead.The real question is did Phil ever love the girl as much as Pete. I don't think so as Phil thought more of his career than the girl. All of a sudden Phil has to hide the girl and she wanted the baby so she goes back. She ends up attempting suicide and ends up being rescued. This is Phillips big day as Deemster and she happens to go before him. He has to decide whether to risk his career and tell Pete the truth or go on like nothing happens. Well he thought more of his career and wouldn't confess anything until the father of the girl suspected and everything unraveled. So if the movie was a little longer and more minor characters introduced this would be a topnotch movie. I sure enjoyed it and I will watch it again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Manxman is Alfred Hitchcock's last silent film before he switched over to sound with Blackmail 1929. This movie is about a fisherman named Pete Quilliam and his childhood friend Philip Christian. Pete is in love with a girl named Kate but Kate's father disapproves of their marriage so he goes off to Africa to first make some money. He tells Philip to look after her while he is gone but Kate and Philip end up falling in love. Since Kate promised she'd wait for Pete she still ends up marrying him upon his return but she also has an affair with Philip and things start to turn ugly as Pete starts to learn more and more about what is going on. The film is based off of a novel and the story is very good and interesting although it seems to follow Hitchcock's typical theme of a love triangle which he has in many of his films.The acting in the movie is very good overall with Carl Brisson as Pete. He pulls off happiness sadness anger and concern all very well which is a wide spectrum of emotion for one actor. Malcolm Keen plays Philip who does a less spectacular but still decent job. And then there is Anny Ondra who plays Kate and she does a worthwhile job at showing love for Philip but not for Pete. So while all of the actors do a good job it is really Brisson who steals the show.All of the special effects in the film seem pretty good with each of the sets looking nice. The courtroom dock house and just about everything else looks right. And during a drowning scene it also looks pretty real. The musical score is mediocre and feels like it's just a lot of recycled music from earlier Hitchcock films but at least it gets the job done.Overall this film isn't perfect by any means but it does have a lot of positive qualities which make it worth watching. The plot is really interesting and entertaining if you aren't already sick of Hitchcock's love triangle theme and the acting in the film is overall pretty good. And the special effects here are great even if the film does have some mediocre music. I'd say that this is one of Hitchcock's better silent films so give it a watch if you get the chance. Score 710".

The story is another lovetriangle that was popular in the era that this motion picture was made. And although the premise of this kind of movie is somewhat familiar I did find The Manxman to be fairly interesting if somewhat drawn out.Acting by the cast was exceptionally well. Gorgeous silent movie actress Anny Ondra was very good as the girl who finds herself the embodiment of affection of two men she's fond of. Malcolm Keen and Carl Brisson were also very strong in their roles. And as sillysounding as a story like this is I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. Enough to take it seriously.Now at two hours The Manxman is a bit slow maybe too much for its own good. Like a lot of Hitchcock's earlycareer films it's a decent movie but not a great one. It won't linger on in your memory forever like the masterpieces that Hitchcock would make later in his career. But hey everybody has to start out somewhere.".

This large island is located between Britain and Ireland and actually produces its own money and has its own particular language though English is commonly spoken. Outside the UK I doubt if that man people are familiar with this place or would recognize the threelegged symbol the triskelion on its flag. Just a bit of history to put the whole thing in perspective. Plus it's the only film I can recall having seen that's set on this island.The film begins with two friends living on the island. Pete is a poor fisherman and Philip is from a well to do family. They both are in love with the same girl though because Philip is such a nice guy he stands aside and says nothing. However the girl's father won't have Pete for a soninlaw because he's so poor so Philip goes off to sea to earn his fortune. Unfortunately word soon comes to everything that Pete has died so Philip announces to the girl that he loves her. Coincidentally it turns out she always loved Philip as well so they plan on marrying. Then out of the blue Pete returnshe didn't die while at sea after all. The first thing he does is ask the girl again to be his bride. Heartbroken but feeling responsible since Pete asked her first she agrees. Unfortunately unknown to her and Philip is that she is carrying Philip's baby!! Yikes.Well after the baby is born apparently Pete couldn't figure out that the kid was his and Philip moves to England to start life anew. However soon she follows himleaving poor Pete stuck at home with the kid. What a mess but in spite of this Pete keeps up a brave face and tells everyone she's on holiday. Later he comes to see Philip to ask him to help find his wifelittle did he know that she was with his best friend all along.If you think about it this plot is very much like a soap opera and is nothing like the films for which Hitchcock became wellknown. As far as the film goes it is pretty interesting but the plot suffers from one problem. When Pete returned from sea had they just told him the truththat they fell in love AFTER they heard he was deadthen the whole mess could have been avoided. Sure Pete would have been upset but would have no doubt understood. However aside from this obvious solution it's a pretty interesting film and is well made though a tad predictable. As far as the acting goes it's pretty good for a silentwithout an serious overemoting.By the way Hitchcock's next film also 1929 turned out to be Britain's first sound film. While this was well behind the US move to sound it was still early compared to the rest of the world.".

Pete sets out to make his money but while he's gone Kate and Philip fall in love. Once again Hitchcock jumps into the melodrama which is strange that he'd go for this type of film so much even after making a splash with the thriller The Lodger. As with Hitchcock's other entries in this genre this film offers up some nice technical stuff but the director just can't handle the melodrama too well. There are some beautiful sequences here including one where Pete asks Philip to talk to the girl's father while he waits outside. Hitchcock shows up this scene from the point of view of Pete who is outside looking in through a window. This scene works very well as does one showing Kate after she receives word that he has been killed. I really wasn't too impressed with Brisson here who goes way over the top to the point where his performance comes off rather silly. Keen on the other hand is very good in his role and Ondra is good in her role. Radnle Ayrton steals the show as her father. This is certainly far from a bad movie but the director has so much better out there than this here will only appeal to diehard fans who must see everything the man did.".

This is certainly far from a bad movie but the director has so much better out there than this here will only appeal to diehard fans who must see everything the man did.";

In his own way Hitchcock provided an element of suspense to the story as I was waiting impatiently for Philip Malcolm Keen and Kate Anny Ondra to come clean with Pete Carl Brisson about their feelings for each other. That Pete and Kate wound up marrying seemed like the greatest deception imaginable eventually leaving all parties broken by the lack of honesty in their relationships. Having read a few of the other reviews for the picture on this board I feel a few viewers missed some aspects of the story. Personally I didn't feel that that Philip's feelings for Kate represented a betrayal of his best friend. It may have seemed that way before the revelation of Pete's 'death' but with that news the relationship was free to take it's course. Afterwards when it was learned that Pete was still alive I thought it incumbent upon all three of the principals to face the truth about what occurred while Pete was away seeking his fortune. Something that really bothered me about Kate occurred during the time that Pete was away early on. In one of her diary entries she started to write about meeting with Mr. Christian and abruptly crossed out his name and replaced it with 'Pete' with successive entries mentioning Pete taking part in regular activities with her. That scenario presented me with the idea that maybe her thoughts were becoming delusional.When Kate made her suicide attempt the picture took a dramatic downward turn in sentiment. Appearing before the newly assigned 'deemster' of the village the parties are forced to acknowledge their relationship with each other something that could have avoided a public spectacle if Philip and Kate had been true to themselves from the outset. There's also another element at play here how was it possible that in such a small fishing village the only party to have an inkling that Phil and Kate were seeing each other was Kate's father Caesar Randle Ayrton. Oh and Philip's mother too. Didn't people on the Isle of Man talk to each other in the way of gossip that would have been normal anywhere else?So for me much of the story didn't ring quite true to life though for a silent film coming up on the last legs of the era it was a commendable attempt by the famed director. The principal players were credible in their portrayals given what I feel were shortcomings in the story while actress Anny Ondra proved to be a rare beauty of the silent screen.".

It's a wonder the moths haven't got it. And that it doesn't deserve.For this interesting Italian transposition of Gogol's semifarcical tale of the little man who was briefly elevated to a sense of importance by the possession of a new overcoat is in many respects an exciting and impressive piece of cinematic art directed by Alberto Lattuada with uncompromising insight and skill.How much of the film's insinuation derives from the sharp sarcastic script of a corps of Italian screenwriters how much from Rascel's apparent skill and how much from Lattuada's shrewd direction is a matter of minor concern. The fact that it is a brilliant picture in its own special frame is enough.To be sure the dramatic situation is both simple and of dubious appeal. A little clerk tired of being pushed and badgered puts his savings in a new overcoat. In it he feels triumphant. He can walk down the street like a lord. He is confident with beautiful women whom he previously yearned for from afar. Then his overcoat is stolen. Inevitably he goes mad and dies. Briefly his spirit haunts the people who had been cruel and haughty to him.That is the situation. But the peculiar attractiveness of the film is in the sharpness with which it satirizes politicians and indeed society and in the incisive humor of Rascel's Chaplinesque pantomime. There are scenes of magnificent humor such as one in which the piteous little clerk reads back with eloquence and gestures some garbled dictation he has taken from his boss. Or the scene in which a grotesque tailor played by Giulio Cali fits him for the new overcoat. There also are scenes of scorching pathos and painful mockery. The sum total of them as in a Chaplin picture makes a haunting commentary.Though artfully played and directed and wellfurnished with English subtitles the picture does have some limitations so far as a wide American audience is concerned. It dwells at great length on the behavior of Italian bureaucrats which is a little flossy for American fancy and it is solemnly dreary toward the end. Plainly it falls somewhere vaguely between City Lights and Murnau's The Last Laugh. It is a picture more than well worth seeing. But be sure you are in the mood.".

He and his friends are involved in the crime. In climax scene his girlfriend is also involved in. Then she is shut into a room and she gets to have to dismantle the bomb. There is little time and she is driven into a corner. I am impressed in last scene. Their bond is very strong. Detective Conan is very long series.

What I still find odd is that it's about a guy who takes a sort of magic potion that turns him into a kid. A lot of his later adventures feature him debunking supernatural claims! What?! I thought this would be like James Bond what with him showing off his high tech gadgets in the beginning.Instead it really was more what I expected with a standard murder mystery genre. Well it was still detective work like Castle. Dang I've been bringing that up too much. Despite the title a lot of the movie is spent with Conan trying to save trains from being blown up. As you would expect there are mysteries that the audience has to follow. Through all this we do get some ordinary scenes of the characters hanging out. I was a bit disappointed the actual skyscraper didn't appear until much later. The finale is still very well done and the tension is built wonderfully at the end too. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Marathon Man starts off rather slowly and for the first hour at least it feels as if you're watching a human drama rather than a thriller. However unlike a lot of thrillers Marathon Man uses this time to create characters and establish the situation which ultimately pays off later on in the film when the movie really gets going. When the film does step on the gas it is as thrilling as any thriller you will ever see Dustin Hoffman is subjected to all sorts of things most notably an excruciating torture sequence. This scene is powerful and painful on it's own but it is made more so by the fact that we have already gotten to know the character and therefore we feel sympathy for him as well as cringing at the images we see on screen. That scene alone is enough to propel the movie in the realms of greatness as it is simply one of the most powerful that cinema has ever given us but this movie is a hell of a lot more than just a torture sequence.The plot revolves around a car crash that takes place in downtown New York. One of the men in this crash is the brother of the infamous Nazi war criminal Szell who has some diamonds hidden in a safety deposit box. From then on many members of a US defence organisation known as The Division begin turning up dead and soon after Thomas Levy a college student obsessive runner and the brother of one of The Division's members becomes embroiled in the plot. It is easy to see the parallels between the plot movie and World War 2 from the withered exNazi indicative of the state of the actual regime to his enemies being American the movie has world war 2 written all over it. The film is excellently directed throughout by John Schlesinger. Schlesinger probably best known for Midnight Cowboy does a fantastic job of keeping the audience on the edge of their seat for the duration of the movie. A constant foreboding feel is created and you're never truly sure of what will happen. This is exactly what you want in a thriller as nobody likes it when they can predict what will happen next.Dustin Hoffman takes the lead role of Thomas Levy. Dustin Hoffman is a fantastic actor and he certainly gets to flex his acting muscles here in a film which sees him go through all manner of unpleasant scenes and also hold up lots of relationships with various characters as well as drawing sympathy from the audience to accent his situation. Roy Scheider of Jaws fame stars opposite Dustin Hoffman in the movie. Scheider doesn't get a great deal of screentime in the film but he still manages to do good things with the time he does have. The third lead role that of the Nazi war criminal is taken by Lawrence Olivier who is also a fantastic actor and gives a great performance in this film. He gives his character just the right atmosphere and we can tell just by looking at the man that he is cold and uncaring and also past it which is the crux of his character.The film ends with a spectacular sequence which sees the movie and the two centrals characters come to a satisfying conclusion. The characters are the central theme in this movie and had the movie have ended differently it could have unravelled everything that it had created but the movie's end is absolutely perfect and does the entire movie justice. A brilliant piece of cinema.".

He gives his character just the right atmosphere and we can tell just by looking at the man that he is cold and uncaring and also past it which is the crux of his character.The film ends with a spectacular sequence which sees the movie and the two centrals characters come to a satisfying conclusion. The characters are the central theme in this movie and had the movie have ended differently it could have unravelled everything that it had created but the movie's end is absolutely perfect and does the entire movie justice. A brilliant piece of cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw MARATHON MAN in its initial theatrical release when I was 13 years old and the years haven't diminished its power for me. Sure the plot gets a little more convoluted than it absolutely has to be but in a way it's because William Goldman's screen adaptation of his brilliant novel takes into account the alltoohuman character flaws of his heroes and villains and the mistakes people make when they're fearful and paranoid. While the performances are uniformly fine with Roy Scheider deserving a place in The Suave Hall of Fame for his portrayal of Doc Levy a.k.a. government agent Scylla. If he hadn't been so charismatic and engaging his murder in midfilm wouldn't have such impact and the movie would suffer for it I think the special secret ingredient that gives MARATHON MAN its punch is the atmosphere. The naturalistic sometimes washedout color palette almost lends the film a blackandwhite film noir look. Almost every person in the film is angry cynical emotionally wounded andor generally negative in some way. And what really struck me was that on screen it seems like chaos and disaster are exploding all over the world. Look at the riots and bombings taking place in France in early scenes with Doc and Janeway nicely subtle homosexual subtext there by the way. Also if you listen carefully to newscasts in the background you'll notice there's nothing but bad news murders suicides all kinds of violence all over including the chicken game between the old Jew and Szell's brother as the film begins. MARATHON MAN isn't a happy film  even when our hero wins he's already lost so much his victory seems hollow indeed  but it never fails to grab and haunt me each time I watch it. If you love the film you'll want to own the DVD not only for the superb letterboxed print but also for the terrific extras including both new and vintage makingof documentaries with Hoffman Scheider Keller Goldman producer Robert Evans and other major MM players as well as rare rehearsal footage and the original theatrical trailer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amidst the the early morning glare of the rising sun and whatever few others are up at this time a young man jogs along the beaten track in an attempt to keep in shape. This as he spots a fellow jogger and begins a fairly innocent 'chase' although the individual manages to outrun our young man to some pretty ominous music. The entire exchange is eventually intercut in a bizarre manner with some found footage of a marathon runner completely disconnected to the events we're witnessing. Marathon Man begins with this rather simplistic sequence of a young man jogging and very slowly turns what is an everyday activity or an unspectacular image into something that is quite sinister. It pitches the tone of the film perfectly establishing an everyday guy and placing him in a sinister chase situation which it is discovered is so easily to get involved in while systematically foreshadowing the eerie turns the narrative will take to do with having to run for one's life.Marathon Man is like that there's something very effective behind its ability to inject terror into a relatively routine situation. That very primal sense of 'running for one's life' whatever the situation is tapped into perfectly by director John Schlesinger who paints a bleak and uncomplimentary picture of New York City and of the scummy lying and doubledealing lowlifes whom inhabit it. Amongst all of this is the character of Thomas Levy Hoffman nicknamed 'Babe' a student of history who is attempting to follow in his now deceased father's footsteps by engaging academically in the same field. Babe will later end up following in the same footsteps as his another family member his brother Henry Scheider but for all the wrong reasons. Even Henry is referred to by his nickname for a lot of the film that being 'Doc' thus repeating the process of use of an alias and tapping into that highly consistent theme of suspicion and what one's true identity is. In a film in which a lot of people act as if they're one thing in order to garner an advantage this use of improper name and alias to act as an alterego is interesting.But Marathon Man provides us with a ray of light in the form of Babe a down to Earth and accessible lead with whom we are able to relate in his innocence and copious levels of naivety to his situation when espionage and betrayal catches up with him. In what might appear to be a complex and rather deep story revolving around said narrative characteristics of espionage smuggling and spies it is ironic that mere fate brings certain people to New York for certain reasons. This when a stark disagreement between two elderly men about something that relates to times and events far deeper than mere road rage.If Babe is a figure cut from a stone that shy but eager in his personality and traits then Laurence Oliver's Christian Szell a doctor well informed in the art of dentistry represents the polaropposite as this elderly and frail man but someone who has made a life out of other people's sheer misery a man that has seemingly existed to inflict pain and suffering wherever he's gone. When we first encounter him he is a lonesome figure in a heavily fortified and secluded place of dwelling in the middle of a South American jungle. Several newspapers are scattered around some in English some in Spanish and some in German which establishes a sense of expertise in language although the items that stand out are the uncanny skulls which line the shelves most of which contain odd shaped teeth which catch our eye. The sequence informs us of a man whom requires security and isolation as well as someone whom is most probably trilingual. In one swooping camera shot we are left to read into as much as we can about this one individual while a lesser film of the thriller ilk would have seen a bunch of people gather in a room brought Szell's face up on a screen and laid out everything for the uninformed characters and audience alike.Babe's involvement in what it is he ends up neck deep in is ultimately instigated by the unsightly sequence in which the death of somebody we do not see coming occurs in his arms. The battered and bloodied body of a blade attack victim acting as the first truly pieces of shocking imagery Babe has seen the blood from the body staining his plain bright white vest that he wears thus staining him and therefore linking him to the world the departing life was connected to. The film is a tight gripping piece a film that clashes a world of smuggling deceit and murder with the quieter more routine world of a young man who's nervous around girls and just attempting to makegood out of some pretty harsh living conditions.It progresses to encompass a series of quite extraordinary sequences the one of which everyone remembers more fondly than others being the torture sequence involving a dentist's drill a sadomasochistic game of fear terror power play ambiguous questions honest but disbelieved answers and sheer pain. One other passage of play sees the lead running down a street in the early hours of the morning whatever light there is being provided by way of the street lamps as what we perceive to be a wailing screeching musical score encompassing this only for it to turn out to be an approaching ambulance which hurtles past catching us all off guard. Marathon Man is a taut thriller drawing its audience in and gripping them with a number of basic conventions raging from the use of a mere MacGuffin to instilling a very visceral very effective sense of fear by way of ambiguous character intentions and pure threat. If ever there was an essential thriller to see it may well be Marathon Man.".

This might not be a problem if it were any other type of picture but the progressive unfolding of an initial puzzle to a somewhat sensible or at least rational set of revelations is one of the hallmarks of the government intelligence thriller. The story here however is so thin that virtually nothing happens for the entire first half of the picture and the second half is really nothing more than one long chase sequence. The biggest problem is that the central objective of the action is precipitated by a murder that if contemplated for more than about twenty seconds reveals itself to make absolutely no sense whatsoever.

There are numerous details throughout that are obviously and to my mind condescendingly designed as mere conveniences for the the action regardless of how inane or inexplicable they may be.

Dustin Hoffman provides us with an excellent performance as the 'Marathon Man'. He was almost forty when he played the role and with his acting skills he makes us believe he is actually a graduate student. Roy Scheider is perfect as Hoffman's crafty and slick older brother who works for the C.I.A. Scheider really does a lot with his role making him perhaps even the coolest character in the movie. Veteran Shakespearan actor Laurence Olivier gives an incredible performance as the evil exNazi that rightfully earned him a Academy Award Nomination for Best Supporting Actor. John Schlesinger provides incendiary direction and the screenplay is consistently engrossing and full of twists. If you are looking for one hell of a suspense flick with a lot of action you should definitely check out 'Marathon Man' at your local videostore. 'Marathon Man' should have earned Oscar nominations for  Best Picture Best Director Best Actor in a Leading Role  Dustin Hoffman Best Actor in a Supporting Role  Laurence Olivier Best Actor in a Supporting Role  Roy Scheider Best Original Screenplay Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing.

Why doesn't Janeway just off Szell Karl and Erhard and get all the diamonds for himself providing he gets the key of course? Or why don't Scylla and Janeway team up. Obviously the Division isn't all that if an old Nazi dentist and his henchmen can get rid of its prime operative. Roy Scheider's ScyllaDoc is hands down the best character in this story. He's supposedly a superspy type yet he transports the diamonds from New York to Paris for Szell. I have trouble accepting the premise and therefore the bit. Definitely worth watching but certainly no Boys from Brazil which has its own issues mind you.".

	schema:headline " Solid and Depressing Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "1970s movies are so cynical aren't they? Dark depressing and often grainylooking and washed out. Marathon Man fits that description. It's good of course  very good  but it's not exactly a good time. Know what I mean?William Goldman one of Hollywood's few celebrity screenwriters wrote both the original novel and the script for this film version. I find him a bit overrated but here he does a good job of elevating hacklevel thriller material into a sort of art form. The beginning of the film is particularly wellwritten and intriguing since it's full of creepy and cryptic events that are not immediately explained. But alas I find the ultimate explanation of these events to be rather prosaic and disappointing.So I think the movie's strengths lie in the acting and directing more so than the story. Olivier and Scheider give particularly great performances and Marthe Keller comes across as appropriately sweet and sexy her big secret though should be really easy for anyone to guess! I'm a little less enamored of Dustin Hoffman whose character is inexplicably nicknamed Babe. He's just way too old to be a typical graduate student almost forty years old to be precise and he simply doesn't have much charisma to me. Usually I like normallooking nonglamorous actors but somehow Hoffman doesn't float my boat.Still it's hard not to sympathize with the poor guy while he's being pursued beaten tortured etc. The dental horror scene is still quite effective though it's rather short I was more impressed by the subsequent chase through the dark streets of NYC. The city by the way looks like a hellish crimeinfested debrisstrewn pit in this movie  like it does in most 1970s productions!In the end Marathon Man isn't quite another French Connection but it's got more than enough suspense to crush a lot of the dross that infests theaters today. It's worth watching just for the terrifying scene when the bad guys start tearing Hoffman's door off its hinges  it's good stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ok I like Dustin Hoffman.  I like Roy Scheider and Lawrence Olivier was a great actor.  Fine.  The dentist scene is visceral and creepy and quite memorable.  Fine.  People I respect have said many positive things about William Goldman.  OK.Having said that this movie rates HIGH on the Unintentional Comedy Scale. The plot is unthinkably profoundly inane and laughable and nonsensical. I.N.A.N.E.  Let me get this right and I am quoting other commenters here a Columbia graduate student Hoffman unwittingly thrust into a game of deadly international intrigue when his brother Scheider is killed by a Nazi fugitive Olivier looking to smuggle a stash of diamonds he had left over from World War II after escaping justice' virek213 and Dustin Hoffman plays a marathon runner whose CIA brother is killed by an evil former nazi played by Laurence Olivier.' Adam Morrison.  You're kidding right?  Take out the words Olivier' and Hoffman' and we have the makings of a plot that doesn't even pass the laugh test.Ask yourself why is Hoffman's character involved?  Because ala Dr. Evil Olivier stabs Scheider BUT DOESN'T KILL HIM.  He just leaves.  I mean just slit the guy's throat.  Come on.  Even Scott Evil knows this.  Just get a gun and shoot the dude.  Oh wait I forgot we have to leave him there NOT QUITE DEAD so that we can spend an enormous amount of complicated energy panicking about whether the guy we easily could have killed happened to say anything to anyone before he died.  Brilliant.  I mean did any of you people think of this when you wrote your reviews?  I am not making this up  there are POSITIVE reviews for this farce here.Think this one through.  I am an evil Nazi dentist.  I decide to send a woman a spy to America to seduce the brother of an American spy that I work with so that I can. oh Jesus I don't know. maybe if later and we're in a fantastical scenario where I need to kill the brotherfind the brother then she can  surprise  turn on him since she will be the person he relies on HE WILL BE COMPLETELY FOILED and I will have succeeded!  As part of this clever strategy I send my goons one of whom comically limps  where was the BWAHAHAHAHA!'? one of whom is Al Neri on loan from Michael Corleone to beat them up!  Why?  Who knows?  Best not to ask!I keep my diamonds in a bank in New York City.  As the William Devane character says and now he's Olivier going to expose himself to incredible risk!' to come get the diamonds.  Smart.  Good plan.  NYC. Good place to keep all my valuables so if I ever need 'em it will be INCREDIBLY RISKY to get 'em.  But only risky because my brother who had the key all along and could have just walked in there and gotten the diamonds at any time ever has just died because he could not overcome his evil irresistible impulse and ran into I am not making this up a gas truck which exploded.As for the scene at the house. I am just at a loss.  I don't even know where to start.  There are 5 people at the house and 0 out of 5 of them behave with any logic.  If you think from each of their standpoints what they are doing and really try to puzzle it out it's just nonsensical.  I think the writers just decided OK everybody needs to be dead at the end of this scene except for Hoffman.  Then they tried to work backward and figure out how this whole shootout would actually play out logically.  Then they said screw it and went to lunch.It's important when you want to keep a low profile in an area where you could be recognized and also you're an evil Nazi with a past to bark at Jewish people in a screamy sort of ordering tone so that you keep yourself disguised and don't jog any memories.  And how many seconds before the woman who recognizes the Nazi gets run over by the car was it obvious that this clichd movie convention was about to happen?  For me it was only about 8 seconds.The closing scene is just laugh out loud funny.  I mean could it have been more awkward?  Did that all take place so that our hero is not gunning someone down and is therefore morally able to claim the high ground?  Nazi has to die but hero can't just kill him.  Isn't selfdefense a little more standard of a movie convention that they could have gone with?  He just trips on the steps and falls?  Please.  How lame is that?  As lame as this whole moronic movie.".

	schema:headline " More than a thriller a nightmarish existential masterpiece ...";
	schema:reviewBody "In a nutshell John Schlesinger's Marathon Man is one of the greatest thrillers of the 70's an intricate and paranoid masterpiece served by an impeccable casting Dustin Hoffman Laurence Olivier Roy Scheider Marthe Keller and Richard Bright. Thomas Babbington Levy aka 'Babe' studies history in Columbia University and prepares a thesis on Tyranny in America. He's also a marathon runner training every day in Central Park trying to emulate his idol the Ethiopian marathon runner Abebe Bikila. A sepia footage of Bikila's victory in Tokyo Olympic Games punctuates the opening credits sequence although the athlete is more notorious for having won the previous marathon in Rome  barefoot. Bikila explained I wanted the world to know that my country Ethiopia has always won with determination and heroism These two words hit a sensitive chord in Babe. His father killed himself during the McCarthyism leaving unanswered the question of his innocence. Babe's thesis can't avoid this dark parenthesis as reminds his teacher who admired his father and Babe acknowledges that. The wound is even harder to conceal because he's torn between his filial love and his personal admiration of virtues like bravery. His father could have faced the hearings and be a model if not a hero he chose to be a victim not even a martyr since he inflicted his own punishment by pulling the trigger. Babe keeps the gun in a drawer like the infamous weight of guilt in his heart the detestable idea of having either a traitor or a weak man as a father.Why are you keeping the gun? Asks his brother 'Doc' Roy Scheider Babe doesn't know or maybe he does and keeps it as a warning he might end like his father with whom he's got a lot in common while Doc more of a respectable businessman type would have been disowned. In a way Babe lives his life like a marathon it's a matter of determination as said Bikila being the fastest on the long run. The secret is endurance and the capability of canalizing the pain and keeping on running. He carries the infamy of his father's lack of 'heroism' and punishes himself as to exorcise his inner demons. And the secret is to find balance by sticking to the weight of past through his history studies and escaping from it through running.The character study is almost imperceptible behind the Hitchcockian and sometimes James Bondlike feeling of some scenes but there's no doubt that Babe as a tormented man haunted by his past is the center of the psychological drama. And as counterpart the film provides an unforgettable villain through Dr. Christian Szell a Nazidentist played by Laurence Olivier in a virtuoso performance. Olivier is not only scary as the White Angel but like many iconic villains he's not genuinely frightening but keeps a gentlemanly attitude that makes him even scarier. The softness and even carefulness he displays when checking Babe's teeth is more horrorinducing than the piercing scream when he probes a cavity. I'm referring of course to one of the scariest scenes of cinema's history.Is it safe?' repeatedly asks Dr. Szell to an exhausted Babe he has just been kidnapped saw his brother dying in his arms and has been neardrowned in his bathtub Babe is naturally baffled by the question. The efficiency of the scene is conveyed by our total empathy toward Babe because we know he doesn't know. What safe? What the it refers to? I've seen this scene enough to remember the extraordinary closeup right after Babe replies sarcastically Olivier is so scary that we immediately figure Babe's next reaction no it's not safe it's dangerous be careful. The directing and the focus on Olivier put us on the same emotional wavelength than Babe and we endure the scene just as if we were in his place. If only because going to the dentist is a painful experience but relatively banal so anyone can relate to it.Yet again there's more than a simple scene terrorizing viewers for the sake of it. Szell immediately applies some oil of cloves and the pain disappears. He gives Babe a cruel choice between telling what he knows and being relieved from the pain or keeping silent and suffering and when you know nothing when truth is as painful as silence you're stuck in an existential nightmare. To a certain degree Babe is pushed to the same deadend as his father during the hearings. Except that he manages to escape from the bad guys and inevitably runs for his life. The chase sequence is another brilliant piece of filmmaking. Babe is out of breath because he's a distance runner not a sprinter but he runs for his survival he decides to live he embodies the same determination than his idol Bikila fittingly running barefoot during the whole chase.But if he's clearly determined he's not heroic yet. As Szell said he belongs to the past while Babe studies the past. In a way Szell is the one that confronts Babe to his inner demons and it's only when Babe gets back to Szell and risks his life to avenge the death of his brother to make Szell swallow the same diamonds that were bought with the blood of Jewish people in Concentration Camp. It's only when he finally confronts his own bravery and caused Szell to impale himself with the same retractable blade that killed his brother killing him without pulling the trigger that Babe finally cleared his conscience and it's not surprising that the last thing he does is throwing his father's gun in the water. I know I could have explored other themes other performances but I just feel that like a good wine the film gets better after more viewings revealing more hidden gems beneath the thriller surface like the fact that it's a fascinating character study and one of Dustin Hoffman's greatest roles.".

	schema:headline " Safe to say this is one of the best thrillers of all time...";
	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever gone to a dentist before? Of course you have. Unless you're British! And that's why the torture scene in Marathon Man is arguably the most famous of all mainstream torture scenes. Even the infamous ear segment in Reservoir Dogs fails to relate to people around the world the same way as this does. Not everyone has had his or her ear chopped off.Anyone who has gone to a dentist before can relate to the fear and excruciating pain that Babe Dustin Hoffman experiences when he is asked Is it safe? and has no idea what his interrogator is talking about then finds himself being given a root canal without any Novocain.The interrogator is Szell Laurence Olivier a dreaded German murderer who carried out awful deeds during World War II and offered Jews a free ticket outfor a hefty price.Szell's question Is it safe? exists because he needs to know whether or not it is safe to withdraw diamonds he stole from Jews during World War II from a safety deposit box. As the film opens Szell's brother dies in a car crash which sets up this entire aspect of the plot since his brother had the key to the vault.Babe's brother Doc Roy Scheider JAWS comes to visit him in New York City but turns up at his apartment with stab wounds. Babe soon finds out that Doc was part of a secret Division CIA blackops stuff that was on Svell's trail. Believing that Doc may have spilled the beans to Babe Svell kidnaps the college graduate and this is where the famous torture scene starts. Is it safe? Is it safe? Is...it...safe...?I don't know what you're talking about!Marathon Man is often considered a classic of the thriller genre and it certainly is. It has its flaws and sometimes it seems a bit average from a technical viewpoint but it set the stage for many gritty coarse thrillers that would follow in later years. It is still arguably one of the greatest of them all.The title comes from the fact that Hoffman's character Babe is a marathon jogger. He runs every single day and so when he finally manages to escape from Szell's grasp you can imagine what a hard time they have chasing after him. In retrospect the title takes on two different and ironic indications.The wellknown story about Olivier's advice to Hoffman on the set of the film has been referenced many times even by Steve Martin in Saturday Night Live so it almost seems pointless to divulge into it. Basically in the words of Steve Martin Hoffman came to the set one day looking absolutely wretched and Sir Larry said 'Dusty you look absolutely wretched!' and it turns out that he had been awake for twentyfour hours because at this point in the movie his character had been so Larry replied 'Oh Dusty why don't you just try acting?' and the American retorted 'Act on this you British fag' and Larry replied 'I asked for a meal not a snack!'So perhaps Steve Martin made up the end of that story but the beginning is true. Dustin was a true method actor and by the end of the film it's clearly evident that Dustin is indeed quite tired both mentally and physically. I doubt whether acting could unleash the same sort of deadness that shines through in Babe had Hoffman simply tried acting.Another arguable fact is that this is Laurence Olivier's most famous role. It's certainly his most villainous. It's a career highlight in a role that many critics called Olivier's finest hour and I think should certainly be remembered as his most devilish. Is it safe? Is it safe? Every time it's spoken it sends a shiver down my spine.Two very important films of Dustin Hoffman's career came out in 1976 All the President's Men and of course Marathon Man. They are both universally regarded as some of his best work and it's not a surprising fact really since it's true that they really are some of his best work. Quite incidentally the renowned William Goldman wrote both screenplays and the latter of the two titles was based on his own novel.Thrillers of such striking power and ferocity are rarely made nowadays in Hollywood. Marathon Man is cold hard gritty and dirty and one of the best of the genre. It's a modernday masterpiece perhaps barely short of greatness but a masterpiece nonetheless. You may never want to go to the dentist again.It's safe to say that Marathon Man is a terrific movie.4.55 stars.John Ulmer".

Great performances from Dustin Hoffman Roy Scheider William Devane and Laurence Olivier. Scheider maintains a cool shrewdness as an undercover agent and Olivier well . . . that guy's a malevolent bastard. The bathroom tub scene was a particular nailbiter and the dental sequence was especially novel. Hearing the phrase Is it safe now actually means something and I'm willing to bet that every time I hear it henceforth it'll evoke that ominous scene. It belongs with the other powerful oneliners in cinema history. Marathon Man is wellwritten suspenseful and you don't see the twists coming. Great movie.810".

An old Nazi hiding in South America made a fortune on the golden teeth of jews in a KZ besides all the tragedy this is actually comical because you can see how much the people in the 70s knew about the holocaust. A fleeing dentist thats it????? This man invested his money in diamonds that he cannot sell without problems because the jews control the business. And the whole movie is about the paranoia of this Nazi. Of course with some more sidestories that are also unnecessary like the father that shot himself because he couldnt stand the McCarthy commission. The same story made today would be a flop so why the people are giving good notes.........?? A 4 not more!!!!".

	schema:headline " A very confusing and disjointed movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie Marathon Man starts out with a car accident where Christian Szell's Laurence Olivier brother Klaus Ben Dova is killed. The word comes back to Szell in Paraguay or is it Brazil that Szell's fortune in diamonds is in danger why? For some reason Szell and his henchmen take off for NYC after being for some 30 years in hiding from the international courts for war crimes. Why does Szell blow his cover and expose himself to jail or worse? We really don't seem to know. All I could gather from the plot is that Szell wanted to know as he kept saying over and over in the movie Is it safe? Safe from what? There are diamonds in a safedeposit box in a curtain midtown bank and Szell had the key to it so what was he so worried about since his brother Klaus had no trouble at all going in and out of the bank with the diamonds as we've seen in the beginning of the movie which Klaus must have been doing for years. Szell walking all over the streets of NYC without a care in the world why would't he be safe when he goes in and out in just this one bank with his henchmen one who has a limp there protecting him? Klaus when he was alive also could have sent them the diamonds registered mail back to Szell in South America if he was so worried about them being lost or stolen. Why now was Szell who seemed to have no fear or trouble at all in murdering a number of people one on a crowed midtown street in broad daylight so paranoid about? It turns out that Szell is somehow connected with this supersecretive US government agency who's protecting him from the law for services rendered. So why can't they take care of Szell's problems whatever they are! They've been doing it since the end of WWII and it seems that the diamonds is what that agency is paying Szell for his services. Later in the movie Szell goes to of all places the midtown diamond district on West 47th St to see what diamonds are selling on the open market! Why on earth does Szell have to go to the diamond district in midtown Manhattan to get an evaluation of how much diamonds are worth? Wasn't Szell informed enough being involved with diamonds for years to know this for himself? and why does he go to the diamond district in midtown Manhattan to get an evaluation where it seems that everybody there is a survivor from the concentration camp that Szell brutally ran during WWII and where he'd be immediately recognized! On top of all that crazy Szell acts toward those people there as if he was still running a concentration camp and that they were still his prisoners? The movie is so confusing with a convoluted love story between Babe Dustin Hoffman and the mysterious Columbia Collage student Helga Marthe Keller added in that almost half way through the film. I think that the director John Schlesinger had to put in a scene in where William Devane who plays Jeneway also a member of this supersecretive government agency who like Simon Okland in the movie Psycho after he saved Babe from Szell's henchmen starts talking into the camera. Jeneway looks as if he were addressing the movie audience as he tells Babe everything about Szell and his brother DocRoy Scheider who also works for the agency who also works with Szell. There's also the diamonds that Szell has hidden in a bank safe deposit box in a midtown Manhattan bank and the Nazis and the supersecretive agency and and blab blab blab in order so that those of us still awake and watching can get just some idea of what the heck is going on in the movie! Just who the hell is this guy Jenaway anyway and who's he working for in the first place? Szell? the CIA? the KBG? the Brooklyn Dodgers? Well anyway getting back to more important things in Marathon Man. One of my favorite and most exciting moments in the film is when Babe escapes from Szell clutches and tooth drilling equipment and is being chased all over NYC by Szell's boys. Beaten bloodied dirty after being brutally tortured and without having slept for what seemed like days and only dressed in pajama bottoms Babe flags down a cab by the Brooklyn Bridge getting away from Szell's gang. Babe then goes all the way uptown to his apartment in Washington Heights a good ten miles or so. You would think that the cabbie would know enough not to pick up someone looking like an escapee from a mental institution for that's just what Babe looked like. Not only can he be dangerous but just looking at his style of dress it's obvious that he doesn't have any money to pay for the long and expensive taxi ride. Not only does the cabbie pick Babe up but instead of driving Babe to the nearest hospital or police station to get help due to the condition that he's in he drives all the way uptown with Babe halfnaked and out cold in the back seat. The cab driver is then surprised when he reaches his destination that Babe doesn't have any cash to pay for the fare? It must have been the cab drivers first day on the job. Yet for some strange reason it turned out that the Szell gang who had Babe in their grip and were torturing him forgot to take an expensive watch that Babe was wearing! Babe pays the car fare by giving the cabbie the watch instead of cash it turned out to be the cabbies lucky day.".

Yet for some strange reason it turned out that the Szell gang who had Babe in their grip and were torturing him forgot to take an expensive watch that Babe was wearing! Babe pays the car fare by giving the cabbie the watch instead of cash it turned out to be the cabbies lucky day.";

Maybe you learned how things worked in film and now you know what they are doing and decide you actually don't like it.Possibly the world has moved and left the thing stranded on some lonely hillock of irrelevance. For me it may be all three.This truly was celebrated when it was new. Great actors  we were told  in a clash of intensity never seen before. Violence and pain as well.Watching this now it seems unsuccessful in all dimensions all but one Schlesinger vision. This man really was adept at presenting things to us. Three scenes stand out in this regard.One is the famous chase scene near the Brooklyn Bridge. Another is the Bertolucciesque meeting and stabbing at the red stairs fountain. And finally and best for me  the last scene in the waterworks set. That's sheer pleasure for me every time I see it and the obnoxious manner of the two actors doesn't bother me either. Its obvious that the scene and particularly the dialog was written by someone other than the clipper Goldsmith. Its all so satisfying that set.A scene that should have been great but wasn't was when our Nazi blackmailing death dentist visits the Jewishdominated gem district to inexplicably ascertain the prices of his thousands of diamonds. Its a completely offensive setup in how artificial is the excuse to present this irony. Lost Race He is at risk of being recognized and he is. Its a remarkable scene even while it doesn't work because it is a real complex street scene when such were rare. But it just doesn't work. We are only left with the realization that it was a clever idea and ambitiously filmed.Here's what doesn't work. The violence. The world here is presented as falling apart. New York is nothing but piles of garbage and people quick to explode. Paris is run by mobs. The contrast with the smooth Germanic order we'd have if things had gone the other way is implicit. But Parisians ARE quick to form mobs and get violent over the most petty grievances.Even the violence of the dental torture is pale compared to the televised videos of beheaded captives that are on the same screens we see this on. It just has no effect today where when new it registered.Ditto with seeing the breasts of our love interest. Once it had cinematic power those few scenes where were are shown that these two really are in love. Open to each other entirely it seems.And again with the Nazi card. It used to convey real evil. Now everyone is called a Nazi more than one even by our current president. And he by his foes. Ho hum.But the real thing that makes me send this to the trash is the acting styles of the two main guys. I never liked Olivier and consider his Hamlet the filmed one an abomination a vulgar parody. His approach is one where am assumed bearing and confidence is supposed to carry the day. Never did. Perhaps on stage where there's a different bargain over the intimacy.And Hoffman. Mechanical. Sure I know he has a technique to be real and he works at it very hard we are told over and over. He works really really hard see? But his intensities are all at where an artificial man would have highs. He has none of the silent reality that conveys. In film we can see that see that it isn't there.

	schema:headline " Superb wartime courtroom drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.The question raised in this film is the same as that raised in the Nuremberg trials following World War II and at the trial of Lt. William Calley during the Vietnam War namely should a soldier be punished for following orders?The answer to that question depends not only on what the orders werethat is were they legitimate orders consistent with the rules of warbut also on who is asking the question and why they are asking it. After WWII the Allies asked the question and the reason they asked it was because so many people were horrified by Nazi atrocities and wanted someone to punish. If the Axis powers had somehow won the war they might have tried US President Harry S Truman and others for the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities or indeed for the fire bombings of Dresden. In Vietnam we asked the question of ourselves during the war because our government and military were being accused both at home and abroad of waging a unjustified war and going against our own value system.Here the story goes back to the Boer War a hundred years ago in South Africa as the British command for political reasons puts Lt. Breaker Morant an Australian soldier fighting with the British forces and two of his fellow Bushveldt Carbineers on trial for shooting Boer prisoners. Their defense is the same as the Nazi soldiers and that of Lt. Calley they were just following orders.The superb direction by Bruce Beresford from the play by Kenneth Ross makes us identify with Morant Edward Woodward Lt. Peter Handcock Bryan Brown and the third soldier because we can see that the horrors of war pervert the usual logic of right and wrong so completely that we can appreciate what drove them to do what they did.

	onyx:emotionText "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.The question raised in this film is the same as that raised in the Nuremberg trials following World War II and at the trial of Lt. William Calley during the Vietnam War namely should a soldier be punished for following orders?The answer to that question depends not only on what the orders werethat is were they legitimate orders consistent with the rules of warbut also on who is asking the question and why they are asking it. After WWII the Allies asked the question and the reason they asked it was because so many people were horrified by Nazi atrocities and wanted someone to punish. If the Axis powers had somehow won the war they might have tried US President Harry S Truman and others for the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities or indeed for the fire bombings of Dresden. In Vietnam we asked the question of ourselves during the war because our government and military were being accused both at home and abroad of waging a unjustified war and going against our own value system.Here the story goes back to the Boer War a hundred years ago in South Africa as the British command for political reasons puts Lt. Breaker Morant an Australian soldier fighting with the British forces and two of his fellow Bushveldt Carbineers on trial for shooting Boer prisoners. Their defense is the same as the Nazi soldiers and that of Lt. Calley they were just following orders.The superb direction by Bruce Beresford from the play by Kenneth Ross makes us identify with Morant Edward Woodward Lt. Peter Handcock Bryan Brown and the third soldier because we can see that the horrors of war pervert the usual logic of right and wrong so completely that we can appreciate what drove them to do what they did. Jack Thompson playing defense attorney Major J. F. Thomas expresses this when he tells the court that war changes us and that therefore the usual rules of conduct no longer apply. Incidentally this film is based on actual events.Regardless of which side of this very vexing question you come down on I can promise you will enjoy this outstanding film winner of 10 Australian Film Institute Awards.

Some of the acting and the script are truly Oscarworthy and the  photography and camera movements were truly outstanding on many occasions taking the whole movie onto another level of experience.

	schema:headline " Magnificent thoughtprovoking albeit depressing courtroom drama";
	schema:reviewBody "'Breaker' Morant is based on true events and deals with the courtmartial of three subalterns during the closing stages of the Second Boer War 18991902. The officers are members of a mostly Australian unit called the Bushveldt Carbineers created to fight the Boer commandos in the original sense of the word by employing their own tactics against them. The charges against them are that they committed murder by summarily executing captured Boers. That they have done so in not in question but in their defence they argue that they were acting in accordance with standing orders not least because the operational nature of the Carbineers would be hampered by having to keep prisoners under guard. The British command is keen to distance itself from this claim for various reasons it might galvanise Boer resistance and give Germany an excuse to provide material support to the Boers thus extending a war which was already a serious drain on the British Empire's resources and though this is left unsaid in the film cause discontent about the conduct of the war in those parts of the Empire supplying the manpower for the war i.e. Britain Australia and Canada. Instead the British command clearly wishes to portray the three protagonists as rogue elements and sacrifice them for the sake of political expediency.'Breaker' Morant is about injustice hypocrisy and incomprehension. The injustice is not that lieutenants Morant Hancock and Witton are innocent of the charges brought against themthey're not. The Second Convention of The Hague may have been only two years old at the time but the custom of not killing prisoners was wellestablished long before and at no point do we see any of the protagonists object to the standing orders. The injustice lies in the fact that the body which is trying them for their crimesthe British armyis the very body which ordered them to commit these crimes in the first place.The incomprehension is that of the home front in a brief flashback of Witton's relatives giving a goingaway party we see the expectation among the civilians that our boys will knock 'em for six but behave like gentlemen while doing so. Brief as the scene is it is plain that the civilians understand only in the most abstract way if they understand at all that war is a messy business in which winning requires killing people in unpleasant ways. As Major Thomas the protagonists' defence counsel comments The barbarities of war are seldom committed by abnormal men. The tragedy of war is that these horrors are committed by normal men in abnormal situations. While I can agree with this observation it does not alter the fact that the acts committed by the protagonists were of such a nature as to be have been formally outlawed even within the context of war two years previously.Another trope which occurs in this film but repeated in every war of the 20th century is that only a combat soldier can judge another combat soldier. As it happens I am a former soldier who never saw combat who later helped prosecute war criminals while a civilian I think this line is unadulterated bullsht. That said this opinion comes with a caveat which is that those civilians and noncombat soldiers who would pass judgement should understand that expecting soldiers to both fight cleanly and to win may be and often are mutually exclusive.Of course standards have changed somewhat since 1901 when Morant remarks it's a new kind of war George it's a new war for a new century the difference he indicates is that it is the first time white men visit atrocities upon each other which both had been quite content to inflict upon nonwhites for most of the previous century. At one point in the film Lt. Hancock pulls a dumdum round from a Boer's ammunition pouch as an indication of the Boers' disregard for the laws of war. However a somewhat apocryphal story from the opening stages of the Boer War not in the film tells of how the Boers lodged a protest with the British after finding dumdum rounds in a killed British soldier's ammunition pouch the British reportedly apologised profusely explaining that the soldier had been issued these rounds in error as these were intended only for use against blacks. The Boers accepted this explanation without further complaint.But however you may feel about the politics underlying this film it is a joy to watch. The quality of the production values is top notch and had I not been familiar with Edward Woodward and Bryan Brown I could have believed this film was made this year rather than in 1980. The directing and acting are also superb. At the heart of this is the script which carried no dead weight of unnecessary scenes likely this is due to the fact that it was originally written and written well for the stage. The story might easily be transposed to any number of conflicts since the Second Boer War in which military victory demands taking nasty measures it could easily be rewritten to Iraq in 2003 Well Peter this is what comes of empirebuilding. and for that reason it deserves more recognition than it's received. Magnificent see it ASAP.".

The stresses put upon the soldiers in the field are conveyed superbly particularly when set against the sterility of the court scenes.What makes this such a magnificent film is not merely portrayal of the injustice meted out to the defendants but the fact that everyone in the film is depicted as doing the best they can under different moral systems.

The final decision rests on his shoulders despite the fact he sides with the authorities the guilt and sadness when delivering the verdict are clear to see. For a film which is about a travesty of justice to do this is admirable. In Breaker Morant as in war it seems not everything is black and white.The great problem with films such as this is that they tend to become fact. Having read up on the background to this film which in itself is a testament to it's power it is pleasing to see that not only is this a truly great war film but also no real liberties were taken with the facts.Even the final summary by Major Thomas is by and large unaltered from the original transcripts and never has a more articulate sentiment been expressed in a war film.If you haven't seen this see it you owe it to yourself.".

At the weekend we were treated to BREAKER MORANT . As I said I'm not keen on the history channel transmitting feature films but I'll forgive them this time because it's a very good movie and very good history .BREAKER MORANT is the dramatisation of a real life incident during the Boer war  the first  dirty war  of the 20th century  where three Australian officers Harry Morant  John Handcock and George Witton are on trial for their lives for the murder of boer POWs and of a German missionary . What I love about this film is that unlike a lot of other movies with an antiwar  anti military injustice agenda is that it shows the difficult situations soldiers will always find themselves in . The men on trial are victims  victims of politics and of a wider picture . With the killing of the missionary Germany wants to intervene in the conflict on the side of the boers  not to protect the noble South African farmers from British aggression but to get their hands on the region's gold and diamond mines . In order to stop this happening the British government needs scapegoats in order to hang and Morant  Witton and Handcock were to be hung out to dry so it's the politicians of the time who are to blame for this miscarriage of justice  not the military  and it'd be interesting to note what people who campaign for pardons for the British soldiers shot for  cowardice  during the first world war make of this tale . The three characters on trial here are victims of a grave injustice but you can't help feeling because they  were only obeying orders  sympathy for them will be in short supply from a modern day perspective . I'm probably correct in saying that anyone who's served in the military can see far more clearly the injustice done than any of the  professional antiwar brigade  . BREAKER MORANT isn't a movie than can be used for anyone's hidden agenda  and for that we should be gratefulIt's fairly obvious BREAKER MORANT is based upon a stage play . The central setting is a military court room with much of the story told in flashback . Director Bruce Beresford handles the action scenes very well but in this type of story the most important aspect is the cast and their acting  and the director gets the best out of his cast especially Edward Woodward  Normally an actor I don't like  who gives a career best performance and Jack Thompson . My only criticism of the casting is that a couple of actors playing British characters let their Aussie accents slip a little  but I'm nitpicking .Just to sum up this is a very intelligent story of a dirty war  dirty politics and dirty justice which will appeal to serious historians and former servicemen rather than professional pacifists".

And the ending although foreshadowed isn't given away. It has lessons for our modern world. It's one of my top 10 movies.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Breaker' Morant is one of the finest movies I've seen in a while. Set at the beginning of the 20th century it takes the viewer to the war between the British Empire and the Bower population in South Africa a war that was mostly about land possession.The Bower War wasn't a conventional war. It wasn't fought between gentleman officers with rules of conduct. It was a guerrilla hitandrun war where the British enemies were farmers. This type of war was so unusual the British had to create a special corps to fight in it the Bushveldt Carbineers men who fought behind enemy lines and sometimes used unusual methods to deal with the enemy.In this movie three soldiers are courtmartialed for killing prisoners. However the court's intention is not to serve justice. In fact the three soldiers are scapegoats for being charged with killing a German missionary the authorities hope that with a conviction they'll appease the German government which is favorable to the Bowers. Furthermore by serving justice the British want to make a good impression at a future peace conference. In other words the soldiers are nothing means to political ends.The court is a farce and the authorities expect a quick conviction. They've rigged everything witnesses in favor of the defendants have been sent to India and an amateur lawyer is found to defend them. What they didn't expect is that the lawyer would give such a fine defense and slowly he dismantles the impartiality of the court to reveal the farce underneath it.The cast is very strong. There are many faces here that anyone can recognize from small roles in forgettable movies Brian Brown Cocktail Jack Thompson Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil  and more famous faces like Edward Woodward The Wicker Man. And they're all impressive. I especially loved Thompson's performance as the defense lawyer a man who initially appears silly but quickly reveals to have a sharp mind capable of dissecting all the lies and contradictions in the prosecution's arguments. Woodward was also unforgettable as Harry 'Breaker' Morant a poet turned soldier who slowly loses his mankind during war especially after his friend is brutally executed by the Bowers. More than anyone in the movie he understands the new type of war being fought and changes his tactics accordingly.And then there's the screenplay the amazing screenplay one of the most intelligent and witty screenplays I've ever seen in a movie. Just about every line is perfect in the movie's context the pacing is exciting and the nonlinear storytelling for once makes the movie more interesting. Each line helps give each character complexity while also remaining very funny. This is a funny entertaining movie in a sort of gallows humor way. But it's also rife with interesting points about the nature of war the politics of war and the sacrifices in the construction of an empire.Although war is practically absent from this movie 'Breaker' Morant in the guise of a courtroom drama manages to speak more about war than many movies combined.".

Fortunately 'Breaker Morant' is a happy exception a perfectlyplotted impeccablyacted war drama that treads a similar path to Stanley Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory 1957' but undeniably leaves its mark as a work of pure Australian filmmaking. The film is based upon a true story of the murder trial and execution of Australian soldiers during the Boer War 18991902. The screenplay written by Jonathan Hardy David Stevens and Bruce Beresford was adapted from Kenneth G. Ross' 1978 play Breaker Morant A Play in Two Acts a popular misconception is that the film was derived from Kit Denton's 1973 book The Breaker and Ross was forced to take legal action to successfully prove otherwise.'Breaker Morant' is certainly one of the most gripping courtroom dramas I've ever come across a perfectlybalanced assembly of probing crossexaminations impassioned monologues and legal injustice. Much of the story unfolds in flashbacks throughout the course of the trial slowly allowing the pieces of the murder puzzle to fall into place. During the Second Boer War three Australian soldiers officers of the Bushveldt Carbineers a multinational mounted infantry regiment of the British Army of which about 40 were Australian were accused of the murder of seven Boer prisonersofwar as well as the sniperstyle assassination of a German missionary. Lt. Harry Breaker Morant Edward Woodward Peter Handcock Bryan Brown and George Witton Lewis FitzGerald were brought to trial by the British Army for their alleged crimes found guilty of murder and both Morant and Handcock were promptly executed. An inexperienced smalltown solicitor Major J.F. Thomas Jack Thompson mounts the most formidable defence he can manage yet the panel's verdict being led by Charles 'Bud' Tingwell seems to have been decided from the very beginning.Australians have a peculiar habit of glorifying historical criminals the bushranger Ned Kelly 19551880 being the most pertinent example. Since his execution the AngloAustralian Harry Breaker Morant has also become something of a minor folk hero his death representative of the resentment that many have for the British over their maltreatment of Australian soldiers Peter Weir's celebrate war film 'Gallipoli 1981' also exhibited this general theme. Indeed the film firmly places its sympathies with the accused soldiers even after they secretly acknowledge their participation in the seeminglybarbaric crimes. In the soldiers' defence Maj. Thomas proposes various arguments that the men were merely following their orders and that these murders were committed by normal men in abnormal situations. Surely with all the death and acts of barbarism constantly taking place around these men their actions cannot be judged as they might in a normal everyday situations. Lt. George Witton who was pardoned after serving a threeyear sentence later published his controversial account of the trial Scapegoats of the Empire which is now considered the most reliable report of the actual proceedings.There's no denying that 'Breaker Morant' has the relatable atmosphere that only an Australian director and largely Australian cast can produce and every actor involved brings passion and authenticity to their roles arguably British actor Edward Woodward gives the film's finest performance as the titular character. The film like most wartime pictures produced in our country celebrates the importance of mateship and comradery between everyday Aussie blokes whether they be fighting the enemy fighting betrayal from their own superiors And a man's foe shall be they of his own household or dying together steadfast and courageous to the last Shoot straight you bastards  don't make a mess of it!. 'Breaker Morant' cleansweeped the 1980 AFI awards claiming a phenomenal ten wins from thirteen nominations. It was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 1981 Academy Awards. Certainly one of the most rousing motion pictures that the Australian film industry has ever produced 'Breaker Morant' is also one of the finest war films you're likely to see anywhere.".

Amidst all of that lies the core attraction of this film courtroom drama. Even The Bard would have had much difficulty replicating such suspense emotion and linguistic eloquence in a play. Speaking of suspense during the military courtmartial each and every utterance from the main players had my full and complete attention.Not many if any one film of a similar genre has ever done that before.If there is one weakness though the film is Aussie biased so much so that I got the impression the directorsproducers blamed Britain solely for the execution of two of their native sons. Yes the 'Thin Red Line' was culpable for committing atrocities against the Boers concentration camps in Northern Transvaal but were the British the lone culprits?Now hold on a New York minute! It's true that Lord Kitchener sought a quick way to extricate himself and the Brits from this 'dirty' war. And it's implicit in the film that Morant and at least one of his two lieutenants were expendable BUT it's also clear that two of the Aussie colonial volunteer soldiers did commit murder the German pastor. And the soldiers were even unabashed about the events leading up to the heinous deed during the court martial. In the dock they all admitted their 'hate' for the German pastor's partisan stand. Their words...He helped the Boer cause solely. And we warned him about the consequences many times.And justice was served the fact that it came by a British military court martial is moot. As soldiers those Aussies knew the penalty. And the one George who was spared execution probably knows now or should have known then that he was only 'pardoned' because of his young age. Although judging by the film's plot his 'role' in the atrocities was deemed negligible even by the prosecution. The judges though didn't exactly state a compelling case for his innocence either.Not convinced? Watch this film and 'judge' for yourself...".

They were interesting wellperformed raised provocative issues and all that. Breaker Morant however is everything those three are not. It's not in a different league it's in a different dimension stratospheric. It is real as Woodward points out in his interview. It's visceral gritty organic flawless. There's no Hollywood gloss no pandering to the public or vested interests. The other three movies are mechanical artefacts you can see the machinery. Morant is dramatic art at the topmost level. The editing is superb the variation in scene after scene closeups longshots is utterly masterful. Again the dialogue the sardonic humour the tragedy the irony are all real. These men are rough and ready in crumpled uniforms truly in the field on active service. There's no staging  well there is of course it's a film  but it just feels dead right every time. It's not fancy. I'm reminded of what my boot camp drill sergeant told me in 1956. This was a man who'd been busted two or three times and who'd seen WWII in a British tank regiment in the desert from Tobruk to Alamein. He told the rookie squad that the finest bunch of men he'd ever known were the Ozzies and I've never forgotten that verdict.

	schema:reviewBody "Edward Woodward better known to American audiences as the Equalizer plays the title role in this military courtroom drama set during the Boer War. Woodward who had a well known reputation as a rollicking writer of the Australian frontier was one of three men charged with murdering several prisoners during the Boer War one of them happened to be a German missionary. That got Kaiser Wilhelm's back up and the British were not looking for intervention from him on the Boer side. One must remember that the Germans did have a presence in Africa at the time. The diplomatic situation was not unlike the Korean War before the Chinese intervened.What to do but find someone to take the fall. Certainly not Lord Kitchener the commander of British forces in South Africa who let it be known quite unofficially and not on paper for attribution that he really wouldn't care if Boer Prisoners were shot. Edward Woodward Bryan Brown and young Lewis Fitzgerald get selected for a court martial. This is not unlike the more famous incident in the French Army during World War I as depicted in Paths of Glory.The Australians to this day feel that these men were singled out because they were Australians and not British. Wouldn't do to have His Majesty's subjects let alone the commander be held responsible. While the Boer War was going on the various colonies on the Australian continent coalesced and formed a nation. Why the Australian government didn't protest more vigorously is something I'm not quite understanding.That however does not detract from Breaker Morant being the fine film it is with sterling performances all around. Jack Thompson is the defense attorney in this court martial and does a splendid job in the face of a stacked deck.Alan Cassell is a bloodless Kitchener covering his own rear at all costs and Vincent Ball plays Sir Ian Hamilton who was Kitchener's aide at the time. Australia would meet these two later on under far worse circumstances as Kitchener was War Minister in the Asquith cabinet during World War I and Ian Hamilton was the commanderinchief of the Gallipoli Expedition where so many ANZACS died in another foreign battlefield for another cause not really their concern. Hamilton is shown as quite the rat here helping to cover his boss's complicity.I recommend Breaker Morant mostly for those who are not Australian so they can acquaint themselves with a sad and bitter chapter in that nation's life.".

That got Kaiser Wilhelm's back up and the British were not looking for intervention from him on the Boer side. One must remember that the Germans did have a presence in Africa at the time. The diplomatic situation was not unlike the Korean War before the Chinese intervened.What to do but find someone to take the fall. Certainly not Lord Kitchener the commander of British forces in South Africa who let it be known quite unofficially and not on paper for attribution that he really wouldn't care if Boer Prisoners were shot. Edward Woodward Bryan Brown and young Lewis Fitzgerald get selected for a court martial. This is not unlike the more famous incident in the French Army during World War I as depicted in Paths of Glory.The Australians to this day feel that these men were singled out because they were Australians and not British. Wouldn't do to have His Majesty's subjects let alone the commander be held responsible. While the Boer War was going on the various colonies on the Australian continent coalesced and formed a nation. Why the Australian government didn't protest more vigorously is something I'm not quite understanding.That however does not detract from Breaker Morant being the fine film it is with sterling performances all around. Jack Thompson is the defense attorney in this court martial and does a splendid job in the face of a stacked deck.Alan Cassell is a bloodless Kitchener covering his own rear at all costs and Vincent Ball plays Sir Ian Hamilton who was Kitchener's aide at the time. Australia would meet these two later on under far worse circumstances as Kitchener was War Minister in the Asquith cabinet during World War I and Ian Hamilton was the commanderinchief of the Gallipoli Expedition where so many ANZACS died in another foreign battlefield for another cause not really their concern. Hamilton is shown as quite the rat here helping to cover his boss's complicity.I recommend Breaker Morant mostly for those who are not Australian so they can acquaint themselves with a sad and bitter chapter in that nation's life.";

This is based on part on a real casethough how closely they stick to the original is uncertain.While most of the film takes place during the court martials through flashbacks you see many of the events that led up to the trials. Some of the behavior of the men seemed incredibly savage such as shooting prisoners who had surrendered on their own and much of their actions seemed to make sense in light of the guerrilla warfare being committed against them. Regardless what is clear is that the court really seems to want nothing more than to make examples of these men.Not surprisingly Breaker Morant struck a chord with many who fought in Vietnam and recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

	schema:headline " One of the best movies ever but could have been even better";
	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this movie at least 20 times and know every line before it is spoken. It is safe to say that it an all time favorite for me. The movie based on a historical event is strengthened a great deal by the quality of the cast. It's difficult to find many movies with a lineup from a talent standpoint at the top that bests Edward Woodward Jack Thompson and Bryan Brown. The script is very well written and acted out but as with many movies based on an actual event they choose for whatever reason to not be totally historically accurate. That is if Kit Denton's book about Morant The Breaker is correct. In the movie three Australian soldiers are court marshaled for murdering Boer prisoners and a German missionary. In Denton's book he lists 4 soldiers as court marshaled for those alleged crimes as well as killing a Boer child. In the movie they are acquitted of killing the missionary but found guilty of murdering the prisoners for which Morant and Handcock are executed and Witten sentenced to penal servitude for life. In Denton's book they are acquitted for executing the prisoners and the child and found guilty of killing the missionary for which Morant and Handcock are executed and Witton sentenced to life in prison and Lt Ivor Compton Summers cashiered. The Boer prisoner Visser was executed by a quickly formed firing squad in the movie. According to Denton's book Morant shot Visser himself after giving him a rifle and telling him to shoot God damn you to hell. As the simple minded Visser held out the rifle to return it Morant stepped toward him and shot him in the face. The movie was never based on Denton's book although it was said to be by the book's publisher at the time. It was based on a stage play by Kenneth Ross. I believe Denton is most historically correct after reading his book when it comes to the parts related to the events the movie is based on. Denton though prefaces his book by saying that the British government's refusal to release a number of essential documents make it impossible to be completely accurate. Denton's book preceded the movie and some of the lines in the movie were also in the book although not spoken by the same person. The lines ending with We shot them under rule 303 were spoken by Handcock in the book rather than Morant. The lines about I wonder how more serious things could be were not said by Handcock after being chastised for his verbal exchange with Drummond but by Witton after he became upset with questions about interrogating of Jacob Hesse the missionary. Witton according to Denton was not the mild mannered and soft spoken person the movie made him out to be. That part of him was actually more like Ivor Summers. Witton was closer to Handcock in personality according to Denton. The lines in the movie being similar or the same as lines in the book lend me to believe Ross used Denton's book as a source of info to help write his play that later became the screenplay for the movie. I'd have liked to have seen the movie been actually based on Denton's book although it was still one of my favorite movies the way it was. The event did take place and while there are differences between the movie and Denton's book it is good to see this travesty of justice not totally lost in history.".

One of those rare films that all by itself can be considered the crowning achievement for the careers of most of the actors involved. I have yet to see Bryan Brown and Jack Thompson in anything else that came close to their performances in this.Some here call this depressing my wife can't stand to watch it for that reason so be forewarned but I have always viewed this story as an ironically triumphant expose of military politics along the lines of Kubrick's Paths of Glory.

In this sense it is better than Paths of Glory because the characters have committed real crimes and in some sense they deserve to be tried for them. The injustice is that the trial is a complete farce and the magnitude of their crimes is piffling in the context of the Kitchener's conduct of the Boer War. They are taking the rap for the crime of shooting POWs while Kitchener was starving women and children to death in concentration camps. They are the scapegoats of the empire. On the other hand like many historical films one should not confuse entertainment with actual history this film has a definite bias towards the soldiers.

Likable? Well one of them likes to recite his own poetry... Yes it has some beautiful outdoors shots so we'll need to send the whole cast and crew to South Africa but most of the action will take place in an ugly little army prison where the characters debate the finer points of British military law and Edwardianera geopolitics.Luckily if any producer at the South Australian Film Corporation received such a pitch they agreed to make the film. Patriotism may have had something to do with it. Beneath the shouted legalese of a movie court martial and the scenes from a coldblooded guerilla war Breaker Morant is about the place of Australia in the British Commonwealth as understood by three men from different strata of turnofthecentury Australian society. Their loyal service in time of war lands them in deadly peril when London decides that they are more useful as scapegoats than as soldiers. In the most moving characterdriven scenes each man remembers and longs for Australia where they have families and where the title character once enjoyed breaking horses. Meanwhile the script takes numerous notso subtle digs at the partGerman royal family and at Lord Kitchener Britain's most famous soldier.For a certain kind of patriotic Australian this basedonatrue story must be a rousing defense of Australian independence and Australian bravery. It's a fascinating watch even for those without a dog in that hunt but it is fair to ask whether the movie is too uncritical of its three heroes. Are they after all war criminals responsible for the mistreatment of prisoners and noncombatants? Or does the movie prove its thesis that the real guilt lay farther up the chain of command and that the King's Australian soldiers were caught up in an unprecedented and complex kind of war from which nobody could come out both alive and clean? The heroic tone at the end is hard to swallow if you haven't been persuaded of the latter interpretation. But the beautiful shots of the veldt and the thoughtful examination of a historical moment seldom depicted on screen make it a satisfying film nonetheless.".

It isn't worth it. Warfare is a grim activity. Killing and survival often are and holding on to one's ethics are often the only thing one may have.

He seems incapable of giving any less than a strong performance in a variety of roles. The Wicker Man comes to mind as well as the many episodes of The Equalizer. It is easy to imagine the conflicts that inevitably occur between military superiors and the men on the front and this film clearly shows that in those days command personnel were much more likely to be obeyed without question even as the enlisted men suffered for their mistakes errors of judgment or even criminality.For me the frosting on the cake was using Woodward to sing Soldiers of the Queen during the roll of the credits. His clear and fine singing voice seemed to taunt the military brass. It is a crackerjack movie and NOT a tearjerker despite the story line.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released several years after his death Roberto Rossellini's The Messiah is arguably one of the two most interesting films made about Jesus Christ the other being Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew  which paints Christ as a protoMarxist and radical social activist.Oddly though Rossellini made many excellent spiritual films  see The Flowers of St Francis  the tone of The Messiah is closer to his 1971 film Socrates and his 1972 film Blaise Pascal Rossellini an atheist painting Christ as a quiet man of logic and reason.And so Rossillini's film is less about the messiah than it is about people whose needs for a messiah are so strong that they project godhood upon a Jesus Christ that is held at a distance and treated almost as a cipher. As such Rossillini portrays Christ as a mild almost timid rabbi the most ordinary quiet and uninspiring teacher imaginable. His Jesus like Bresson's Joan of Arc despite being immensely curious also seems to want to disappear into obscurity.Of course upon this blank slate Rossillini then shows a slew of followers blindly projecting their burdens wants and needs. Rossellini's Christ is a resonant tabula rasa and it is ultimately others who turn him into the son of God.In this regard the followers of Jesus are turned into a subtle parody of irrationality whilst those naysayers whom films typically show lambasting Christ as a conman and charlatan are shown to be simply reacting against illogical scripture twisting Christians who are at worst a civilly disruptive phenomenon at best a harmless bunch of simpletons.Christ is such a cipher in this film that even on the cross Rossillini chooses to leave out those iconic bits of Biblical dialogue which we're all familiar with Forgive them Father for they know not what they do! My Father why hast Thou forsaken me? etc. Instead Christ just hangs there a provocative question mark.Which is not to say that the film mocks Christians. No Rossellini is up to something else. His film downplays the New Testament's miracles and more supernatural elements and portrays Christs followers both as a race and social class as being abandoned adrift perpetually persecuted directionless and without a unifying leader. So hungry are they for direction and justice that they almost conjure Christ himself out of the desert sands. He they decide will stand for them. In this regard the film draws parallels with Rossellini's Socrates who is abused by an Athenian democracy which persecutes intellectuals humanists and educators intellectuals are similarly summoned and slain in The Messiah. The animosity directed towards Christ and Socrates then becomes a metaphor for the growing animosity toward social justice and critical thinking in both totalitarian and democratic societies both of which are preoccupied with power profit and so afraid of autonomy knowledge and education. This of course echoes Rossellini's own life under Mussolini and postfascism.So again we have Christ the liberator not sent but hungered for by a people who wish to be liberated from the despotic rule of a wealthy minority. Christ's murder then becomes the execution of a people's very dream for liberation. The film's last shot focuses on a sad strangely empty sky. Christianity as an existential even social project dies here and henceforth becomes a religious cult. Pessimistically social justice is seen to be attainable in the area of valuesbeliefshopes etc but not in the realm of real life. 810  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dubbed the most Catholic of all film directors by one critic I guess it was only a matter of time before Roberto Rossellini tackled the life of Christ on celluloid. Ironically this he did in what proved to be his last feature film which was in itself a followup to his TV miniseries ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1969. That earlier work was interesting for treating littleknown passages from the New Testament but with an unhurried pace and a generally unassuming tone the end result was decidedly meandering. Conversely THE MESSIAH presents alltoofamiliar events  with the overall effect feeling lengthy still yet distinctly more cinematic. That said it starts off with the arrival of the Jews in the Promised Land and the appointment of their first king Saul before moving on to the life of Christ actually this is also one of the few films to show the famous incident in which Jesus is lost in the temple as a boy. Unsurprisingly it doesn't stray much from the spirit  or word  of the Gospels even so in the throes of an agonizing death Herod The Great played by Vittorio Caprioli  though his trademark flustered demeanor is downplayed by having his voice dubbed is seen planning the annihilation of his own subjects akin to the practice of ancient Egyptian rulers! Incidentally the rich and commanding voice of Christ himself is supplied by Enrico Maria Salerno  a superb actor in his own right who had actually already handled the very same task in THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW 1964  which is effectively contrasted with the inconspicuous appearance of the young man who appears in the role perhaps best approximating the Lothaire Bluteau of Jesus OF MONTREAL 1989. This Messiah then is far removed from the striking goodlooks of Jeffrey Hunter KING OF KINGS 1961 and Robert Powell the Jesus OF NAZARETH 1977 TV miniseries or the brooding power of Max von Sydow THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD 1965 and Willem Dafoe THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ 1988! Naturally the bulk of the narrative is devoted to Christ's public life  though no overdue emphasis is placed on the miracles he performed these are mentioned but rarely seen  which also provides the film with its essential coresince the latter section revolving around the more commonlydepicted events of Jesus' trial where Jean Martin the French Colonel in THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS 1966 nonetheless makes for a fine Pontius Pilate crucifixion and eventual resurrection are curiously skimped here! The subplot involving John The Baptist however is quite nicely handled by the way the only other recognizable face in the cast is that of Tina Aumont even if her contribution amounts to no more than a few minutes of screentime! as the adulteress Christ famously pardons by denouncing her pursuers instead. The score is once again by Mario Nascimbene  though it's not as prominent as his work on ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. On the visual side the film seems closest to the contemporaneous Jesus OF NAZARETH  yet the lyrical style and quiet dignity on display makes of THE MESSIAH a more than worthy companion piece to Pier Paolo Pasolini's aforementioned and more renowned THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW. With this in mind while perhaps not the definitive film on the subject it certainly emerges as an underrated achievement  both among the myriad treatments including those by such great directors as D. W. Griffith Carl Theodor Dreyer Cecil B. DeMille and Abel Gance of Christ's life over the years and in Rossellini's own highly respected canon.".

Some people don't like this wonderful movie because they felt bored. The reason is maybe the high concentrated work of the director. He always get the scenes to one minimalism point. The actors are great especially the actor of Jesus. But be warned There is no big scene no action! The cast has only a few extras but 80 scenes. And my favorite scene is when Jesus meets Johannes the baptist and there is only one sentence spoken  the first for the Jesuscharacter in this movie.This is a good very fantastic moment a really great for the movie. Here you can feel the consequence of the perfect work Rossellinis. And his true work to the bible without any pathos! It is maybe the best Jesus movie ever.

I find quite curious that two Italian nonbelievers and filmmakers one Marxist and the other atheist made two of the most interesting films I have seen about the figure of Jesus of Nazareth. First Pier Paolo Pasolini released in 1964 The Gospel According to Matthew in the middle of a controversy that ended in praise and the other Roberto Rossellini presented The Messia in 1975 with less luck to the point that the free circulation of the product had to wait almost 30 years to be marginally distributed. The Messiah is long Brechtian austere and intelligent it dispenses with many biblical passages in which David W. Griffith Miguel Morayta Nicholas Ray George Stevens Franco Zeffirelli Martin Scorsese or Mel Gibson delighted in their kind of frivolous versions of the Nazarene's immolation and it introduces the story in an ingenious way the film starts with a synthesis of the history of the Jewish people from their arrival to the promised land after 40 years in the desert to the selection of Saul as their first king who led the common man to war and proceeds with a description of the process of corruption to which the tribes came which culminates in the moment when the expected Messiah appeared to whom they ended up turning their backs and murdering. Rossellini does not shilly shally he cleverly exposes the political intrigue of Pharisees and Jewish priests who try to preserve their power without disturbing the Roman invaders that control them. Jesus is young and strong somewhat timid he works wood ploughs and gleans has mystical outbursts preaches with metaphors to death and knows how to debate with logical reasoning. The most difficult part of the film is the sequence of the apostles' proselytizing campaign as they preach the new word but that is the director's choice. Rossellini prefers that to show us instead the brutal and violent in the best aesthetic line of a Greek tragedy which showed not tortures crimes or mutilations on stage. The Messiah saves us the lashes the road to Golgotha the long agony on the cross and the miracles. The agenda of the film is another it is to show the story of a man who confronted the corruption of power who preached love as method but who was paid with hatred by his own people. The way Rossellini does it is realistic he shows thing in a way so natural and nondramatized often in long shots with few cuts or none that the images lose that false fervor of saint cards that has ruined so many films about Jesus. As an example see the sequence of the last supper from the moment Jesus washes the apostles' feet to Judas' departure. It is just that a last meal a sad farewell and the leader's final instructions and not an ornate evocation of the first Eucharist. Roberto Rossellini was not an improvised filmmaker he is the father of Italian neo realism a brilliant light in the history of cinema whose trilogy of war Rome Open City Pais and Germany Year Zero marked the birth of contemporary cinema. He was an innovator who took melodrama to the limit in his films with Ingrid Bergman the love of his life in Stromboli Land of God Europe 51 or Voyage to Italy and a visionary who joined the practice of television a medium that he glimpsed as the audiovisual future of the planet. The Messiah is not a sole spiritual work in his oeuvre. It also includes the portrait of Francis of Assisi in his film Francesco Jester of God 1950 and the TV miniseries Acts of the Apostles 1969. Atheists can also be sensitive to genuine religious people.".

I find quite curious that two Italian nonbelievers and filmmakers one Marxist and the other atheist made two of the most interesting films I have seen about the figure of Jesus of Nazareth.

Goldie Hawn is adorable in the intro section. Beatty does a nice job during the heist section. The getaway is the weak part of the movie if only because it challenges my ability to suspend my disbelief. Some parts of it were cool though.I think Beatty was convincing both as a security expert and thief. Hawn as mentioned above is adorable I admit I have always found her attractive. Reasons to watch the movie  you like Beatty you like Hawn you like heist movies though there are better or you like quirky 70s movies. The last item should not be overlooked because there's a distinctive style in certain 70s movies that's no longer seen  for example the implication that sex and drugs and alcohol is simply a lifestyle rather than a problem that needs to be addressed.".

The first half hour appears disjointed but careful attention to the action reveals the skillful development of the characters and provides good insight into their nefarious activities. Beatty and Hawn excel as the couple defrauding the mafia with a clever and intelligent scheme to switch safety deposit box contents belonging to the criminals to their own deposit box. At the eleventh hour their plan is uncovered and the ensuing chase brilliantly portrays both the tension of the moment and the atmosphere as well as the seediness of Hamburg during this period. There are moments of good humour pathos and tension as the pursuers are systematically eliminated. The ending is perhaps one of the first occasions that the thieves have been allowed obviously to get away with it. Although now looking a little dated Dollars nonetheless captures the realities of 1970's Germany. I highly recommend this film.".

Banks in Germany and Switzerland were attracting attention because they were convenient for money laundering purposes although that term was not fully in use yet. They offered security and confidentiality which American Banks could not compete with.Gert Frobe is the head of the bank in the story somewhat ironic as his best role was as Auric Goldfinger who also threatened the American economy in a different way. Frobe is playing his hard working banker as a good natured somewhat naive type. His right hand man is a security expert played by Warren Beatty. Beatty has learned that there are several people who are using the bank a bunch of crooked G.I.s led by Scott Brady a mob lawyer Robert Webber and his assistant who are transporting tens of thousands of dollars to the bank a hired assassin and drug courier. All three groups have one common denominator Goldie Hawn has been having sex with Brady Webber and the assassin. The three groups have used the banks superprotected safety deposit boxes to store their cash. Beatty has set up the cameras so he is aware of the timing of the cameras as they move. If he can get locked into the vault under reasonably acceptable circumstances he can also control his movements so as not to be photographed by the camera. He is also in a position to have duplicates for the three security boxes he would have to open. Once this is done he could clear out the money in bags put into Golde Hawn's box and she can come in the next day and pick them up.It sounds complicated. It is complicated but Beatty and Hawn pull it off based on the knowledge of how much each group will deposit on a given weekend and on the known nervousness of Frobe for the security of his beloved bank. The first half hour shows how the scheme got laid out the next twenty minutes show how Beatty and Hawn especially Beatty in the locked vault pull it off. But the film does not end then. The three sets of individuals discover the robbery after the fact and then Brady and the assassin discover the common denominator Hawn. And the last forty minutes is a protracted chase through Germany that has one great set piece of Beatty's fight for his life on a frozen lake.It is not a great film but it is entertaining and at times comic thanks mostly to Hawn and Frobe with some help from Brady occasionally. So I give it a 7 out of 10.".

It is light and has its amusing moments but I found that the scenery was also very interesting.The chase scene was great except it was a bit unbelievable as the man with the suitcase running away from the crooks never seemed to get tired.

Pretty good performances from Eli Wallach as the villian Hayley Mills and Peter McEnery as the detectivesromantic leads and Irene Papas as the villian's nervous sister who dosen't have much to do but makes an impression.  Also funny comic performances from Joan Greenwood as Mills' aunt and the appearence of Pola Negri the silent screen star as the jewel collector Madame Habib.  The gorgeous scenery of Crete is also a big asset.  I found the film to be pretty suspenseful and engaging throughout.  I really wasn't sure just what was going to happen next.  It did keep me on the edge of my seat in some spots.  The only weak link was  a very rushed and uneventful conclusion but otherwise very welldone.  This was Disney's answer to Hitchcock and also an apparent attempt to get his young star Miss Mills into more adult roles after four years of excellent but very kiddie films for the studio. Unfortunately she didn't get any more roles like this at Disney her next and last was in That Darn Cat! a very enjoyable and funny film but still aimed more at kids.  She ended up having to leave the studio do a nude scene in another film and have an affair with an older man in order to become more adult in the eyes of the world.  Still this was her starting point and while Hitchcock could easily have topped this and any other suspensemystery film it's still fun to watch and suspenseful never boring.  See it you won't be sorry.".

	schema:headline " Routine Light Thriller with Charismatic Young Actress";
	schema:reviewBody "In some of her early films such as 'Tiger Bay' or 'Whistle Down the Wind' Hayley Mills revealed herself to be one of Britain's most remarkable child actresses but as an adult her films were generally unremarkable. The light family films she made in her teenage years for Disney and others can be seen as marking a stage in her decline to the ordinary from the extraordinary. Indeed they were possibly a cause of that decline had she been given more demanding roles during this period she might have matured into a bigger adult star. The studios' determination to fit her into the role of Teenage Virgin Queen occupied a few years earlier by Sandra Dee might also have made it more difficult for the public to accept her as an adult woman.'The Moonspinners' is a typical offering from her Disney period. The teenage Nikky Ferris arrives for a holiday in Crete with her aunt a musicologist who wants to make recordings of Cretan folkmusic. The owner of their hotel however is unwelcoming and his behaviour soon arises Nikky's suspicions that he is involved in some criminal enterprise. Nikky meets and befriends a young Englishman Mark and the two soon find themselves involved in a search to recover some stolen jewels. Several other reviewers compare this film to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. The film is a mixture of romantic comedy and thriller although I felt that the romance and comedy elements predominate over the suspense elements to a greater extent than they ever do in Hitchcock even in his lighter films. The scene where Nikki and Mark are rescued from the windmill however did strike me as very Hitchcockian I wondered if it was intended as deliberate homage to the similar scene involving Joel McCrae in 'Foreign Correspondent'. My general impression of the film was that it was despite some attractive location photography a fairly routine light thriller. Peter McEnery as Mark makes an uncharismatic leading man and the principal baddies Eli Wallach as suspicious surly foreigner and John Le Mesurier as smooth but hypocritical English gentleman are drawn straight from the Official Hollywood Scriptwriter's Guide to Stock Villainous Characters. There is an amusing cameo from Sheila Hancock as Le Mesurier's alcoholic wife but the best thing about the film is the presence of Hayley herself. She reminded me of Audrey Hepburn whose charisma and presence frequently enabled her to make memorable what would otherwise have been very ordinary thrillers or romantic comedies. Hayley was of course considerably younger than Audrey and in my view less classically beautiful but shared with her the ability to carry a film through charm and charisma. 'The Moonspinners' is not in the same league as Hayley's best films but it is worth watching for a chance to see this fine young actress. 610".

Constructed a little bit like an Hitchcock movie where tension is building up slowly but surely and where many characters are not always what they seem to be it is filled with memorable scenes the escape from the windmill for example and good humor. Although she may not be as sparkling as in Pollyanna or The Parent Trap Hayley Mills is nevertheless still the star of the show both charming and endearing. Furthermore as a beautiful grown up she is portraying a modern heroin not afraid to take charge of her own detective work. As the villain Eli Wallach is also particularly brilliant. Eventually the music and especially the title song by Terry Gilkyson are lively and enchanting.".

Back to the Moon...I so wanted to be on that island to help her and her friend. I was all in knots during the wind mill adventure...wow for a seven year old that was very intense especially for a country boy. I remember yelling at the movie screen when things got too intense and I was very relieved when everything turned out OK. Yes the movie was very good and still would be good with another leading lady but I am glad that Mr Disney found Haley Mills!".

	schema:reviewBody "First thing. The Moon Spinners despite the tag line on IMDb is not set on a SMALL Greek island but a rather large one Crete. I watched this movie for the first time today April 17th 2006..43 years after it was released.I did so mainly because I first went to Crete in 1976 when it was quite undeveloped. So I was interested to see what it was like in 1964  even more adorable.Sadly I've been back on business and it is now hideously overdeveloped. But the original beauty and primitiveness of Crete comes over in this film. The movie itself seems to lose its way  someone should have had a close look at the script. From the moment the alleged British consul played by John Le Mesurier makes an appearance the movie heads off into bizarre territory. Polo Negri as the muchmarried Greek millionaire looks like a man in drag and the last 45 minutes leaves one both bewildered and yawning.But what are astonishing are the stunts. The young kid leaping onto the moving windmill sail and spinning full circle on it then actor McEnery on the face of it doing partially the same. I'm assuming they used a stunt double for Hayley Mills. Even McEnery leaping from rock to dangerous rock. The motorboat scenes look a bit hairy too and I think there would be a lot more Health and Safety regulation now.McEnery was already showing signs of what would become a considerable dramatic pedigree.But it was an enjoyable romp in parts and early Sixties Crete looked marvellous and unspoilt.History buffs may recall that a savage battle was fought there in 1941 when German airborne forces wrested control of the island from British and New Zealand forces. War cemeteries are present on the island to this day.Later Cretan partisans fought the German occupiers from the mountains. In 1976 one such partisan by then in his Seventies proudly showed me a knife with Luftwaffe markings he'd taken after allegedly killing its Nazi owner.But small Crete is not. It's the largest of the many Greek islands. About 130 miles long at its longest point I recall and about 80 miles deep.Final note As teenagers we were all in love with Hayley Mills  she seemed to epitomise the times freshfaced innocent naive. Reason enough to watch this and recapture the Zeitgeist of 1964.Stuart White".

Keep in mind that this stylistic resemblance may be seen as an advantage or a serious flaw. The story happens in Greece on the island of Crete though it's actually not very much about Greece or its culture. Of the seven major characters only one is actually Greek. Two of the actors notably Eli Wallach play at being Hellenic while struggling through bad accents and mangled dialog. Culturally the whole film is a profound embarrassment if you know anything about Greece. But of course that wasn't the point of the project. Rather it was a vehicle for Haley Mills. By this standard she does good work presenting herself as a wacky cute girl who stumbles onto a scheme involving stolen jewels. The plot itself is needlessly confused and characters say and do all sorts of things that make no practical sense except as stale devices to move the story along. The truly shining moments of the film come only near the end in scenes involving former silentmovielegend Pola Negri in her final film role. At this point the movie thoroughly entertains and nearly makes up for the hourplus of previous tedium. Unfortunately even Eli Wallach fails to impress in this strained vehicle. If you're looking for a good movie one with a solid plot and uniformly good acting and directing then pass on The MoonSpinners. It's really quite unremarkable. But if you want to conjure warm memories of a classicDisney childhood and you want to see the last glimpse of the amazing Pola Negri then definitely watch this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether a film is or is not like the book that it is purportedly based on is surely the most ridiculous reason for liking or disliking it.A film is a film and a book is a book. Two very different art forms. No one can film a book. For one thing they won't fit. A long movie has roughly the content of a short story. Trying too hard to pack in all the material of the book is a recipe for cinematic disaster. On the other hand drawing inspiration from a great book can often produce a great movie. But the two remain separate works and must be judged separately.Never was this more true than in the case of Walt Disney. His movies even the ones he produced at arm's length like The MoonSpinners were always Disney movies first and foremost. Products of his unique vision. That was always a given... when you went to see a Disney movie you knew what to expect. Not the Mary Poppins of the books nor the Mowgli of Kipling. You knew it would be Disney's Mowgli... and you knew he'd be a wonderful creation in his own right.Though it fits well with Disney's other UKproduced works Greyfriars Bobby Emil and the Detectives Darby O'Gill etc. The MoonSpinners is still very much a Disney movie. It's warm and safe even in its most dangerous moments. It transports us back to a time and place that never really existed except in Walt's imagination. But which we always WANTED to exist. A place where we could romp up and down Cretan hills with the glowing and by now disturbingly voluptuous Haley Mills. Double chins indeed! Only the most anorexiafixated American viewer could fail to find her a vision of beauty in this film.The story line is slim to be sure but actually quite robust by Disney standards. It's Disney's Midsummer Night's dream... a memory of a dream of a romp on a warm summer night on a romantic Mediterranean isle. That's more than enough for me... though like any dream it's a very personal thing.".

I looked at the clock and it said 300 am. I began to watch this movie and I got very interested. It kept me awake! I didn't even know the title but it was such a great movie that I HAD to find out on imdb. I gave this movie a 10 because it was filled with excitement!

My elderly father loves it I still enjoy watching it and my grandchildren do too. That is my measurement of pure entertainment. At the first showing I fell deeply in love with Peter McEnery  as only a 14yearold could do. It is a shame that this movie is his only real claim to fame. The other reviews say pretty much what else I would like to say about the movie. At the time I wanted to be Haley Mills I wanted to go to Crete to see the windmills and dance with the locals and hear them sing. I wanted to board a fantastic yacht and pet an ocelot. Especially I wanted a little romance with a tall handsome British man with lots of wavy hair a man with a secret who also respected me and would save me in time of danger. It was a wonderful movie.".

The plot is written by what appears to be a drunken chimp. The first thing you notice is Hayley looks different. She's got....bits. Sort of curves. And what looks suspiciously like a double chin. Something is wrong here in this remarkably disturbing film. She doesn't look like my Hayley. You know the little scamp. The tearaway that touched a generation. The bobby on the beat cannot stop her. Tanks cannot stop her. Bubonic plague dies at her feet. Arnold Schwarzenegger pleads a prior engagement. Resistance is futile. She's the engine of my soul. My North my..etc. Could she finally have reached gulp puberty? Could she be having....stirrings? Interest tremble  in boys? Say it ain't so Joe. I'm in a daze Haze.Our Haze is on holiday in Crete and takes an immediate shine to a good looking young guy named Mark whose involved in some dodgy dealings involving stolen jewelry. They stand on some steps together and Haze talks wistfully up at the moon. That's close enough pal. Along comes Eli Wallach as Stratos in a warm up for his part as Tuco in 'The Good The Bad And The Ugly' two years later. He even crosses himself like Tuco when he sees the Madonna. You see Tuco there are two kinds of people in this world. Spurs who come in through the door and those that come in through the window. Those with loaded guns and those who dig. Those who prefer Hayley Mills as sweet and virginal albeit dangerous in a built up zone and those who belong in jail. Stratos definitely fits the latter category. The original Hayley would not simper in front of men and take being manhandled slapped and generally patronised. No building or tree or poncho would be left standing. Do I not like this. Mark follows Stratos to the beach at night suspecting him of jewelry smuggling and is shot and falls into the sea. Unfortunately he lives and asks our Haze to procure some brandy for him from the hotel bar. Somebody shoot him again. How can he corrupt our beloved if disconcertingly tall Hayley like that? Later on he even smelling salts KISSES her. You know...on...on the lips. Stratos looks for Mark with a gun. Stratos! Stratos! He's in the church! we cry in unison but it is our Haze who is imprisoned in a windmill and has to be rescued by Mark's young Cretan friend catchphrase This is no time to make love in a gobsmacking scene like Hitchcock on acid. Flying around on the end of a sail our Haze falls on Mark nearly killing him with puppy fat. Sadly he gets up and is on Stratos's trail again. Suffering from his usual aversion to dry clothes Mark plunges into the sea again and Stratos tries to run him over in a boat. That's it Stratos HIT HIM! But no. Stratos's sister is played by Irene Papas who it seems is contractually obligated to appear in any film made on Crete even that kenneth Branagh bomb and gives a performance that belongs in a proper film. With real people. And a six year old Hayley Mills. You know the real world. Ignoring his sister's pleading to leave our Haze alone and repent his wicked ways Stratos goes for a rendezvous on a boat to sell the jewelry stolen from Mark's employer. What follows is a truly bizarre series of events involving a double crossing honoury consul with a drunken wife a hearse masquerading as an ambulance a femme fatale of dubious repute with a dress sense that makes Norma Desmond look like a piker a yacht boudoir like a Cecil B DeMille set without the charm and last but not least a cheater without a lead and a pathological fear of actors. AND Hayley Mills is given alcohol and falls over drunk.This horrifying film will give me many a sleepless night. Did the decadence of the sixties leave nothing unsullied in it's pernicious wake? To see ANY minor abused and corrupted in a film is bad enough but Hayley Mills? And couldn't they stop her growing up like they did with Judy Garland? And keep her off the handburgers? Be warned this Disney film is the 'Reservoir Dogs' of that dark decade. The seventies were cool though.".

It has a nice sense of humour and the story is not too unrealistic in our modern times.Unfortunately the movie is too long  in the storical way.Personally I always thought it funny that romance movies end with the Big Love and don't show the life that follows. This movie kind of shows the afterstory. And that's what I don't like about it.It should have ended at the moment Anna and Paul found each other and really fell in love. Perhaps Pauline could have written some bad sides of him in her book  with the good side is here.Unfortunately it looks like someone decided at this moment wait  let's not make a comical movie and added some more adventures to urge it more into the family genre. Pauline's best friend has to move far away for some in film terms throwninreason Pauline starts to hate Pit and tries to run away to Brasilia.I admit the wedding scene between Pauline and Leon was wonderful and would have been hard to include without that afterstory but in the end I would have liked the movie much more without the last twenty minutes or so.".

It has a nice sense of humour and the story is not too unrealistic in our modern times.Unfortunately the movie is too long  in the storical way.Personally I always thought it funny that romance movies end with the Big Love and don't show the life that follows. This movie kind of shows the afterstory. And that's what I don't like about it.It should have ended at the moment Anna and Paul found each other and really fell in love. Perhaps Pauline could have written some bad sides of him in her book  with the good side is here.Unfortunately it looks like someone decided at this moment wait  let's not make a comical movie and added some more adventures to urge it more into the family genre. Pauline's best friend has to move far away for some in film terms throwninreason Pauline starts to hate Pit and tries to run away to Brasilia.I admit the wedding scene between Pauline and Leon was wonderful and would have been hard to include without that afterstory but in the end I would have liked the movie much more without the last twenty minutes or so.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Morning After is a murder mystery that features romance blackmail and suspense but it's the relationship between the story's two leading characters that provides the main focus of the action and also most of the humour and interest that make this movie so enjoyable to watch. Its opening scene is really intriguing and sets the story up brilliantly. What follows is loosely based on The Blue Gardenia 1953 and like its predecessor this movie features a woman who was with a murder victim on the night he died awakens the next morning unable to remember what happened and then has to put her trust in someone of whom she's not certain.Alex Sternbergen Jane Fonda is an alcoholic exactress who wakes up in a strange bed next to the corpse of a man she doesn't know and has no memory of how she got there. She's immediately convinced that the police won't believe her story because she has a history of becoming violent and suffering blackouts after her drinking binges and had even stabbed her first husband with a paring knife during one of her blackouts. In her panic Alex heads to the airport but can't get out of L.A. because it's the Thanksgiving holiday and all the flights are booked. Feeling desperate and anxious she gets involved in a car accident and races away from the scene into a nearby parking lot where she meets Turner Kendall Jeff Bridges.In her efforts to escape the other irate drivers involved in the car accident Alex gets into Turner's car and together they drive away from her pursuers. Turner's an easygoing bigoted excop who says I like to repair stuff whatever people are through with and works mainly on small appliances like toasters. Turner and Alex gradually get to know each other and fall in love. She doesn't know whether or not she was responsible for the dead man's murder and he tries to help her to solve the mystery. The problem is she isn't sure whether or not she can trust him especially as her estranged husband Joaquin Jacky Manero Raul Julia who's a very successful hairdresser in Beverly Hills warns her that Turner is actually trying to frame her. Alex and Turner stick together and eventually discover who the murderer is and also the extent to which blackmail was involved in the crime.The Morning After makes a strong impression visually with good use being made of interesting locations and a colour palette that uses a range of pastels quite effectively. The scene in which Alex escapes from the apartment where the killing had taken place is particularly memorable because at a time when she's feeling desperate and scared being situated in a highly lit desertedlooking street in which she's dwarfed by the structures around her really emphasises her plight and reinforces the impression that in these very open surroundings there really is no hiding place.Jane Fonda and Jeff Bridges are both exceptional in this movie and the chemistry between them is the icing on the cake. Fonda in an Oscar nominated role makes Alex's combination of toughness vulnerability and selfdoubt totally believable and Bridges is wonderfully subtle in a performance that creates a lot of distrust about how sincere he is in his concern for Alex's predicament. The dialogue they share is also superb and some of Alex's cutting remarks really sting.There's a great deal to enjoy in The Morning After and the whole experience of watching it is extremely entertaining. Its only disappointment however is the resolution to the mystery which unfortunately isn't up to the standard of everything else that precedes it.".

	schema:headline " Two Great Performances Buried in Gaping Plot Discrepancies";
	schema:reviewBody "The Morning After opens with an extraordinarily effective scene  prototypical of director Sidney Lumet's pareddown building of tension.  As Jane Fonda crawls out of bed we sense her hangover one of those  inordinately miserable mornings when nothing about you is sufficiently  functional and we also sense how accustomed she's become to these  mornings as she is not only passably functional but also recognizes  herself in the mirror and indeed spills some gin into a glass  speculating about the guy in her bed. Who is he? She doesn't comprehend  the true gravity of her predicament until she turns him onto his back.  She sees no cop is going to buy her story so she attempts to remove  all the evidence of her stopover. And then she rambles back out into  the intense Los Angeles light. And in a shot from high overhead she  seems like a lab rat ensnared in some sort of a experiment. It's so  well directed that we almost forget how preposterous it is to think  this frameup would ever work.  This beginning promises an exceptional thriller. Alas The Morning  After never matches its initial potential not as a thriller at least.  The narrative has some gaping disparities in it and thrillers need to  be impermeable. This one chalks various elements up to pure  coincidence the ultimate motives are flimsy at best and the fact that  the body keeps reappearing like a cartoon or a takeoff on The Trouble  with Harry brings the movie too close to qualifying as '80s schlock for  one to become seriously absorbed in the plot. But The Morning After  merits a look anyhow owing to the characters that it cultivates and  the performances of Fonda and Jeff Bridges in the two leads.  She plays an alcoholic actress long past her heyday. He plays an excop  who happens to be fixing his car right where she topples into his back  seat and implores him to get her away from there quick. Bridges stays  in a petty manufactured shed where he repairs appliances. This is all  Fonda needs. She's a veteran of the livefastdieyoung subscription  her friends all bartenders and drag queens her separated husband Raul  Julia the most upmarket hairdresser in Beverly Hills. Nevertheless  Bridges is reliable and sound and she could do with a friend.  Naturally it's axiomatic that they fall in love.  The plot of The Morning After is not nearly as well captured or  interesting as the daybyday grinds of these characters. Actually I  can picture a movie that would omit the murder and just trail the  genuine human development between Fonda and Bridges. The thriller  filler isn't needed although given that they used it couldn't they  have made it credible? The entire murder plot gets such slapdash  treatment that perhaps I oughtn't have been startled by the big scene  in which the killer's exposed. I've seen innumerable revelations in  innumerable thrillers but seldom one as transparent as this one where  the surprises are just announced in an improbable monologue. Indeed  the fact that nearly every opinion I've heard or read of this film  seems unanimous in terms of James Hicks' script including mine even  down to the 'It starts off well but then it gets really forced and  jerrybuilt' gist it seems pretty clearcut what makes the film not  quite work though it'd be a misstep to write this movie off simply  because the story is so rickety. It's worth making an allowance for due  to the performances.  Fonda and Bridges are superb in the film and their rapport founded on  skeletons in the cupboard bitterness and ulterior motives gets  especially remarkable. They create tangible unspoken feelings together  and they have some dialogue that feels more alive than most starryeyed  chatter in the movies. Before the schmaltzy final scene not even close  to prototypical of Lumet there's a single shot in which all Bridges  and Fonda do is face each other and we know and fee that they want  to have sex with each other. It's just energy and it works wonders.  I also admire how Lumet reinforces every color. Living in Los Angeles  is part of the debilitating influence on the character played by Jane  Fonda. All color is exaggerated red redder blue filters orange  hazes. He creates an L.A. comprised of vast flat surfaces of pastels  and aggressively sunlit exposed areas. He traps the inebriated Fonda on  this landscape like a helplessly insignificant insect sought for  squashing by unknown feet and the imagery makes the whole first hour  of the movie much more ominous than it merits. Too bad they couldn't  have take steps with the script.".

Who is he? She doesn't comprehend  the true gravity of her predicament until she turns him onto his back.  She sees no cop is going to buy her story so she attempts to remove  all the evidence of her stopover. And then she rambles back out into  the intense Los Angeles light. And in a shot from high overhead she  seems like a lab rat ensnared in some sort of a experiment. It's so  well directed that we almost forget how preposterous it is to think  this frameup would ever work.  This beginning promises an exceptional thriller. Alas The Morning  After never matches its initial potential not as a thriller at least.  The narrative has some gaping disparities in it and thrillers need to  be impermeable. This one chalks various elements up to pure  coincidence the ultimate motives are flimsy at best and the fact that  the body keeps reappearing like a cartoon or a takeoff on The Trouble  with Harry brings the movie too close to qualifying as '80s schlock for  one to become seriously absorbed in the plot. But The Morning After  merits a look anyhow owing to the characters that it cultivates and  the performances of Fonda and Jeff Bridges in the two leads.  She plays an alcoholic actress long past her heyday. He plays an excop  who happens to be fixing his car right where she topples into his back  seat and implores him to get her away from there quick. Bridges stays  in a petty manufactured shed where he repairs appliances. This is all  Fonda needs. She's a veteran of the livefastdieyoung subscription  her friends all bartenders and drag queens her separated husband Raul  Julia the most upmarket hairdresser in Beverly Hills. Nevertheless  Bridges is reliable and sound and she could do with a friend.  Naturally it's axiomatic that they fall in love.  The plot of The Morning After is not nearly as well captured or  interesting as the daybyday grinds of these characters. Actually I  can picture a movie that would omit the murder and just trail the  genuine human development between Fonda and Bridges. The thriller  filler isn't needed although given that they used it couldn't they  have made it credible? The entire murder plot gets such slapdash  treatment that perhaps I oughtn't have been startled by the big scene  in which the killer's exposed. I've seen innumerable revelations in  innumerable thrillers but seldom one as transparent as this one where  the surprises are just announced in an improbable monologue. Indeed  the fact that nearly every opinion I've heard or read of this film  seems unanimous in terms of James Hicks' script including mine even  down to the 'It starts off well but then it gets really forced and  jerrybuilt' gist it seems pretty clearcut what makes the film not  quite work though it'd be a misstep to write this movie off simply  because the story is so rickety. It's worth making an allowance for due  to the performances.  Fonda and Bridges are superb in the film and their rapport founded on  skeletons in the cupboard bitterness and ulterior motives gets  especially remarkable. They create tangible unspoken feelings together  and they have some dialogue that feels more alive than most starryeyed  chatter in the movies. Before the schmaltzy final scene not even close  to prototypical of Lumet there's a single shot in which all Bridges  and Fonda do is face each other and we know and fee that they want  to have sex with each other. It's just energy and it works wonders.  I also admire how Lumet reinforces every color. Living in Los Angeles  is part of the debilitating influence on the character played by Jane  Fonda. All color is exaggerated red redder blue filters orange  hazes. He creates an L.A. comprised of vast flat surfaces of pastels  and aggressively sunlit exposed areas. He traps the inebriated Fonda on  this landscape like a helplessly insignificant insect sought for  squashing by unknown feet and the imagery makes the whole first hour  of the movie much more ominous than it merits. Too bad they couldn't  have take steps with the script.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was much better than I had reason to expect after reading the comments on IMDb. Its biggest flaw must be the way The Morning After is marketed. It is not really a taut whodunit thriller but rather a study of a particular place in a particular era with particular characters  a dark comedy and a love drama at the same time. The second biggest flaw is the grating almost ever present musical score. But for the rest this movie is nearly perfect.I should call The Morning After an expose of Southern California in the mid 1980s. The sets and the photography a lot frontal or near frontal wide angle shots of curbside sceneries are very accomplished  Schrader's American Gigolo came to mind. The sun is always shining the air seems to be absolutely pure even places that should be dirty back yards industrial sites etc. are painted in gaudy colors and squeaky clean. But the minds of the principal protagonists are desperately foggy and muddled. California appears to be a big decaying fake idyll. People go there to die I once read in a novel by Nathanael West The Day of the Locust  also made into a great underrated California movie by the way. And that more or less sums up the feel of it.The cast is kept wonderfully small. Jane Fonda is brilliant and she would have deserved the Oscar for this part. For several long scenes she acts alone in front of the camera and she really conveys the desperation and the natural charm of the character and she's really attractive too despite the boozing. Jeff Bridges is a reliable support here. Also very good is Raul Julia as Fonda's somehow estranged husband. He plays a high end hairdresser with a snazzy salon and at times displays an unexpected but highly welcome gentlemanly charm. Until now I always thought of Sidney Lumet as an American East Coast director. It is the only one of his movies I know that is set in California. He seems to have his own way of appreciating that place. There is a director's comment on the DVD I purchased and I am looking forward to listening to that.".

The set up is immediately compelling but it's the only worthwhile scene in an otherwise strangely unthrilling thriller. The film is a juicy premise with no payoff presenting just two possible suspects only one logically implicated and hustling in a vague motive for the crime almost out if the blue just before the final credits. Never mind the actual details which in retrospect are about as memorable as Fonda's onenight stand. Jeff Bridges costars as a benevolent excop from Bakersfield who meets Fonda entirely by chance and Raul Julia plays her ambitious hair stylist exhusband.

But I actually thought that Jane Fonda's role was absolutely laughable. She was completely unbelievable as was Raul Julia. Casting against type never works and it definitely does not work here. And the fact that Sidney Lumet directed this mishmash is the biggest shock of all. One wonders how so much talent could be utterly wasted in so much tripe. Actually the most interesting performance I thought was by Diane Salinger who I remember most vividly from the film whereas everyone else sort of washes out. I looked up Salinger and learned that she has an acting academy in Los Angeles which makes perfect sense since she really shines in this catastrophe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Would you ever think that Jane Fonda and Jeff Bridges had chemistry on screen? Well if you want to see it then you won't really find it here. What you will find is good performances from the two but with a fairly weak script and a story that mildly entertains. The Morning After is the story about a washed up actress who wakes up with a hangover next to a dead man one morning. She has no recollection of the previous night and no idea what to do with herself in this situation. She finds help from a mysterious young man named Turner Kendall played by Jeff Bridges but suspense and mystery build as her situation becomes increasingly dire. She doesn't know if this strange Turner character is a blessing or a curse and whether she should trust him or be deathly afraid of him. And so the mystery begins in this halfway decent suspense thriller of which there's not a whole lot to say.The Morning After is helped by strong performances and an engaging story that leads you on to want to know the outcome. It is hurt by a weak script and the lack of originality it faces in its midsection. It starts out strong opening with Jane Fonda's character waking up in bed next to a man with a knife in his chest. She panics and leaves the apartment she is in and tries to get her situation under control before she decides what to do with the body. During this panic she meets Turner and this is where the mystery begins.The film builds its suspense nicely but after a while it starts to flat line and doesn't get any more interesting until the end. A romance begins between Fonda and Bridges not unexpectedly to say the least and for a while nothing much happens. The two characters are developed and their relationship grows but after a while it becomes redundant and their back stories don't end up being all that creative. Fonda is an actress who used to be big and has now fallen into obscurity. Bridges was a big shot cop who suffered an injury and is now a nobody. These character profiles are important to the overall arc of the story but they don't make our two main characters all too interesting leading the film as a whole to not be all too interesting. Plus we have a script that leaves a lot to be desired. But when the film finally comes to its conclusion it isn't something I saw coming but in retrospect I probably should have been able to see it from a mile away. I can however give the movie credit for having a very exciting climax but that leads into a final scene which wraps the film up a little too nicely.When you get right down to it The Morning After is just sort of there. It isn't great it isn't terrible but it isn't something I will remember. I won't be thinking about this film in a few weeks and I might not even remember watching it. It's a movie that tells a mildly interesting story with mildly interesting characters played by great actors. It's more or less your typical suspense thriller and there's nothing wrong with that but there's really nothing here that is going to stick with me.".

She gets drunk again wakes up in the morning and tries to take a shower but finds the same dead body propped up in the shower stall.Her estranged husband Raoul Julia does what he can to help but he's involved with his tony hair dressing business and Fonda winds up turning to Bridges for safety succor and sex.Then the plot gets a little twisted.I think Sidney Lumet must have gotten lost during a binge in New York night spots and woke up in Los Angeles. But he gets it just about right. When Fonda first leaves the corpse's apartment she finds herself on an unfamiliar street the kind that characterizes LA perfectly. The opening sequence shows us blank warehouse walls on empty industrial boulevards and the avenues of pastel middleclass apartments are equally devoid of pedestrians. That's the difference between LA and New York. In Los Angeles nobody walks. In New York if you step out your door you are mugged by the crowd.Fonda is a professional actress undone by age but the role is played with craggy inconsistency. She's pretty tough. She makes wisecracks to the cadaver while she's scrubbing his apartment. She's aggressive and manipulative at LAX. On the other hand she plays Viveca as a shrill nervous wreck with a semiquaver in her voice even when she's supposed to be mellowed out on Thunderbird a cheap wine. However Fonda looks just fine considering that she's no longer the teenager of her earlier movies. She's just my age. I saw a recent photo of her and she still looks stunningly beautiful as do I.I've always like Raoul Julia's performances. He's reliable reassuring good in almost everything he does. Too bad he wasn't around longer. Jeff Bridges usually brings something unique to each of his roles but he's hobbled here by the limitations written into this stereotype of stability. He's a handyman the eternal fixerupper a guy who takes old busted things and refurbishes them every wife's dream of a man who is good with a wrench and knows how to reintroduce the sputtering home computer to the concept of reliability. He's a man of nature comfortable enough in his own skin to use ethnic epithets like beaner and spade good naturedly and without self consciousness a Mellors the grounds keeper for our time.The script has little hackneyed touches that I find hard to believe originated with such a seasoned and talented director as Sidney Lumet. Fonda is backing out of the dead man's apartment bumps into someone there is a sting in the score and it's merely Jeff Bridges who has followed her without Fonda or the audience knowing it. It's done twice and it's pretty cheap. And when Fonda changes her hair from phony blond to natural chestnut or burnt sienna or whatever it is a grand dramatic display is made of it. The viewer is supposed to applaud because now THAT'S the iconic Jane Fonda we know and love. No phoniness here. She smokes and drinks during the first half of the movie but not the last half. The score is by Paul Chihara and the main theme is carried by a soprano saxophone. This might have been a novelty in 1986 but now after ten years of Kenny G it's enough to induce thyrotoxic storm.On the admirable side she simply stops drinking for a couple of days and is determined never to get drunk again. We are spared the tears and anguish we might experience if she went through withdrawal  the bottle looming in the foreground the trembling hand the halffull glass poured back into the bottle. Still I have to say that the ending of Lumet's Verdict was more realistic. There Paul Newman's drunk has found himself at the end but it doesn't stop him from drinking.

I am partial to Lloyd's version but I enjoyed this too.Keaton's version starts off with the high school graduation ceremony. Ronald Keaton the scholar of the class gives a speech denouncing athletics as a total waste of time and promoting being a bookworm over anything else. This speech is so offensive to the crowd that everyone leaves but Keaton's mom who applauds. By the way all the high school graduates look between 2535 years of age. These are the oldestlooking high school seniors in history!!Anyway a girl Buster is trying to impress Mary Haynes Anne Cornwall was among those not impressed with his snobby scholar speech. She'd rather have an athletic man. So upon entering college Ronald tries a variety of sports to gain the approval of the girl. Does this theme sound familiar not just in the Lloyd film but so many of Keaton's other films?He attempts to play baseball but is so clueless he puts on all the catcher's equipment to play third base. Suffice to say after a number of plays ensue it's more than evident that Ronald is a little bit out of his element! Next he goes out for track but gets discouraged when two little kids speed by him on the track. Throwing the discus and javelin are not good ideas either. His highjumping routine is very funny. He isn't bad in the hurdles however. Obviously pole vaulting doesn't work and the hammer throw almost gets his teammates killed so he's told to leave.He gets a call from the Dean's office. The Dean who liked him from the start because he preferred studies over sports is distressed because Buster's grades are bad. Buster explains his problems and the Dean played by the alwaysfunny Snitz Edwards sympathizes because being a wimpy little guy he same problem years ago with a woman he liked. So as a favor Dean Edwards orders the rowing coach to install Buster as the coxswain of the team. The coach and the crew don't want this as Little Lord Fauntleroy or Mama's Boy and other names he's called has a reputation already at college as an athletic loser. They try to sabotage his attempt at being part of their crew but he turns the tables. The funniest scene is when the new coxswain literally becomes the boat's rudder.The neatest part of the film is the ending which is usually the case in silent comedies. Suffice to say that Buster puts all of his athletic talents which were not effective on the sports fields to good use to get the girl. It's a memorable ending.".

Horne is something of a sortafter silent classic inspired by Harold Lloyd's more successful college comedy THE FRESHMAN 1925 starring Buster Keaton demonstrating on how to fail as an athlete without really trying. The story opens one rainy afternoon with Ronald Buster Keaton carrying his umbrella walking along side with his mother Florence Turner to attend his high school graduation ceremony along with his other classmates Mary Haines Anne Cornwall the girl he loves and Jeff Brown Harold Goodwin his rival for Mary's affection and star athlete who is finally graduating after seven years. Ronald the school's most brilliant scholar receives his diploma and is asked by the members of the faculty to speak on the Curse of Athletics which he does. After degrading sports by saying The student who wastes his time on athletics rather than study shows ignorance and Where would I be without my books wins approval with the teachers but not with his classmates especially Mary who finds his speech ridiculous. Because Ronald loves Mary he finds he might now really lose her to Jeff Harold Goodwin. As Mary and Jeff register at Clayton College Ronald decides to enroll there also and with no financial support from his mother he decides to work his way through college where he intends to win back Mary's affection by becoming an athlete himself. In true Keaton fashion he tries out in all sports imaginable ranging from baseball track and field events shotput and finally as a coxswain on a varsity crew team in an important race and flunks. Even while working as a soda jerk and as a waiter he fails at that too. But after he learns that his girl is in trouble does he pull out all stops in making himself a success without realizing how good he actually is.COLLEGE may not be as well known as Buster Keaton's other silent film comedies including two of which come to mind SHERLOCK Jr. 1924 and of course his masterpiece THE GENERAL 1926 but it's a simpleminded story set against a college backdrop that features plenty of sight gags and sports activity to make this one enjoyable especially to any avid sports fan. The supporting players include Snitz Edwards as the college dean Grant Withers Sam Crawford Buddy Mason and Flora Bramley. While these names are not particularly wellknown it's the Buster Keaton name heading the cast that has generated interest in this comedy then and now.COLLEGE was one of the twelve selected films to appear during the summer months on public television's 1975 weekly presentation of The Silent Years as hosted by Lillian Gish with a piano score and color tints from the Paul Killiam collection. Before the airing of the featurelength silent comedy Gish would talk a little about Keaton's career and how he became known as Buster present a 20minute comedy short ONE WEEK 1920 and then ask for the viewers awaiting to see COLLEGE to not be offended with one particular scene where Keaton's character of Harold is working in a restaurant disguised as a colored waiter. This plea would still reflect upon viewers of today.COLLEGE which is available on video cassette and DVD can be seen in various ways depending on the distributor especially with its time length. Blackhawk Video's version accompanied with the same piano score that was used in The Silent Years runs at 60 minutes while Video Yesteryear's accuspeed version with organ score runs close to 100 minutes. A more recent and recommended 1992 restored version with clearer picture and a fine new organ score by John Muri running at 65 minutes was the one formerly shown on cable television's American Movie Classics 19972001 and later on Silent Sunday Nights on Turner Classic Movies. In spite of a handful of collegesports films produced during this period it's interesting to point out that such legends of screen comedy as Charlie Chaplin andor WC Fields have never attempted this. Future film comedians as Lou Costello and Jerry Lewis have done such and probably were inspired by the likes of Lloyd or Keaton. However COLLEGE is minor but enjoyable Keaton at best that would be a fine addition to any film buff's video or DVD library. ".

	schema:reviewBody "While this may seem a rather lightweight effort considering it came in the same year that produced 'The General 1927' 'College' is an excellent little film in which Buster Keaton exploits the endless slapstick possibilities offered by sporting activities. Keaton plays Ronald an unpopular bookworm whose public condemnation of athletics leads his girlfriend Anne Cornwall to dump him in favour of a more physicallycapable jock Harold Goodwin. In an attempt to win back the love of his life Ronald enrolls himself in college and tries his hands at every sport in sight with hilarious consequences. The two preceding sentences pretty much summarise the entire film. However this inkling of a narrative is more than enough to open up a vast range of entertaining gags and Keaton snatches a laugh at every opportunity.How do I begin to list my favourite moments from 'College?' Though some have complained of the repetitiveness of the sequence in which Keaton tries every athletics activity in the book I thought it was the highlight of the film. The scenes follow a very strict comedic routine first we see how it is supposed to be done then we see Ronald's absurdly inept attempt. Wash rinse repeat this time with a completely different sport. Of course the routine becomes somewhat predictable but Buster Keaton is always the uncertain variable. We don't know how his next effort is going to fail but we know it is and that it's going to be a spectacular failure. Ronald is a hopeless case but you can't deny that he's got heart. Whether he is being outsprinted by a pair of young children falling short of the longjump sandpit snapping a polevaulting stick in half or planting his face two feet underground after clearing the highjump bar he is always courageous enough to get up brush himself off and try again.I've read that Harold Lloyd explored similar territory two years earlier with 'The Freshman 1925' a film I haven't seen yet so that one's probably a good film to look up if you like me enjoyed this one. It is also believed that there was originally a sequence showing Ronald's attempts to play American football though this was ulimately cut to avoid comparisons with Lloyd's movie. Additionally I was interested to read that Ronald's polevault through the window was one of the few times in Keaton's career that he didn't perform his own stunts. I'm certain that the dangerlevel was definitely not the problem anybody who's seen 'Steamboat Bill Jr. 1928' will attest to that but polevaulting must have been one activity that he simply couldn't pull off. I don't blame him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Incredible stunts and deadpan expressions were Buster Keaton's stock in trade but his best films relied on more to interest audiences. College plays more like a filler project between more ambitious efforts showcasing the talents of its silent comic star only in fits and starts.Buster plays Ronald valedictorian of his high school class but too poor to afford college and a shot at the woman he loves Clayton State College freshman Mary Haynes Anne Cornwall. He enrolls at Clayton anyway tries his hand at work and jumps into scholastic athletics despite his grievous lack of physical coordination. Mary is impressed he's trying but his old rival Jeff Harold Goodwin is one of many who block his path.Directed by James W. Horne and an uncredited Keaton as an excuse for a series of sportsrelated gags College barely makes it to its running time of just over an hour even with the padding of a long intro centered around Buster's highschool graduation. Ronald's college career seems to consist of alternating bouts of athletics and hazing with some period shots of USC's campus for atmosphere.Buster's stone face is a little more expressive in this film beginning with his big graduation speech an ironic denunciation of sports he delivers with amusing eyebulging passion as he sways from side to side feet planted on the floor. What have Ty Ruth or Babe Dempsey done for Science! he demands angering his classmates so much they leave in midceremony.Speaking of Ty Cobb his former Tiger teammate Sam Crawford appears here as Clayton's baseball coach in one of the better sequences he was really USC's baseball coach at the time. As the third baseman Buster gets caught in a rundown then as a baserunner manages to cause a triple play by himself. Crawford finally ends things by gives Buster the boot.The overall storyline is episodic and haphazard. For a job Buster first works as a soda jerk scattering milk and eggs hither and yon until Mary walks in and Buster ashamedly pretends to be a customer too. This would seem a promising idea but instead the boss confronts him and Buster walks out ending that whole deal with a shrug. Later he tries to be a colored waiter by donning blackface. The color comes off the sequence doesn't.Even the celebrated visual trickery found in Keaton's other films gets short shrift here. The most prominent involves him being tossed up in the air holding an umbrella which causes him to slow when falling. It's a poor device in service of a weak gag involving a heavyset woman dressing at a window who gets annoyed at Buster's apparent peeping. Like much else in the film it could have been eliminated without notice.Finally with the help of a friendly dean who identifies with Buster's lovelorn state he gets a varsity position as the coxswain or coaxer as Buster calls it for Clayton's crew team which must win their big race or face elimination from the school program.There's an energetic ending like the blackface humor rather dated in which Buster must save Mary from a fate worse than death  being caught in her room with a boy. Never mind the couple's fully dressed and she's struggling to get out it's instant expulsion for her if she's caught. Here rushing to save her Buster shows off the athleticism that he has been keeping under cover for the whole film and it's a nice payoff in that you get laughs and thrills standard fare in most Keaton films though only in evidence here in the last few minutes.Like many commenters have already noted College is regarded as a lesser Keaton though its last shot is jawdroppingly memorable Keaton's unsentimental sensibilities at their stoniest. It's a good thing he used the shot for a film like College it might have spoiled one of his funnier efforts.".

	schema:reviewBody "The sophomoric 1927 Buster Keaton silent comedy College lacks the overall creativity of The General 1927 Steamboat Bill Jr. 1928 and The Cameraman 1928. Buster's gags and routines are tame compared with the three aforementioned epics. Nevertheless College isn't completely without merit. The irony for example is that the physically fit Buster plays a protagonist without any athletic ability until the villain endangers our hero's sweetheart. Like Charles Chaplin Buster exploited incongruity as the source for his comedy. College is basically your boy wants girl boy loses girl and then boy wins girl nonsense. On the sunkist slopes of the Pacific where land and water meetCalifornia reads the opening title card. Rain pelts Union High School auditorium as people huddle under newspapers and umbrellas. The opening 10 minuteplus scene depicts Buster's high school graduation day where the next step is either to go to college or go to work. Buster arrives at graduation with his mother. Although Ronald has brought an umbrella his cheap 15 suit shrinks up on him as that he looks ridiculous. This gag and his problems closing an umbrella gag are clever and cute. This is the most nontraditional graduation because nobody wears caps and gowns. They had to otherwise everybody would have looked the same and we would never have seen Buster's suit shrink. All in all this is the most thought out and calculated sequence in College.Mary Haynesthe heroinehas a memorable introduction. The male students remove several coats that they had generously allowed her to bundle up in to avoid getting drenched. She is described as the winner of every popular contest in which the boys were allowed to vote. When she receives his diploma the principal predicts that she will fit in at Clayton College as she did at Union High School. Star athlete Jeff Brown Harold Goodwin appears amid fanfare. He is described as a man who loved exercise so much that he has made many a girl walk home. When the principal hands Jeff his diploma he notes that Jeff took seven years to earn it. Lastly the principal congratulates Buster for being the most brilliant scholar. Of course everybody laughs at Buster because his suit has shrunken so much that the buttons on his vest have popped off and his sleeves have retreated virtually to his elbows. Buster alienates everybody at graduation with his antiathletic speech. As the top student he receives an honor medal. The student who wastes his time on athletics rather than study show only ignorance. His words anger Jeff and the other fellows. Future generations depend upon brains and not upon jumping the discus or hurdling the javelin. Mary Anne Cornwall criticizes Ronald. When you change your mind about athletics then I'll change my mind about you. She rides away with Jeff.Mary enters Clayton College. Neither Ronald nor his mother can afford the tuition so Ronald looks for a job so he can work his way through school. He gets a temporary job as a soda jerk clerk. He carries a picture of Mary around in his suitcase and boards in the dormitory. The soda clerk job doesn't last long because Ronald is afraid that Mary will see him in such a lowly job and ridicule him so he quits.Dean Edwards Snitz Edwards congratulates Ronald about his maturity. He praises him A boy like you can make this athlete infested college a seat of learning once more. Eventually Ronald quits his soda jerk job when Mary enters the shop. Ronald decides he wants to take a try at sports. Ronald gets on the baseball team and his idiotic antics result in his team losing. Jeff and some guys catch him walking home from the disastrous baseball game and toss him on a blanket in the air. He sails so high that he can see an old battle axe dressing through her balcony window. Infuriated she storms onto the balcony and swats at him with an umbrella. More umbrella buffoonery! He seizes the umbrella and floats up and down until he tears down a balcony and brings down the battle axe on it. Ronald tries out for track and other related athletics and again fails miserably. Pay close attention to these shenanigans because they play an important part in the conclusion. Looking for work Buster masquerades as an AfricanAmerican in a restaurant. The black paint on his face smears off when he is serving Jeff and Mary on a date. When the blacks discover that he's an imposter they run him off. Eventually the Dean summons our hero to his office and complains about Ronald's failing grades. I took up athletics because the girl I love thinks I'm a weakling Buster explains in his own defense. The Dean requests that the rowing coach make Buster the coxswain on the rowboat team. The coach however has other ideas and he slips Buster a mickey. Things don't work out for the coach and the person intended to replace Buster gulps the potion. The photography for the boat rowing race is incredibly good. One of the boats has the semiprofane name 'Damfino.' This too must have been pretty risqu for its day.Ultimately Jeff shows his true antagonistic colors when he locks Mary in her dorm room and stays with her. She warns him that his being caught in her room will mean expulsion for both of them. Jeff points out that he has been expelled already. Mary calls Ronald for help and he responds with alacrity. The last nine minutes of College portray Ronald as an entirely different kind of guy and the ending is truly odd. Again College is not topnotch Keaton but it is worth watching and the DVD is available in a Kino International print on Genius Entertainment for under a dollar in some stores.".

Even though the emotion on his face doesn't change he is still a pretty damn good actor. I bought this movie on DVD from the 99 cent store. I have seen his most famous movie The General and i must say that this movie entitled College is a lot better. Every single scene had great entertainment. Very well filmed for that time. This movie really made me see how times have changed. In the scene where he plays a black waiter is something that would never make it into a movie these days. The ending was really original. Lots of laughs and of course his physical comedy was excellent as usual.".

'College' features the exact same idea but without any of the cleverness or laughs. That is a highly unusual thing to say about a Buster Keaton film who in my opinion was the greatest silent filmmaker there was but this is easily his weakest effort Edit I've actually rated 'The Saphead' lower which was so bad I'd forgotten about it!. The film mostly consists of Buster watching a track and field athlete practice then attempting the sport himself only to fail miserably. This might have been funny if each failure had been cut back to back in a quick one minute segment but it comprises most of the film and is an utter drag. And although short Keaton is far too muscular and has performed far too many difficult stunts in the past for anyone to believe he could be a dud athlete.The only time 'College' reaches the heights of his other efforts is in the very brief ending sequence where just like an athlete he hurdles hedges long jumps streams and pole vaults into a second story bedroom in order to win the girl. That last stunt is as good as any he's done though a rarity in his career it was actually performed by someone else. I guess if there is one thing Keaton really couldn't do it was pole vault.".

This led Keaton's producer Joseph M.

The result was a lackluster picture which managed to lose more money than The General and unlike its predecessor time has not improved its reputation.As many others have noted Buster does not pull off the unathletic milquetoast character in this. He does fine when he's wearing baggy clothes and such but the moment he puts on those tight athletic outfits you can see every muscle on his body. This is bad when it comes to making the character believable but a plus as well since he's so goodlooking. Most of the story is rather repetitive Buster tries and fails to make sports teams on campus. It becomes rather dull fast. There are some good bits in between however the soda jerk scene is great and then there's the climax where Buster has to rush to save his girl from the unwanted advances of a romantic rival. The ending is the best of all one of the darkest Keaton ever made we see he and the girl go off to be wed and it seems as though they will live happily ever after. However the film does not end there we flash forward to the couple's life together raising children and growing old. In the growing old scene the couple seem rather upset with each other perhaps inferring that theirs was not a match made in heaven? The final shot is that of two tombstones followed by The End. It almost makes up for the dull sequences which have gone on before but not quite.".

Having watched it I can't really disagree with that assessment. There's plenty of good material here and the star of course but it's difficult not to compare it with Keaton's other work and somehow it doesn't really feel like a Buster Keaton feature in certain ways.The line of the story is less unified and forceful than in his other films Buster is a bookworm who goes to college and must pay his way while taking up sports to prove himself to a girl. Instead of the kind of logical sequence of events that drives The General or flight of stunningly bizarre imagination that marks Sherlock Jr College is more of an episodic series of sequences in which Buster tries out various new sports and jobs at his new school.This keeps the story from moving quickly or becoming as involving as it could be but the upside is that these are mainly handled in a very funny way with Buster showing off his seemingly innate ability to turn any setting i.e. a soda jerk's counter into a treasure chest of natural physical comedy. Probably the highlight of the film is the extended sequence where we get to see Buster have fun generating comedy from his and my favorites sport  baseball. One can see the enthusiasm as he plays third base in catcher's gear and finds a way to make three outs for his team in one play.One could believe that Buster's character here is a younger version of his sheltered professor from Speak Easily and like that later film this one is funny even if it doesn't always make full use of his particular comedy abilities and style. It feels a little more typical than most of his best comedies and doesn't feature many of the largescale and involved mechanical gag sequences that he excelled at until the thrill ending in which Keaton gets the girl. Perhaps as a contrast to the more conventional nature of the story and some of the comedy in this feature Keaton ends the film which a brilliant gag that subverts the typical Hollywood ending in just a few utterly logical and hilarious seconds.This is a good comedy and well worth a viewing for the comedy Buster Keaton brings to failure at the various sports and jobs at attempts in it but as a film it has to be said that it is less than wellstructured and dynamic.".

	schema:reviewBody "In films that combined comedy with extraordinary physical risks Buster Keaton played a brave spirit who took the universe on its own terms and gave no quarter Roger Ebert Among many silent movies which we are lucky to see these days and which have not been lost after all COLLEGE by James W. Horne and Buster Keaton was a real surprise for the audiences in my town's movie theater. Seeing silent comedies on the big screen exceptionally proves to be an uncommon experience. I think that there are hardly any viewers who may leave the cinema disappointed. Simply because the humor of COLLEGE seems to have stood a test of time combining comedy features with some notions of what a good movie entertainment is all about. What is it about? It is to amuse us to bring relief to educate a bit being at the same time not too tense. Roger Ebert in the quotations that marks the beginning of my review nicely observes that Keaton was able to execute tremendous physical abilities which makes his films interesting even today. That is particularly noticeable in COLLEGE and calls our attention throughout. His character of young Ronald who does anything to make himself attractive to Mary Anne Cornwall the girl he loves executes much of timeless humor. Combined with wit the effect is outstanding awe and laughter go in pairs and substitute each other. Who can forget the hilarious scenes on the sports field? How can you remain indifferent to his efforts? A lot of such moments when he moves like a true athlete do not allow you to concentrate elsewhere. That makes COLLEGE vibrant and surprising.Keaton's character is quite different than Charlie Chaplin's roles. He is quite a flamboyant young man who makes us laugh but ALSO makes us identify with his dilemma. Just to note what there is at the heart of his efforts to win the heart of his 'sweetheart.' Consider the scenes with his mother Florence Turner when the humor is somehow directed towards his umbrella but also supplied with a clue of such a young man's personality his dealing with the world and his dealing with simple situations. When he is in the arms of his Mary at last the moment that he reaches thanks to extraordinary pains taken it is a truly genuine moment a moment of a dream fulfilled...expressed in the face of a performer.Among the supporting cast Snitz Edwards is fabulously funny as the Dean the old bachelor who only claims to be indifferent to a woman's love. To draw a humorous conclusion COLLEGE is a light hearted entertainment which though it is silent does not let you resort to silence. Having seen it you still feel a desire to share your thoughts with other people. A gem of its time!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bookish Buster Keaton goes to college with the intention of excelling in athletics to impress his girlfriend in this somewhat lackluster late silent film. While I found the film amusing in places I don't think it stacks up well against his other more inventive features. Many other reviewers have compared this film unfavorably to one of Harold Lloyd's better features The Freshman. The comparison is apt  although sadly I wish Keaton would have followed Lloyd's lead and ended the film with a big football finish. It would have been interesting to compare Keaton's take on the sport against Lloyd's approach or that of the Marx Brothers or even MASH and The Longest Yard. The film is also hurt by Keaton's muscular build. Keaton has the body of an athlete so his utter ineptness isn't very convincing. Also Keaton looks a little long in the tooth to be a college freshman. But that might actually be accurate. People often had to work for years to raise the money for college so student bodies tended to be older. Still despite this quibbling no Keaton silent feature is without its merits. The way he makes his character achieve all of the tasks in real life that he failed to achieve in the sports arena was inventive and amusing. I also really enjoyed the odd coda that quickly stepped through Buster and Anne's life and beyond after the joyous moment of their marriage. This film isn't the best place to start a study of Keaton but it is still worth a look.".

Ronald the top scholar tries to put down sports in favor of academics in his valedictorian speech. Wow does he ruffle a few feathers even though Mary may take some of his speech to heart. As this young woman and her present beau are going to a nearby college in California Ronald convinces his mother that he can work his way through school and attend the same school. Once there though Ronald is put down for his job as a soda jerk and his lack of athletic prowess. In order to claim Mary's affections and silence the bullies Ronnie launches a brave attempt to make any and every team available from baseball to tracknfield. The results are what you might expect. Or are they? This silent classic is a keeper for the ages. Keaton is one truly funny and physical comedian. Just watch him try the discus where the metal frisbie takes off the wig of a bigwig or the high jump where he lands planted in the ground and the giggles will flow like the Mississippi. Cornwall and the other cast members are wonderful as well. Then too the novelty of reading the screen for cues and listening to the expressive music of the times makes it a mustsee. Its surprising however how little human nature changes over time as much of the story will seem to hit home for every viewer. If you are at all interested in the silent movie era this is a great place to start your journey into the beginnings of the cinematic age. Your appetite and appreciation for the times and for Keaton will grow by leaps and bounds.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Myth";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was pretty hyped up for many reasons. Jackie Chan after the relatively successful return to HK movie industry with the release of New Police Story teams up once again with Stanley Tong Rumble in the Bronx for starters. Tong wrote the story of The Myth casting Jackie Chan in a never seen before role yes audiences are tired with his cop roles already as a Qin dynasty general. What's refreshing too is that the role requires the use of a real weapon a sword in this case rather than having JC's character improvising with tools from his environment.As most would already know from the trailer and poster JC plays Jack Chan about time they come up with better names too an archaeologist who dreams about a Korean princess whom he's escorting to the Qin emperor as his new concubine. It's a recurring dream and before you can say Indiana Jones he's off to locales he sees in his dream world to try and unravel its mystery while research companion Tony Leung The Lover irks him along the way with tomb raiding in the name of scientific studies.The story while it might be original for a Jackie Chan movie seemed a little clich. It plays like a young boy's fantasy of snagging that exotic oriental princess enjoying the support of the troop masses having utmost loyalty to the king and blessed with good fighting skills topped with a signature sword. And with the Qin dynasty you're usually reduced to plots which may include the Great Wall beautiful consorts or the pill of Immortality.The Myth looks and feels like a classic JC movie in terms of production values like the familiar fightwiththebaddiesacrobaticstunts scenes and physical humour injected at certain points. However I guess with JC's age the number of fight scenes have been reduced and somewhat slowed down deliberately. The fight at the Rat Glue Factory stood out for being a combination of both brawn and injected situational humour. On the other hand The Myth signifies new developments in a typical JC storyline with the introduction of dramamama romance nothing much romantic though with being comatose in all the good bits and lots of lingering stares and a surprise? epilogue for his Qin character. And the No blood no sex unofficial clause goes out the window too.Despite its huge budget the special effects were not refined which was a pity. The blue screen effect is obvious even to the untrained eye and there were a tad too many lazy extras who in wide angled supposedly big epic fight scenes just stood danced moved around anything but fight realistically. The original Highlander perfected the art of transitioning between flashbacks and present time while The Myth falters looking seemingly forced and contrived at times or opted for the cheap way out  the blackouts.As with most JC films the women here play flower vases. But I'm not complaining. Kim Heeseon was beautiful in her role as the princess and in the blooper reel she was actually speaking Mandarin and having a hard time remembering her lines. Mallika Sherawat was sizzling as she dandied around in flimsical dresses while executing those high kicks and I guess the entire run up to the Rat Glue Factory might turn out to be a fan favourite.Many in the audience were surprised when the characters started speaking in Cantonese for settings in modern day Hong Kong and the local censors had no issue with that instead of dubbing over the lines with Mandarin. Now that's a thumbs up.So enjoy The Myth for what it is just don't expect too much from a simple predictable storyline and for some illogical and improbable scenes I can't stand the horse backkicking bits that plays out like Michelle Yeoh's The Touch or even JC's own The Medallion.".

Yes it's more serious yes it is not typical JC action. But people forget JC is not up to his stunts because of his age. Still he kicks ass like the martial artist he is. I am a Jackie Chan fan since i could watch movies 5 years old! And i have always liked his movies until he made real bad ones in Hollywood! Since his return in Hongkong you can see the improvement maybe freedom he has making this movie! The use of CGI was fitting for this kind of story.Honestly i really was moved by the story. People who love action you will get what you wantamazing stunts and the best martial arts! Also you romantic lovers will not be disappointed! I have only one point of criticism and that is the abrupt ending! But overall one of the better Jackie Chan movies made these last years.".

The plot is very tenuous and was probably written after someone wanted a story with Chinese history combined with a modern drive towards the nascent Chinese scientific and technological resurgence.Jackie Chan plays an Indiana Jones like archaeologist which spirals into a Lara Croft style adventure of finding very strange but mindbogglingly powerful things. Meanwhile a very hazy parallel story runs of a concubine who falls for a general played by Jackie Chan a few hundreds years in the past. There is antigravity devices and immortality pills thrown in as well.Though it does get really cheesy and maudlin at times it's a really fun movie to watch.".

A remote analogy of the Sphinx  part woman part beast part god  but nothing of a man in it. And this went on for what seem like an eternity both in local and Hollywood productions. Then approaching midlife Chan started to try new things  e.g. pure romance in Bo lei jun or Glass bottle 1999 and pathos in New Police story 2004.In The Myth he takes things even further by giving us both an old clowning around Jackie Chan and a new all serious Jackie Chan in two parallel stories present and ancient. Good intentions and efforts notwithstanding Chan's portrayal of a general of woeful countenance in the ancient Qin dynasty is just not convincing maybe because of things as a simple as his stature or that his face is too familiar. As a result the love story on which obvious emphasis has been placed never quite gets off the ground. What we are left with then is pretty much the old Jackie Chan flick. Still with the multi billion dollar HK budget an international cast and some pretty clever ideas as the rat glue factory scene everybody mentioned this movie IS entertaining. As well although the historical portion is not exactly a resounding success it does add another dimension to the movie.One final note  at halfcentury point Jackie Chan finally yields a bit on his resistance to wire work and CGI. While we are all proud of his steadfast determination to do all the dangerous stunts himself the laws of nature dictate that there are things that you just can't go on doing forever.".

But the other half of the film the epic historical stuff is very very cheesy even the fights which a loaded with CG for this half of the film don't spark any positive reaction and Jackie trying to play a serious melodramatic role doesn't quite cut the mustard either. However Tong uses brilliant cinematography for the old era China part of the film and I must compliment the film for some of its use of music. Overall the story doesn't hold up as being remotely plosible. But thanks to some great comedy and other funny moments that I don't think were meant to be funny the film is still enjoyable.

Judging by the sum of its parts this ought to be the greatest movie of the 21st century. In reality it's not quite so. 2 tremendously entertaining hours yes but not a perfect movie.What are the reasons? I'd like to name three. First I always see Jackie Chan with a helmet desperately trying to keep a straight face when I am supposed to see the general. He just isn't that type of guy. The dreams or historical flashbacks are therefore less convincing than the scenes from the present day. Second the whole antigravity stone thing has much too much Spielberg in it. The myth could have remained a myth in other words the audience doesn't always want a scientific explanation why things happen especially if it's as unlikely as this one. Third I think what neither worked well in this movie is the villain. From the moment he appears and does the usual I'll steal the big Blah to rule the world villain routine the rest becomes predictable. If the screenplay had dared to move along a different path it would have evoked less of the seen it before feeling. I enjoyed it but regrettably it's not without the little flaws mentioned.".

It would be easy for him to churn out countless sequels to already established series but he does try to vary his output. Well that is in as much as the constraints of his fans expectations and his established film persona will allow anyway. The Myth as a film suffers paradoxically because of these two things trying to satisfy by offering something new while fulfilling audience expectation based on Jackie's previous output. The historical side of the film works best providing Chan with a role Army General bound by honour compromised by love that is unfamiliar and more interesting largely because of that. The action is more gritty and brutal in these sequences with lots more blood on show than in typical Jackie fare. The present day character is classic Jackie though the comedic set pieces and brief fight scenes don't have quite the inventiveness or sparkle of yesteryear. You can imagine the glue factory scene in particular being more involving and exciting if it had been choreographed twenty or even ten years ago. Stanley Tong's handling of the material is due to the nature of his script very uneven. The presentation of the modern day settings is fine if a little uninspiring especially when you consider some of the film's spectacular locations. However the historical battles look and feel dull and lack any kind of epic quality. This may have been down to budget constraints but watching the film you feel that if more clever camerawork had been employed this effect could have been conveyed. Ultimately it's a pity Jackie wasn't brave enough to do a straight serious historical actiondrama because under The Myth's familiarity there's a different Jackie Chan film trying to get out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Asian movie producers have been churning out medieval swordplaymovies at high rates these last few years. Many of them of a high quality at that. So no surprise then that the demands put on the quality of those films have increased along with their numbers.This is not your average swordplaymovie. Rather this is half Herolike medieval battleromance and half Asian Indiana Joneslike present day action. Jackie Chan has a part to play in both eras and he does a reasonably good job although the presentday character seems to be more his style.I didn't enjoy this movie very much i can say that right away. For me it had several problems that overshone the entertaining aspects. First of all the split between medieval time and present day was unfortunate. Not least because they were like two completely different movies in style. While the medieval part was serious and heavy with concepts of honor and love the presentday part was more standard Jackie Chanfare. He was running around kicking and fighting while doing acrobatics all this mixed with slapstick comedy. The contrast between these two styles became too much for me to accept.The directors ambitions were what bothered me most about this whole project. It seems to me like he wanted to make something he could neither afford nor handle. He wanted to transcend the timescale and the genres and when he was done he ended up with two halves that didn't make a whole. And those halves were not that great to begin with. The special effects feel halfdone at times and some of the medieval battles look downright awful. Cutting techniques and lowgrade CGI are used to try and spice things up but it doesn't really help. Also the movie felt to me at least 30 minutes too long  a feeling that was getting stronger when in the end of the movie we lapse into a few minutes of what is basically a music video that shows flashbacks to earlier scenes...In my opinion the presentday part of this movie would have been enough. An Asian version of Indiana Jones starring Jackie Chan is a great idea to begin with and it's not a brand new one either remember Armour of God and Condor? and it would have been enough to support this film. As it is now we get short but enjoyable pieces of presentday action mingled with slow and many times dreary medieval parts. Not recommended.510".

This movie is very entertaining.For those who are a huge fans of Jackie this is a must see movie.Excellent. Touching. Funny. All important movie's aspects are inside. The fighting is good although sometimes it seem so unreal with the help of CG. His moves is still the best combined with some kind of coincidence that makes it laughable and funny. Maybe the only one who can compared with him is Jet Lee. Although Jet Lee is more serious than Jackie.This movie reminds me of the Chinese old story the famous Three Kingdom. His style of battle nearly match the great Zhao Yun combined with the fierce warrior Ma Chao in Dynasty Warrior Games. Great combination that makes the enemy's guts crush into sands. The drama is a little touching but not entirely touching. The war is absolutely fantastic and I remember one of his moves that copy the style of Achilles from The Troy. Funtastic.It's so good that after I watch this movie I want to buy the DVD for my collection. It's really worth it.Overall the movie itself is very good. Well done Jackie Chan. I would like to rate this movie from 1 to 10 910.".

This movie is very entertaining.For those who are a huge fans of Jackie this is a must see movie.Excellent. Touching. Funny. All important movie's aspects are inside. The fighting is good although sometimes it seem so unreal with the help of CG. His moves is still the best combined with some kind of coincidence that makes it laughable and funny. Maybe the only one who can compared with him is Jet Lee. Although Jet Lee is more serious than Jackie.This movie reminds me of the Chinese old story the famous Three Kingdom. His style of battle nearly match the great Zhao Yun combined with the fierce warrior Ma Chao in Dynasty Warrior Games. Great combination that makes the enemy's guts crush into sands. The drama is a little touching but not entirely touching. The war is absolutely fantastic and I remember one of his moves that copy the style of Achilles from The Troy. Funtastic.It's so good that after I watch this movie I want to buy the DVD for my collection. It's really worth it.Overall the movie itself is very good. Well done Jackie Chan. I would like to rate this movie from 1 to 10 910.";

This movie displays the serious and entertaining side of Jackie in his past life and in reality a very creative combination indeed! I love the way Stanley and Jackie pulled the different actors and actresses from different countries together which is an excellent way in attracting the people...But in my opinion The Myth is rich in the China history and mythology where the Qin Emperor's vision and dream were made a reality...thus if you want to fully understand the film knowledge about the Qin Dynasty is necessary... What I like the most is still the Jackie Chan's kungfu flicks and entertaining fighting scenes...especially in the Dasai Tomb and The Rat Glue Factory...another good one will be the fight with the Dasai Prince which switches between reality and past life...But what I do not favor much is the fighting scenes using the computer effects wirings and the fake backgrounds towards the end... The actresses in the movie is beautiful and it is worth the watch...Mallika Sherawat and Kim Hee Seong are both very attractive in their natural looks. That's what make the movie good in its own sense... But the drawbacks may be the goofs and mistakes which can be spotted by anyone i think... 1.At the first scene during the rescue of the princess the wooden carriage which was on fire is hardly seen spreading and it seems that it takes a very long time to burn down that carriage. 2.When Meng Yi were alone trying to hold on to the carriage we could see that the Korean General came from the opposite direction where he headed before. 3.When Jack was in the shower we could notice the reflection of camera at the metal shower spray. 4.After Meng Yi had beheaded his enemy his sword and the princess were not even stained with a single blood drop. 5.There was a sudden change of attires before and after Jack and William went inside the tomb. Well there are still many of them... But in overall the movie is still worth the fun and the money...".

While the script and scenes are cheesy and corny at best and the special FX badly done you can't compare it to Hollywood movies due to Hong Kong's lowbudget trying to reap big profits way of doing things.But this is indeed one of the better films this year. Great Jackie Chanstyle fighting and comedy sequences hot Asian chicks and a brief take at ancient Chinese history is what this movie offers. I'd give it a 5 but plus 2 points for Hong Kong taking an extra step on this one.".

So with The Myth you have two movies in one a modern tale and one thousands of years ago. Neither one really works. You end up with two minor love stories two plot lines that will eventually intersect but don't make much sense.Anyone expecting this to be Jackie Chan's House of Flying Daggers can forget about that. Look I am normally pretty forgiving towards Jackie Chan's films in terms of plot so let's look at the action scenes! The film opens 2000 or so years ago with a small over the top battle on horses. Pretty silly really one of those scenes where the two leads take a break in the action to stare longingly into each others eyes with the music blaring in the back ground. There is a fair bit of sword work is this and it is certainly the bloodiest Jackie Chan film I have seen.It may sound silly but personally I prefer Chan's films to be grounded in reality. When he ends up with some type of super powers like in the god awful The Tuxedo you just lose me. I do not like to see Jackie fight 100 people at once or fly through the air. He is at his best when he uses his surroundings to get the better of his enemies rather than using 'wire work' and bad CGI to get the job done. There is one classic scene in a glue factory that really got at the crowd clapping vintage Chan.But one great action scene and a one very beautiful actress do not make a great movie even with Jackie Chan.".

Anyone fascinated by the Terra cotta soldiers found in the tomb of the Qin King will enjoy this fantasy movie.This movie is real eye candy from the wonderful scenes of India and China to the lavish costumes of the Qin period of China. The Korean actress who plays the tragic concubine Li and the Indian actress that plays Samantha a beautiful Indian woman who helps Jack get away from the police also add to the beauty of this film.Jackie's getting kinda old and he seems to be a lot more serious in this film than other Jackie Chan's films. His acting is fine just that no matter what he just can't play romantic. He's very earnest as the general but it's hard to believe that he loves the concubine. The Korean actress on the other hand really make you believe that she was in love with the general. She is truly heartbreaking in the final scene of the movie.This is a fun movie that will satisfy moviegoers who likes action fantasy movies. Really worth taking a look!".

	schema:headline " kitschy fun";
	schema:reviewBody "This is probably the fastestpaced and most actionpacked of the German Edgar Wallace krimi series a cross between the Dr. Mabuse films of yore and 60's pop thrillers like Batman and the Man from UNCLE. It reintroduces the outrageous villain from an earlier film who dons a stylish monk's habit and breaks the necks of victims with the curl of a deadly whip. Set at a posh girls' school filled with lecherous middleaged professors and with the cops fondling their hottotrot secretaries at every opportunity it certainly is a throwback to those wonderfully politicallyincorrect times. There's a definite link to a later Wallacebased film the excellent giallo Whatever Happened to Solange? which also concerns female students being corrupted by and corrupting? their elders. Quite appropriate to the monk theme the mastermind villain uses boobytrapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows and also maintains a reptilereplete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences.  Alfred Vohrer was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show. The Monk appears in a raving scarlet cowl and robe tastefully setting off the lustrous white whip while appearing against purplishnight backgrounds. There's also a voyeurfriendly turquoise swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing milieu for the nubile students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes. The trademark kicker of hiding the Ende card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here. And there's a fine brassy and twangy score for retromusic fans.Fans of the series will definitely miss the flippant Eddie Arent character in these later films. Instead the chief inspector Sir John takes on the role of buffoon convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after taking a few night courses. Unfortunately Klaus Kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things. The krimis had lost some of their offbeat subversive charm by this point and now worked on a much more blatant popculture level which will make this one quite accessible to uninitiated viewers.".

Who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college? What Works The Killer. What's not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red KKK looking outfit complete with red gloves. The white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown. Although the idea of a killer in a flaming red pointyhead outfit sneaking around a girl's school is fairly farfetched it's one of the more sinister looking costumes I've seen.Groovy 60s Music. I really would like to track down the title music to The College Girl Murders. It's got a jazzy hip 60s feel to it that I just loved.Bizarre Touches. Beyond the killer's red gown and hood the movie features a sliding fireplace a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead poison spraying bibles a strategically placed mannequin miniskirts gogo boots and mile high hair. I would describe it as a cross between the 60s Batman TV show and an Italian giallo. The College Girl Murders is a real treat for the eye.The End. Let's just say that there are more twists than a mountain road. Just when you think the killer has been uncovered here comes a twist..and another.and anotherand another.What Doesn't Work Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the guy was meant to be comic relief but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time.Why Have Alligators? Previously I mentioned the alligators in the pit. And while they are a nice touch they serve very little purpose. Why go through all the trouble and not use them? Plodding Plot. Some of The College Girl Murders has no flow or rhythm to it. There are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt. Better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable movie.I haven't seen many of these German krimis but of the few I have seen Phantom of Soho Strangler of Blackmoor Castle Dead Eyes of London this may be my favorite. This one has a real funky feel to it that I really go into. Had the plot flowed a little better I could have easily given The College Girl Murders a 710.".

The delightfully ludicrous plot has a mad scientist who has invented a poisonous spray which he conceals in Bibles in order to kill people who open them. In order to deliver boobytrapped Bibles for some reason he needs the help of convicts who he sneaks out out of a nearby prison. As the title suggests the victims are all girls at a nearby collegea very strange college I might add where all the students look like voluptuous European fashion models and all the male professors perhaps understandablyare lecherous perverts trying to get a leg over. Then there's the monk did I mention the monk? in a red robe going around breaking various people's necks with a bullwhip.Obviously the plot is ridiculous but it's also a whole lot of fun. And wait until the final revelation where the identity of the hooded monk is revealed and the preposterous motive for the murders is given like the Italian gialli Seven Bloodstained Orchids also based on a Wallace novel the villain is willing to kill a ridiculous number of innocent people and go through ludicrous Rube Goldburg machinations just to get at his one intended victim.

The inspectors at Scotland Yard HigginsIJoachim Fuchsbergerand his superior Sir JohnSiegfried Schrenbergcertainly have their hands full with this case. It all seems to center around student Ann PortlandUschi Glas who when she turns 21 is to inherit a great deal of wealth. The girls who are targeted share a room with Ann but the reason for their murders remains a mystery SY's finest must figure out. The staff of the girls' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. Two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. It's a clever scheme where a driver GreavesGnter Meisnermeets the convicts..who hide in a barrelwho are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. Taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind he gives them orders on who to kill and how. Uncovering this operation is a top priority for Higgins and Sir John for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. Under suspicion are girls' dormitory headmistress her author brother a sweaty incredibly nervous chemistry teacher a snooping gardener and the Bannister. Some are red herrings until they are disposed of throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. The ending features multiple twists. Out of the Krimi films I've seen THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects  sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. I think you can also see the influence of James Bond on this particular Krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit..which isn't used the fake biblewater pistol when opened fires the gas into the face of startled victims the Greaves' Royles Royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming. Many might consider Sir John a liability due to his bumbling buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines Higgins' abilities to get at the truth..perhaps poking fun at knowitall British inspectors who harm a case more than solve it..I felt he was used as comedy relief particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims often misunderstanding what are told to him. Higgins using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator instead follows the cluesfacts often avoiding Sir John as much as possible. Capable direction by the reliable Alfred Vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content..the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls' executions. I'd say this may be one of the best..if not the bestexamples of the Krimi genre for it keeps you guessing always one more ace up it's sleeve..the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eyeopening..and you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off.".

There's some James Bond type of evil mastermind  who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor  recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison. There's also a villainous monk with a whip dressed like a communist KKK member getting rid of the leftover characters like overly curious teachers and such as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach. Seriously if I had known sooner that these Krimi films were so colorful and crazy I would have purchased a whole collection of them already. The pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow but I don't care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a variant on the Italian Giallo but with slapstick elements.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm still new to the Krimi genre and the only one I've seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing 'The Dead Eyes of London' which didn't exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me. If I'd seen this one first however the feeling would have been different as while The College Girl Murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick it's great fun to watch and it's really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style. The film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack. This poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison and then has them put back in jail. As the title suggests it's a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims. There's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip.Of course with a plot like that this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongueincheek vibe to the film which does bode well with the plot. The fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly although this isn't a big problem as things are kept ticking over nicely throughout the film and there's always enough going on to keep the audience interested. The atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at. Of course the film is based on an Edgar Wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination the locations used are also superb and while a killer's lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot it does help to give the film that extra 'something'. You cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax. Overall College Girl Murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended!".

Of course the film is based on an Edgar Wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination the locations used are also superb and while a killer's lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot it does help to give the film that extra 'something'. You cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax. Overall College Girl Murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended!";

	schema:reviewBody "Der Mnch mit der Peitsche is another German movie made in the late 1960s that was based on the crime novels of author Edgar Wallace. these were fairly famous back then. The director is Alfred Vohrer who made several of these and the cast also includes a couple familiar names. Uschi Glas and Joachim Fuchsberger for example showed up in several of these Edgar Wallace films especially Fuchsberger. And bother are also actors that are still very wellknown in Germany today. Also Grit Boettcher may still be a name to some. The title here says already who this film is about as usual they included the main antagonist and this time it is a murderous monk with a whip. I must say that he did look pretty ridiculous when we saw him and I cannot say I was scared but this is nothing new for these German Wallace movies as they usual includes a handful of comedy sometimes more obvious sometimes more subtle. Unfortunately the story here is not really that good. There were okay moments but there were also some pretty weak moments that did not make sense in the grand scheme of things such as the detective dressing up as the evil monk himself to provoke him with no references if he was even near or why he would care. Yeah overall I am glad this was fairly short. These films rarely make it to the 90minute mark some even stay under 85. I give this one here a thumbs down. Not recommended.".

It has silly weapons a gun that sprays gas a bible that kills a stupid evil criminal plot people who do silly and unlikely things in general silly James Bond like villains that live in a lair with crocodiles and other sea animals surrounding the villain who sits with his back to the camera in a chair and who we can only hear speak. This really seems like the German answer to James Bond's growing popularity. But luckily the movie also doesn't take itself very serious. It has fun almost quirky like characters and some good comic relief as well from time to time.The movie is being based on a Edgar Wallace novel that were quite popular not in the very least because Edgar Wallace was also the author of King Kong. A whole series of movies got made of his books. The books were actually a lot older than the movies so it's hard to say how much of the silliness actually comes from the books themselves. Probably very little and the books in essence were mostly being serious crimethrillers with always a mysterious villain that inspector Higgins had to unmask.The movie is just basically a whole lot of fun. The villains the silly plot all of the other characters it's funky '60's style and atmosphere all make this a very likable movie. This really is the movie its strongest point since if you have to look at this movie deeper and more serious you really can't call this movie a good one at all. The story and storytelling is far from likely or well done so overall you can really call this movie a bad one if you look at it very strictly.

Seeing it with contemporary eyes and ears it is easy to forget that sound film was then still new and in its infancy and yet Otsep and Karol Rathaus given his first opportunity to compose for a film immediately grasped the fundamental potential music could play in propelling dramatic narrative. To his eternal credit the late great Bernard Herrmann in a published interview cited this film as the one he most admired for its creative use of a musical score.The frantic coach ride when Karamazov pursues Grushenka when she has abandoned him must rank even today as one of the most dynamic scenes in world cinema. With its rapid cross cutting and editing allied with Rathaus' incredible score which uses frantic drumming Chinese blocks and assorted percussion instruments it perfectly conveys the desperation and mad love we are confronted with and although probably only lasting less than a minute in screen time leaves one stunned and breathless with excitement.Then when Karamazov arrives at the bordello to which Grushenka has fled can you believe in a film shot in 1930 when sound cameras weighed a ton Otsep introduces an uninterrupted tracking shot as Karmazov wanders from room to room trailed and proceeded by the camera in real time as he seeks to find her which is every bit as dynamic and fascinating as the opening shot of A Touch of Evil'?I am convinced that Orson Welles had already seen this film before setting out to make Citizen Kane' since so many of the innovations in that for which he was hailed actually first appeared in Otsep's film. It is a perfect marriage of silent film montage and editing with all the new potential that sound unleashed fully realised and Otsep combines the two with incredible skill and mastery.Full of atmosphere and a Slavonic expressionistic fatalism it is in many ways much more of a Russian' film than a German one it is interesting to note that a French speaking version was simultaneously filmed alongside this. Although there is a slight narrative blurring and overlap between Dostoyevsky's Karamazov' and Tolstoy's Resurrection' both often filmed in any case this does at least provide the ending of the film with a slight modicum of hope.Set within baroque interiors which hardly ever leave any surface uncovered unpatterned or not seducing the eye to gain its attention and contrasted with bleak and hostile exteriors the inner and outer worlds of human experience are constantly juxtaposed and shown to be in perpetual conflict. If only modern filmmakers would study and learn from the sheer economy of space and time used in pre50s cinema!As befits writers of the calibre of Dostoyevsky and perhaps even more so the borrowing from Tolstoy a wild anarchic spirit animates the characters as they act out their fatalistic drama the amour fou that Otsep was later to explore in Amok' but all through and in part heightened by Rathaus' music there is a fearful melancholy that pervades it all a sense of impending doom. These are what we would today call dysfunctional characters but they are imprisoned in the manners and mores of their time trying to claw some small space in which they can be free but in their innermost heart of hearts knowing that it is unlikely to be.When Grushenka decides to join Karamazov in his exile in Siberia the train which takes them away that constant and valuable cinematic metaphor of inevitability and mechanistic fatalism and with hindsight so similar to the transportations used by the Nazis ten years later is seen vanishing into oblivion with the camera astride the track against which backdrop Rathaus added a musical chord sequence that borders on heartbreak poignancy and pain.A masterpiece of world cinema that must one day be rediscovered and given its rightful respect and critical admiration.A sinister footnote should perhaps mention that outofcontext sequences from this film were strung together as part of the Nazi antiSemitic film Der Ewige Jude' together with scenes similarly lifted from Fritz Lang's M' to illustrate what were termed degenerate Jewish influences in German cinema'. It is fortunate that Otsep and his wife were able to leave Paris where they were then living just days before the Germans arrived during WW2 since they immediately closed all cinemas and then after a week or so allowed a few to reopen which were forced to show Der Ewige Jude'. Unfortunately Otsep's career was never able to recover and find the opportunities through which to reestablish himself as a master film craftsman in the USA and he died in 1949.".

Even if this movie is already 85 years old it is still far from the very early works of scary German cinema. A duo of writers and directors made this namely Erich Engels and Fyodor Otsep and it is among their more known works. This also has to do with Fyodor Dostoevsky a really famous writer being the one who wrote the base material and he was only half a century dead when this film came out. The movie runs for approximately 90 minutes so it is not among the shortest or longest from the era. I personally would say that I have seen better and worse films from the 1930s and from Germany around that era but it shows that there were all kinds of movies as this one here is something entirely different compared to the mountain films for example. All in all I give it a thumbs down.".

	schema:headline " Anna Sten Shows Why Goldwyn Had Faith in Her!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Before she became known as Goldwyn's Folly Anna Sten was one of Europe's brightest stars. Starting out in Russia she was soon sent to Berlin because of the city's superior equipment and studios. She specialized in musicals but of course cherished an ambition to play Gruschenka in The Brothers Karamazov a role that may have remained a dream if it wasn't for her mentor and husband Dr. Eugene Frenke. He was captivated by her and devoted himself to furthering her career. He ended up producing the film himself and surrounding her with a stellar cast which guaranteed the film's great public success and got Anna a contract with U.F.A.The title is Der Morder Dimitri Karamasoff  after motives by Dostoyevsky so it has taken only one theme from Dostoyevsky's mammoth novel. Fritz Kortner gives a superb performance as the tormented Alexis as well as directing it in fact this was his last German film before he fled to Britain to escape Nazi persecution.Alexis desperately needs the 2000 rubles of his mother's legacy to marry the frigid Katya  but his father is anxious to marry Gruschenka the town slut so is reluctant to advance the money. Alexis visits her to persuade her to stop his father making a fool of himself but her beauty mesmerizes him and her taunts about the pious Katya whip him into a frenzy. Anna Sten is just a stunning Gruschenka just luminous and you can understand why Goldwyn thought she could be his next big star. There is even a song sequence to highlight Sten's musical ability.Just as important are the stunning visuals featuring striking camera angles drops of dew on a leafless tree Alexis bathes his face after a night of passion and scenes played out in different mirrors. Alexis has been going to the dogs in his lust for Gruschenka and his father writes to Katya to come and use her influence to put him on the straight and narrow. She comes but goes thinking Alexis will meet her at the station but his life has taken a turn for the worse  he is involved in his father's death and joins Gruschenka in an abandoned orgy. The rest of the film all 15 minutes of it is taken up with the trial and the ramifications.Fritz Rasp who had featured in The Diary of a Lost Girl was the sinister servant Smerdjakoff the holy fool. Even though the film lacked the interweaving plot lines of the novel it made up for it in it's artistry and atmosphere.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:headline " solid entry in Jerry Cotton germancrime series w George Nader";
	schema:reviewBody "My Englishlanguage print of this film is called BODY IN CENTRAL PARK. This comes midway in the German Jerry Cotton crime series starring George Nader and it delivers the action and style one expects from the series. The plot revolves around rich businessman being blackmailed and threatened with the murder of their children. For a German crime film the plot is relatively easy to follow and the film is not as stylized as the earlier BW entries in the series nor as convoluted as some of the later ones. While the Cotton series is often compared with James Bond I really don't see much similarity besides the fact that both men are government agents. The series especially the early entries seems more like an attempt to extend the early 60s German Edgar Wallace mysteries into imitationAmerican hardboiled crime films. Eddie Constantine's Lemmy Caution crime films which predate Dr. No and James Bond seem much more Bondlike than Jerry Cotton who could have been the hero of a 1950s US crime series except for the 1960s modern settings of the films. Peter Thomas' musical score is relatively understated for him at least! here and Nader is as convincing as ever as the tough stylish FBI man Cotton. If you have already seen some of this series you'll want to see this one although it's not the best. If you are not familiar with the series any of the earlier onesincluding this onewould be a good introduction to one of the best series of crime films of the 1960s. I'm hoping English language versions of these will eventually find their way onto DVDperhaps in double bills! While Mr. Nader is no longer with us perhaps some of the German castcrew can do commentary tracks.".

	schema:reviewBody "You will never change your political opponents' minds by arguing with them but what if you have sex with them? Baya Benmahmoud Sara Forestier lives her life by this mantra. She is an ultraleftwing idealist who sleeps with right wing fascists to convert them politically. She even keeps a scrapbook of her successful conversions most of them are now some sort of shepherd. While listening to birdflu expert Arthur Martin Jacques Gamblin in a radio station one day Baya bursts through the studio's door and argues with him on the air that if you can't trust ducks then what is this world coming to? This is a very amusing argument and also makes for a humorous lead character introduction.Any other film such as an American one would construct Arthur as a rock solid conservative and make it Baya's quest to convert him. Ah but this is an intelligent French film. Arthur is a socialist and while not nearly as leftwing as Baya he proudly states he voted for Lionel Jospin. A warning if you do not know who Lionel Jospin is you will miss an amazing and funny scene. The Names of Love takes a sharp turn from where the film was leading the audience. It is not a romantic comedy well not all the way. Much screen time is devoted to Baya and Arthur's respective families and to what extent they identify themselves as French citizens.Baya's father is from Algeria and vividly remembers the French Army shooting many of his relatives in the war. Her mother is a hippie who thinks everything nonFrench is fascinating which is why she marries a man with the last name Benmahmoud. Arthur's folks at first appear to be the exact opposite of the first couple and are shown boring and set in their specific way of life. However there is a lingering secret past with Arthur's mother which is not necessarily hidden from view but takes on more of a role as the film progresses.The Names of Love starts out at a fast clip with both leading characters taking their turns talking directly into the camera about their youths and where they imagine themselves on the political spectrum. After a half hour or so this starts to taper off and a more somber and contemplative mood takes over what was almost a comedic farce. Arthur and Baya are shown interacting with each other's unfamiliar cultures and testing their respective boundaries. The script is whip smart and expects a lot from its audience especially from its nonFrench audience. I give a high mark to how intelligent and probing this film is but be wary of the shift from light comedy to more serious introspection.".

She is an ultraleftwing idealist who sleeps with right wing fascists to convert them politically. She even keeps a scrapbook of her successful conversions most of them are now some sort of shepherd.

Within the first fifteen minutes of the film the theater was resounding with loud bursts of laughter from the audience. That continued throughout the course of the film. Frequently French comedies can be very intelligent enjoyable and well worth seeing. But they are rarely at least since the days of Jacques Tati' laugh out loud funny. I am very frustrated by the fact that at least to my knowledge there has not been a major release of this film in the movie theaters in the Los Angeles area. I would love to be able to share this delightful film with family and friends! I have been able to locate very few reviews of the film by media film critics. While virtually all of these reviews have been very positive some have tended to pigeonhole the film as being a satire of some of the more esoteric components of French culture and society and therefore not likely to be of interest to filmgoers who are not especially knowledgeable or interested in a comedy focused on such a theme.This could not be further from the truth! The reality is that the film works wonderfully on its own terms and that to thoroughly enjoy it one need not be particularly conversant in the intricacies or peculiarities of French culture. I am praying that at the very least the film is released in a home video format with English language subtitles. Then at least purveyors of fine foreign films would get the opportunity to see and enjoy it.! And I would not be deprived of the vast pleasure of sharing it with friends who enjoy high quality films!Update Very good news! Subsequent to the writing of this review both the Sunday LA Times and the Sunday New York Times published special editions of their summer movie sneaks ie films to be released this summerand both indicated that The Names of Love would be playing in theaters commencing around the end of Junebeginning of July.

Indeed Arthur is a conservative clinical repressed individual whose life was shaped by his upbringing Sara is a volatile emotional leftist whose life was equally shaped by her upbringing. Their parents lives are culturally polar Jewish and Muslim but share similar struggle and so Arthur and Sara find that to be their common bond in addition to their most satisfying sexual relationship. I just wanted to take a bite out of Sara but in a very good way I found Arthur very sympathetic.There was a passage in the film that sort of explained the scientific expression 'hybrid vigor' I found this to be particularly fascinating and of course I subscribe to it wholeheartedly. Sara liberates Arthur from his repression and he provides her with the real affection she was always deserving of a romantic comedy movie could hardly do better.Too often comedy is mistaken for hilarious premise or funny storytelling comedy is roughly defined though as a drama with light and amusing characters typically with a happy ending and we tend to forget this. It's one reason so many movies are categorized as romantic comedies. I rather like the genre and believe it lends itself to a more fulfilling experience than action movies or thrillers which tend to be judge more rigorously. Don't get me wrong I need my fix of those as well. If you like foreign non Hollywood films you should love this one if on the other hand you haven't yet realized such a variety enriches you moviegoing experience try.

	schema:reviewBody "I must have watched a French comedy and put the titles of all the films previewed on my Netflix list because they keep coming. Bienvenue! This 2010 film from France is the latesta pleasant farce directed by Michel Leclerc and written by him and Baya Kasmi. It won three Csar Awards in 2011 including for best writing. The story is about a young woman who uses sex as a weapon to persuade conservative politiciansmen whom she considers rightwing in generalto embrace more liberal attitudes. From this comes some satirical moments too touching on the impermanence of supposed firmly held beliefs and the pitfalls of stereotyping ethnic and religious groups based simply on how they look or what their names are. HalfAlgerian the young woman's name is Baya Benmahmoudand she says no one in France has that name. But she tackles one person too many when she confronts Arthur Martin15207 people in France have the same name he tells usa middleaged scientist who does necropsies on dead birds in order to detect possible human illnesses. Why are you scaring people? she demands to know at their first confrontational meeting. The free spirit and the buttonedup scientist are of course destined to fall for each other.

	onyx:emotionText "I must have watched a French comedy and put the titles of all the films previewed on my Netflix list because they keep coming. Bienvenue! This 2010 film from France is the latesta pleasant farce directed by Michel Leclerc and written by him and Baya Kasmi. It won three Csar Awards in 2011 including for best writing. The story is about a young woman who uses sex as a weapon to persuade conservative politiciansmen whom she considers rightwing in generalto embrace more liberal attitudes. From this comes some satirical moments too touching on the impermanence of supposed firmly held beliefs and the pitfalls of stereotyping ethnic and religious groups based simply on how they look or what their names are. HalfAlgerian the young woman's name is Baya Benmahmoudand she says no one in France has that name. But she tackles one person too many when she confronts Arthur Martin15207 people in France have the same name he tells usa middleaged scientist who does necropsies on dead birds in order to detect possible human illnesses. Why are you scaring people? she demands to know at their first confrontational meeting. The free spirit and the buttonedup scientist are of course destined to fall for each other.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie literally to get out of the intense heat a couple of nights ago not expecting or even knowing that much about it and that's prob the best way to approach it. Its a very nice and deceptively light french film about the ridiculousness of people's beliefs and the ridiculousness that other people will go to to change these beliefs. Film wants to and very much succeeds in wanting to merge people's personal beliefs with their political ones but in a way that is both light and sweet and funny without being either too maudlin and sad or too lightweight.Film features a radical liberal who knowing that talk will never get anyone to change their minds prefers to let her body do the talking for her. she engages in intercourse to get other people to change their mindsjust how she does it is explained in the film although its a fair question as to whether or not it would actually work in real life or not.One day she hears this uptight doctor on the phone and decides to seduce himnot knowing that he brings his own rather heavy baggage with him in the form of family history parental beliefs informing his own beliefs and just about everything you can imagine really. She in turn brings her own baggage fam history parental beliefs and also current relationship with parentsbut she never doubts her own abilities to change anyone's minds for a second.Needless to say they fall for one another and an attachment gets made and now the 2 of them have to overcome a lot to make it work if they're gonna make it work at all. This is not a spoiler to say that this is what happensbecause the bulk of the movie is the 2 leads trying to get their stuff in tune with one another so that they can continue to more or less lead the lives they were living just with each other instead of without.Its not an easy tone to pull off given the balance that is needed to offset real world beliefs with the warmth and heart needed to make a successful romantic comedy but this one managed to do it more so then any recent film i can recall seeing which is damn impressive. Its actually quite Woody Allenish in some way which is even more impressive as most who try to copy Allen can't quite get the heart part right. Much like some of Woody Allen's films this film even brings in some really heavy duty topics with an amazingly light touch. Things like the holocaust the war of Algerian independence and modern day conservatism vs modern day liberalism all manage to get touched upon and discussed but never in a way that's heavy handed or brings the movie to a halt. Film always amazingly manages to maintain a lightness of touch and this is in no small part because of the very zesty and very lively performance of Sara Forstier in the lead role. She is like Sophia Loren in some of her more lively performances one who clearly loves life and one who doesn't really care or need other people to tell her how she should live it and its one that should her career take offit'll be this role that people look back on 10 20 years from now and say Viva La France!".

I wasn't expecting much from this film as I'm not really fond of romantic comedies most of them nowadays are terrible and full of cheesy clichd and nonsensical stuff. This film however was a blow of fresh air to me it completely blew my mind with its originality.The photography and the camerawork are really amazing they help to contemplate things much better and the plot is not the clichd romantic plot you would expect maybe in some parts it is but for the most part is really innovative at least in my opinion. I for one liked the short scene and sequence where the main characters of the story are sitting on a bench and then the camera moves onto a nearer bench where they appear again but this time as kids. Then the camera goes back to the other bench where they are grown up again and then one more time moves onto the bench that represents them as kids. That was really an amazing sequence showing their actual selves on one side and their past selves on the other.As to the acting they are very well executed. The revelation here would be actress Sara Forestier what a great actress and beautiful woman she is she delivers a really convincing acting. Maybe that was a little bit biased on account of her nudity in this film but she still is a great actress nevertheless. I would actually compare this kind of filmmaking with that of Amelie's. They are very different movies though but it is the closest style of filmmaking I can compare it with.Finally It is appropriate to say that this film is not for everyone it is a really different kind of filmmaking. Although if you're looking for something fresh you should give this a try you won't be disappointed.My Score 9.110".

His family members were killed by the military. Baya's mother is a hippie from an upper class French family. She was happy to lose her name and gain an Arab name. Arthur's family represses their haunted history while Baya's family is boisterous and political. She was sexually molested by a neighbor as a child and is very sexually liberated as an adult. On the other hand he's very repressed. She uses sex to convert 'fascists' to her politics. Despite being a socialist he catches her eye and they become an odd pairing as she continues to try to convert 'fascists' from all sides.Normally I have difficulties with French comedies. It may be the cultural barrier or it may simply be reading the subtitles. There is something distancing about having to read a joke rather than have it performed. Sara Forestier is able to break through with her expressiveness. She is enchanting sexy and magnetic. Jacques Gamblin also has a great deal of charm. His expressions are the perfect foil for her. They work brilliantly together. There are real big laughs in this and that is rare for me with foreign language verbal jokes. Physical humor is without borders but written jokes have a harder time crossing those borders. It's also a great romance. His support for her father is pure romanticism. This is a great unconventional romcom.".

	schema:headline " The universality of the republican lifestyle";
	schema:reviewBody "There is something doubleedged about Le nom des gens. The film glorifies a cosmopolitan attitude but its narrative is also typically French. In fact the universality of the republican lifestyle is more or less the heritage of the French Revolution. Whereas Anglosaxon republicans accept a pluralist society the French are suspicious that pluralism will weaken their state. In Le nom des gens the cultural diversity of the main characters is enormous. There are Muslims and Jews bourgeois and parochial persons. However they all try desperately to ignore their own cultural origins. Muslims marry bourgeois and Jews. They eat drink and do everything that God forbade. Etcetera. As the events unfold it becomes clear that the suppression of their past eventually affects their mental wellbeing. Time is adamant the very first insect. This leads to several moving scenes in particular for the Jewish woman who as a child witnessed the holocaust. And there is the tragedy of the Algerian Muslim who witnessed the colonial war. The main characters stem from the militant leftwing community which in France after the Revolution has always been quite sizable. Rightwing persons and nationalists only enter as targets for a Muslim woman who tries to convert them by having sexual intercourse. She searches for love companionship and sympathy preferably at three different addresses. Her father feels ashamed Are there not enough Muslims in town? joke. Although the mental problems of the characters are overwhelming in general the film manages to keep a light tone. Many of the events are ironic. And the love story is dynamite take a flea out to diner. In addition you have to be openminded and for instance accept that a normal woman leaves her house without noticing that she forgot to get dressed. Put women's libbers behind bras. For some reason Lionel Jospin say the French Al Gore who managed to come third in the presidential elections even behind the nationalist candidate also plays a minor role. Overall Le nom des gens can be recommended. However it is wise to buy a version with at least French subtitles. Don't hesitate to leave a comment. I love it.".

I know it sounds like a bizarre combination but once you see the film you will understand and appreciate the pleasure of it. It's quite an achievement that the filmmakers were able to maintain the hilarity and high level of political discourse all the way through while adding poignant elements to the story as well. Bravo to all involved I was quite impressed.The only other film I can think of that can be compared to this is the Billy Wilder film One Two Three that's set in Berlin during the Cold War and has a capitalist and a communist falling in love with the help of the girl's reluctant guardian a Coca Cola executive who pretends the communist is the son of an Old World aristocrat so the girl's parents don't freak out.But the Wilder film is more of a broad farce and doesn't have any poignancy to it.

She is easily distracted to the point of going into the Paris metro completely naked and not realizing it until a Muslim man sitting opposite her is clearly shocked by her nakedness.Les nom des gens directed and cowritten by Michel Leclerc and Baya Kasmi is a different film from France with strong political as well as romantic ideas. We saw it when it first opened commercially at the Sunshine and on second viewing we found it even better than the first time. M.

It is a film that fires theories and ideas in rapid fashion something that works well within the context of what the director was looking for.The best thing in the film is Sarah Forestier whose take on Baya is disarmingly frank. One can only think about how difficult it must have been for this actress to do some of the things the screenplay demanded of her. It might have been embarrassing as well for her to follow what was expected of her. No wonder she was given the precious Cesar for best actress. It is a bold approach to acting something quite unique. Ms. Forestier gives one of the most courageous renditions for an actress in recent memory.Jacques Gamblin on the other hand plays the more quieter Arthur with good sense of what was wanted of him.

	schema:headline " Shipshape comedy on a grand scale and flawlessly executed";
	schema:reviewBody "Fred Gabourie affectionately known as Gabe was Buster Keaton's hardworking art director responsible for sets props and special effectsquite a job when working for a boss so devoted to scale and authenticity. Gabe's first assignment was a 1922 short comedy called The Boat and he had endless difficulties with the little craft of the title. According to biographer Rudi Blesh he vowed to to supply his boss with a real boat someday. Two years later Gabe chanced to discover the S.S. Buford an ocean liner on her way to the scrapheap. He alerted Keaton who jumped at the chance to rent the ship. Then he and his creative team sat down to build a story around their new prop.What they came up with was beautifully simple a rich young man and the girl he wants to marry are stranded on an ocean liner which is adrift on the open ocean without power or crew. That's it. They have to learn how to surviveneither has ever made a cup of coffee beforeand then cope with damage to the ship and an attack by cannibal islanders. It is unfortunately necessary to set up a reason for this situation and the solution an anarchist plot combined with a mixup on the docks is implausible and marred by hammy acting by the plotterswhich Buster blamed on his codirector Donald Crisp whom he'd hired for his dramatic skills. To his dismay Crisp wanted to meddle with the comedy and Keaton regretted hiring him. The scenes introducing Buster's character Rollo Treadway are charming. Rollo is sedated by his wealth docile and helpless. To get to the house across the street where his girl Kathryn McGuire lives he climbs into his chauffeured car and the vehicle makes a Uturn. After the girl has rejected his proposal he tells his chauffeur that a long walk will do him good then toddles back across the street. Once the liner renamed the S.S. Navigator for the film is adrift in the Pacific boy and girl both think they are alone on the ship. The scene in which they suspect each other's presence and race around the decks always just missing each other is a marvel of choreography timing and spatial sophistication. The ship itself is the film's third major character. Cast and crew lived happily aboard the Buford during filming. The long white corridors and the maze of decks and stairs resemble an M.C. Escher drawing and the boilers funnels and other nautical machinery provide both a handsome backdrop and raw material for Keaton's favorite kind of mechanical humor.Once they meet the two socialites attempt to cook breakfast in the ship's galley kitchen using massive pots and utensils. Watch for Buster's priceless reaction on tasting the coffee made by the girl with three unground beans and seawater. Kathryn McGuire who also appeared in Keaton's previous film Sherlock Jr. is more comedy partner than love interest and she makes an excellent foil with her endearing gawkiness straightfaced style and willingness to be the butt of a joke. The clueless seafarers don sailor suits but they have many difficulties finding a secure place to sleep on the eerie vessel. Finally despairing of rest they decide to play cards in a tight closeup of his hands Buster shuffles a wet deck of cards that turn to mush in his nimble oblivious fingers. This small moment is a gem of pure physical comedy.No sooner have our heroes gotten everything shipshapefilling the kitchen with patented Keaton contraptions to grind coffee open cans and boil eggsthan the ship runs aground and Buster has to put on a diving suit to mend the damage. The underwater sequence was a nightmare to film. Rejecting studio tanks because he wanted to use a fullsize mockup of the ship's propeller Keaton wound up filming at the bottom of Lake Tahoe where the glassclear water was so cold that he and the cameramen could only stay down for short periods of time. None of the difficulties are visible in the zany slowmotion gags of his sequence as Buster uses a lobster to clip wires grabs a swordfish to fence with another swordfish washes and dries his hands underwater. Buster's subtly expressive acting while encumbered in the huge diving suit is a marvel. The grand finale of the film is an invasion of the boat by cannibal hordes in all the swirl of crowds the highlight is Buster's encounter with a tiny toy cannon that chases him around the deck.Compared to Keaton's other masterpieces The Navigator is richer in gags and weaker in drama. If it has a flaw it's that it lacks the warm heart found in The General or Our Hospitality the sweet and soulful quality that marks Buster at his very best. But I wouldn't argue with the audience member I overheard coming out of a recent screening of The Navigator who said That's as close to perfect as anything needs to be.".

This small moment is a gem of pure physical comedy.No sooner have our heroes gotten everything shipshapefilling the kitchen with patented Keaton contraptions to grind coffee open cans and boil eggsthan the ship runs aground and Buster has to put on a diving suit to mend the damage. The underwater sequence was a nightmare to film. Rejecting studio tanks because he wanted to use a fullsize mockup of the ship's propeller Keaton wound up filming at the bottom of Lake Tahoe where the glassclear water was so cold that he and the cameramen could only stay down for short periods of time. None of the difficulties are visible in the zany slowmotion gags of his sequence as Buster uses a lobster to clip wires grabs a swordfish to fence with another swordfish washes and dries his hands underwater. Buster's subtly expressive acting while encumbered in the huge diving suit is a marvel. The grand finale of the film is an invasion of the boat by cannibal hordes in all the swirl of crowds the highlight is Buster's encounter with a tiny toy cannon that chases him around the deck.Compared to Keaton's other masterpieces The Navigator is richer in gags and weaker in drama. If it has a flaw it's that it lacks the warm heart found in The General or Our Hospitality the sweet and soulful quality that marks Buster at his very best. But I wouldn't argue with the audience member I overheard coming out of a recent screening of The Navigator who said That's as close to perfect as anything needs to be.";

It is held up by some slowmoving scenes which are not as funny as they try to be.  Although the sequence of events which result in the stranding of the couple upon the sea are highly improbable they were wellexecuted and the humorous possibilities to be explored make that easy to overlook.  Most of the attempted humor pays off but somehow the movie drags a bit.  I especially found the underwater scene to be too long and was an anchor to the movie's momentum.  However it did lead to some very humorous moments when Keaton made it ashore.  Keaton's trip back to the ship from the island may have inspired the scene in Woody Allen's Sleeper in which Allen and Diane Keaton escaped from the futuristic police by using an inflatable suit to float across a lake.  Whatever one's opinion of the bulk of The Navigator the ending is unquestionably inspired.  This is a great example of Keaton pulling a rabbit out of a hat to the surprise of the audience.  It's a great audience pleaser.  I would not recommend this movie as an introduction to Buster Keaton but if you're already a fan then you have to see it.".

The idea for the film emerged when Keaton heard of the imminent scrapping of the SS Buford a former army troop transport ship turned passenger liner. Seizing the opportunity the comedy star purchased the ship cheaply and built an original story around this mammoth film prop. Directed by Keaton and Donald Crisp 'The Navigator' was released in the same year that produced his legendary 'Sherlock Jr.' and these two pictures mark the only occasions on which Keaton costarred with Kathryn McGuire. The two actors are virtually alone for much of this film barring a multitude of native cannibals but they carry the film well with an assortment of clever and impeccablytimed gags.Rollo Treadway Keaton is a rich and arrogant young man who suddenly decides to marry his sweetheart Betsy O'Brien Kathryn McGuire. Crippled by her immediate negative response of certainly not! Treadway embarks on the honeymoon by himself but awakes the following morning to find that the passenger ship he boarded is empty and drifting aimlessly across the ocean. However via a series of sinister events it seems that Betsy has also stumbled aboard the doomed ship and she and Treadway must work together if they are to survive. There are many moments in the film that will have you chuckling the two hapless fools trying to concoct a suitable breakfast especially Keaton attacking a tin of ham with a meat cleaver their efforts to find a safe and comfortable place to sleep the pair's encounter with a village of tropical island cannibals and Keaton's underwater fencing joust with a swordfish.'The Navigator' is perhaps missing many of the mindblowing stunts that make Buster Keaton's films so memorable but there certainly are a few good ones in there. Perhaps unusually the most hairraising stunts are performed by the extras playing the cannibals their leader portrayed by the prolific AfricanAmerican actor Noble Johnson. The moment that springs immediately to mind was the collapse of an immense palm tree onto one of the tiny dugout canoes. Though the cannibal who gets crushed by the trunk is obviously a dummy albeit a convincing one the extras who clambered out of the craft at the final moment were certainly placing their lives at risk. Overall since it's powered by a very loose and poorlydeveloped narrative 'The Navigator' is probably the weakest of Keaton's features that I've seen so far following 'Sherlock Jr.' 'The General' 'Seven Chances' and 'Steamboat Bill Jr.' but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable. Also for an excellent slapstick short that also features Keaton as a mariner check out 'The Love Nest 1923.'".

It also has a grand climax that plays on stereotypes of naive and impressionable natives on some faraway island and it struck me as dated and depending on the viewer maybe demeaning. This includes a comic appearance of Keaton in a deep sea suit from the water spooking the natives who apparently think he is a kind of monster or god. They later catch on and the chase begins again.The basis of the movie is the clueless rich young man Keaton trying to get the disinterested girl Betsy O'Brien. And in a very very roundabout way he seems like he just might. You'll see.The Navigator is actually the name of a ship a trick rather like how the name of his better and more famous film The General is the really the name of a locomotive. And it mostly takes place on board this abandoned vessel which Keaton bought outright when it was being scrapped. The reason it is abandoned in the movie and set adrift seems like it might matter at first as a kind of political plot but this all ends up not really being part of the larger movie. It's just an excuse to have the two on a big ship alone with all the likely things that might happen as a result.The grand finale of it all is a bit of a lucky farce and a good laugh though the natives again don't look too clever in it all. The gags that Keaton uses are slapstick and sight gags with some of his trademark stunt work but not as much as usual. In fact this might the most Chaplinesque of all his films even having a scene where submarine tilts its sense of level and reminds me a lot of Chaplin's Gold Rush in the cabin scenes. To note however this is one year before the Chaplin film. The scenes where Keaton is at his best are probably the underwater ones with a lobster as a wire cutter and a sword fish as a weapon in an underwater sword fight. Hilarious.Keaton codirects with Donald Crisp who went on to a long acting career starting years before Birth of a Nation and going into the 1940s with some general fame. It's thought that Keaton ended up directing most of it himself. It's a great fun ride for sure but just if you've seen other Keaton gems Sherlock Jr. and The General and Steamboat Bill you need to expect something less original.".

There was also the previously mentioned underwater scene which I was surprised to see in such an early movie including a spliced in segment of a real octopus added as foreshadowing.In what I think was a progressive step forward there was a brief scene depicting a seemingly wealthy AfricanAmerican couple being chauffeured after getting married.

The movie did have quite a few funny parts though some that were actually funny and others that were just so outrageous you couldn't help but laugh. I enjoyed the fact that the woman had a predominate role I feel like that wasn't very common back then I believe she did an excellent job portraying her role. As did Buster Keaton but together they both made the film enjoyable. By the middle of the movie I found myself getting distracted and kind of lost sense with what was going on. I think it was because the comedy had gotten predictable and slowed down and the story seemed to drag out what seemed like could have been short scenes. Although I didn't enjoy the story line of the middle of the movie I do believe the film work was impressive with all the creative shots and use of detail. Even though there weren't many title cards it was very easy to understand what was going on which was very refreshing. Over I think the acting and use of detail were some of The Navigators strong points and any silent film fan would enjoy this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "It would be a lie to say that The Navigator didn't make me laugh nor that I didn't enjoy it. I found it a very crafted romantic adventure based on an interesting premise one that would be deemed original even by today's standards... only to be ultimately misused.Indeed having a man and a woman both born with silver spoons in their mouth finding themselves alone in a big passenger ship drifting into the ocean is something that would have immediately been fueled with sexual tension and puerile arguments set on the course of an obligatory love scene. In fact no modern movie would have showed the two protagonists coming from similar backgrounds because today's screenplays workshops insist on the necessity of conflicts between protagonists.Fair enough... but Buster Keaton belongs to an era where scripts were a luxury a few movies could afford and they didn't have 'conventions' to be embarrassed with. Keaton takes advantage from the temporary availability of an expassenger cargo ship set for scrap iron and turns it into a protagonist rather than the setting of a sweet and lovable tale one of two aristocrats learning how to domesticate machinery. What wouldn't people do when driven to the most extreme situations? As usual with Keaton the setting and the 'vehicles' matter more than the stories.But as a story the film is divided into three simple acts. First there's a plotsetting foreign spy conspiracy so common in interwar movies a group of politicians learning that the Navigator was sold to their enemy decide to sabotage the ship and set her adrift during the night. Meanwhile there's Rollo Treadway a rich heir so wealthy he needs a limousine to cross the road and go visit her neighbor Betsy O'Brien Kathryn McGuire and asks her for marriage... because he had nothing else to do. Before he gets an answer he's already sent the butler to book two tickets to Honolulu. Is he overly confident or utterly stupid? There's something so nonchalant yet pleasant in that Rollo character even the No he gets is met with stoicism he decides to go anyway as if he's not even used to deal with conflicting opinions. While turning his back to Betsy he doesn't even realize she's not indifferent. Then series of incidents involving piers' numbers and unfortunate encounters put the two lovers in a situation where they wake up in the morning and find themselves aboard the Navigator. After a hilarious chase where they keep missing each other they finally bump into each other and the second act can start. The chase is one of Keaton's typical masterstrokes proving that he knows how to provide the right angle to get the full picture there's something that could have been almost Averyan in that scene. He uses the large ship as a prop to his comical inspiration. Another sequence shows them struggling to make coffee or Rollo trying to open a can using a hatchet so big he destroys everything the scene drags on a little but it makes the payoff even more satisfying when we see them having built some practical expertise after a few weeks.But one of the highlights of the movie is the night sequence with the picture of Donald Crisp the director swinging and looking from the window as if there was an intruder in the ship. It is funny how an image with a right expression and a movement creates the illusion of a presence by simply moving. It does say something about the magic of the camera... and convincingly.The third act is perhaps the most memorable with the underwater scene and a funny sword fight with the perfect opponent a swordfish something worthy of a cartoon. And unfortunately one can say the same about the following part which is good but doesn't quite hold up in our days of political correctness it involves the whole fight against cannibals portrayed by darkskinned actors it's not fair to judge the film by our values but to be fair the cannibals sequence never really work on both a comical or action level because they are no professional actors and some action scenes look too staged for the film's own good... and just because it's a 20s film doesn't mean we should lower our standards. But I guess the real issue with the film is that Keaton is a man of movement in Sherlock Jr. he spent almost ten minutes on a bike in The General it was a train in motion but a large ship is hardly the epitome of visible movement so it's a rather static setting that doesn't leave much to his talent even the underwater scenes feels slow as if a diving suit wouldn't be his strongest. Too heavy to put on so to speak and maybe the ship was too big for Keaton's own inspiration.Just think of Chaplin's Immigrant and how many situations he exploits from the sailing movement I could picture a sap like Rollo dealing with seasickness a situation with fishing but maybe I should appreciate that the film didn't go for easy laughs and cared about telling a story instead of filling them with stunts. Still we all expect stunts when it comes to Keaton that's his trademark isn't it? Maybe it's because Sherlock Jr. didn't succeed and he was trying something less exuberant and that the film was a commercial success proved his intuition right. But while I liked that movie it didn't impress me and with Buster Keaton it's problematic. I know these reviews are all relative and why should I judge this film as a lesser 'Keaton' while it's a classic silent movie... I guess my eyes were hungry for thrills and acrobatic stunts like only Keaton could have pulled and that hunger wasn't quite satisfied.".

	schema:headline " Yet Another Classic From Buster Keaton!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Navigator is essentially a two character film. Buster Keaton plays an heir to the Treadway fortune Rollo Treadway. It's a part similar to the one he played in his first feature The Saphead 1920. Kathryn McGuire plays Betsy O'Brien the daughter of a rich shipbuilder.There are two unnamed countries at war. One of them purchase a large luxury liner The Navigator from Betsy's father. The other side plots to capture the ship and set her adrift so that she will be dashed upon the rocks and sink.When Betsy rejects Rollo's marriage proposal he decides to take the planned honeymoon cruise to Hawaii himself. Naturally Rollo boards the wrong ship the deserted Navigator. Betsy meanwhile in trying to rescue her father who has been captured by spies winds up aboard the Navigator unbeknownst to Rollo. Being on such a large ship the two manage to avoid running into each other with comedic effect.The two being rich and spoiled are at first unable to live on their own. But as the voyage proceeds Rollo manages to devise a series of pulleys and equipment that solves their feeding problems. Rollo has to don a deep sea diving outfit in order to repair a broken rudder on the ship. Just as they are about to accept their fate they spot land. The only problem is the island is inhabited by cannibals.Turning Buster Keaton loose on an empty ocean liner you know will result in an endless array of pratfalls and sight gags...and it does. The fighting off of the cannibal attack is a highlight. His rescue of Betsy from the cannibals and their return to the ship is hilarious. His diving sequence where he puts up a Danger  Men at Work sign uses a lobster to cut a cord and his swordfight with a pair of swordfish are memorable. In one scene Buster gets entangled with a cannon which he would utilize again in The General 1926. The pair's rescue when all is seemingly lost during the relentless cannibal attack is pure Keaton.Not to be missed a true Keaton classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE NAVIGATOR 1924 tells the story of a bored wealthy young man Buster Keaton who after having his marriage proposal rejected decides to go for a cruise. Unfortunately he winds up on the wrong boat and sets sail on an empty ship that is headed for destruction. There he meets his wouldbe fiance Kathryn McGuire whose father sold the ship to a small country at war and whose enemies decided to set it adrift. Comic complications ensue. Directed by Buster Keaton and Donald Crisp.SCRIPT THE NAVIGATOR is definitely one of Keaton's most entertaining efforts. The movie lasts barely an hour but is full of comic invention and ingenuity. Among the highlights are Keaton's hilariously inept attempts to make breakfast on the ship his battle with a swordfish and their epic battle against cannibals. This movie gave my wife and me lots of laughs! SCORE 910ACTING Buster Keaton was known for his stoneface routine remaining comically unflappable in the face of dire circumstances and he does it well here. He does well at portraying the bored rich young man and is also very athletic when the situation calls for it. Kathryn McGuire is also very good as his love interest. McGuire comically mocks the damsel in distress style of acting at times and she's very game for all of the slapstick funny business as well. They are the two who are most prominent in the movie in fact they're the only people involved for long stretches of the film and their chemistry and talent help keep things afloat. SCORE 910CINEMATOGRAPHYPRODUCTION This film was expertly shot by Byron Houck and Elgin Lessley. In many cases all they have to do is just set the camera up and let it roll to capture Keaton's stunningly inventive gags but there are nice tracking shots and underwater camerawork as well. Also the battle between Keaton McGuire and the cannibals is given the right epic feel while still being quite funny. Solid work overall. SCORE 810SUMMARY THE NAVIGATOR is great fun with lots of inventive gags and great comic chemistry between the two leads. It's one of Keaton's best films and it stands the test of time as a wonderful example of the imaginative richness of silent comedy. SCORE 910".

The premise is simple two spoiled rich kids with a great deal of romantic tension between them are marooned on a ship in the middle of the ocean and must learn to fend for themselves. Keaton and his team wring a lot of great material from this premise.Buster and his understated emoting are fantastic as always but I feel his leading lady Kathryn MacGuire is rarely given the credit she deserves. In his book Classics of the Silent Screen Joe Franklin insists MacGuire's characters in TN and Sherlock Jr were idiots but I actually think MacGuire was among Keaton's best comic partners. While she's little more than a damselindistress in Sherlock Jr this film has her as Keaton's equally clueless comedic partner and there is more of an equality between them than there is for most of Keaton's leading ladies.It may not be his best but TN is still a fine movie and a great little comedy to relax with after a long day.".

	schema:headline " Great information Could Be Edited Better";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is a documentary in the truest sense of the word and the film was admitted as evidence at the Nuremberg trials in December 1945. The first part of the film is basically home movies and news reels about what was happening in Germany in the 20s and early 30s leading up to the Nazi takeover in 1933 and some of their early actions book burning boycott of the Jews. After that it is mostly official news reels about Nazi activities from 1935 to 1944 and then curiously stops abruptly. As a documentary it has lots of faults although as a compilation of information about the Nazi movement it is priceless.There is no real continuity in the movement from one segment to another all of them defined chronologically. IOW one has to have a good idea of what you're looking at for it to be of importance. A good deal of the film consists of the German language with sporadic translations that are often much shorter than the original German part of the film. There is no attempt to identify the various party leaders.George Stevens 19041975 took time out from a busy career as a director to work for the war department and made 3 films of which this was the last. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times and won twice Giant and A Place in the Sun. 16 of his films generated 69 Oscar nominations and 15 wins. Some of his memorable films prior to his war service include comedies like Woman of the Year 1942 and Alice Adams 1935. After his war experience his major films include Diary of Anne Frank 1959 Shane 1953 and I Remember Mama 1948. Both of his Oscar wins come from the period after the war service. Budd Schulberg 19142009 helped work on the film after he finished his work with director John Ford. Schulberg is known for his novels  e.g. What Makes Sammy Run 1941 The Harder They Fall 1947  and for his original screenplays  On the Waterfront 1954 A Face in the Crowd 1957. If you're interested in this type of documentary Hitler's Death Squad aka Nazi Death Squads is a far better film not merely as a film but for some of the footage which is truly remarkable. I saw it on National Geographic TV channel. It's the story of the Nazi Einsatzgruppen especially the two years surrounding the June 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy.".

The first part of the film is basically home movies and news reels about what was happening in Germany in the 20s and early 30s leading up to the Nazi takeover in 1933 and some of their early actions book burning boycott of the Jews. After that it is mostly official news reels about Nazi activities from 1935 to 1944 and then curiously stops abruptly. As a documentary it has lots of faults although as a compilation of information about the Nazi movement it is priceless.There is no real continuity in the movement from one segment to another all of them defined chronologically. IOW one has to have a good idea of what you're looking at for it to be of importance. A good deal of the film consists of the German language with sporadic translations that are often much shorter than the original German part of the film. There is no attempt to identify the various party leaders.George Stevens 19041975 took time out from a busy career as a director to work for the war department and made 3 films of which this was the last. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times and won twice Giant and A Place in the Sun. 16 of his films generated 69 Oscar nominations and 15 wins. Some of his memorable films prior to his war service include comedies like Woman of the Year 1942 and Alice Adams 1935. After his war experience his major films include Diary of Anne Frank 1959 Shane 1953 and I Remember Mama 1948. Both of his Oscar wins come from the period after the war service. Budd Schulberg 19142009 helped work on the film after he finished his work with director John Ford. Schulberg is known for his novels  e.g. What Makes Sammy Run 1941 The Harder They Fall 1947  and for his original screenplays  On the Waterfront 1954 A Face in the Crowd 1957. If you're interested in this type of documentary Hitler's Death Squad aka Nazi Death Squads is a far better film not merely as a film but for some of the footage which is truly remarkable. I saw it on National Geographic TV channel. It's the story of the Nazi Einsatzgruppen especially the two years surrounding the June 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy.";

	schema:reviewBody "Flanders 1940 during a bombing raid the gates to an asylum are left open allowing patients to drift out onto the street and blend in with the human train of refugees. Folle embellie directed by Dominique Cabrera and written by Cabrera and Antoine Montperrin follows several of these figures from the hospital as they learn to cope with the outside world and not just any world the world during wartime. It's a movie subject you don't see every day.Cabrera has said in interviews that she wanted to tell a story looking at how this heightened situation could bring about changes in the characters and therefore become a vehicle for a story of social change in general. It's quite hard initially to grasp how involved we are meant to be in this story and these characters especially as events seem to proceed in a fairly disorientating fashion. At first Alida MiouMiou and her son Julien Morgan Marinne separated from the others seek refuge on a barge later further along the canal they rejoin with Julien's father Fernand JeanPierre Leaud and the rest of the group. From there it becomes a kind of road movie except that the road is a rural backstreet and the characters aren't really heading anywhere definite.It's intriguing to spend time with a movie whose cast of characters is not conventionally communicative unlike say One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest an obvious comparison there is no Jack Nicholson character with whom the audience can readily engage and if we could say that the nemesis role the Nurse Ratched part is filled by the Nazis well they aren't in the film that much either  although the movie does a very good job of portraying the lulled casual threat that they pose in this landscape of stragglers and wanderers.As Fernand the tightlywound and dogmatic attentiongrabber JeanPierre Leaud is riveting even if it's unclear how controlled or deliberate his performance is. It's hard to watch Fernand without thinking of Leaud's own upanddown screen persona of the past couple of decades. Perhaps Cabrera is subtly utilising our knowledge of the actor to bring edginess to the portrayal of Fernand. It would be very nice though to see Leaud play a role which is not in some way tortured and to play it with the supreme authority that he still seems to possess. But has he ever given such a performance? He remains a frustrating puzzle of the cinema so often has he come so close to being so good.Morgan Marinne was of course superb as Francis the teenager just out of juvenile custody in Le Fils  and yet that film appearance was also a triumph of casting it was a question as to whether or how well he could do another role. In Folle embellie he may not seem strictly inperiod but with his watchfulness and concentration he is so absorbing he manages to transcend his natural register. He also shows that he has a very sure grip on his craft if Le Fils was a major test for actors with its lengthy takes and movements choreographed precisely with the camera Julien in Folle embellie is a demanding part because it's not easy to act opposite people who are aiming to be unpredictable and Marinne proves himself equal to this challenge. His lucidity allows Julien to shine his character arc gives a satisfying structure to the understandably meandering nature of so much of the material.Dominique Cabrera uses the camera as an omniscient presence more than just an observer capable of flights of fancy such as some Crouching Tigerlike trips through the trees to convey the reach of her characters. She spreads an intoxicating sheen across the material making it seem perhaps more logical than it actually is and papering over any cracks in character development or interaction. The tone is a nice mixture of looseness and purpose and even if it is not a totally satisfying story it provides many striking images and a general sense that the warm moments in wartime life are hardearned and fleeting.".

On the other hand it was released at the beginning of July and I saw it on September 2 so maybe it's just running out of steam.  The premise  if not the leading characters  is simple As we establish a provincial town during an air raid and then what the French call an 'asile' a caption sets the time June 1940.  The road running past the asile is up to its ass with vehicular and pedestrian traffic trying to outrun the Germans so it's not too difficult for JeanPaul Leaud to open the gate and lead his family and friends to what passes for freedom at that time and place.  Sorry but I for one have a problem with that it SHOULD be difficult dammit.  These are after all fruitcakes or if you're PC they are being detained for their own and other's safety under the applicable mental health act yet at no time does anyone attempt to follow them or bring them back.  Mental illness of course takes many forms and we get a fair sprinkling here from Leaud who plays everything as if he'd only just seen fifty years too late Joseph Wiseman in 'Detective Story' to MiouMiou who has no fewer than three new films on release in Paris who does a beautiful job of passivity. One notable feature is the almost total lack of background music so that for long stretches we hear only natural sound. Ultimately it's a moving film in an unassuming way but animal lovers should beware the scene where Leaud beats a cow to death with a sledghammer.    810".

If you're a fan of Fulcistyle gore there's surely something here for you. There's one scene where a girl's eye meets a razor that's particularly nasty and particularly difficult to watch. And if you're a fan of Fulcistyle sleaze there's surely something here for you also. While I won't go as far as some reviewers and call it pornographic there are a variety of sexual perversions on display. But it's not all blood and sex. Fulci actually manages to create a few scenes with real tension. There are moments where you know that killer is about to strike but the anticipation Fulci builds in the audience is quite good.Unfortunately there are problems I have with the film. I'll limit this to two examples. First the resolution of the mystery is a real letdown. The killer's identity is far too easy to guess. Fulci telegraphs the answer form the opening moments of the film. Second Gialli often ask the viewer to suspend reality to accept various plot points but the final scenes in The New York Ripper cross the line into ridiculousness and really hurt the overall film. I'm certainly no expert but I sincerely doubt that all the psychological babble made any real sense to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "The late Italian director Lucio Fulci remains a controversial figure among horror film fans. Some view him merely as a hack exploitation director who unsuccessfully tried to mimic the ideas and techniques of skilled horror directors such as Dario Argento and George Romero. Others view him as a directorial genius with his own distinctive style. Upon viewing my first Fulci film THE NEW YORK RIPPER I am inclined to believe that Fulci has not been given as much credit as he deserves.THE NEW YORK RIPPER is a good example of an Italian giallo film which blends the graphic gore sequences typically found in slasher films with the police investigations typically found in crime dramas. The film's plot is simple a psychopath who talks like a duck is killing beautiful young women in New York City in vicious ways. Burnedout Lieutenant Fred Williams Jack Hedley is assigned to investigate the case and soon gets taunting calls from the killer. At the same time the one woman to survive the killer's attack track star Fay Majors Almanta Keller finds that her life remains in peril.THE NEW YORK RIPPER is unapologetically sleazy. The gore effects are very well done and will make even the most hardened fans of gore wince at their brutality. There is also plenty of sex which is quite explicit even by today's standards. In short THE NEW YORK RIPPER is tasteless. But that doesn't mean it's bad. The film is well paced and there is hardly a dull moment. The murder mystery aspect of the film will keep you guessing until the film's climax. Fulci also  delivers stylish direction and the film has some nice atmospheric shots of New York City.One of the main criticisms of THE NEW YORK RIPPER is that it is brutally misogynistic. On the surface this appears to be true. The killer's victims are almost all sexually promiscuous young women who are killed in a brutal sexual manner. However in my opinion the film is not so much antiwoman as it is antihumanity. Fulci's New York City much like Martin Scorsese's in TAXI DRIVER is a seemingly inescapable hell filled with perverts sex shows prostitutes and 42nd Street gigolos. It should also be noted that the film's one strong and sympathetic character is a woman Fay Majors.Also it is often said that THE NEW YORK RIPPER is Fulci's ripoff of the 1980 film MANIAC also one of my favorites. This is simply not true their only similarity is that they concern a psycho killer on the loose in New York City. MANIAC is a character study horror film while THE NEW YORK RIPPER is a mystery thriller much like Brian DePalma's DRESSED TO KILL1980.Lastly I must say that the recently released uncut widescreen version of THE NEW YORK RIPPER is a major improvement over the old video version. While the dubbing remains shoddy in some parts this new edition looks beautiful in its widescreen format. Additionally the old edition chopped up some scenes which contained crucial clues about the killer's identity. With these scenes now intact the killer's identity is not as totally out of left field as some critics have charged. out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard of Lucio Fulci for years through mail order catalogs interviews in genre magazines and newsgroup discussions. I just decided yesterday to shell out 15 to buy the Anchor Bay video version of New York Ripper. I am a huge video collector and the clamshell box with the lurid cover art just called out to me. Well I popped it into the VCR after not eating any dinner to disallow any possible barfing! and watched the video. Though the gore is plentiful and there are some downright sleazy scenes I thought this was one of the best giallotype crime films I've ever seen! While not as violent as I thought it would be there are plenty of graphic murders to squirm at. The worst by far was the murder of the detective's prostitute girlfriend including savage razorblade attacks on her nipples and her eyes! Despite the other reviews that say there is a lot of sex there is only one real sex scene the rest is heavily implied. As for misogyny charges I think the film isn't misogynistic just the killer. And this is never explained so I guess the film could be a tad antiwoman but I didn't really see anything expressing this feeling that I wouldn't see in any other slasher film. The widescreen version is the best one to see it displays Fulci's gorgeous cinematography in full and makes the film look a little more classy and sophisticated than it should. The performance of Almanta Keller as Fay the heroine is one of the best I've seen in Italian horror films. Her dream sequence is another disturbing visual sequence that might leave your dinner in your lap! What more can I say I love this movie it is sleazy it is violent it is controversial but the atmosphere and style of Fulci's filmmaking more than makes up for it.".

It's overthetop sleazy and misogynistic. It never shies away from it. Personally speaking it's sleaze par excellence. The misogynistic aspect bothers me but then 90 of horror films out there are misogynistic so it's not like I'm not used to it. As for the sleaze aspect well if you don't like sleaze don't watch it. If you're fascinated by sleaze like me then this is like the CITIZEN KANE of sleaze. What makes this so different than the majority of truly worthless sleaze out there is that Fulci is honest about the sleaze. Compare this to let's say the recent MURDER SET PIECES which is very sleazy but almost totally worthless. It's so selfconscious about the fact that it's horrific and sleazy it just doesn't work. It's not real sleaze. NEW YORK RIPPER is real 42nd Ave sleaze.What makes NEW YORK RIPPER unique among the plethora of sleazy films made then and today is the way it's filmed. In scope garish colors grimy settings very gloomy and harsh. I love the scenes shot in the subway or around other parts of a depressed NY city. The acting is not really good but the level of acting is what you expect from these kind of films. It's remarkably violent towards women. Truly appalling. But then after the stunningly blunt ending everything is suddenly redeemed. Though most of the violence is directed towards women the sleaze centers around women and men including a couple having live sex in front of an audience horny thugs a nymphomaniac housewife who tries to sleep around with any guy including the thugs and a hunky psycho who is thought to be the killer and there's a gay character who's the most likable character in the whole film. I can't say that I like this Fulci flick. NEW YORK RIPPER is not something someone likes per se. It's just too harsh to attach any affection to it. But I'm fascinated about it and that's why I give it an 8. There are very few films that can claim to be something that will never be topped and because of our PC times and depending of what's in store in the near future it's almost guaranteed that NEW YORK RIPPER will never be topped as far as the sleaze factor is concern.".

	schema:headline " Violence Shown in Realistic Light";
	schema:reviewBody "Lo Squartatore di New YorkNew York Ripper1982 outraged many horror filmgoers with its brutal uncompromising depiction of violence towards women.  One of the most controversial giallos to come out of Italy. Released ten years after Don't Torture a Duckling1972 which was also controversial for different reasons.  Lucio Fulci has filmed vicious scenes of violence before but New York Ripper takes the cake in violent imagery. As brutal as giallos like Giallo a Venezia1979 and The Killer is Still Among Us1986.  What makes the violent scenes for some tough to digest are the intense physical emotions of the murderer when killing his victims.Gives new meaning to the term hardcore horror.  Some of the most brutal depiction of hardcore horror I have witnessed in a horror film.  Many of the film's contents have many similarities with Maniac1980 which gained controversy for identical reasons.  Daring approach by Fulci in making the hardcore horror moments both powerful and ugly.  The director had guts in doing a giallo with an extremely unpleasant subject matter.  Misunderstood Lucio Fulci film that is one of his finest horror films.An aspect that either humored shocked or upset many people was the mock duck voice used by the murderer.  I find that the duck voice of the killer adds to his menacing and sick presence.  The duck voice of the murderer was a reference by the director to his earlier 1970s giallo Don't Torture a Duckling1972.  A reference that is lost among some horror film enthusiasts.  Capped what would be Lucio Fulci's second and final prosperous artistic period of his film career.  The director's sole horror film with erotic overtones that adds to the controversial style of this  pic.Grim and relentless portrayal of human nature and its darkest aspects.  The bleak nature of New York Ripper1982 makes Lucio Fulci's gothic films look happy go lucky.  Explodes with lots of anger and resentment that gives it a depressing feel.  Dipped deep in nihilistic waters with the depressing portrayal of human behavior.  The subplot involving the disabled little girl is uncomfortably sad.  One film that has its plot full of anger and resentment is Abel Ferrara's Ms. 451981.New York Ripper1982 is filled with some of the director's usual quirks and visual trademarks.  Fulci's direction pushes the limit in scenes of sadistic violence.  Sometimes part of the story seems to come from the gut of the controversial filmmaker.  Direction does have some negative aspects but the negatives are few and far between.  The direction of Lucio Fulci for New York Ripper1982 is not as flashy or flamboyant as Dario Argento's direction of Tenebre1982except in a few moments.  He does get the job done with competence and craftsman experience.Comparisons can be made between Lucio Fulci's New York Ripper1982 and Dario Argento's Tenebre1982.  Both films deal with similar motifs and themes on violence towards women.  Also each film are gory uncompromising giallos with striking images.  New York Ripper and Tenebre each have a show stopping moment of gory murder.  These two films use bold filmmaking techniques.  Each changed some of the rules of the giallo genre.There are many scenes that were controversial but the one that placed New York Ripper in film infamy was the infamous death scene of Daniela Doria. Two years for Daniela Doria after being part of another controversial scene in The Gates of Hell1980.  For a gruesome moment of vile violence it certainly has a excellent build up and pay off.  As in Zombie Flesh Eaters1979 the eye motif becomes a major part of this scene.  Daniela Doria has to get kudos for acting in a difficult scene as this one.  The merger of the erotic and the violent is what makes this particular scene hard to watch.There is a small film noir quality within the frame of the story.  This is because of the assortment of unsympathetic characters that surround it.  The only person that comes close to having any moments of sympathy is Jane.  Lt. Williams is an unlikable protagonist who comes out as arrogant and self centered.  The character of Lt. Williams seems to be inspired by the close minded Police Detective of Let Sleeping Corpse Lie1974.  Dr. Davis comes out in the film as a narcissist who's too please with his intellect.What turned off even some of the Lucio Fulci admirers was the realistic look of New York Ripper's violent scenes.  Unlike in his gothic films from the same period there is no fantasy subtext to make the violence bearable.  Its realistic elements help make New York Ripper1982 into a courageous effort of fercious horror.  The violence depicted towards women is what it is and that's disgusting but at the same time has a certain realism that doesn't make it totally misogynistic.  New York Ripper moves away from the comic book feel of Fulci's gothic pictures and into the realism of his early 1970s giallo pictures.  Its realistic depiction of violence is the film's biggest strength.Abel Ferrara made a little ribbing to the title of this film when the killer of Fear City1985 is once referred to as New York Knifer.  Two of the film's writers had worked with Fulci before on Don't Torture a Duckling. Unusually tightly plotted thriller which never clicks in a good flow in some moments.  Excellent camera work created by Deep Red1975 DoP Luigi Kuveiller.  Its not a perfect motion picture but for a bold horror film it certainly delivers the goods.".

	onyx:emotionText "Lo Squartatore di New YorkNew York Ripper1982 outraged many horror filmgoers with its brutal uncompromising depiction of violence towards women.  One of the most controversial giallos to come out of Italy. Released ten years after Don't Torture a Duckling1972 which was also controversial for different reasons.  Lucio Fulci has filmed vicious scenes of violence before but New York Ripper takes the cake in violent imagery. As brutal as giallos like Giallo a Venezia1979 and The Killer is Still Among Us1986.  What makes the violent scenes for some tough to digest are the intense physical emotions of the murderer when killing his victims.Gives new meaning to the term hardcore horror.  Some of the most brutal depiction of hardcore horror I have witnessed in a horror film.  Many of the film's contents have many similarities with Maniac1980 which gained controversy for identical reasons.  Daring approach by Fulci in making the hardcore horror moments both powerful and ugly.  The director had guts in doing a giallo with an extremely unpleasant subject matter.  Misunderstood Lucio Fulci film that is one of his finest horror films.An aspect that either humored shocked or upset many people was the mock duck voice used by the murderer.  I find that the duck voice of the killer adds to his menacing and sick presence.  The duck voice of the murderer was a reference by the director to his earlier 1970s giallo Don't Torture a Duckling1972.  A reference that is lost among some horror film enthusiasts.  Capped what would be Lucio Fulci's second and final prosperous artistic period of his film career.  The director's sole horror film with erotic overtones that adds to the controversial style of this  pic.Grim and relentless portrayal of human nature and its darkest aspects.  The bleak nature of New York Ripper1982 makes Lucio Fulci's gothic films look happy go lucky.  Explodes with lots of anger and resentment that gives it a depressing feel.  Dipped deep in nihilistic waters with the depressing portrayal of human behavior.  The subplot involving the disabled little girl is uncomfortably sad.  One film that has its plot full of anger and resentment is Abel Ferrara's Ms. 451981.New York Ripper1982 is filled with some of the director's usual quirks and visual trademarks.  Fulci's direction pushes the limit in scenes of sadistic violence.  Sometimes part of the story seems to come from the gut of the controversial filmmaker.  Direction does have some negative aspects but the negatives are few and far between.  The direction of Lucio Fulci for New York Ripper1982 is not as flashy or flamboyant as Dario Argento's direction of Tenebre1982except in a few moments.  He does get the job done with competence and craftsman experience.Comparisons can be made between Lucio Fulci's New York Ripper1982 and Dario Argento's Tenebre1982.  Both films deal with similar motifs and themes on violence towards women.  Also each film are gory uncompromising giallos with striking images.  New York Ripper and Tenebre each have a show stopping moment of gory murder.  These two films use bold filmmaking techniques.  Each changed some of the rules of the giallo genre.There are many scenes that were controversial but the one that placed New York Ripper in film infamy was the infamous death scene of Daniela Doria. Two years for Daniela Doria after being part of another controversial scene in The Gates of Hell1980.  For a gruesome moment of vile violence it certainly has a excellent build up and pay off.  As in Zombie Flesh Eaters1979 the eye motif becomes a major part of this scene.  Daniela Doria has to get kudos for acting in a difficult scene as this one.  The merger of the erotic and the violent is what makes this particular scene hard to watch.There is a small film noir quality within the frame of the story.

Fulci deals with a lot of psychological issues and the areas of the unknown. There is enough unsaid that keeps you guessing until the very end some which never gets said but we won't go there. In my opinion this movie had a faster pace and more solid plot than most of Fulci's more popular efforts. It was simple someone who talks like a duck is killing beautiful women in New York. I did find it scary. Sometimes I'm intrigued how they think up some of the things they did in this movie. Maybe it should be called The Amsterdam Ripper because of the extreme sex violence and drug atmosphere. But on the Anchor Bay DVD uncut release the cinematography was amazing. I do love that this is an Italian movie filmed in New York another totally illogical thing to do in my mind yet on some level it works for the sheer creativity and guts to do something new. No Academy Awards but they sure don't make movies like this anymore! I'll give it 3 quacks out of 5.".

Certain scenes are so mean spirited and graphic that it is difficult to watch but of course this is precisely what Fulci has in mind.

Specifically the American ideal of being the best in a given pursuit is what fuels the murderer's rage.  Those critics who believe Fulci to be an ardent Catholic who feels that women who behave sexily deserve to be murdered have had a field day with this film.  Yet these critics have failed to properly understand the film.  Fulci is not an ardent Catholic as NON SI SEVIZIA UN PAPERINO proves nor is he condemning the women in his films.  Rather this is a film that paints a bleak portrait of human behavior.  There are no sympathetic characters and an air of hopelessness dominates the proceedings.  The issue of mysoginy has no bearing in a film like this  instead of being antiwoman this film is antihumanity.  Sure it is not a pleasant premise on which to base a film but then who says that films have to be pleasant?

One cannot imagine that an artist of Fulci's caliber would simply produce something this horrible for the sake of being horrible.

Subversion perversion deep hatred a mirror image of the Director's earlier film intimations of a diseased city snapshots of 42nd St at it's worst...Then of course there's the killer stabbing along as he furiously quacks like Donald Duck. Yes Donald Duck. At times you can't help but find it's morbidity haunting even poetic. Funny? Only in the blackest way imaginable. I realize that it sounds crazy to assign depth to such a sleaze fest but I get the impression there is something important going on here. I can't figure AND digest it. Maybe if it could be seen where and when it was made at the infamous Times Square Splatterhouses of it's NYC namesake? There is of course the reference to Fulci's earlier DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING to consider and there are subplots about disabled children and prostitution. I don't think I want to spread it out much more than that. Technically the dub isn't the best but that was the Italian model at this time. The acting isn't the greatest and I'm not always sure the casting decisions were well made either. The cinematography is understated. It is one of Fulci's stronger stylistic pieces I think. I agree with another reviewer who took the time to describe it's Noirish tone and feel. Indeed you'll be hard pressed to like a single character. It's just overall very very dark. Which is really saying something coming from me. I can't think of many other films I would say this about or feel that way about. This is a cruel film. It may be too much for some but it seems that maybe that lump I get in the back of my throat from watching this I feel like maybe that lump is indicative of something brilliant going on.".

As several more murders follow he enlists therapist Dr. Paul Davis Paolo Malco to help him determine who is committing the crimes. When a clue is found at the scene of one of them he is suddenly inundated with threatening phone calls from the caller who rambles on squeaking like Donald Duck. After he makes a failed attack on Fay Majors Almanta Suska her husband Peter Bunch Andrea Occhipinti offers to help out in tracking the killer. As the deaths and the phone calls continue to flood the search they finally find the real killer and race to stop his deadly rampage across the city.The Good News This here was a rather pleasant and surprisingly good film. The biggest factor with it is the rampant sleaze undertow the film carries. The best parts here come from exploiting this factor. The rampant and excessive nudity present in the film are just a small part and this one really packs it in. From several prostitutes seen in their job requirements to seeing some wandering around nude or topless as well as being backstage at a sex show where performers engage in it before an audience. That provides more fun as one of the female observes produces a tape and records herself selfpleasuring herself for her husband. A later scene with the same observer being confronted in a store where they pleasure her sexually with their feet underneath the table is perhaps one of the perverted highlights ever seen complete with camera angles showing it transpire and facial reactions to go along with the regular shots of the interaction. This high amount of sleaze is nice to behold showing a film not afraid to wallow around in these types of themes and scenes with all the other stuff going on. The gore and kills in here are just as good being explicitly violent without being anything more. There's plenty of stabbing in here mainly to the stomach that slits open the area stabbing in the neck a slit throat a broken beer bottle rammed and then ground into a crotch and the biggest scene where a razor blade slices from chest to stomach cuts nipple open and then slashes from the forehead down to the cheek slicing open one of the eyes. This is an exceptionally done sequence that is brutal graphic bloody and quite shocking making it a real highlight in the film. It also doesn't miss out on suspense since the later sequence where a prostitute is tied up in bed when a radio announcer lets slip a piece of information that makes her realize she's in bed with the killer forcing her to remove her binds to escape without making him up who's sleeping soundly next to her. It's a fantastic scene that comes across marvelously and pulled off perfectly. A confrontation in a victim's house raises some few chilling moments and it opens with a great moment where a fetching dog disappears behind some bushes and comes out later with a shocking clue for the owner. The killer's revelation is something that comes across as really surprising the motive of doing so is really creative and it even includes the characteristic that makes it stick out from others. This one here is incredibly surprising.The Bad News This one has almost no flaws. The thing about it is that the sleaze and gore may not be for everyone. There's an abundant amount of nudity which includes seeing every part of the anatomy in several individuals could be seen as something that will be a dealbreaker to some and mixed in with the excessive gore and sexual themes on display could create an experience that some may not want if in the mood for a straightup horror film rather than a sleazy slasher. This here is the film's main problem and it's not something that all will find to be a problem.The Final Verdict An incredibly entertaining slasher with a nice amount of sleaze and gore mixed in with some great elements into a really great film. See this if a fan of these sexual thrillers Fulci fanatics or Italian horror in general while those who don't appreciate it's more obscene side will be welladvised to skip this one.Rated UNR Graphic Violence Full Nudity Language a sex scene and attempted Rape".

It's truly a miracle considering what a poorly and cheaply slapped together mess this is so I figured I'd do my part by casting a vote of 1 out of 10. Does it deserve a 1? Maybe. It's pretty much awful. If I were in a more generous mood I might bump it up to 2 but it's definitely down there with the worst of the worst. The Video Nasty label probably helps its overall score but that can't save it from being a monotonous bore. Leave it to a filmmaker of Fulci's dubious talent to make excessive nudity graphic gore and oppressive unpleasantness seem so tedious. I really don't need to go into much detail about the plot. Standard story about a detective trying to track down a womanhating and duck voiced! sexpsycho who's slashing up young ladies in the Big Apple. And yet despite such lovely acts as a broken bottle being thrust into a woman's crotch and another unfortunate getting her breast and eyeball sliced with a razor blade it all seems so... DULL. Yes dull. Granted I did kind of like the opening scene a game of fetch gone terribly wrong! but it's all downhill from there as the usual awful acting writing directing etc. take their toll. But whatever...New York Ripper pretty much only works for a certain sector of horror fans anyway those who fancy themselves more adventurous than your average fan. You know they who use words like hardcore or extreme to describe themselves and their limited taste within the genre. So basically those people who want to see a large number of women being sexually assaulted degraded and mutilated without pesky things like plot or characterization getting in the way. But I mean hardcore is a fun term to throw around especially if you want to sound cool in spite of the fact you don't like movies that require any thinking or even the most elementary of comprehension skills to view. I can only chuckle while skimming through all these reviews about how extreme and hardcore you have to be to sit through a movie where a guy taunts cops over the telly by reciting laughably bad dialogue in a Donald Duck voice in between scenes of jabbing sharp objects into mannequin heads with wobbly glass eyeballs. In any case if all you want from a movie is to see a few naked girls getting slashed up real good... then have at it with New York Ripper. You might just like it. You must be hardcore bro! Others who aren't so extreme will want to go elsewhere for their kicks.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's very hard to admit taking a liking to New York Ripper possibly the most infamous of Fulci's post House by the Cemetery period. The film is so astonisingly sleazy that it literally defies description. As has been pointed out it is Fulci's most extreme and misogynistic peice ever and features some of his most grotesque set peices. In fact New York Ripper may be Fulci's goriest work ever but since it ranks so low on the totem pole with the fans you never see articles prasing it's effects like you would with Zombie or City of the Living Dead. It is difficult to get worked up over scenes that so relish in the butchery of women. This isn't like the almost mystical gore of Fulci's other films. This violence is too real and hits to close to home. The murder of the young girl on the ferry and the repeated slashing of the main character's hooker girlfriend why do all cops have hooker girlfriends? are very unsettling. I'm sure this was the point but as I said the violence here is too mean spirited. All this is perpetrated by a human villain who does have one ridiculous trait that really comes out of left field. No zombies undead preists or immortal mad scientists here but a human being who quacks like a duck. Yes it's incredibly stupid but there is a rational explanation for his duck tinged accent trust me. But even so it adds a peculiar feel to the precedings and does not sit at all well with everything else on view here. Anti female murders done by a cop baiting killer who talks like a cartoon character. That is something you don't see all the time.Like a lot of Italian Giallo thrillers Ripper has a great deal of red herrings. Not even the helpful psycho analyst is above suspicion as we see him perusing and eventually buying a gay men's magazine although it ultimatley comes as no great surprise who the real killer is. In Ripper's defense at least Fulci does manage to come up with some nice touches. Building on the New York scenes of Zombie Fulci here again makes the Big Apple look incredibly alien and foreign. This isn't the New York we know but an alien landscape that just can't be the real New York even though we know it is. Years before the morgue attendant who listens to music on his walkman while going about his gruesome task in Return of the Living Dead Fulci gives us a forensic pathologist who does the exact same thing. But be warned the disturbing sight of the little girl wasting away from lymphoma is an image that will haunt you for a long time. Its quite unpleasant.Fulci again cameos here this time as a police commisioner. It never ceases to amaze me how this little bespctacled fellow who looks like your Grandfather was behind some of the most extreme Italian horror films ever in particular this one. I don't believe that Fulci hated women as some have but New York Ripper gives the opposition fuel for their fire so to speak.If you're a Fulci completist or slasher fan then see it. All others stay away.".

The plot what there is of it rather loses steam by the end but by then you're too charmed to worry overmuch.

	schema:reviewBody "Wir knnen auch anders... or No More Mr. Nice Guy or Unternehmen Viktor is a German 90minute comedy from 1993 so this one is already almost 25 years old. The director is Detlev Buck one of Germany's most successful filmmakers and he also worked on the script namely on adapting the book by Ernst Kahl. Kahl is also not entirely unknown as he worked on the famous pretty good partially animated movie Werner Beinhart. But back to this one here. you can probably call kit a road movie and it is mostly a comedy. The cast includes Joachim Krl Horst Krause and Sophie Rois and all 3 are still quite successful today even if they may have been more famous a couple years ago especially Krl and Krause. I like other stuff I have seen from Buck but this one here did not impress me that much. I also like him as an actor but sadly in this one he only has a small cameo. As for Krl and Krause they aren't bad and have solid chemistry. But I am quite a fan of Krause and the fact that I only call him decent may also imply that others will be even more underwhelmed. But Konstantin Kotljarov who plays one of the biggest characters as well left me kinda unimpressed and I am not too surprised that he did not return to film acting afterward. And my perception of Sophie Rois is that I am not a fan at all and it's difficult for me to like a film where she plays the biggest female part that involved romance of course too. So basically the other way around as I said with Krause. It's all subjective in this case. As for the plot it's mostly comedy but there are dramatic moments too which is Buck's approach all the time. And there are moments when the film works and when it was a solid watch. Buck was 30 when he made this one and it was still relatively early in his career. But he was also already somewhat experienced not just through short films. I would say Buck showed promising talent at times but was still quite a while away from his peak. Overall I give this film a thumbsdown and I don't recommend checking it out. It is not a failure and there aren't any really disastrous components but it's also far from being good enough for me to suggest you to check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The meta story of this classic film is the most interesting story of our times that banks create money out of thin air.Post worldwar Germans naturally assume that a texan is a rich person. This perception alone is the reason for all that follows including the magic generation of big sums of cash in the end.The director Carl Boese his last name translates to EVIL remakes his own film from before the war. Is this another hint at the importance of the subject? If you are unsure about the monumental implications you could try watching Paul Grignon's 'Money As Debt' as a primer.The foreground story is well enjoyable too. Incomparable lead actor Hans Moser is the uncle who returns from 'Amerika' after 40 years in Texas where he discovers that his 'authentic' experiences in the USA are closer to the German experiences than the German myth about Amerkia allows.Some great comedy develops as he is forced to represent the myth for example the scene in 'Onkel Toms Texas Bar' established in his honour where he is asked to sing a song during the grand opening. The song ends up being a sentimental song about Germany.Whenever I see skyscrapers I wish for a small house A small house here nearby I don't want to reach high When I look outside the window Then the familiar people greet and ask How are you That's what I'd enjoy.and the refrain Over there everything is double as large but here all is double as pretty.I very much recommend this film. A great educational watch also for children of all ages. A indispensable addition to your film library worth watching every year say on December 23 to commemorate the passing of the 1913 Federal Reserve Act where the USA joined the international banking system that is determining nearly all human aspirations today. But that's just the metastory. The film's overt story is a wonderful seemingly harmless Christmasstorylike quaint fairy tale a great watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm always intrigued whenever a film director remakes his or her own work. What do they want to do differently this time? 'Der Onkel aus Amerika' 'The Uncle from America' directed by Carl Boese is a remake of his 1931 film 'Man Braucht kein Geld'. Each film gives an interesting depiction of Germany and its relationship with the United States at their respective moment in time the 1931 version shows Germany on the brink of Nazism during the throes of Depression which was largely caused by American financiers whilst the 1953 remake depicts postwar West Germany rising from the ashes literally under partitioning and U.S. military supervision.Both films have nearly identical plots. In the remake Thomas Hoffmann is a German expatriate who has reportedly made his fortune in America now he is returning to his hometown for a visit. Schmidt is the head clerk at the local bank which is on the brink of failure due to wartime problems and irresponsible speculation before and after the war. Schmidt believes that wealthy Hoffmann will invest in local industry and deposit money in the bank to save both the bank and the town. In the event it turns out that Hoffmann is a failure and a fraud. Nevertheless because Hoffmann is perceived to be rich his mere presence attracts money businessmen want to invest in his prosperous American businesses unaware that those businesses are nonexistent. All is well until Hoffmann decides to turn honest and reveal the truth...German comedies usually manage to be unfunny and this movie is meant to be a satire which is even worse. The movie tries to make all sorts of clever comments about the United States and big business and German society but most of these jokes fall flat. Still this film is an interesting document of its time. I'll rate 'Der Onkel' 3 points out of 10.".

Then of course there was the rest of us.If you were an average teen in the late 70's or early 80's driving drinking and smoking whatever you could afford then you got this movie for sure. Smoking skank weed out of a crushed Shlitz Malt Liquor tall can  been there did it. Driving a vehicle that was a barely moving invitation for the cops to bust you try a brush painted green Chevy Luv pickup for nasty did that too. Getting wasted and crashing the rich kidjock kegger with your friends  did that more times than I can count.I especially liked how the writerdirector portrayed Joe and Hubbs  for once long haired hard rock listening beer swilling stoners weren't turned into violent sociopaths. There was no nannying Lifetime style message about drug and alcohol use. These were good kids who while on the wild side would more than likely grow up to be pretty responsible adults  like most of us did.It's sad there was never a follow up to this one. I liked the characters enough that seeing them in later years can you picture both Joe and Hubbs being the father character dealing with the hip hop listening punks of today  I couldwould surely be worth seeing.This a great nearly forgotten gem that deserves the 10 I gave it. Crack open a tall OX 45 light up some lumbo and enjoy".

	schema:reviewBody "Bit of advice to low budget filmmakers  have your film take place during the present day. Setting your film in the past is expensive and takes a lot of time and energy. This movie's depiction of 1970's era Southern California is so bad it's as if they made no effort whatsoever. I mean the very first scene has Crump's brother standing on the side of the highway as Ford Explorers and late 90's model Volvo Station wagons go cruising by. I didn't even know it took place in the 70's until Joe had his 8track eaten by the Blue Bomber. Even the wardrobe and hair is terrible. Half the cast looks straight out of the Seattle grunge scene  tight ripped jeans leather jackets and long straight hair. Hell Hubbs looks more like the dude from the Cult than a 17 yearold high school kid in the 70's. The hot chick adds even more confusion with her late80's metal groupie she's my cherry pie Warrant video ensemble. Now with that said there are some great moments. Tack is hilarious and perfect. Joe's brush with Blue Oyster Cult and the laser is classic. The soundtrack of Ted Nugent Sabbath and the aforementioned BOC totally rocks guess we know where the budget went. The Schnapster rules ping! Mike Dick and Mike New York and all their cases of talls rule too. Kind of amazing how such a bad flick can have so many classic moments. As a matter of fact every poorly contrived scene of bad dialogue and even worse wardrobes is actually worth sitting through if just for that one scene where Tack starts talking about his zits. Dazed and Confused one of my all time favorite movies doesn't have a single scene as funny as candid as just straight up randon as that one. I don't want no chicks with zits I want fine chicks! Amen Tack.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those who disparage this movie missed the point entirely. Of course so did many of it's fans.This thing is a goldmine of incisive social commentary packed densely enough with excellent writing that it really does merit multiple viewings to take it all in.I'm astonished that anybody could watch this movie and come away thinking that it was made for burnouts in praise of the burnout lifestyle. The point of the title is that this teenage metalhead culture has regressed to a neanderthal state and if you watched this film without picking up on that you may have regressed into a neanderthal state yourself.The fact is this film is so funny it hurts and if you can watch it without appreciating any of the humor you must be one of those soulless feminists who have decided that real women don't laugh.In short while we're supposed to cheer for the protagonists we're also supposed to notice the things about them that are subhuman and laugh at them. The point of this film isn't that we should all be wasted and think with our dicks all the time.Here's an illustrative exchange from the filmJoe There's gotta be more to life than driving around Torrance trying to get drunk stoned and laid.Hubbs with an expression of mild horror You're weirding out on me man.And as for the comparisons to Dazed and Confused they're pretty tenuous and DC wasn't nearly as well written or so tongue in cheek when it praised drinkingdebaucheryfornicationobjectification. And TSA whether you're interested in it or not had a plot conflict resolution. It wasn't just a bunch of scenes strung together like DC.".

	onyx:emotionText "Those who disparage this movie missed the point entirely. Of course so did many of it's fans.This thing is a goldmine of incisive social commentary packed densely enough with excellent writing that it really does merit multiple viewings to take it all in.I'm astonished that anybody could watch this movie and come away thinking that it was made for burnouts in praise of the burnout lifestyle. The point of the title is that this teenage metalhead culture has regressed to a neanderthal state and if you watched this film without picking up on that you may have regressed into a neanderthal state yourself.The fact is this film is so funny it hurts and if you can watch it without appreciating any of the humor you must be one of those soulless feminists who have decided that real women don't laugh.In short while we're supposed to cheer for the protagonists we're also supposed to notice the things about them that are subhuman and laugh at them. The point of this film isn't that we should all be wasted and think with our dicks all the time.Here's an illustrative exchange from the filmJoe There's gotta be more to life than driving around Torrance trying to get drunk stoned and laid.Hubbs with an expression of mild horror You're weirding out on me man.And as for the comparisons to Dazed and Confused they're pretty tenuous and DC wasn't nearly as well written or so tongue in cheek when it praised drinkingdebaucheryfornicationobjectification. And TSA whether you're interested in it or not had a plot conflict resolution. It wasn't just a bunch of scenes strung together like DC.";

	schema:reviewBody "Japon a film by firsttime director Carlos Reygadas is a sensual meditation on death and the possibility of transformation in which a gaunt middleaged man comes to a remote Mexican village with the stated purpose of killing himself. We are given no information as to his name or background except that we later surmise that he is a painter who has come from the city to seek solitude for his final act of selfabnegation. The man with no name and no past is the quintessential existential antihero a character that could easily have wandered in from a Wim Wenders movie or a novel by Albert Camus.Reygadas has said that he admires spectators who go to the movies to experience life not to forget about it. In Japon Reygadas largely succeeds in engaging those who wish not to forget showing nature in all its ragged beauty. His images of an unseen pig crying out as it being slaughtered horses copulating while children laugh and a bird being decapitated push viewers out of their comfort zone and challenge us to engage life at a deeper more honest level similar to the work of Bruno Dumont. Though I found parts of the film to be abrasive I was pulled in by the stark beauty of the desert landscapes the authenticity of its nonprofessional actors and its willingness to explore issues of man's loneliness and relationship to the natural world.After an opening sequence on the freeway that in its drone of dehumanized images pays homage to Tarkovsky's Solaris a tall man nameless with a weatherbeaten face played by the late Alejandro Ferretis makes his way down the canyon to a small village in a remote part of Mexico. Limping with the aid of a cane he tells a man offering directions to the canyon floor that his purpose in going to the remote village is to commit suicide. The man shrugs and tells him to get into the van. Since there are no hotels in the area he is offered lodging in a barn close to an old woman's shack. The woman is named Ascen short for Ascension which she says refers to Christ ascending into heaven without help.Japon is a work of mood and atmosphere the director's static takes and long periods of silence achieve a tone of somber intensity. Ascen remarkably played by 79year old Magdalena Flores is generous and loving leaving her house guest confused and not sure that he knows what he wants. He fails at a suicide attempt and then settles in to the routine of living in the desert. He drinks Mescal and gets drunk in the village smokes marijuana offering some to the old lady and masturbates while dreaming of a beautiful woman on the beach. It is only when Ascen's soninlaw attempts to cheat her out of her house that he comes alive and asks a strange favor of Ascen that made me decidedly uncomfortable.Little by little the depressed man seems to be engaging more in life and connecting with the people around him. Japon uses an amazing sevenminute circular tracking that employs both natural sound and the sublime music of Arvo Part's Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten to end the film on a note of transcendence. Although Japon is at times vague in its delineation of character and feels derivative of Kiarostami and Tarkovsky it is a promising first effort and I am eager to follow this audacious director's career.".

The story is rather simple and not at all worldshattering a man determined to kill himself walks into a canyon in order to commit suicide in peace and tranquility. He moves to an old woman's house and impressed by her attitude to life and somehow inspired by what is going on in the beautiful Nature around him falls in love with or or at least unfolds the desire to sleep with her. Telling the rest wouldn't take long but still spoil a lot.The important thing is not the story including logical character development but the way it is told. The movie has the air of grandezza sometimes it is the opposite of naturalism but thus it is much more like reality than a couple of Dogmastyle films. When you are alone in nature well what else will you do but admire the wonderful landscape and small events happening therein for a couple of minutes trying to absorb it as intensely as possible? As a result there are quite lengthy moments in the film which might repel some people but that's a pity because it means that they are unable to enjoy the immediate experience of beauty.In a review I read the author charged Reygardas with being pretentious and cheap and I guess he referred to the very last shot which by the way could be the most astonishing technical achievement a cinematographer has ever performed!. I understand what he means and in a way he is right but I find that what we see makes up for this oh so terrible lack of modesty. Seldom have I heard so little noise in a theatre after the last image of a film  it was completely silent except for one person in the audience who couldn't help applauding. And this experience has confirmed me in two opinions First movies are not made for intellectual critics in the first place. And second cinema will always have a reason to persist. Nothing like a television or DVD set can give you the same feeling as a movie like Japn on the big screen. Of course there are a lot of films that need the big screen to be worth their money but as opposed to them Japn is something really really great touching our hearts AND senses AND also it is not a silly movie! brains.".

First of all the woman in the film is unbelievable in the most exalted sense of the word. She is the anchor of it all and so naturally unassuming and modest. I don't want to give anything away but as Reygadas the director implies in a surreal beach sequence beautiful beyond ... I'll leave it at that. Also the most memorable singing sequence near the end of the film with this peasant labourer after he accepts the gift of a drink from the woman during a work break from smashing up her barn or maybe from pretend filming. I mean who says beautiful singing has to be technically beautiful? What he sings and how he sings it beats anything I've ever seen and that says a whole bunch. Anyways a film definitely worth seeing in view of the overinflated monetary and materialistic attitudes of this new order world of ours. What is it we want? Can we really have everything? That's just one of the many questions posed to us from Reygada's film. Stick with it. The film may seem sluggish at the beginning but it might just blow you right out of the water or cesspool in the second half. I'd give it a perfect ten if I were more spiritual but Doestoevsky most of us are not. Reygadas comes damn close though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Japon Carlos Reygadas' startling directorial debut is a mysterious film that will divide audiences. Mr. Reygadas working with the talented cinematographer Diego Martinez Vignatti takes us along for a ride to an unknown part of Mexico where he sets this complex tale about a man at a crossroad of his life. Shot entirely on location in the state of Hidalgo Japon gives us a bird's eye view of life in those forgotten areas where time seems to stand still forever.The man at the center of the story wants to commits suicide. For that he has chosen going back to this desolate part of the country where he wants to do himself in. He suddenly discovers there is a life out there he didn't even know existed. When he befriends the older woman Ascen he mistakenly calls her Asuncion and she corrects him it is Ascencion an odd name for anyone to have.The title is probably related to the harikiri he intends to commit and it's the only reference between the title and what's going on in the mind of the would be suicide. When he asks Ascen if she would have sex with him we are shocked. Isn't she after all much too old to be having sex? Yet when she complies what we see is something like a redemption and Ascen is the object where the man suddenly becomes human again knowing the sacrifice she has made in order to redeem him.Many people have suggested an affinity of Mr. Reygadas with the Iranian filmmaker Kiarostami. Both men have dealt with this same theme but where Kiarostami becomes repetitive in what he gives the viewer Mr. Reygadas takes a different approach that rewards us as viewers. Mr. Reygadas also has to be congratulated by the use of nonactors that give intense performances that no other trained professionals would ever dreamed of giving.Carlos Reygadas will no doubt infuriate some of his audiences but at the same time he shows he has talent and imagination.".

	onyx:emotionText "Japon Carlos Reygadas' startling directorial debut is a mysterious film that will divide audiences. Mr. Reygadas working with the talented cinematographer Diego Martinez Vignatti takes us along for a ride to an unknown part of Mexico where he sets this complex tale about a man at a crossroad of his life. Shot entirely on location in the state of Hidalgo Japon gives us a bird's eye view of life in those forgotten areas where time seems to stand still forever.The man at the center of the story wants to commits suicide. For that he has chosen going back to this desolate part of the country where he wants to do himself in. He suddenly discovers there is a life out there he didn't even know existed. When he befriends the older woman Ascen he mistakenly calls her Asuncion and she corrects him it is Ascencion an odd name for anyone to have.The title is probably related to the harikiri he intends to commit and it's the only reference between the title and what's going on in the mind of the would be suicide. When he asks Ascen if she would have sex with him we are shocked. Isn't she after all much too old to be having sex? Yet when she complies what we see is something like a redemption and Ascen is the object where the man suddenly becomes human again knowing the sacrifice she has made in order to redeem him.Many people have suggested an affinity of Mr. Reygadas with the Iranian filmmaker Kiarostami. Both men have dealt with this same theme but where Kiarostami becomes repetitive in what he gives the viewer Mr. Reygadas takes a different approach that rewards us as viewers. Mr. Reygadas also has to be congratulated by the use of nonactors that give intense performances that no other trained professionals would ever dreamed of giving.Carlos Reygadas will no doubt infuriate some of his audiences but at the same time he shows he has talent and imagination.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film though not close to perfect is a beautifully crafted work that uses cinema to create poetry. It seems that the director might have been heavily influenced by Italian neorealist cinema think de Sica and uses nonprofessional actors who convincingly take on their roles. The story explores sex and romance among people normally associated with being at the end of their lives and no longer in need of that type of affection. The older woman lead is brilliant and the cinematography captures the unromanticized bleakness of life in rural Mexico. The problem with the film is that it seems a bit pretentious when it becomes too cryptic. Also at times the story meanders and I still don't get the title but overall a solid piece of work and a nice respite from bigbudget Hollywood films.".

	schema:headline " A suicidal traveler seeks peace in his final days.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is not about how people need love even if they are old or anything like that. The person who wrote that missed the point of the film completely. It is a portrayal of rural Mexican life from the point of view of an educated male artist. It is very raw with a lot of death and sexuality. The protagonist El Hombre has decided to end his life for unknown reasons. Perhaps he has had enough of this life. The reasons themselves are insignificant really. El Hombre continually tries to defy the cultural norms of this canyon village as men attempt to take an old woman's Ascen house. He is an outsider who has his own opinions of how men should act and treat women. But it's really not about feminist issues either. The fact that El Hombre is powerless to change the minds of the male villagers is secondary to the obvious fact that these people do not want to be changed. Ascen serves pulque and tequila to the men while they rest from the task of destroying and relocating the stones of her house. She is completely subservient to the men but never complains. She wants to go along with them when they leave. El Hombre is no better. Even though the viewer might see him as a somewhat noble character he is one and the same as the rest of the males. He realizes this himself this is my interpretation as he is having sex with Ascen. While trying to seem compassionate for the old woman he is still sleeping in her barn eating her food and eventually fornicating with her. He eventually is left alone realizing that he has not and never will experienced or understood all there is in this world. The final scene is a tragic one consisting of all of the men who tore the house down including Ascen lying dead from a train collision. Arvo Part's amazing composition from Tabula Rasa plays over the scene which is a very circular and overlapping piece. In my opinion this demonstrates the theme that nothing really matterswe all live and die and feel. We try to establish rules and beliefs of what's right in life but no one is ever really sure. Nature is central to this film and I believe director Reygada has done a remarkable job in simplifying while simultaneously confusing this aimless life we lead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carlos Reygadas' film Japon is a breathtaking work of image making rich with scenes that unfold in unbroken time story untold and symbolic gestures and references left un authoritatively open to interpretation. It's a cinema of the immanent that accomplishes transcendence in Deleuze's terms transcendental empiricism. Reygadas uses image and sound with a strong degree of influence from Andrei Tarkovsky Bresson Kiarostami Ozu Rosselini and though he's not mentioned among Reygadas' favorite filmmakers in the DVD interview Hungary's Bela Tarr. Actors are nonprofessional the script is loose and and scenes are allowed to run in the manner of Bela Tarr and Tarkovsky for as long as they take or for as long as they remain interesting. His camera use suggests his presence as the film's director an eye wandering through the lens for an image that may have little to do with the action in front of the camera. Actors are captured for their authenticity and reality veriteacute and their lack of professionalism only serves the film's higher motives. While this would seem to be a highly religious film or symbolic at least Reygadas denies having such intentions. The Madonna Jesus Christ miraculous events the sacred and profane come together in a Russian Mexico bound by the use of music familiar to Tarkovsky fans Arvo Part's Cantus to Benjamin Britten. The film even begins with a child a tree and the Cantus that closes Tarkovsky's film The Sacrifice which also ends with the child and the tree. It seems the film is a sequel to the sacrifice. And in fact our lead character a Mexican Siddhartha questing with cane or Bela Tarr's Irimias from Stntang? is struggling to end his life while allowing himself to be saved by a Madonnalike Mexican villager whose faith is nonetheless redeemed in a genuine human sympathy. Tarkovsky on the other hand often chooses the miraculous. She is the Samaritan a story referred to by the film's final roadside conclusion I'll not give anything away. As Reygadas claims life is in the little things. Though he clearly means that life is greater than the little things the ten thousand things a Taoist concept for the biggest number for everything the World. A transcendental empiricism Spinozist filmmaking affectimage through the shot. You will live in this film.".

The director  Carlos Reygadas really makes this trip worth going to. His minimalistic and visually perfect pictures of the tedious landscape make it eventually' beautiful. Just when you think of the director's devotion to the leading female character it's worth the whole time and money you spent. He presents her in a glorious light shows her generosity and humanity her kindness her simplicity in a way to stun you to show you the real human being to make you admire her despite her age and looks. And you do. What a genius performance from the 79. years old newcomer Magdalena Flores. She literally shines in this role.It's really one of the most poetic films I've seen in years and it never gets boring the 140 minutes just fly by and in the end you want to see more and more. Okay it is disturbing at times  some images are for a strong stomach  just remember the decapitation of the bird the horse with its intestines out the dead cat the agonizing bawling and the last seconds of a pig's life horses mating the full frontal masturbation the two leading characters having sex but it's all redeemed in the glorious music the operatic arias and the phenomenal breathtaking haunting and emotional ending. It reminded me of The Piano  Ascen definitely knew that greed is a sin her nephew was the main cause that the film ends tragically IMO  he caused all the trouble and that she's not a sinner. But maybe that's why she went on the cart lorry because she thought she is. But eventually she maybe sensed that something like that will happen and that she chose death she chose to take that ride she wanted to stay with her house or what was left of it and even if that costs her life. like in The Piano when Ada chooses to go down with the piano no matter if she survives or not.

Although it's a very very simple love story you can feel the internal beauty that the director want to express if you can calm very down to see it. Sometimes while seeing it I even think the plot is no more important. All you should do is to feel the beautiful things in it. Takako Matsu is famous most because of her lovely performance in many Japanese soaps. However we can still see her excellent performance in this movie. Meanwhile Shunji Iwai shouldn't be forgotten. He is a very gifted young movie director. He is simply an artist. You can know more about Japan movies after seeing his works. Frankly I love this movie completely due to Shunji Iwai and lovely Takako Matsu.".

In April Story a 1998 film Shunji Iwai continues his sensitive interpretations of the difficulties young people face in stepping gingerly into the adult world.

For the shy and innocent Uzuki Noreno Takako Matsu however coming to Musashino University in Tokyo from rural Hokkaido may be the psychological equivalent of landing on the moon. In the first week alone she faces the not too delicate questioning of fellow students about her background and why she came to college the loneliness of being away from home for the first time and the confusing time of signing up for classes and studying such strange topics as Investment in the Japanese Economy and Cultural Anthropology.Although withdrawn Uzuki is adventurous enough to join a FlyFishing Club at the urging of her only friend Saeko Sano Rumi but is embarrassed when she confuses one Brad Pitt movie for another in a discussion with the group leader. One of the loveliest scenes takes place when the newly recruited club members stand in an open field and cast their fishing rods rhythmically into the air. Uzuki's exploration of her surroundings brings daily trips to the local bookstore where she is intrigued by a bushyhaired young clerk an encounter with a harassing gentleman in a movie theater and the inviting sounds of a street band. Fearfully she reaches out to her neighbors but achieves little result. It is only late in the film that the real reason for her attending this particular university emerges and in a heavy spring rain that paints the city with a refreshing glow the magic of first love begins to unfold.".

The reason she chose to go to the university in Tokyo is because her unrequited crush on boy one year her senior is attending it. The film could have been longer and explored their relationship but then it wouldn't have ended as poetically as it does right at the moment they meet.

For example when Uzuki asks how late the bookstore is open what she is really asking is What are the chances I'll be able to see today the man I am in love with? I felt that this movie was a lot like literature in that we had the opportunity to fill in a lot of details with our imaginations. With this in mind the second viewing was a remarkable experience. Check out the group of people for whom the moving van has to reverse for. Here we have what will ultimately be off screen and after the credits the happy ending but we see it implied at the beginning of the movie.The name Mushashino itself as in both the university and bookstore It refers to the wide plains upon which Tokyo has been built. Even more than a thousand years ago in what some say is the world's first novel The Tale of Genji Mushashino was considered a poetic place of exile and romantic yearning.That jarring samurai movie may have been wellchosen as well for its symbolic ramifications. It was about Oda Nobunaga who was the first person to come close to achieving a unification of Japan until he was assassinated by Mitsuhide Akechi A story of ambush and treachery just as what was going on with the creep making moves on Uzuki in the movie theater. But in the samurai movie Oda Nobunaga through trickery of his own survived that ambush as did Uzuki. Her fleeing brings to mind Ieyasu who in the historical time depicted rapidly fled that dangerous situation with the assistance of the ninja Hattori Hanzo. So we can even make this part of April Story into a kind of ninja movie if we wish with the protagonist successfully fleeing danger and later establishing a grand unification with her soon to be lover of her own. Like the one passing in front of the moving van.Not only the movie theater creep was a threat to her fulfilling her chosen destiny but also the leader of the flyfishing club who wanted to catch her. He even got the hook of a lure into her sweater. But what did he want with her after all? He wanted to use her If you get one other person to join our club this reel is yours for free.Here in the U.S. young lovers have been known to write or carve their initials within the outline of a heart. In Japan they write their names vertically under an umbrella on either side of the handle. And the color of the umbrella she chose the Japanese character for crimson can be synonymous for passion.I found that the movie resonates deeply if we apply some attention and imagination.What a pleasure it is to watch it and the amazing performance of Takako Matsu who expressed so much and so deeply with so few external manifestations. By the way if anyone wondered about the location she rides her bicycle over a blue pedestrian bridge that had written on it that it was in Kunitachi in the western part of Tokyo next to Tachikawa.".

But now the fun is gone lost to these insipid Billy Zane scenes which had barely existed and these voiceovers from the book that make me want to gag. Everything is so melodramatic. I know the star is the producer's wife but even she was so much better in the original cut. This cut really does make it seem like a vanity project a reel for Surel.Why hire the director of The Pretty Girl for such a task?Having heard the film was recut from scratch and seeing the final results I can only wonder WHY? Did the producers want to make it unwatchable? If that was their goal they succeeded.And if they wanted to give us the sappiest collection of mismatched tunes ever ditto. I so remember the Getup Kids song Mass Pike playing during the road trip when Dushku and Surel are driving in the red Mustang...how cool was that? So cool that the producer pulled it and every lick of the director's music.And the opening...this brilliant montage of Paris with a Djangotype tune in the background...also gone.What's left...a lot of Zane and Surel...overacting.There should be a law here like in France where the director controls the film! The Kiss could be exhibit 1.".

So cool that the producer pulled it and every lick of the director's music.And the opening...this brilliant montage of Paris with a Djangotype tune in the background...also gone.What's left...a lot of Zane and Surel...overacting.There should be a law here like in France where the director controls the film! The Kiss could be exhibit 1.";

This is what the producers wanted me to do these are the actors featured most prominently on the DVD cover art. I was suckered which is unfortunate but I'm not mad I watched it.The writing direction production value and makeup are nothing I can complain about . This is a cute idea for a story and the music is pleasant and the costuming is really great subtly but instantly telling you someone is an exprofessor or party animal or all business. The actors mentioned above really came to play making the most of dialogue that varied from mediocre to cheesy though the cheesy can be passed off as being quoted from a manuscript that is the center of the films plot.My lone complaint though this is a major one is the actress playing the lead Cara. She's awful. Atrocious. Community Theater bad. She has one facial expression this goofy awkward smile which goes away when she says her lines then returns instantly. Every actor around her exudes charisma and demands your attention just by being there but Francoise Surel the DVD credits say she's a former makeup artist is a blank slate her several costume changes are more interesting than she is.All I can think is the director cast his girlfriend which was unfortunate because the rest of the movie works so well around her. Ultimately it doesn't matter because even with a skilled experienced or interesting actress in the lead the film still wouldn't be worthy of a theatrical release but it was still sweet and charming nonetheless. Perhaps a subplot would have helped though it doesn't feel like it the film only runs 80 minutes.I can see the producers sitting in their office... Wow Terrence Stamp said yes? We're LUCKY to get Terrence Stamp. Eliza Dushku said yes? Wow she's really popular we're LUCKY to get Eliza Dushku. Ileana Douglas said yes? Wow she's an indieQUEEN we're LUCKY to get Ileana Douglas. Now we need to cast the romantic lead to really bring in an audience... hmm.... do you think Francoise Surel is available?Yeah she's totally some dudes girlfriend. She might be nice in real life but on film she's just a 6foot skinnyasarail liability with Dcups which seems unlikely. Still this charming slightly predictable movie overcomes her... by a hair. It's sweet romantic and better than whatever is on Lifetime this week.... worth a look.".

I disagree with the hateful comments here by other reviewers. I found her perfect for the part. The only problem here I found was the part where the old boyfriend of Cara's is still in a funk after 10 yearshas not remarried and as I said after 10 years all he can seem to paint is portraits of a girl he dated in college. This parallels with the 20 year mourning done by the Terence Stamp character. The parallels are just too too unrealistic. Also that the male writer character in the past had no British accent and 20 years later he does. In any event it is a sweet film well acted but very very unrealistic. A very happy ending here but in real life such a happy ending would never ever ever happen. You can bet that the boyfriend remarried. You decide.".

The casting was good the music brought back happy memories I watched it 14 years after it was made and the story line was fun. Because Mollie's feelings and the ups and downs of raising children were depicted so well I suspected the story was written by a woman. Sure enough Amy Heckerling both wrote and directed it. Bravo Amy! You know? I bet babies and toddlers really DO think many of those things. Now I'm eager to watch the third movie in this trilogy.".

But where is she for most of the movie? There is so much of the parents fighting and problems with the goofy brotherinlaw that it seems the kids take a second seat in this film. I was bored at times with the long fighting scenes. They were neither interesting nor funny. The pregnancy was fastforwarded through  I suppose they had no more ideas for it after the first movie  and Mikey's jealousy for his sister gets less attention than the potty trainingwhich is far less interesting. The burglar story is too unbelievable to be funny. And the music video parts are weird  why are there so many songs? the Elvis impersonation is pretty coolby John Travolta but the rest of the classic pop songs should have been left out.There are some really cute sisterbrother scenes but this movie could have been so much better funnier and more interesting if they had let the kids play the main role.

This is just one of the many heartfelt moments that displays the family presence in this film.Regardless of the lovehate relationship between Mikey and Julie the performances of the young children truly define the typical lovehate relationships between siblings everywhere.John Travolta accurately depicted the role of the underpaid and underappreciated spouse.Kirstie Alley does a great job as the wifeleftbehind. And as the One in the middle in regards to being caught in the middle between spouse and sibling.This movie mirrors reality in many areas. One specific thing that happen in real life every day is sad tale of the children blaming themselves for their parents problems. And blaming their other siblings. This film showed how that is not true at all.Overall I give this movie an 8 out of 10.

I have to admit that I can't listen to Jealous Guy even now without shedding a tear.  Guess I'm just a little over sensitive oI also like how they dealt with the marital problems of Mollie and James. Things like this happen to many people... and I'm glad they showed it in a sensitive manner.  Life isn't always happy and smiles.Although I have to address a previous comment... you would think Mikey would have a little bit better vocabulary at 2 or 3 years of age.  Maybe he's just quiet.  Children progress at different rates... and I know of one little boy who even at 4 couldn't be well understood when he spoke some of the time.  So that could be the reasoning.If any film is a live action Rugrats however though I liked Baby Geniuses OK it's this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "Say what you will about this film and I will admit it's not quite as genius as the first but still heartwarming nonetheless.Following the story of the now model family Mom Dad son and daughter you now get to see things from a little girl's point of view.It even shows you aspects of birth that weren't covered in the first film watch it and see what I mean which I would say is somewhat educational... and good to show that everything doesn't always work out.Since I have had minimal sibling rivalry with my brother for a number of reasons it's almost hard to see things from that point of view... but even if you're not familiar with it you begin to realize how it may feel during the film.  I have to admit that I can't listen to Jealous Guy even now without shedding a tear.  Guess I'm just a little over sensitive oI also like how they dealt with the marital problems of Mollie and James. Things like this happen to many people... and I'm glad they showed it in a sensitive manner.  Life isn't always happy and smiles.Although I have to address a previous comment... you would think Mikey would have a little bit better vocabulary at 2 or 3 years of age.  Maybe he's just quiet.  Children progress at different rates... and I know of one little boy who even at 4 couldn't be well understood when he spoke some of the time.  So that could be the reasoning.If any film is a live action Rugrats however though I liked Baby Geniuses OK it's this one.";

I was born in 1988 and grew up watching this movie. My friends and I all loved it. It's unique and it shows us more of the JamesMolly relationship.

The movies portrays the effect of the friction and powerplay between the couple on young Mikey. Mikey is not old enough to know the reason their parents fight he just knows that they are yelling and assumes he has something to do with it or that his sister had something to do with it. This causes some love lost between the siblings notably when mikey rips off the head of julies favorite doll. But common sense and love prevails and things work out well for all through testing circumstances. The Mr Toilet Man bit was funny. Mikeys Conversations with Eddievoiced by damon Wayanwas the funniest part of the movie. Eddies giving potty tips to mikey was really great.

They had half of the Earth's population to choose from and out of all those options out of every woman on the planet they picked... her? This is one of three pieces of... entertainment? no that's not it this doesn't qualify as that... that I've seen her in and were her parts permanently taken out from all three it would not exactly reduce me to crying in the fetal position. The reaction it would produce from me would rather be in the other end of the spectrum. Various castmembers return not all having anything to do. More nightmare sequences one misusing a master in comedy. Gilbert Gottfried is brought in to perform his shtick but interjects no laughs. So is Damon WayansWayans' I'm sure need to do no acting to play kids or their voices anyway. This time around the couple fight. Their differences are yet again set up against each other in a manner that I would presume is meant to entertain. So is most of the movie one would guess but it tends to inspire boredom and restlessness instead. More scenes that seem to have no other purpose for existing than to bring the running time close to 90 minutesthough this didn't even make it to that... thank goodness. Progun people take a pounding. At least the kids stop talking after this one. I recommend this to... I don't know people who can stand Roseanne andor needless sequels. 410".

So is Damon WayansWayans' I'm sure need to do no acting to play kids or their voices anyway. This time around the couple fight. Their differences are yet again set up against each other in a manner that I would presume is meant to entertain. So is most of the movie one would guess but it tends to inspire boredom and restlessness instead. More scenes that seem to have no other purpose for existing than to bring the running time close to 90 minutesthough this didn't even make it to that... thank goodness. Progun people take a pounding. At least the kids stop talking after this one. I recommend this to... I don't know people who can stand Roseanne andor needless sequels. 410";

	schema:headline " I Confess To Seeing This Movie In Theaters As a Child . . . Twice";
	schema:reviewBody "I just thought I would get that confession out of the way and into the open. Yes I went to see this in theaters twice when I was 11 years old. I could list to you the excuses I have such as the fact that my parents paid for my ticket and there were only six theaters in my local multiplex at the time and I had already seen Forrest Gump. I could go on. The truth is that when I first saw a matine showing of this film with a friend neither of us thought it was a bad movie. Then I went to see another matine showing a few days later on a rainy day with my brother and a babysitter and they both hated the film. Not disliked mind you but hated it. They weren't the only ones. In the sixteen years since the film's release I have heard nothing but bad things about it. It was released on VHS once never on DVD and Roger Ebert's review I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audienceinsulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it is now more famous than the movie itself.As a kid I knew North wasn't a perfect film. In fact its major flaw was and still is the major copout and frankly lazy ending that I won't give away. However I thought it was enjoyable enough it had a creative but highly unrealistic premise and I liked and still like Elijah Wood. Before seeing the movie again after so many years I wonder what I missed about it in the first place that other people didn't. After seeing it as a 27 year old I wonder how I could have missed these things to begin with.I think what disappointed people the most about this movie was the fact that it had an allstar cast a likable lead an accomplished director Rob Reiner who had not directed a bad film before this one and was based on a book written by Alan Zweibel one of the original Saturday Night Live writers who also wrote the screenplay. I haven't read that book but the idea of a child leaving his parents is more sad than funny.Wood plays a child named North who is a stellar student athlete and actor yet he is worried that his parents don't pay enough attention to him simply because they ignore him while arguing one night at the dinner table. His successful legal divorce from his parents causes a contrived media circus resulting in kids having control over their parents. Such a revolution is spearheaded by North's acquaintance Winchell Matthew McCurley a journalist for his school's newspaper who reminded me then of Stuart Minkus from Boy Meets World but now reminds me of Dick Cheney. In an even more contrived circumstance Winchell becomes head of a major corporation and plots to kill North when he decides to return to his original parents.Throughout the film North goes around the world searching for better parents. He stays with various sets of adoptive parents. They include a couple in Texas Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire who dress like cowboys you find at the Ice Capades Alaskans Graham Greene and Kathy Bates who send their elderly father Abe Vigoda out to sea to die in an archaic ritual that hasn't been practiced in 150 years and Hawaiian parents who are all too eager to show North's rear end on a highway billboard. It makes me sick writing about these jokes so you can imagine what it's like to watch it.Seeing this as a kid I never took these plot points seriously perhaps because I never thought about divorcing my parents. Seeing it again as an adult here's what I missed that was so bad about the movie the awful ethnic stereotyping that came in the form of tasteless oneliners and myopic character depictions. The worst came in the form of Kathy Bates putting on a blackface equivalent to play an Eskimo. I cringe now at the terrible joke made by the Hawaiian Governor Ho Keone Young about his wife Lauren Tom and her inability to procreate Hawaii is a lush and fertile land. In fact there is only one barren spot on all of our islands. Unfortunately it's Mrs. Ho.. If I were Mrs. Ho I would have kicked him in the balls.We've all done foolish things as children. My foolish thing was the 12 dollars that went to waste from seeing this movie twice although they were both matinees so I saved some money. The important thing is that I know better now and I reviewed this film recently before writing this review. This rule should apply to every amateur critic on this site the way you remember movies you saw years ago is not the same as the way these movies actually are.Siskel  Ebert declared North the worst movie of 1994 and looking back their reasoning was good. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? No. Worse movies came out in 1994 It's Pat The Movie and Exit To Eden come especially to mind and any movie written or directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer make North look like Citizen Kane and I doubt Ebert would disagree. However there's no question that there's only one barren spot in Rob Reiner's directing career. Unfortunately it's this movie.".

Furthermore I've always had a soft spot for the underdog the ugly duckling the universally vilified always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously when I heard of North the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner with its stellar cast and very bad reputation I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could North be? Or more accurately put how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like?Well... North is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults the philosophical narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with offcolour jokes and somewhat waspish clichs that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where North really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass the Hawaiian episode springs to mind in that respect.Of course one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place like any other Rob Reiner film and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that North is never funny which in itself is pure torture for a socalled comedy but offensive and ultimately meanspirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters the main villain here chief suspect among these deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life.I so wanted to like this film if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone which I admit is rather obnoxious of me.

I guess everyone is entitled to make at least one mistake. Even if this particular one is really tough to forgive. If he hadn't proved himself so thoroughly after this I'm not sure one could disassociate him from this. I haven't read the novel. Can it be as awful as this? I sure hope not. This is painfully stupid unbelievably offensive and never actually funny. The jokes are disturbing sick weird andor poor and often based on ridiculous stereotypes that serve no other purpose than to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the two guys who wrote the script for this Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman have not been out of their own country in their entire lives. This wastes so much acting and comedic talent that you have to wonder if there was some sort of bet involved to see if they could actually get all of these skilled people and have them recite horrible material and see if anyone would outright quit. I'm not sure I'd say that Elijah was one of them at this point but then again all the child performers in this are annoying. There is brief moderately strong language in this. The DVD has a trailer and about about ten minutes worth of interviews with the director and cast. I recommend... well not this not for anyone. If you do find yourself watching at least a little of this I urge you to treat yourself to the Nostalgia Critic's video review of it. 110".

If he hadn't proved himself so thoroughly after this I'm not sure one could disassociate him from this. I haven't read the novel. Can it be as awful as this? I sure hope not. This is painfully stupid unbelievably offensive and never actually funny. The jokes are disturbing sick weird andor poor and often based on ridiculous stereotypes that serve no other purpose than to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the two guys who wrote the script for this Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman have not been out of their own country in their entire lives. This wastes so much acting and comedic talent that you have to wonder if there was some sort of bet involved to see if they could actually get all of these skilled people and have them recite horrible material and see if anyone would outright quit. I'm not sure I'd say that Elijah was one of them at this point but then again all the child performers in this are annoying. There is brief moderately strong language in this. The DVD has a trailer and about about ten minutes worth of interviews with the director and cast. I recommend... well not this not for anyone. If you do find yourself watching at least a little of this I urge you to treat yourself to the Nostalgia Critic's video review of it. 110";

Do kids movies talk about men having blood in their stool or boys balls sticking to their legs in hot weather? Do kids movies have children utter words like asshole?  Do kids movies have the main character apparently get shot in the head?  It's one thing to have elements that will appeal to adults but those elements shouldn't force parents to cover their kids' ears.North is a bad movie.

Kids don't get out of their homes when their parents are molesting them beating them and neglecting them and North gets out because his parents don't let him run wild like he doesn't have any?  The movie is just lame. Maybe it's amusing to 10 year olds who think that parents should let them do whatever they want but the world just isn't like that.  So get over it. The only good thing about this movie...of which many other commentaries have mentioned was Bruce Willis in the pink bunny suit.  I bet he will never live that down.  He's probably looking back on this movie and crying.  It was nice to see him in a 'family' movie. 2 out of 10.  The 2 points are for the bunny costume.".

	schema:headline " A Monty Pythonishstyle social satire the US couldn't take.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the closest Hollywood has come to doing a Monty Pythonish spin of American society at least until the SOUTH PARK movie but unfortunately it was made at the time when America took itself far too seriously and was too priggish to handle satirical jabs especially compared to British Australian or Canadian societies. It took the success of animated TV series like The Simpsons and South Park in order to get America to lighten up about itself. It is very telling that most American critics enjoyed the poke at French society yet couldn't stomach anything closer to home. It is also interesting that the only classic US geographic stereotype not included here is hippyish Californians!The movie isn't without it's faults. The assassination scene in particular feels like a stock Hollywood action scenario that's been tacked on at the end. And the use of a prepubescent boy in a provocative advertising commercial is quite tasteless. But most of the time this consists of wellstaged comic set pieces with the tongueincheek feel of a usual standup routine. My fav line is So THAT'S why we had to stop 47 time! which is delivered with zeal  especially in the original theatrical release you have to see the story to geddit. And it also has in the Texas scene one of the best staged musical numbers in modern American cinema along with MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING. It is also interesting to compare the fictional critical reaction to North in Fiddler on the Roof to the reallife critical reaction to Haley Joel Osment in THE SIXTH SENSEA.I.The movie deals with two central concepts. The first is the stock presentation of the young whizzkid genius common at the time with the attendant attitude that the World Owes Me a Living. The prime dramatic example is Wesley Crusher of the TV series Star TrekTNG. The second related theme is the way that in the 80s and early 90s Hollywood and to a lesser extent America generally tended to think of children almost purely as undersized adults  with the attached responsibilities and privileges. This film isn't the only one to deal with this other examples include BIG SHOTS THE LITTLE RASCALS HOME ALONE 2  3 and even the TV series Uncle Buck. Attitudes have changed slightly since Hollywood's notorious backlash against child actor Macaulay Culkin and reallife incidents like the young girl who crashed piloting a plane across the US and the gradeschool boy who was suspended for kissing a girl have caused America to rethink the issue somewhat.Prior to this movie was the film IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES starring a young Drew Barrymore and though it handled a child's divorce case a lot more crassly and tastelessly it didn't receive nearly half the critical outrage this movie did. Even more amazing an almost identical storyline was revamped read ripped off in the film RUSHMORE and though it's a lot more pretentious and ponderous in its delivery the critics lauded it. Apparently having a whizzkid neurotically stalk a gradeschool teacher among other things is more critically commendable than having him learn there's no place like home. Go figure!One of the regrettable outcomes of this movie is that talented actor Elijah Wood went from playing broadranging allrounder variety of roles leading up to this film to playing almost exclusively standard rote grungy drama roles afterwards. I halfsuspect he's been put off comic roles for life and quite frankly I wouldn't blame him  though it seems a crying shame! He showed a great deal of range and personality as a kid and the Hollywood system squelched it!In summary this is a flawed but still widely underappreciated satire of America's more eccentric social mores which the American general public and professional film critics in particular weren't maturely sophisticated enough to handle.".

	schema:headline " North really went south fast. It's awful but it's a guilty pleasure of mine.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie directed by Rob Reiner is often regarded as one of the worst films ever made but somehow I kinda like it. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of things wrong and unpleasant about this movie. The movie was often panned by many critics for its humorless jokes adult content racial insensitivity ethnic stereotyping coldhearted characters references to pedophilia and incomprehensible plot with an awful twist ending. I do agree with them but I find myself defending the movie more because it's told in the eyes of a trouble often neglect young child North Elijah Woods who wish to have better parents. Without spoiling too much I believe there seem to be more to the film that it's stating out. Based on the novel North The Tale of a 9YearOld Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel the movie started out with North having a panic attack and begins to lose consciousness. Call it a depressing fan theory but I really think the whole movie secretly is about North's final thoughts. He either about to die or in a comalike dream wondering if his parents honestly love him. It wasn't his parents in a coma it was him. This would make sense why his secret spot looks like selfmade purgatory and why his guardian angel Bruce Willis comes out as the Easter Bunny. It's a hint to the idea of resurrection. North is stuck there until he can come to terms if he wants to live with his parents or not. This would explain why the rest of the story is told in a childlike view of the world. Everywhere that he visits is shown like a cartoon stereotype matter. It's ironic that North is his name because everybody that follows a compass believes North is prime direction but it wasn't until North step out his borders that the film shows how little he knows of the world and how truly directionless he is. There is a scene that explains that North fails in geography that somewhat proves this theory. Still all these fan theories doesn't excuse the movie for how stupid the movie is. There are scenes in the movie that are so obnoxious that it was a bit unbearable. The worst for me has to be the musical number in Texas that I found annoying ripping hard to rip away 1959's TV show Bonanza and 1978's show Dallas. The whole journey of racist insensitivity was a bit rough. The most offensive has to be the whole Eskimo 'flow' scene. At least all the characters kinda stand out. It's so weird seeing so many big names actors playing insulting characters. I really think actors like Kathy Bates Reba McEntire Dan Aykroyd and others probably fired their agents after seeing their performance in this film. Other actors seem not to care too much for the film and just wing it like Bruce Willis Richard Belzer  Alan Arkin. Then there are those actors that play it as if they were just doing another Seinfeld episode like Jason Alexander  Julia Louis Dreyfus. Some actors really did put some work into their characters such as John Ritter  Elijah Woods. It's also worth noting that the movie even has young Scarlett Johansson in a minor role. The movie took friendly jabs at film and televisions references such as the squeaky clean 1950's family suburbia 1954's Father Knows Best 1957's Leave it to Beaver and 1960's Andy Griffin Show. It downright nearly parody them in the Nelson sequence. Other good things about the film is how the movie was shot by cinematographer Adam Greenberg. The opening with all the snowglobes foreshadowing North's adventure was pretty cool to see. This movie is the film that got me hook on collecting snow globes so thank you for that. A lot of work also went into the exotic sets. My favorite has to be the Eskimo village where everything looks like it's made of ice. It remind me of the Flintstone TV show with its fantasy juxtaposition of modern everyday objects with that of ice world setting. That was pretty cool. The movie made great use of all the locations. It was breathtaking beautiful. One thing I have to say was amazing is the theme song from Marc Shaiman. It was so whimsical but charming. Despite the allstar cast and a good director at the helm North will probably be most wellknown as the film that got famous film critic Roger Ebert superass mad about. No doubt about it North will continue to receive aggressively negative reviews. Is the movie the worst thing out there? No. I have saw worst. Overall It's bad but it can be 'so bad it's good' somewhat watchable if you turn off your brain. Check it out if you want to but I don't recommended unless you want a headache.".

	schema:reviewBody "Say you have 40 million to make a movie. You have a great director and a wonderful cast topped off with a great young actor. The story is nothing too big so the 40 mil should cover it. You seem to have the makings for a potential classic. Nothing could go wrong with this right? Right?But the movie you'd have would be North. And apparently things did go wrong. Many...many things. Or possibly the only thing that went wrong was the story chosen. The story is about an 11 year old boy named North now how could a movie NOT be funny with such an unusual name for a character? played by a preFrodo Elijah Woods who feels his parents are mistreating him because they don't pay attention to him. So he gets a lawyer who he finds literally chasing an ambulance haha and divorces his parents. Now because he's such an overachieving little wretch letters come pouring in from families who would LOVE to have North as a part of their family.Bruce Willis plays...well I don't really know WHAT Bruce Willis plays. Whatever he has of a character is too useless to be a guardian angel. He doesn't really DO anything. He first shows up in an Easter Bunny costume the movie just keeps getting funnier and funnier and sits next to North in his North's secret spot a chair in the middle of a department store. Now maybe Alan Zweibel's definition of 'secret' differs from mine but shouldn't a 'secret spot' be a spot that nobody else knows about? I'm pretty sure at least a couple people noticed that GASP there's a chair in the middle of the department store.Watching North is like receiving a shotgun blast to the crotch stretched out over 87 minutes only without as much permanent damage. Some of the people involved have done so many other great movies that I can forgive them for this. However Alan Zweibel has not only done nothing of note besides this he wrote the story this movie was based on. The script is the sole reason this movie is bad. It certainly isn't the actors it's not the director Rob Reiner. The plot twists or attempt thereof are lame and the final one is just insulting to anybody who has the misfortune of watching this movie.Avoid this movie at all costs. No matter what is on the other channels or at the video store nothing is as bad or worse than North.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the look and sound of it North is a simple familyfriendly movie about a young boy named North Elijah Wood who divorces himself from his parents to search for a new set because he feels they do not appreciate him. Underneath this facade is a film that like a shark hiding below the surface waiting to strike at unsuspecting victims. I can now see why the late Gene Siskel described this movie as first class junk and trash.North is what can be described as a perfect child and has a perfect life except in one area his parents Jason Alexander and Julia Louis Dreyfus. North feels his parents do not appreciate him or pay him as much attention as they should. We are shown this by his parents not paying attention to him at the dinner table while they are in a heated argument. This one incident leads to him suffering in other areas of his life including in academics acting and sports. North goes to his secret spot where he talks with a man in an Easter Bunny costume Bruce Willis and then decides that he will divorce himself from them. With the help of his lawyer Arthur Belt Jon Lovitz a Lionel Hutzesque lawyer who unlike Hutz from The Simpsons is very unlikable and unfunny. The other person who helps him out is his friend Winchell Matthew McCurley who with Belt is planning on using North's story to have children take over.North wins the case and travels across the world to places like Texas Alaska China France and New York with the stereotypical representations of the people going from seemingly innocent comedy to downright racist and hurtful. North meets an array of parents including Texans Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire to a nice New York couple the Nelsons the late John Ritter and Faith Ford. Along the way North realizes that what he really wants is to be with his real parents and goes to meet up with them.At the same time a subplot goes on about the illogical and incomprehensible plan of getting children to take over and put Belt in office. The kids act like evil geniuses while the adults are bumbling buffoons who go along with this or are so frightened by the idea of their kids leaving them that they will bow to their every demand. Their plan even in the film's universe is illogical and wouldn't work. Going along with this plan are strangely a number of adults including a hit man named Al Robert Costanzo who is tasked with taking North out so he does not return to his parents. Al lies in wait while North finally reunites with his parents and is shot only to discover that the film sank to the level of having it's events all be a dream.Another large problem with the movie is the character of North. North wants to divorce himself from his parents because he says they are selfish and only care about themselves and leaves the other possible parents he meets for reasons like they are uncaring like with the set of parents in Alaska Graham Greene and Kathy Bates and so on. All of the problems that North finds with his parents and the other potential parents are all with him too. He thinks the Alaskan parents are uncaring when he just dumped his real parents and he thinks his real parents are selfish while he is an egotistical little brat who thinks he is the greatest thing ever. He leaves his parents claiming their disaffection with him is ruining the rest of his life when it must not have been all bad if it just started taking a toll. Also all we know is that he wants to leave them after they would not acknowledge him while they were in the middle of an argument at dinner. He is exactly what he hates. This is in no way the fault of Elijah Wood. Wood is a quite talented actor but no actor no matter how good could pull this role off.The film is littered with talented actors like Bruce Willis Elijah Wood Dan Aykroyd etc. but none of them manage to save the movie or put in a performance that makes the film bearable and you can't blame them based on the material they're working with. The humor is unfunny and racist at times the premise is hurtful and heartless and the lesson at the end is one we could learn from watching the far better and far more entertaining film The Wizard of Oz.This film is the three H's hateful heartless and horrible. Gene Siskel described the movie as firstclass junk and claimed it made him feel unclean. He was being too nice. North is a horrible movie that will make you feel horrible inside instead of heartwarmed like you were obviously supposed to be.".

After having seen it for the second time in 10 years I must agree that I was not as amused as I was the first time.North is a major cheat. In the first half hour it comes up with a pretty nifty premise but then it doesn't have the guts to follow through. It has nothing to do with most of the characters being broad caricatures or the fact that most of them are kind of stupid. Will there ever be a part for Jon Lovitz where he is not a sniveling toady? Most of the characters may not be funny true but the thing is that after years of seeing parodies like Airplane or Naked Gun you sort of become very jaded and seeing the little kid Winchell play dictator isn't as funny as it must have been if the movie came out in the 50's.North is a pretty bad movie one of the reasons comes at the end. It's as if the writer got stuck for an ending and then decided to give up. Watch it and you will know what I'm talking about.Another reason it's bad is because of Bruce Willis. I don't mean because his performance is awful but because he is tremendously not funny something that is hard to say about him. Hudson Hawk looks like an Oscar caliber performance compared to this. He is flat probably written that way but it is his funny costumes that's supposed to carry his comedic weight. At that it bombs.So I hated this movie too I guess but it is not the worst movie in history. Elijah Wood is pretty good and individual episodes are quite amusing Dan Aykroyd as a Texan. It's just that ending I can't stomach.".

So if you want to see this movie don't listen to the critics!!! Use your own judgement people. That's all.Luv Farfalla DolceBy the way about the swearing and stuff in the movie is it reall that bad? I mean as if kids who watch the movie don't use them already. Seriously people just think about it!! It was a cute movie let's leave it at that.";

So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho Some last name. They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! NahI'm just kiddinghe didn't move in with Sarah Palinbut he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit familyand the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit.

I mean I was born in the 90s but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review but the Siskel  Ebert review. At first I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies but given the quote from Siskel  Ebert themselves It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it. I'm personally at their side now.I thought it had a creative but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis Jason Alexander and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride. But when I watched the whole thing online I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap copout ending. Like I said before it has a talented cast but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script unfunny oneliners and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be.Overall North isn't the worse movie I've seen but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.".

A BulgarianItalian coproduction set in a version of Berlin where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between is hardly credible. The English vocabulary is basically limited to fuck you bastard and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from this racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting subject but in the Germany I know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. And if all that is not enough there is also a serial killer going around who kills Turkish children and paints them white. In order to create some tension we see the serial killer and hear him hum Schubert's lullaby but we won't see his face. I don't even believe they actually shot it in Germany. There are some street shots that are quite obviously in Berlin but the actors are not seen in those shot. It's probably Bulgaria with some German signs added here and there.".

These annoy viewers every flipping time yet once again they're here to annoy COTC Revelation viewers too. These pathetic acts of filmmaking sloth knock the film down a few pegs on their own!

First off it is a must that these movies be set in corn fields! not a hotel with a patch of corn along the edge! Also this movie is only 82 mins long and it uses about all those minutes to establish that something weird is going on that  these freaky mute kids running around are not right in the head.. well DUH! And Wow was the lead chick dumb in this even at the end of the movie I still don't think she had a clue about anything. This film lacks the cheese of part 2 the fun of part 5 and the art of part 6. It also lacks a hell of a lot more but I ain't got that much time. I hope this series lives forever so I better submit my script for part 8! If this one didn't kill it for good.

	schema:reviewBody "Children of the Corn Revelation is the seventh sequel in this never ending horror series and was one that I actually really enjoyed. This film is about a woman named Jamie who arrives in a small rural town to visit her grandmother Hattie. When she arrives at the dilapidated Hampton Arms apartment building which is incidentally located in the middle of a cornfield she discovers that her grandmother has mysteriously disappeared. After having a strange encounter with some children at a smalltown market nearby one evening Jamie begins to get a little creeped out. She goes to the police to report her grandmother missing and the strange children keep on appearing to her on many occasions around the building as she awaits any news of her grandmother's discovery. Then the other residents of the building begin to disappear one by one and the many children who are lurking around seem to be behind it...This one really isn't related to the rest of the movies but I think that's why it prevailed in my eyes. The same plot being rehashed over and over in this series was a little annoying and I found Part 6 Isaac's Return to be godawful. I liked the atmosphere this movie set up the building was creepy and the bizarre children that pop up all over the place were surprisingly unnerving. The film had some fairly decent scarescenes and the actors did a fair job here. The ending was a little abrupt though. Some of the CGI corn effects especially the ones used in the finale were a little overdone and corny yes pun intended! but it was nothing to pine over. I also found the bathtub scene to be kind of funny and ridiculous but what can you expect? It's number seven in a horror series in which 90 of the films have straighttovideo releases. If you suspend your disbelief this is an entertaining reasonably creepy little flick.While it isn't cinematic brilliance I found Children of the Corn Revelation to be a decent sequel and probably my favorite of this horror series. It had a somewhat original story some good scares and creepy imagery and stands as something marginally fresh in the recycled series. Worth a watch even if you haven't seen the previous installments. 710.".

It's like watching Friday the 13th 4  The Final Chapter and then finding out there are 6 more sequels reminding you that Jason is pure evil thus he won't be killed that easily at least not in a movie that's called 'The Final Chapter'.What I'm only trying to say is that there's absolutely NO point to this movie whatsoever a woman comes looking for her grandma who has disappeared running into a bunch of evil children some plot that makes no sense at all and even worse this movie is so predictable it won't even scare you. In the first part we saw a big cornfield which had something eerie even if nothing happened in this part we have a house with a small 'corn garden' in front of it because there's no such thing as a Children Of The Corn movie without corn! On top of that the acting is bad really bad! The girl who plays Jamie isn't convincing at all let alone the 'priest' who looks more like an escaped criminal.To put it shortly don't let the looks of the cover trick you into renting or even worse buying it because that cover is the best asset to this movie cheerio to the designer of that particular cover he's certainly worth his money.Avoid at all costs!".

In fact for the first 10 or 15 minutes it seemed reminiscent of the more recent 1408 2007 which I loved. It had a good setting a good premise good atmosphere creepy scenes a bit of eye candy and even a bit of odd humor.But right about the halfway mark it starts to unravel. Mysterious characters many supernatural are never explained and they keep growing in number. A couple scenes featured supernatural characters that don't cohere with the rest of the filmfor example one has a zombie or adult burn victim. The film starts getting choppy and it begins to feel more like a series of pointless and disconnected scary setpieces.Worse there was a stable of interesting human characters who were never explored enoughwe're just teased with them and then they're usually quickly dispatched with relatively generic horror film deaths. And the crux of the storyJamie's Claudette Mink missing grandmotherremains murky through the end. The biggest tragedy is that the ball was dropped. With just a bit more work on the scriptanother two or three drafts maybethis could have been one of the better entries of this uneven series.".

Death scenes are lame and not scary to say the least and the scariest thing you see would probably be some little kids playing evil dead  a video game on a machine. Children laugh effect sounds extremely fake and not threatening. As for the story it stops really developing after 30th minute too. Nothing gets accomplished except from local people being slaughter and it's just down the hill from there. It would probably be safe to say that this movie would better stand alone with some different plot elements because COTC aren't really that important here. I would've loved the movie if it could've sustained the atmosphere of the beginning but it failed to do that. Failed big time. The ending is lame and very unsatisfying too. If you're going to watch this movie I recommend to shut it down after that magical 30th minute I keep mentioning. Unless you want to be bored to sleep that is. Good stuff lasts for about 40  of the movie so I give it 410.".

One of the biggest pluses is the film's collection of rather impressive and freaky confrontations sequences with the kids throughout. These here provide the film with some solid action throughout here as the first big one is the attack on the one victim in the bathtub which is great with the cornstalks appearing through the bubbles shooting out and wrap around the clueless victim. This is in itself an impressive visual but with the added bonus of supplying nudity and a funlooking kill as well really starts this off on a fun note leading into the quick flashcut visions out in the cornfields which are a lot of fun The big one is the main dream sequence where the whole backstory is spelled out quite nicely from the events that show what happened to the grandmother to the somewhat suspenseful chase up the twisting darkened stairway that leads to a very creepy denouement reveal it's all a very fun scene and definitely gets the most out of these types of scenes. With the resolution of the burning stoves and the lastditch effort by the possessed cornstalks coming into play quite nicely these here are all incredibly fun scenes that make the finale really blow right by and feel like a fun film. That it's always hard to tell what's featured during them is another factor and the glimpses offered aren't that bad at all and some are downright freaky most notably a scene of them taking out a victim through the goggles of a nightvision camera dropped in the attack. Armed with some good kills in here these here make the film watchable as there wasn't a whole lot of stuff here that didn't work. One of the main flaws was the film's constant child's laughter playing throughout the whole film. It got off as a rather nice tactic that makes the children appear as constant forces within the town only as time went on it grew irritating to hear the exact same thing playing in the background of nearly every scene within the apartment complex and wore out it's welcome quite early. The very boring beginning doesn't help all that much as this one just spends a large amount of time just showing her walking around the apartments meeting everyone and trying to get the information needed but it's just not that interesting the way it plays out since it just consists of her meeting up with people who have no impact in the story and then going on to someone else to get the same thing. Rather than trying to make it seem like it's a conspiracy at work it just drags the beginning out and could've been done in a recap or montage effort since most serve no purpose. The last flaw is the question regarding the confusion over who the priest character is. It's not explained at all who he is what his connection is and the only amount of information gathered is that he's here to warn her despite this coming at the end of the film and his unspoken presence seen throughout. It's quite confusing but these are the film's only flaws.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Nudity.".

Basically the corn seeds are spreading all over the world.In Revelation why are these kids 'ghostly'? The original film there were NO 'ghostly' kids. Just real human kids who started listening to and was influenced by Isaac! It's He Who Walks Behind The Rows that is the supernatural element and Isaac's relationship  contact with He.Hey at least in this film the kids are wearing the older style clothing again conservative religious look. If that counts for anything. I say this because I hated the way they were dressed in Isaac's Return  looking modern and way off base of the original story.Anyway if you view this film as just another supernatural creepy kid film then it's easier to enjoy than to try to think of this one as a part of the CotC series.310".

The mass persecution of Christians still goes on and many are continuing to lose their lives and their freedom simply because they are Christians. Most people my age did not have any photos of themselves or their families taken while they were growing up. During the Cultural Revolution photos and most anything else like musical instruments art foreign clothing books or even nicer furniture were not allowed and were destroyed or buried as you could be severely punished for having them since they were considered foreign I even heard of a lady putting her family photos in soup  when her house was being searched by Red Guards to get rid of them lest she be caught. There were Mao statutes everywhere and I was told that if you did take a photo with one of them in the background and cut of his head in the picture that you could be punished or even killed. Teachers were taken out of the classroom in front of their students and paraded through town wearing dunce caps. It was a terrible terrible time especially if you were an educated person or desired to think for yourself.".

Individual scenes typically wellscripted but...well I'll address the problem in the next paragraph.  The basic premise that one's affinity to the divine is a delicate thing that can't be explained nor explained away does come across in the end.Bad things  Generally poor narrative script and scene organization. Lack of funds to do some of the scenes right e.g. Japanese invasion by one soldier in an empty street pummeling a gate with his rifle butt. General clumsiness in use of voiceover.  Motivation for last scene leading lady walking across a desert expanse to meet her husband not set up properly confusing.  Some of the character development in the area of abuses by party heavies is hyperbolic and generally not believable.  In general movies that rely upon the depiction of a litany of atrocities committed by thepowersthatbe tend to be weak.  I'm not saying that consciousness raising about these things is bad it's just a question of the delicate balance you have to maintain in cinema when trying to communicate this.  The litany approach doesn't cut it.I conclude by citing this as yetanother example of the ascendency of true artistry over even divinelyinspired good intentions.  I'm sorry to see that this continues to haunt Christian movies to this day I'm writing in 2002.  Some day these people will quit bellyaching about the Satanic plot that funnels all the money to secular themes and just come up with a compelling story and get enough money and nobullstuff talent to finally do the job right.

	schema:reviewBody "Sorry. I was raised in 'the Christian genre'. I suppose that I should have more sympathy for this movie therefore. It may in the end be a compelling story about Communists suppressing another poor Christian despite 'the communist constitution' and yes even dissident Andrei Sakharov a nonChristian told the world again and again that the constitutions of many communist nations like Canada's and the USA's 'guarantees freedom of religion'.Oh I became suspicious that this was one more 'Christian' production for the sake of boosting the low morales and morals of weakling 'christians'. After all one must portray a 'true story' by as the film's precursory text admits 'compressing' the primary character's life down into short intense dramas. I could not get beyond watching the pregnant heroine being kicked by a communist interrogator in her pregnant gut.It may have been a true event but the contrived scene caused me to turn the DVD off.Why? It is not just that the 1990 film is so jerky in its subtitles and its filming is so bad. The honesty behind what is the worth of telling the story is so forced in its presentation that it leaves me wondering how much of the story is 'compressed' for the sake of bad drama and good propaganda. The problem becomes that shoddy art and worse questions of whether the truth is being sacrificed for 'the sake of religion' does not justify suffering any 'true story' made into a film.I am also sick of the repetitive productions by 'Christian production companies' like this that hide their banners Produced by a Christian CORPORATION! while they accuse 'commies' muslims and others of forcing their own friends into hiding. Good god I sat in an Anglican church in Nipigon Ontario as late as 2010 and listened to a Christian Gideon Bible thumper tell the tiny men in that tiny back room church room that a certain tribe of Abraham should have been exterminated millennia ago as the Jewish god apparently ordered in that 'old testament'. Instead those 'damned muslims' became so great in number to leave 'us christians!' with the onerous task by 2010 of exterminating masses of 'those Islamic rats'. Those sects apparently descended from the same loins of the ancient man Abraham who supposedly spawned the fathers of the Jews and the Muslims and those christians and how many other murderous sects now claiming that the new sect of 'antireligion' those damned commies have no right to live either.So when does TBN Films the supposed production company behind this 'China Cry' start to make the films that vilify the antics of 'christians'? That is relevant because at least in the open world of independent films there are films produced that criticize both commies and religious nut bars. Produced by the same production companies. I have YET to see such navel gazing from these 'Christian production companies'.So when they do not navel gaze in self criticism what makes the 'Christian film genre' any more credible than the nonsense coming out of commie North Korea where navel gazing is not allowed? Is there a gun to the heads of the 'Christian nutbars' who create this stuff? If there were then I might start to watch 'the Christian version of a story' to try to find the hidden agenda in their 'bad productions'.I sicken of this propaganda from religious sects of all kinds. BUT I am OFFENDED by the fact that these religious sects try to suck the rest of us into watching really BAD productions by refusing to post their big Jesus Christ crosses of idolatry at the front of their productions.Oh watch it if you must but I tossed it because we will never really know if this lady's professing that she 'encountered miracles!' is because there was 'a god of modern idolatry' involved. OR if those people who were involved in the stomach kicking of pregnant women actually dared to turn to their superior commanding officers and ask What does our constitution really say? Something that American and Canadian 'christians' of too many sects are seemingly more and more reluctant to do inside our own nations.... when it comes to anyone who does not 'profess your Christianity!' And what does all of this mean when it comes down to the 'Christian' icon's supposedly professed advice that being honest to the truth removes any question as to what your motives really are? To drag money out of the down and oppressed so that big cathedrals and monuments can be built to the benefit of what and who?In other words in a world where the 'Christian' enters the game of dishonesty in the first bars of who is making the presentation the role of credibility in the purpose of the film and hence the objectivity in the film itself is lost.This film was a waste of my time for 20 minutes AND YES I resent that. IF you are making a film with religious recruitment as your intent GET HONEST! Post your christian cross or Islamic sword or... communist hammer and sickle at the start so that I know the purposeful twisting of the stories so that I can pull it out of the DVD within a minute instead of suffering so long that instead of recruitment you achieve resentment.Why a 3 instead of a big fat ZERO? Wherever the production was made it had some nice representative Asian architecture. And the male and female 'stars' were 'good eye candy' for awhile. Otherwise phoooeeeeyyy!

This was a very welcome exception. What a find! This movie has simply everything great characters superb cinematography a kickass soundtrack it's a comedy a mystery thriller a drama and a romance  and the performances and the direction are flawless.

He lives in the dark depressing tunnels below the city and never leaves them having chosen his own personal hell after a life above which he seems to desperately want to forget. Bulcs is a very ambiguous character and it's precisely the ambiguity and the symbolism of his story which make this film stand out for me.

	schema:reviewBody "KONTROLL is a Hungarian film from director Nimrd Antal. Yes that's really his name. The first thing he did when he introduced the film was make fun of the fact that he was called Nimrod which is great.The film is about a group of ticket inspectors in the Hungarian subway system with the focus on at least one in particular Bulcs. Each character is extremely likable even the passengers become memorable characters as none of them buy a ticket and are chased or shaken down by the inspectors which is commonplace in Hungary. There is even a young girl in a bear suit don't ask that is absolutely gorgeous. The interaction between her and Bulcs is sweet and funny. They had the kind of chemistry that is difficult to capture on film.The entire film takes place in the underground which is effectively presented as a separate world than the one above ground. Some characters even talk about up there with a child like wonder in their voices.The cinematography is beautiful. Some of the scenes or long panning shots in the underground are breathtaking. Who'd a thunk it'd look so cool down there? You can tell the director has a photography background by the wonderful shots he selected.I was also pleasantly surprised by the rockin' soundtrack. Unfortunately the band that did the music NEO are no longer together. Lets hope the director gets the soundtrack released.This film is not all laughs however. It has a very serious side that is dark and an ending that makes you think. If this is the kind of film we can expect from Hungary I'm eagerly anticipating more. I definitely recommend this film. 810".

An excellent though a bit weird mixture of satirical comedy mystical drama and thriller. The metro stations become a world of their own the neon lights create a new reality.While in the beginning the film focuses on a whole group of ticket controllers and we expect a satirical comedy about their lives in the second half the storyline concentrates on the terrifying experiences of Bulcs a man with a mysterious past. He used to be an artist or in some other kind of creative business not specified further but left this life for unknown reasons and started to live in the metro. It also becomes clear that for some reason he is not able to leave the metro system until the end  when he overcomes the dark forces that probably have also been lurking inside him. Everything about this story is deeply irrational except for the satirical elements that are in some ways very close to reality  this is just a terrible world where love means the only hope I was a bit reminded of Terry Gilliam's Brazil.An excellent movie that I would also strongly recommend to foreign viewers. I don't know if this will ever come to other countries but I would very much like it to be so. So that Hungary could be put back on the landscape of international moviemaking.P.s. The Budapest multiplex I saw this in was absolutely packed with people. I was astonished what a great success Kontroll has become in Hungary because I think that most people in the audience there have probably never seen anything that could only remotely be called arthouse  and Kontroll wasn't exactly an easy popcorn movie....".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it's one of the best Hungarian films what had been ever made. Bulcs's character is very good and Kovcs Lajos the drunken metro driver is a great actor the story is exciting and the pictures have very dark feelings so it's a perfect film from a genius director Antal Nimrd.

Bulcs never even leaves the system. He sleeps on the platforms all he seems to eat or drink is coffee from the machines on the platforms.

	schema:reviewBody "There are those jobs in life in which the job becomes the person's complete identity. Preacher. Policeman. President. Suppose you had one of those jobs in which convey a very negative identity. A job in which everyone hated and loathed you. I don't mean just looked down on like a garbage collector or feared like a policeman but just purely despised. The movie Kontroll operates within this context the world of ticket inspectors in the Budapest underground metro system.Now I need to explain a bit of this unique context. Like most transit systems in the world you need to have some sort of ticket or pass to ride. What makes the Budapest system different from many is that there are no physical barriers turnstiles or gates that you must pass through for you to get onto the trains. It is completely possible to use the system free of charge with little effort. Those of us who live here call it black riding. It happens a lot. To combat black riders the mass transit company has a small army of plain clothes ticket inspectors who often pop out of the crowd in a train tram or bus put on an armband their only piece of uniform and greet you Jo napot kivanok. Literally that's I wish you a good day. In reality it's Show me your ticket or else. Now about the movie. Up front I need to tell you that after a single viewing I think this might be one of my top ten favorite movies. Easy. But before you rush out and watch the film on my recommendation some have recently been disappointed with my recommendations I need to make a couple of caveats. First of all this movie is steeped in dark symbolism and psychology. If you felt that the ending of Fight Club was a little too weird for you then you won't like Kontroll. The movie doesn't easily resolve either. So if you're comfortable with dark symbolism depressive psychology and murky resolution then this is your movie.Kontroll actually came out about 18 months ago in Budapest. The posters made it look like a cute comedy about ticket inspectors and it really didn't pique my interest until my friend Gabi saw it. This movie is no comedy. Kontroll is one of the best views into the world of depression despair and angst. Leave it to the Hungarians to make the perfect movie on these subject I'm not ragging on my Hungarian friends here... I think that they would all agree with me.The music the visuals the situations the writing and the acting blend well and create an atmosphere that is believable and characters that you really care about. The impetus for watching the film was simply to see a movie filmed in the underground metro of my home town. I thought it would be something to recommend to the folks back in America for a glimpse of what life is like here in Budapest. The underground metro of the movie is a bit more edgy and macabre than the reality of the underground. What it does capture well is the sense of spiritual and psychological reality of Budapest itself.And now for the best part. Am I gushing yet?. Kontroll is one of those movies that and probably by accident captures the reality the true Narative we all live in whether it is Budapest or Atlanta. The story boils down to the struggle of evil in ourselves and our need of a redemptive agent to free us from a fallen world. I'm not sure that Nimrd Antal necessarily intended this much for his film but I think that the Narative we live in just shines through some works of art despite the artist. This happens in Shindler's List as well. Yes I just compared this movie to Schindler's List.If you want to see what life looks like in Budapest then rent a tourism video. If you want to see what life seems like here and maybe where you live too then you gotta see this film.".

	schema:headline " The Worst Sample ever of my favorite movie genre ";
	schema:reviewBody "Called Metro Party a nongovernmental organization NGO works for financially supporting the labor party. In their fund raising campaign they cooperate with the subway stations management to earn percentage based commissions. On this account they charge the metro passengers to make them pay for a metropass while passengers are getting on the wagon compartments. We are introduced to these uneducated dope addict and vagabond members of the organization while witnessing their chit chat social dialogues full of slang. The screenplay narrows its focus gradually and loses ground. Then it totally gets lost in the details. From a different perspective losing the focus of the screenplay over a small gang and then taking this focus over to a different level A criminal mind. There the viewer should see the catch of the movie how a banal drama becomes a total and very downtoearth psychological trauma.Director Antal uses the story telling as of 100 Lynch style turning a social examination into a psychological trauma. The introduction part of the film concludes to a sociopolitical drama at first then at the nodal point comes to this psychological trauma majoring on its victim the most friendly likable and usual character of the movie Bulcs.Without getting caught to no one Bulcs invents a new way for metro passengers not to pay for their compartment passes. Whoever waiting for the metro at the platform lonely is being pushed to the railway at the arrival moment of the metro wagon and thus getting killed by him. Bulcs does this even without getting caught to himself. He was looking for this serial killer as a given duty by the organization. Soon he realized that it was actually himself. When his dual personality comes together as one director Antal uses the daughter of the machinist the girl in the pink bear costume to keep viewers amused in order to ward off the boredom after the serial murders are solved and when there is nothing else to make the viewer surprised of.A very smart directing redoubles and clicks a runofthemill plot. Sadly it's the only good thing to say about Kontroll. The worst aspect is that the characterizations are very low and there is a hidden directing fear that there is no clue for answering any what? how? and why? q's. So think about this...What do you expect from a movie when the happenings and the reality are nonidentifiable? The ultimate effort of the whole movie is to lead the viewer into error of not to be able to find out what the reality is. I'm telling this to you believing that David Lynch is the master of FantasyCrimeMystery genre and there are alike of him and his owncreated style. There are certain rules to blend this 3 subgenres. First of all you must be honest with the viewer at all times from opening to the ending.

Kontroll can be a very likable movie at its first view since it impresses you yet it happened to me to become one of the abhorrent and hateful movies I ever watched when I did for the second time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Called Metro Party a nongovernmental organization NGO works for financially supporting the labor party. In their fund raising campaign they cooperate with the subway stations management to earn percentage based commissions. On this account they charge the metro passengers to make them pay for a metropass while passengers are getting on the wagon compartments. We are introduced to these uneducated dope addict and vagabond members of the organization while witnessing their chit chat social dialogues full of slang. The screenplay narrows its focus gradually and loses ground. Then it totally gets lost in the details. From a different perspective losing the focus of the screenplay over a small gang and then taking this focus over to a different level A criminal mind. There the viewer should see the catch of the movie how a banal drama becomes a total and very downtoearth psychological trauma.Director Antal uses the story telling as of 100 Lynch style turning a social examination into a psychological trauma. The introduction part of the film concludes to a sociopolitical drama at first then at the nodal point comes to this psychological trauma majoring on its victim the most friendly likable and usual character of the movie Bulcs.Without getting caught to no one Bulcs invents a new way for metro passengers not to pay for their compartment passes. Whoever waiting for the metro at the platform lonely is being pushed to the railway at the arrival moment of the metro wagon and thus getting killed by him. Bulcs does this even without getting caught to himself. He was looking for this serial killer as a given duty by the organization. Soon he realized that it was actually himself. When his dual personality comes together as one director Antal uses the daughter of the machinist the girl in the pink bear costume to keep viewers amused in order to ward off the boredom after the serial murders are solved and when there is nothing else to make the viewer surprised of.A very smart directing redoubles and clicks a runofthemill plot. Sadly it's the only good thing to say about Kontroll. The worst aspect is that the characterizations are very low and there is a hidden directing fear that there is no clue for answering any what? how? and why? q's. So think about this...What do you expect from a movie when the happenings and the reality are nonidentifiable? The ultimate effort of the whole movie is to lead the viewer into error of not to be able to find out what the reality is. I'm telling this to you believing that David Lynch is the master of FantasyCrimeMystery genre and there are alike of him and his owncreated style. There are certain rules to blend this 3 subgenres. First of all you must be honest with the viewer at all times from opening to the ending. Second you can hide everything and anything but you gotta give clues of each element you hide away from the viewer. Third you gotta explain the reasons of happenings. Finally as a key factor you have to PROVE how these things are happening.My last word is to warn the viewer that the first impression you are getting from watching Kontroll is just a delusion. Kontroll can be a very likable movie at its first view since it impresses you yet it happened to me to become one of the abhorrent and hateful movies I ever watched when I did for the second time.";

	schema:reviewBody "I went into Kontroll with no expectations and was quickly a fan of the characters and cinematography. We're introduced to the who the hell would work here world of the Hungarian subway and we're given a few archetypal characters the rookie the reluctant hero with the mysterious past the buffoon and not one but two veterans. All of the promise of the first act however quickly dissipates into an overwrought poorlyedited and very confused film. The plot SEEMS to be about a random psychopathic killer. Then the hooded killer goes missing for the rest of the movie until he's needed to wrap up a plot point in the last ten minutes. He doesn't even kill anyone we care about Bootsie could've been edited out of the movie and it would make no difference. Then the plot SEEMS to be about the horrible life of a subway worker. We're given two maybe three montages of how menial and soulsucking the work is. We get it it's a horrible job. What we don't get is why the protagonist stays. We don't need to know what he's afraid of success? his parents? but we do need to know why he puts up with his job for so long. We're given more than a glimpse of how strenuous it is so it's definitely not the lack of pressure.Then the plot SEEMS to be about a guy falling in love with a kooky girl she wears a bear suit! how nonthreateningly quirky! someone get Zach Braff on the phone and falling head over heels for her because she's cute and of course her obvious mental illness is alluring. All of this would be great if Kontroll actually did anything meaningful with these elements. Instead it tosses them into a salad with a bit of love conquers all dressing. It could have easily been 20 minutes shorter and twice as good. It seems the director fell in love with all of his footage and didn't know what to dump. A chase scene is exciting. A five minute chase scene where no one is running through glass or doing parkour or shooting bullets or doing something more than just running is boring. And spoiler I don't buy the killer being Bulcsu's split personality. He has no signs of derangement and the film doesn't give us any other clues that it may be him. The killer is a cheap plot device to load interest into the front end and provide a symbol for the protagonist at the end. There are three very good ideas for a film in this movie but the filmmakers never wrangle them in and take control of a steady direction. This could be a film about a subway pusher. A film about a guy overcoming failure to win a quirky girl seen that one a million times. A film about working in a hostile and unrewarding environment. There's a way to incorporate all of these themes into one film but Kontroll never seems to find out how to do that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw KONTROLL it was playing on late night TV at about four in the morning. I might have been exhausted but this film grabbed hold of me slapped me a few times and ensured I was still awake when the sun came up.KONTROLL tells the tale of a group of conductors in a huge underground rail complex. Their defacto leader Bulcsu is an enigmatic outcast who sleeps on the platforms and never goes to the surface and his comrades are a utterly lovable batch of losers including a cranky old geezer a short unwashed failed womaniser a narcoleptic and a naive new recruit. They spend their days dealing out fines to faredodgers chasing a serial troublemaker and dodging the distinctly sinister station manager. Bulcsu's thankless job is further complicated by a murderer pushing people under trains and the arrival of a beautiful girl in a bear costume.At face value KONTROLL is a fairly straightforward story about the daylightdeprived world of a motley gang of ticket inspectors on the Budapest subway. There are elements of mystery romance and comedy the industrialdance hybrid soundtrack is fantastic and KONTROLL features in my opinion the best footchase scene I've ever seen but this film really goes beyond telling a simple entertaining story. Under the surface are massive depths. The whole movie is loaded with visual metaphor and meaning the surrealbutreal world of the metro stations and tunnels are eerie and hypnotic and some of the characters are much more than they appear at first one character manifests a halo in one scene and another has scars on his head where horns might once have been.... In the end the story told is less to do with underground rail and more about good evil personal demons and finally salvation. Give this dazzling movie a try and fall in love with the mysterious underground world it paints and the humans that collide within it...".

	onyx:emotionText "The first time I saw KONTROLL it was playing on late night TV at about four in the morning. I might have been exhausted but this film grabbed hold of me slapped me a few times and ensured I was still awake when the sun came up.KONTROLL tells the tale of a group of conductors in a huge underground rail complex. Their defacto leader Bulcsu is an enigmatic outcast who sleeps on the platforms and never goes to the surface and his comrades are a utterly lovable batch of losers including a cranky old geezer a short unwashed failed womaniser a narcoleptic and a naive new recruit. They spend their days dealing out fines to faredodgers chasing a serial troublemaker and dodging the distinctly sinister station manager. Bulcsu's thankless job is further complicated by a murderer pushing people under trains and the arrival of a beautiful girl in a bear costume.At face value KONTROLL is a fairly straightforward story about the daylightdeprived world of a motley gang of ticket inspectors on the Budapest subway. There are elements of mystery romance and comedy the industrialdance hybrid soundtrack is fantastic and KONTROLL features in my opinion the best footchase scene I've ever seen but this film really goes beyond telling a simple entertaining story. Under the surface are massive depths. The whole movie is loaded with visual metaphor and meaning the surrealbutreal world of the metro stations and tunnels are eerie and hypnotic and some of the characters are much more than they appear at first one character manifests a halo in one scene and another has scars on his head where horns might once have been.... In the end the story told is less to do with underground rail and more about good evil personal demons and finally salvation. Give this dazzling movie a try and fall in love with the mysterious underground world it paints and the humans that collide within it...";

A group of extremely eccentric ticket takers toil away in the Budapest subway system thanklessly trying to do their job. Slowly we focus on one tickettaker who is apparently hiding down in the subway for unnamed reasons. A killer is pushing people in front of the trains our hero is later implicated in one of his crimes. Truly fascinating movie works on several levels as a straight ahead thriller as a metaphor for redemption as a symbolic drama of good vs. evil as a metaphor for the hero's journey from darkness to light as a metaphor for explicitly Christian salvation as a metaphor of the worker's struggle against capital as a metaphor of depression. Unlike other movies which try to attain this kind of depth there's never a feeling of heavy lifting or sweating the metaphorical resonances are all gracefully handled. What's best of all is that the movie is quite funny Hungarian humor transfers exceptionally well it seems. Who would've known? Highly recommended check it out.".

Strange that nobody has commented on the way the movie navigates the lowkey sexual tensions between the almost entirely male characters with the leader of the rival railing gang making a gaybaiting comment about his antagonist ... and thus it is even more interesting that the young woman  Bela's daughter  is reductively described by many reviewers as Bulscu's 'girlfriend' when she doesn't really fulfil that prosaic a dramatic function any more than the 'pushershadow' is a literal serial killer in the manner say of Lustig's 'Maniac'. She occupies a similar space to the magnificent owl a being that sees what is going on in the darkness and that also is sacred to Athena goddess of among other things wisdom. And while the subtitles refer to her as wearing a bear suit viewers on IMDb and amazon seem to think she's in a bunny suit while I would swear she's in a kangaroo cozzie. In fact the presence of real or masquerade animals in the movie is mythically interesting  I counted 3 dogs for instance and was reminded of the 3headed dog Cerberus the Guardian of the Underworld in classical mythology also a reference Fincher made in 'Se7en' I could write reams about this astounding movie. Dreamlike nailbiting humane and terrifying in equal measure it's a work of which all involved in its making must be amazingly proud.

You really felt like Rothrock's performance when she sheds tears at a very nasty incident was quite convincing.  Another thing that works in the film's favour is the chemistry between Rothrock and costar Richard Norton Australian Karate exponent. As you might expect though the fights are what this and its sequel are really about and these are some of the best Western fights ever I reckon.  None of the slowness of later efforts and Rothrock's blows look very powerful Hong Kong actordirector Sammo Hung says they ARE powerful.  A big hand to Keith Cooke for his lethal bootwork though.

The fights are superbly choreographed and really show off the different talents of the three main fighters. There is a bit too much 'acting' between the fights but not overly so.Keith Cooke really steals the show with his amazing kicking techniques while Richard Norton opts for a more wrist lock and throw style which is cool beyond belief leaving Rothrock as a good all rounder. This allows you to pick your favourite depending on what style you like very much like a video game which is good. The real downpoint to the film and a lot of these eastwest films suffered from this is that there was no final threat to speak of. The main antagonist is an ageing man with zero fight capability and It was just really wave after wave of goons for the heroes to dispose of which is no bad thing but it would have been better with a really threatening figurehead and a great end fight between China and a Boss.The film was in many ways far ahead of it's time and ticks a lot of boxes with regards to the feminist movement. The China O' Brian character is the superior authority in the film with all the lawmen working beneath her Rothrock gets top billing in both opening and Closing credits and she is not sexualised in any scene and never wears anything lewd or revealing. For 1988 that was pretty much unheard of even in Hollywood let alone a low budget martial arts film.A great one to watch with mates or even a girlfriend.

But besides the improbability of a Utah native growing up with an Australian accent can we assume he picked that up in the Special Forces? at least it's not too unrealistic.But this movie was basically created to showcase Rothrock's abilities and they are readily apparent. Someone mentioned that this film was meant as a vehicle for Jackie Chan this is also easy to see based on the beautifully choreographed fight scenes that make good use of the available props the scene in the high school's weight room is particularly fun.Overall score With regards to the filmmaking process this one gets a low rating thanks to bad sound effects cheap production and minimal writing talent.

However there are problems the main one being that the bad guys are pretty faceless. The main one for the most part is Deputy Lickner who manages to be loathsome but the bad guy leader doesn't do much at all.Richard Norton makes a great partner for Ms. Rothrock as does Keith Cooke as the mysterious Dakota. The action is nonstop as well with lots of bad guys being sent flying by our three main heroes. China O'Brien is a great movie. I give it 610.".

However there are problems the main one being that the bad guys are pretty faceless. The main one for the most part is Deputy Lickner who manages to be loathsome but the bad guy leader doesn't do much at all.Richard Norton makes a great partner for Ms. Rothrock as does Keith Cooke as the mysterious Dakota. The action is nonstop as well with lots of bad guys being sent flying by our three main heroes. China O'Brien is a great movie. I give it 610.";

Sadly he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this movie was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straighttovideo action flick.China O'Brien returns home to help out her dad. He's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help. So she returns home and restores order with the help of two unlikely people. But will they be enough to topple Mister Big and his evil cronies?If you're a big Cynthia Rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you. I only enjoyed the fighting scenes everything else is rubbish. Why didn't Raymond Chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director?Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "China O'Brien Rothrock is a tough cop in the big city who also happens to be a karate instructor. After a shooting incident goes wrong she is forced to move back to the rural Utah town where she grew up Beaver Creek. Her father is the sheriff and he does his best but there is something sinister brewing in this quiet burg. It appears corruption is rife and it naturally goes all the way to the top. The mastermind of all this is the sinister but elderly Mr. Sommers Kerby. Seeing Sheriff O'Brien Blackwell as a threat to their smalltown criminal empire as he cannot be bought off like the rest of the judges and law enforcement in town including the bowtied judge Godar Hazlett the baddies use their preferred method of murder they blow him up with a car bomb. Distraught China runs for her father's old position. Along the way she reconnects with old flame Matt Norton and the mysterious but helpful Dakota Cooke. Luckily the three of them have plenty of martial arts skill and they take on an army of goons because the only way for Beaver Creek to be untainted with corruption is to punch and kick everyone in sight.As has been noted elsewhere one of the major flaws in China O'Brien is the lack of a powerful bad guy  at least one that can do martial arts. Because the bad guy here is the nebulous notion of corruption and the man who has his fingers in all the interests of the town looks more like he should be doing daytime TV commercials complaining about his diabetis the film's end could be described as an anticlimax. To add insult to injury assuming you've seen it the plot and antagonist will remind you of Radical Jack 2000.But all is not lost as Rothrock Norton and Cooke clearly came to play and all three bring their physical Agame. The prerequisite bar brawl and the high school gym sequence are standouts as is the confrontation at the political rally. Norton is his usual likable self and Cooke has some seriously impressive moves. You'll remember him as Prang from King of the Kickboxers. But the star of the show is obviously Rothrock and she does a great job as the crusading O'Brien. Fighting corruption is a theme everyone can get behind so you cheer for her all the way.By action movie standards C O'B has a relatively slow pace presumably to match the slower pace of the boondocks in which the movie is set. In that sense it's appropriate but fans may be puzzled by it.The best way to describe this movie is Americana with punching  wouldn't you love to see a Norman Rockwell painting of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton pummeling the baddies into submission?

The film has an almost Jackie Chanstyle atmosphere going on in the various battles as our three heroes use all manner of scenery and props to battle and bruise the gangs of bad guy henchmen that pop up at every opportunity to do some damage. Fridge doors flip into faces dumbbells smack the faces of the unwary bodies smash into mirrors and there's almost as smashing glass as in the finale of POLICE STORY well not quite.After a decent run of Chinese films in the late '80s Rothrock was billed as the next martial arts sensation a la JeanClaude Van Damme Steven Seagal et al. Well that never happened and Rothrock has never risen from the straighttovideo genre but that's the general population's problem not the Bmovie fan's. Because Rothrock kicks ass. She also happens to be lithe sexy and quite sweet but the main emphasis is on her asskicking prowess and it never lets up. Whether kicking some Chinese guy's head in slowmotion across the room breaking a bad guy's neck or punching a hulking brute of a man out with one hit Rothrock lights up the screen with a martial arts energy possessed by only a few. Here she's equalled by Richard Norton another crossover from Hong Kong cinema and Jackie Chan's regular sparring partner. Norton is alive his flame burning with kung fu excellency and watching him whup ass over and over again is a real treat. The final member of the heroic trio is the unknown Keith Cooke whose body seems possessed with the spirit of Bruce Lee in his great fights.The plot is a highly predictable one that reminded me of WALKING TALL. There's a rough town out in the wilderness that needs cleaning up  so step in Rothrock Norton and Cooke. Most of the other cast members are relatively unskilled both in acting and in martial arts. None of the opponents really provide the heroes with a real test of their skills like you'd seen in an '80s Hong Kong film all are knocked cold after a few moves. Most of the actors were seemingly hired on the street boasting this sole film on their CV even the bad guy Sommers played by Steven Kerby only ever appeared in this one film. The only other distinguished person in the cast is Patrick Adamson who makes his corrupt cop loathsome without even really seeming to act much  I guess that means kudos is deserved for this man.So in all CHINA O'BRIEN is a Bmovie martial arts flick that covers old ground but covers it in such an exciting welldirected way that you'll end up loving it. Massive bouts in a school gym and a barroom brawl are the real highlights of the movie but it all moves so fast and with such a pace that you'll never resort to checking your watch. The three good guys returned for CHINA O'BRIEN II and I'll sure as hell be checking that one out as well!".

Cute little China resigns as a big city cop after shooting a criminal in self defense. Isn't that a requirement of being a cop in the first place?Whatever it gives China an excuse to never hold a gun again and move back to her small home town where her father's the sheriff.But just like 'Walking Tall' Norman Rockwell's small town as become crime ridden and too corrupt to stop by legal means.Richard Norton is also along for the ride a requirement of all great Rothrock films as an Australian who left the US special forces to become a small town school teacher. Whatever just go with it.The big event comes when Sheriff O'Brien and his deputy are killed in a car bombing. Meaning it's up to China herself to run for sheriff.There are obviously many mob tactics to destroy China's campaign giving us plenty of scenes for Rothrock to beat the living crap out of people. LOTS of groin kicks and Rothrock's patented over her head back kick.So this organized crime syndicate is affective enough to just let criminals walk free from jail and bold enough to car bomb the entire police force? But when it comes time to dealing with China all they have are a bunch of fat unarmed thugs? As with most Kung Fu films random objects become weapons. Aren't these organized criminals smart enough to bring their own weapons? Like clubs knives or even.... guns? Rothrock's films have never been accused of being logical so why start now? She's going with what works. And in 'China O'Brien' everything works. It's the classic story of a lone sheriff taking on a crime ridden town Rothrock looking cute as always Richard Norton and most importantly Rothrock beating the living crap out of everyone for 90 minutes! How can you NOT love this film?".

Aren't these organized criminals smart enough to bring their own weapons? Like clubs knives or even.... guns? Rothrock's films have never been accused of being logical so why start now? She's going with what works. And in 'China O'Brien' everything works. It's the classic story of a lone sheriff taking on a crime ridden town Rothrock looking cute as always Richard Norton and most importantly Rothrock beating the living crap out of everyone for 90 minutes! How can you NOT love this film?";

	schema:headline " Bad '80's Bmovie all the way";
	schema:reviewBody "After her role in Yes! Madam aka In the Line of Duty Cynthia Rothrock became the first female gweilo foreigner to become a star in Hong Kong. The success of the movie inspired a series of knockoffs with women like Sophia Crawford Karen Shepard and many others heading to Hong Kong to follow in her footsteps. The influx of talent a term sometimes loosely used since some of the women were picked more for their looks and willingness to do nudity rather than their acting skills or martial arts ability coming into Hong Kong  who were often willing to work for much less money than Rothrock  caused Cynthia's own roles to dwindle in visibility. While she continued to be involved in notable movies like Millionaire's Express where she fought Sammo Hung the producer who originally signed her on to Yes! Madam her roles were becoming more of glorified cameos than anything else.With this situation in mind Rothrock decided to head back to America where martial arts films were gaining popularity after the success of films by stars such as JeanClaude Van Damme and Steven Seagal. Golden Harvest president Raymond Chow was and still is always looking for a way to break into the lucrative American market and so he gave the greenlight for this project. For a director he chose Robert Clouse who was most famous for directing Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon and Game of Death but had accomplished little afterwards. After Clouse's collaboration with Jackie Chan the horrible The Big Brawl failed Clouse found himself directing Bmovie action junk like the kung fugymnastics combo Gymkata. Could this movie revive both Rothrock and Clouse's careers? Well as you might imagine the answer is no. For starters the plot is pretty unoriginal. Cynthia plays a bigcity cop named China O'Brien who leaves the force after shooting a teenager during a fight. She heads back to her hometown where she finds that a corrupt businessman is running the show. Her father is the sheriff of the town and after he is killed China decides to run for sheriff to save the day. Along the way she meets up with her old boyfriend Richard Norton and a mysterious Native American named Dakota groan  anyway he's played by Keith Cooke who even though he goes around wearing a really badlooking Evil Dead 2type fake stump hand manages to kick a lot of ass on the local rednecks. Of course everyone teams up during the finale to bring Mr. Big down.From the bad haircuts even the cops in this movie sport mullets to garish clothing to the mandatory hard rock score China O'Brien just screams bad '80's Bmovie all the way. Worse yet the production values are lower than your average music video. For instance Dakota like to ride a dirtbike around and there are several times where you can see that his stump has magically changed into a hand it's not like the electrical tape wrapped around his hand was convincing anyway and apparently this town's police station consists of one room which also happens to be one of the bad guy's offices after some creative rearrangment of the props.Despite it's inherent problems China O'Brien is still a pretty fun movie to watch  it falls into that so bad it's good category. If you enjoy nitpicking or ripping on movies you will have a field day with this one it's most definitely Mystery Science Theatre material. Besides that the action is surprisingly good for a US Bmovie. It's a bit too undercranked sped up in parts but overall it's choreographed well with some inventive use of props and weapons. Both Rothrock and Norton if not the greatest actors in the world are excellent martial artists and this movie showcases their talents in a good light. Of particular note is a fight where the two take on a gang of thugs in a gym where seemingly every piece of equipment that isn't nailed down is used as a weapon in some fashion.Some notes about the fate of the principal people involved on the film Cynthia Rothrock never became a star in the States US audiences weren't as receptive to female action stars as their Asian counterparts but continued to work steadily in lowbudget action movies as well as TV shows like the Hong Kong filminspired Hercules and has earned the title of the queen of Bgrade action movies from her fans. She never returned to Hong Kong though footage from some of her films through cutandpaste director Godfrey Ho has been put into a few Hong Kong movies the most blatant case being the horrid Angel the Kickboxer which is a remix of Rothrock's Honor and Glory and some of her western directtovideo releases have been put into theatres in Asia.Keith Cooke who was heavily promoted as one of the hot new action stars there is a sizable segment in the documentary The Deadliest Art  perhaps not coincidentally produced by Fred Weintraub  dedicated to him never found much success in films though he still finds work from time to time. His most notable roles have been in films involving Hong Kong Bmovie actor Robin Shou such as playing some of the ninjas in the movies based on the popular Mortal Kombat video game.Richard Norton has had a bit more success than the rest. He found work with his old friend Chuck Norris' TV show Walker Texas Ranger where he worked as a fightstunt coordinator. Norton like Rothrock also became a staple of cheap US Bmovies as well as sometimes working in Hong Kong with major roles in Jackie Chan's City Hunter and Mr. Nice Guy. He also served on producer for a few movies and is currently working in Australia and Europe on various movies and TV shows.".

Through the successful venture that was Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon Keiko Kitagawa has become an increasingly popular actress who has had minor roles in such international films as The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift. With her career blossoming Keiko Kitagawa has landed her first main role in Kazuyuki Morosawa's Dear Friends a story that details the true meaning of friendship.Dear Friends follows the exploits of Japanese high school student Rina Keiko Kitagawa whose increasingly malevolent behavior affects those close to her. She parties frequently shows total disregard for her parents and believes friends are just people to use and dispose of. In fact the opening scenes of Dear Friends showcase her twisted philosophy quite well after one of Rina's friends discovers Rina has slept with her boyfriend Rina is then questioned about her the motive behind the heinous act in which she promptly proclaims to her friend that friends are to be used. But all it not entirely well with physically well with Rina. When she periodically begins to show signs of sickness she is taken into the doctor only to discover that she has cancer. With no one to support her through the ordeal Rina slowly begins to discover the importance of friendship through visiting classmate Maki Yuika Motokariya who arrives unannounced to support Rina through her hardships.Dear Friendsconceptuallyis a film that portrays a meaningful attachment to the word friendship. Numerous people think they have friends but do these people we accompany really deserve the title of being called a friend? The protagonist in Dear Friends is a confused individual who like many people is so infatuated with their own endeavors and selfish tendencies fail to see how their actions affect themselves and the many individuals around them. When Rina rejects the many offers of genuine friendships that are presented to her throughout the film it is not only the person she quickly rejects but also her own willingness to accept emotional growth. Repeatedly throughout Dear Friends this is showcased hinting around that Rina is a metaphor for one's illusion regarding what is true friendshipand what is not. Always running to individuals that please her rather than truly look out for her best interests Rina is totally flabbergasted when her classmate Maki considers her a friend. It's through her astonishment that she begins to find her true self and as well as true friends.Director Kazuyuki Morosawa shoots Dear Friends exceptionally well. There are scenes within Dear Friends that he able to deliver an effective cause and effect to the screenshowcasing the frustration and mental anguish that Rina is portraying at the moment. Similarly Keiko Kitagawa delivers a great performance as the emotionally detached Rina as well Yuika Motokariya who portrays her helpful and caring classmate Maki. Overall great performances.In the end Dear Friends is film that reconsiders the true essence of genuine friendship. The film does falter somewhat in its execution specifically towards its conclusion as well as become a little clich in attempting to portray certain situations that arise in the film. But Dear Friends does convey a strong message of friendship and willingness for one to change their life for the ultimate better and that is what makes Dear Friends worth a watch.Visit CinemaRepose.com for more reviews.".

	schema:headline " Two girls world apart joined by friendship";
	schema:reviewBody "A charismatic high school girl with a decidedly rainy day approach to friendship finds just how important connections can be when she is diagnosed with a terminal illness and relegated to a lonely hospital bed. Rina Keiko Kitagawa Fast n Furious Tokyo Drift comes from a dysfunctional family and only contacts her friends in times of need. Her father is completely selfabsorbed and her mother is overprotective to a fault. Much to Rina's relief a concerned classmate named Maki eventually appears claiming she was a childhood friend. One day after discovering that she has a terminal illness the girl who once viewed her friendships as disposable is forced to sit in her sterile surroundings with nary a friendly soul in sight. Her family is too wrapped up in their own affairs to drop in for a visit and her friends all realize that she and Rina were good friends back in grade school. When Maki tries to reconnect with her old friend and Rina realizes that she doesn't even remember the friendly girl it soon becomes apparent just how flawed the philosophy of this fiercely independent teen truly is. While the film is predictable it doesn't hinder it from being a touching little piece. Keiko Kitagawa's performance was great as a new up and coming actress in Japan. Audience will really believe how unmerciful her character can be and the gradual change of her character's view of companionship towards the film's end.If anything a narrative flaw on the director's part would be having Maki be concerned of Rina to almost a stalking fan. Even hints of homo sexuality since they weren't that close in the first place with the enormous sacrifice on Maki's behalf. It just seemed to be case until halfway through the film when we discover the reason for her almost infatuated care towards Rina. This aside some shots were dead on delivered especially scenes with Rina dancing away in the nightclub. With other scenes being hardly accompanied with any background score to heighten the drama which was disappointing. And one glaringly disjointed narrative which occurs two thrids into the film. Overall this is one of the better films to come out of Japan in 2007 and is definitely worth a look. It is as much about teen angst as it about friendship and what defines a true life companion.".

Like literature... sometimes you must learn to read between the lines to appreciate what the authorcreator of the bookmovie is trying to say. No this isn't just the type of movie you just sit there and watch and expect to do all the work. If you want lowmaintenance movies then look elsewhere. Just like not all books are for light reading which just have gratuitous violence and smut... not all movies are made for the sole purpose of entertaining the viewer with the same type of stuff. Look at the name of the movie! It starts there. So many things are going on at once but I did not find it difficult at all to feel the emotions that were intended. So much suppressed emotions... very much like the people of Hong Kong worried about suppression of their freedoms. Each shot of the movie included something symbolic. I think that no matter how many times I watch it I will see one more thing that was meant to be said. Social political and individual... I truly admired this movie and the captivating web it has weaved.".

No this isn't just the type of movie you just sit there and watch and expect to do all the work. If you want lowmaintenance movies then look elsewhere. Just like not all books are for light reading which just have gratuitous violence and smut... not all movies are made for the sole purpose of entertaining the viewer with the same type of stuff. Look at the name of the movie! It starts there. So many things are going on at once but I did not find it difficult at all to feel the emotions that were intended. So much suppressed emotions... very much like the people of Hong Kong worried about suppression of their freedoms. Each shot of the movie included something symbolic. I think that no matter how many times I watch it I will see one more thing that was meant to be said. Social political and individual... I truly admired this movie and the captivating web it has weaved.";

I think perhaps the only drawback is Maggie Cheung's character as it seems a little pointless. However I like nearly everything Jeremy Irons is in  he is really one of the world's best actors. His characters are always people that I can somehow empathise with  they're always very believable and he really carries the film's themes. The idea of setting the film in the six months leading up to Hong Kong's July 1 1997 handover works well. As Irons' character dies so does British sovereignty  the Union Jack goes down the last Governor cries Gong Li shakes off her longtime sugar daddy. It's a captivating and welltold story of which the Director should be proud although I read an interview with him a while ago and he didn't want to talk about the film since it's upset some people in Hong Kong I think. This film is certainly better than most rubbish that's made in Hong Kong. I urge you to find a copy and see it.".

It is the time when not only the world is changing in an unknown direction but also when John may or may not find the fulfilling of his great love to Vivian a beautiful Chinese bartender with a dubious past herself in love with a third Chinese man.The story is a combination between culture clash movies intertwined with love stories a la 'Shogun' with love stories in the shade of a crumbling world as in 'Casablanca'. It is to the credit of the director that despite a little too simplistic and explicit romantic intrigue he succeeds to bring to screen and combine a little of the charm of both genres in the right dosage. One may wonder where did Wayne Wang's career go lately and why he rather picked to do trashy films as 'Maid in Manhattan'.The strength of the film and what makes it survive well the decade since its realization resides however in the rendition of the city of its infinite colors and smells of the crowd and the noise of its hopes fears and dreams in the wake of the falling under Communist rule. Jeremy Irons is perfect as he will ever be Li Gong is an enigmatic Chinese Hepburn and Ruben Blades and Maggie Chang fill in two memorable supporting roles and another lateral story that fits well in the mosaic. 'Chinese Box' catches both a moment to remember in history and a beautiful love story to remember as well on the background of a world in transition to an unknown destination.".

	schema:headline " One of the best movie IMHO";
	schema:reviewBody "Jeremy Iron Ruben Maggie are fantastic in the movie. Gong Li worked hard at it. She's got the look but I have to hold my breath every time she tries to act... It's quite exhausting to watch her act in this role. Hope it's just me.But the story writing fits perfectly with the title China Box. You have to have enough background knowledge and sensibility to appreciate it. The movie never falls into the clich of eastmeetsthewest. Instead it uses the historical seachange in Hong Kong as the back drop as the grand orchestra accompanying the extraordinary solo of the age old story of love a man and a woman. Nothing is obvious and nothing gives away in the middle and the tension keeps building till the very last moment. I first saw the movie when it came out in theater. But 10 years later I saw it again on tape it blew me away like no other. I'd give it a 10 if not for the rather limited acting skill from Gong Li. There's got to be someone else out there among the 1.3 billion who can really act. Maggie can act but she certainly falls short in her natural beauty for this role in comparison to Gong Li. One other thing I thought was bit of a drag is Maggie's almost perfect English. I thought a character from the very bottom of Hong Kong society with limited education probably would be more convincing if she has more local accent. That's my past experience with folks from Hong Kong. Only those from the privileged the class in Hong Kong would speak like her in the movie... I am so disappointed by the featured review on IMDb here. Because in the past this web site has consistently picked a more sensible review for other movies I ran into. I felt rather compelled to write something to clear the bad rap of this great movie as much as I can. For those who cares Maggie Cheung was in another great movie In the Mood for Love 2000. But that movie was more limited in scope and more nuanced in its presentation a more oriental romance. This movie clearly more European is breadth and depth in its attempt. Some might find the political overtone  a rather negative focus on the 1997 handover suicide etc a bit predictable and clich. But in this particular movie it does set the mood for the over all theme of the movie  after all this is a rather a sad romance. No happy endings for any one. Only human spirit triumph. For that I thought the movie title is a bit off actually. IMHO China Box is only a clever device that is seemingly simple but capable of endless intrigue and twist. That title would be much more fit for a thriller. This one I thought is more about the ultimate triumph of the unyielding human spirit for truth for real meaning and for love as the word originally meant overcoming all odds even the limitation of one's unavoidable mortality.It's a master piece.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jeremy Iron Ruben Maggie are fantastic in the movie. Gong Li worked hard at it. She's got the look but I have to hold my breath every time she tries to act... It's quite exhausting to watch her act in this role. Hope it's just me.But the story writing fits perfectly with the title China Box. You have to have enough background knowledge and sensibility to appreciate it. The movie never falls into the clich of eastmeetsthewest. Instead it uses the historical seachange in Hong Kong as the back drop as the grand orchestra accompanying the extraordinary solo of the age old story of love a man and a woman. Nothing is obvious and nothing gives away in the middle and the tension keeps building till the very last moment. I first saw the movie when it came out in theater. But 10 years later I saw it again on tape it blew me away like no other. I'd give it a 10 if not for the rather limited acting skill from Gong Li. There's got to be someone else out there among the 1.3 billion who can really act. Maggie can act but she certainly falls short in her natural beauty for this role in comparison to Gong Li. One other thing I thought was bit of a drag is Maggie's almost perfect English. I thought a character from the very bottom of Hong Kong society with limited education probably would be more convincing if she has more local accent. That's my past experience with folks from Hong Kong. Only those from the privileged the class in Hong Kong would speak like her in the movie... I am so disappointed by the featured review on IMDb here. Because in the past this web site has consistently picked a more sensible review for other movies I ran into. I felt rather compelled to write something to clear the bad rap of this great movie as much as I can. For those who cares Maggie Cheung was in another great movie In the Mood for Love 2000. But that movie was more limited in scope and more nuanced in its presentation a more oriental romance. This movie clearly more European is breadth and depth in its attempt. Some might find the political overtone  a rather negative focus on the 1997 handover suicide etc a bit predictable and clich.

With the approaching political changeover John is feeling a deep sense of melancholy that is deepened when his doctor gives him some bad news about him having leukemia. The bulk of the film follows him as he makes one last desperate play for Vivian. However his attempt to win her over is doomed to fail not only by the changing political tides but by a series of dark secrets that emerge from both of their pasts. A subplot of greater interest centers on John's endeavor to record the life story of JeanMaggie Cheung a street hustler with a burned face. This pretty much sums up the plot.First of all let me say it is interesting too see Wangs view on the situation with China and Britain and their all time taboo Hong Kong. A lot of cities have been illuminated for freedom which looks now almost like a new trend if you look at the former Soviets states. Wang doesn't seem to really pick a side weather it is for Britain or China which makes it pleasant to watch.The issue here is the love story which is the biggest barricade here. Although The actors are good the plot just doesn't seem to be going somewhere. Some people might view this as a flaw but it really is just a point of view not so really much TELLING than SHOWING a story. there is a difference.Irons seems to be in his element after M.Butterfly and makes a good stand in keeping up where the story falls down. Gong Li also makes a good impression but she doesn't seem to have the same intensity as her processors in films like Farewell my Concubine or In the Mood for Love. Being the mistress of a rather pathetic Chinese salary man I know that the term is Japanese but this is the best way to subscribe him. Not highly but of some level and she fits nicely around Irons.Maggie Cheung and her character is the one who is standing out in both story as well as in acting. Somehow it doesn't really fit in here therefore it was a smart move of Wang to let it be a sidestory.Remarkable is the music by Greame Revell who delivers a brilliant Chinese Score for this film. You can hear that he tried to find the things that made China what it is and if you listen to the music then it doesn't sound like china it IS china if you understand what I am getting at Revell isn't imitating but he is recomposing. Nice sound design and the song Reuben Blades sings when Irons leaves the hospital is just wonderful with very emotional lyrics.The cinematography is at some points interesting but not of a high art. Wangs direction isn't brilliant but it holds up. WHat makes this movie so good then. The feeling and the lead actor Jeremy Irons.".

He's in love with Vivian Gong Li a Hong Kong resident who in turn is in love with a powerful businessman. Then there is also Jean Maggie Cheung a woman who captures John's interest and is willing to give him an interview for a price. But is she telling the truth? Chinese Box is an enigma and one could argue that that is the point.

We want him to make it with Vivian because we like him so much. Irons does not go for the tear ducts nor does he spend the time he has left moping around or spouting philosophical nonsense. John knows he doesn't have much time left and he spends it doing the two things he really wants win Vivian's heart back and figure out Jean. There is a reason why Gong Li is considered the Asian Meryl Streep. Li is a amazing actress but unfortunately like the film she remains an enigma. She doesn't have much dialogue but Li uses her face to express herself. Cheung is also interesting as the feisty Jean. She's actually the polar opposite of Vivian vocal emotive and independent. This is probably why John finds her so interesting.Director Wayne Wang made the hit film The Joy Luck Club based on the bestselling novel by Amy Tan neither of which I have experienced. Whatever rights he did there are not present here. He keeps the characters at an arm's distance which may be the point but what we do understand isn't especially interesting. There are some isolated scenes that work but over all it's a pretty dull film. The best parts are when we get a peek into the culture of Hong Kong or what we can gather of it.This isn't an especially interesting film and not really worth it.".

That said it's not for everyone and it's the kind of film that I am always surprised to see in a cinema release because I can see little or no mainstream market for it. Regardless of this the film is worth seeing even if only for the extraordinary performance of Maggie Cheung. Jeremy Irons as usual plays Jeremy Irons and Gong Li from whom we were expecting a virtuoso performance seems to fade in and out of the background. She does have a few shining moments but... perhaps it's the role she's been given. Maggie plays a young woman with an unexplained facial scar and a tragic past which I won't detail and she does so with an air of charm and vulnerability and even leaves us with an impression of genuine innocence. It's hard not to like Maggie and the film leaves the viewer wanting more. Speilberg has reputedly cast her in Memoirs of a Geisha  in production in 2000. Watch out for HK film veteran Michael Hui The Private Eyes Teppanyaki etc. as the man unableunwilling to marry Gong Li because of her past.".

Jeremy Irons as usual plays Jeremy Irons and Gong Li from whom we were expecting a virtuoso performance seems to fade in and out of the background. She does have a few shining moments but... perhaps it's the role she's been given. Maggie plays a young woman with an unexplained facial scar and a tragic past which I won't detail and she does so with an air of charm and vulnerability and even leaves us with an impression of genuine innocence. It's hard not to like Maggie and the film leaves the viewer wanting more. Speilberg has reputedly cast her in Memoirs of a Geisha  in production in 2000. Watch out for HK film veteran Michael Hui The Private Eyes Teppanyaki etc. as the man unableunwilling to marry Gong Li because of her past.";

This is nowhere near that but I did come away thinking that this is a very personal film about the change in Hong Kong. Story does take place in Hong Kong during the last 6 months of British colonialism and the central character is John Jeremy Irons who is a writer and roams the city with his video camera capturing different things that go on but he is madly in love with Vivian Gong Li who owns a bar but has a sordid past that looms over them. John has been feeling ill and gets checked out and learns that he has leukemia and has 3 to 6 months to live.SPOILER ALERTJohn continues to wander the streets and he meets Jean Maggie Cheung who has a bad scar on her face and she sells knick knacks on the street and John becomes fascinated by her. As time dwindles down John must face the fact that changes are inevitable and the people of Hong Kong will go on without him.This film is directed by Wayne Wang who has made a good career out of making films about Asians and the way they live despite cultural differences. But while I think there are some interesting things in this film it's clearly not one of Wang's best. Film tries very hard to be thought provoking in it's overall message with the characters but it just seems to come off as ponderous. As talented as Iron's and Li are they seem a bit uninspired and the rare bursts of energy just lack any conviction. The most interesting character in the film is Jean played by Cheung and she easily steals every scene she's in and her character shows obvious layers of pain that she hides well despite the scar on her face. Cheung is a Hong Kong action star but she shows she can easily handle drama and I hope someone writes her a good script to be in. The story meanders and doesn't really have any focus in it's message and even though Wang is a good director it just comes across as lacking emotional depth.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've got a Chinese guy living in my house who doesn't speak a word of Spanish.Ricardo Darn has starred in two of my favorite Argentine films El Secreto de Sus Ojos and Nueve Reinas. Darn is a great actor and he has proved he can do very different roles and manage them well. In this film he plays a quiet grumpy and lonely man whose life turns around when an unexpected visitor changes his every day routine. Un Cuento Chino was written and directed by Sebastian Borensztein a director I wasn't familiar with until now. He has made a well crafted film by mixing the right amount of comedy with drama. The movie shines thanks to the original script and Darn's performance along with two good supporting performances from unknown actors Muriel Santa Ana and Ignacio Huang. The film claims to be based on a true story but actually it is just loosely based on an unexpected incident which had to do with a cow falling from the sky and sinking a Japanese ship. This story actually begins with a Chinese couple in a River who are interrupted when a cow falls from the sky. From that moment on you know that you are in for a very different movie but there is a perfect explanation for the event. The cow falling from the sky is the only true event about this movie which is a fictionalization about a relationship between this lonely man played by Ricardo Darn and a Chinese immigrant in Argentina. Their failure to communicate is what makes this film so funny.Roberto Ricardo Darin is a hardware store owner who lives on his own in the city of Buenos Aires. He is very grumpy and always complaining but also seems to live a very quiet and routine life. His house is behind the store so he spends most of his time indoors keeping to his self and collecting newspaper clips of bizarre and rare stories in order to prove that life is meaningless. He goes to bed exactly at 11pm and wakes up the next morning to the same breakfast coffee and bread. He seems comfortable living on his own. He seems to have had a short relationship with the sister in law of the person who always brings him the international newspapers. Her name is Mari Muriel Santa Ana and she lives in the countryside far from Buenos Aires but happens to be visiting again and is very much in love with Roberto. His life changes when he runs into a Chinese immigrant named Jun Ignacio Huang who is thrown out of a cab after being mugged. Jun has nowhere to go and doesn't speak Spanish so Roberto decides to help him. He takes Jun to the address he has tattooed on his arm but the person living there claims that a Chinese man sold the house to him several years ago. Roberto takes Jun to the Chinese Embassy where Jun can finally communicate his intentions He has come to Argentina to find his uncle since he is the only family he has left. Despite the inconvenience Roberto decides to take Jun in for a few days until his uncle shows up. This will change Roberto's routine and affect his life.Darin's character might be grumpy and mean but he is also nice and has a big enough heart to accommodate a foreigner into his home. He will never expect how this relationship will dramatically change his life but this relationship is exactly what makes the story work. There are other funny moments like some of the paper clips that Roberto finds and how he recreates those bizarre events in his mind but the center of the story revolves around him Jun and Mari. The story moves slow at times but it works really well because it shows us exactly how Roberto lived before Jun shows up. Once Jun is with Roberto everything changes and that is what makes for the funniest moments. Un Cuento Chino is a very rare film but a good one with memorable characters and an unlikely pairing between Darin and Huang that works really well. The film has a feel good feeling to it and once the credits begin to role it's impossible not to leave with a smile in your face. I absolutely recommend this movie which won Best Argentine Film and the Goya for Best Iberoamerican Film in 2011. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

He takes Jun to the address he has tattooed on his arm but the person living there claims that a Chinese man sold the house to him several years ago. Roberto takes Jun to the Chinese Embassy where Jun can finally communicate his intentions He has come to Argentina to find his uncle since he is the only family he has left. Despite the inconvenience Roberto decides to take Jun in for a few days until his uncle shows up. This will change Roberto's routine and affect his life.Darin's character might be grumpy and mean but he is also nice and has a big enough heart to accommodate a foreigner into his home. He will never expect how this relationship will dramatically change his life but this relationship is exactly what makes the story work. There are other funny moments like some of the paper clips that Roberto finds and how he recreates those bizarre events in his mind but the center of the story revolves around him Jun and Mari. The story moves slow at times but it works really well because it shows us exactly how Roberto lived before Jun shows up. Once Jun is with Roberto everything changes and that is what makes for the funniest moments. Un Cuento Chino is a very rare film but a good one with memorable characters and an unlikely pairing between Darin and Huang that works really well. The film has a feel good feeling to it and once the credits begin to role it's impossible not to leave with a smile in your face. I absolutely recommend this movie which won Best Argentine Film and the Goya for Best Iberoamerican Film in 2011. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Enjoyable but a bit sentimental says Yalza from Denmark as a title to his critic for this movie. I don't quite understand it this is not a Rambo movie this is a very subtle composition about human values about ethical decisions about people reaching out to each other trying to cope with emotions sometimes small ones sometimes too big and impossible to grasp in one take.I was mesmerized throughout the whole film for moments afraid that the incredible pacing and magic created by this superb director Sebastin Borensztein also the script writer could come down with some unforgivable faux pas that would destroy the fantastic story being told. But that improbability never happened. Not even in the most minuscule detail. Ricardo Darn created such a strong introverted character Roberto endearing from the very beginning with his constant cursing I didn't see the English subtitles but I'm afraid that most Argentinian cursing vocabulary is untranslatable while Ignacio Huang Jun brought to life this lost penniless Chinese immigrant incapable even to say ROBERTO due to his total lack of the Spanish language plus the handicap that Chinese people cannot pronounce R at the beginning of a word Muriel Santa Ana as Mari projected so well her not hidden at all great love for Roberto that one felt immediately for her.And so it goes with the whole rest of the cast all perfect even to the smallest part. This movie grabbed me with the story of the lost immigrant in a country without the language because I was there and although it wasn't that tragic I know how one can feel when it's impossible to communicate.There are some heart wrenching emotional moments the ones I suppose our friend Yalza from Denmark found objectionable tearjerkers but they are an intrinsic part of those situations and their inevitable conclusion otherwise we'd be dealing with robots.Anyway to me this is an impeccable movie so far removed from any Hollywood product I'm convinced that Argentinian movies delve with the same profoundly human feelings that once did the Italian neorrealism in the 1940s and as far as I know and I don't know that much only Brazilian cinematography matches those feelings with the same intensity.Try to watch it because honestly it's a jewel of a movie. And oh! its final scene... what a gorgeous final scene to end a perfectly gorgeous movie!".

	schema:headline " Beautiful and touching story";
	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this Argentinian comedydrama movie about a solitary man that aids an indigent Chinese man that arrives in his country and speaks no word of Spanish! It's quite a beautiful and touching story mostly because of the way it develops and helps both men finding their way to happiness. It's told in the beginning that this story is based on true events. If so it's even better and interesting.Roberto played by Ricardo Darn is a solitary man that lives in a poor house and owns a small shop. He's very methodic and has some strange habits and hobbies. For instance he shuts down the light before sleep everyday on 23pm o'clock on the precise second ! and collects bizarre and absurd true stories he cuts from newspapers I also appreciated the way those stories are told in the film Roberto imagines the story as he was there and assumes the character of that little story like Amlie Poulain in AMLIE . But his live is not easy. He's afraid to release his feelings and emotions and he's very closed and linked to the past. At the same time he's very honest has a strong personality and is a person with great moral values. Precisely what will make him rescue Juan the lost Chinese man played by Ignacio Huang and help him against everything even other Chinese people who are unwilling to aid Juan by the way it's hilarious the scene when they go to a Chinese neighborhood in Buenos Aires and when Juan starts speaking in Chinese to his compatriot the other man says in Spanish  I don't understand him!! He's talking in Cantonese and I speak Mandarin! It's a different language! AHAH! Of course he's right but the situation is hilarious and priceless!. So it's for this man with such noble character that Mari Muriel Santa Ana a friend and neighbor of Roberto will fall in love. But he seems to not care he seems to be afraid of her or maybe he's just afraid of himself However helping Juan Roberto will help himself too as we will see in the end of the film. I don't use to appreciate beautiful and happy endings but here I did! I really enjoyed the way this film ended especially because what it meant to Roberto and to the way his life turned around! This film is delicious by its humor its drama and also because of all those little circumstances portrayed that can really happen to every one of us and change our lives!".

	schema:reviewBody "Usually telling the end of a film is considered a spoiler. In the case of Argentinian director Sebastin Borensztein 'Chinese TakeOut' 'Un cuento cino' in the Spanish version it would be a spoiler to tell how it begins. I actually watched the usual late comers to the cinema hall and wondered whether the film experience is really complete for those folks who entered even only two minutes late after the start of the projection. So I won't make the mistake of revealing the start of this quite charming feelgood film I will just say it's quite relevant.The film tells the story of a grumpy midaged owner of a hardware shop in Argentina named Roberto who lives alone refusing almost any relation with other human beings excepting his suppliers and customers well even with these ones only to the point where they do not walk on his toes. He is a good and decent man and a very bad communicator at the same time. The last thing he needs in life is the appearance of a young Chinese man Jun frightened and disoriented who looks for his uncle in the search for somebody to support him in finding a new way in a new country and who has noone to rely on but Roberto whom he met accidentally. None of them speaks any word in the language of the other and each hides traumas from the bast that justify their own barriers in communication. The whole movie is about finding ways to communicate and building a friendship that will help both in overcoming the hurdles of life.Films about overcoming cultural gaps doubled by barriers of language and making human communication possible despite of them have been made in the past the one I happen to remember is the Israeli 'Noodle' which was telling the story of a stewardess who finds herself taking care of an abandoned Chinese kid. What makes the story different in 'Un quento cino' are the background stories of the two heroes and the fact that Ricardo Darin and Ignacio Huang are right on spot for the two leading roles. One of the nice ideas of the film is that Jun Huang does not really speak one word of Spanish during the whole film he speaks Chinese but no translation is available. The language gap is more than a emotional trick or a comic pretext in this film. It is the very glue upon which the relationship and eventually the friendship between the two characters is based upon. Although it is aimed eventually to be a feelgood movie and succeeds to be so 'Un quento cino' avoids falling into cheap melodrama because of the discrete humor built upon the daytoday situations also based on the fact that in the absence of words the characters need to use gestures which to some extent remind the pantomime style of the early cinema comedies. A discrete and pleasant film.".

All the major characters in the film seemed frustrated in their individual search of love. Jun was lost in a foreign country and searching for his uncle who could give him new hope of living. Roberto was burdened by a very sad memory that his beloved father died from a unbearable shock that his only son was on the battlefield of a war. Mari was making every effort to open Roberto's heart but could hardly make any progress... These characters didn't talk much in the whole film but showed us so many deep emotions.

	schema:headline " Chinese Take Away by Ivette FredRivera";
	schema:reviewBody "Chinese Take Away Un cuento chino by Ivette FredRiveraChinese Take Away Un cuento chino in Spanish is a comedy written and directed by Sebastin Borensztein and winner of the international awards of Best Film by the public at the Festival in Rome and Best Latin American Film at the Goya Awards both in 2011. It is the third time that excellent Argentinian actor Ricardo Darn stars in a film of Borensztein the other two Oscar winning The secret in their eyes and Oscar nominated The Son of the Bride. The title in Spanish is curious because a Chinese story means a story improbable incredible I think because it's a place so far away that we cannot believe how do we know if China exist? The film opens in Fucheng China in Hebei province we can enjoy the already wellknown beauty of the Chinese landscape when a Chinese man Jun Ignacio Huang takes his girlfriend on a boat trip on a picturesque lake surrounded by mountains to propose to her when a cow falls from the sky killing Jun's girlfriend. Ironically what falls from the sky is usually a sign of good luck in Latin America. A reverse shot makes the transition to hardware De Cesare in Buenos Aires Argentina because it is going around the world. In the beginning Roberto Ricardo Darn shows that theft is a string a trader sells him fewer screws per box and he sells his client less per pound. But as Mari Muriel Santa Ana explains Roberto although suffered is noble. A chance encounter in the street prompts Roberto to help Jun. Roberto sees Jun being expelled from a taxi after being robbed while he was watching the landing of airplanes in the airport. The toy plane flying inside of Roberto's car takes him to China.It is the story of Roberto and Jun brought together in Buenos Aires where Jun goes in search of his only living relative. For the Chinese even in the diaspora the family is sacred as it is stipulated by Confucianism ancient texts. Jun insists on finding his uncle to start a new life after his tragedy. Both Jun and Roberto are orphans but Jun has insisted that his tapo uncle is his family.Though Roberto's life is totally dominated by repetition he is fascinated with coincidence. Roberto collects quirky news from around the world and permutes the characters with the people he knows in his imagination taking revenge on their enemies as Dante did in the Divine Comedy.Through the stylish Chinese food delivery guy  looking like the Chinese youth dressed in the cities in China very modern who serves as a translator Roberto explains to Jun that life is absurd does not have any sense and shows the news he had collected including one about some men stealing cows in China with a plane and how a group of peasants follows and shoots the plane in flight the plane's back door is opened and two cows are dropped one of them killing a girlfriend in a boat who happens to be Jun's as the translator then explains to Roberto. On the other hand for Jun everything in life has meaning. It all makes sense. The absurd is for those who can't understand meaning. Very touching the drawing Jun makes for Roberto before he departs to meet his tapo with a frontal cow head on the wall that he had repaired and cleaned. He is an artist who worked painting toys in China. Jun draw it with what was left of a pencil that Roberto discarded. The Chinese are very resourceful people indeed. No waste the most hardworking people in the world.I liked the film very much because it is a proof of the universality of body language. In China itself being so vast there are several languages in the different regions that's why Jun is not understood by the Chinese he met in Chinatown. However when he talks on the phone with his uncle in Chinese we understand perfectly what he is saying because of the depiction of emotion. Language is really a matter of our genuine interest to understand each Other. I have just returned from China I can assure you that.".

It is the third time that excellent Argentinian actor Ricardo Darn stars in a film of Borensztein the other two Oscar winning The secret in their eyes and Oscar nominated The Son of the Bride. The title in Spanish is curious because a Chinese story means a story improbable incredible I think because it's a place so far away that we cannot believe how do we know if China exist? The film opens in Fucheng China in Hebei province we can enjoy the already wellknown beauty of the Chinese landscape when a Chinese man Jun Ignacio Huang takes his girlfriend on a boat trip on a picturesque lake surrounded by mountains to propose to her when a cow falls from the sky killing Jun's girlfriend. Ironically what falls from the sky is usually a sign of good luck in Latin America. A reverse shot makes the transition to hardware De Cesare in Buenos Aires Argentina because it is going around the world. In the beginning Roberto Ricardo Darn shows that theft is a string a trader sells him fewer screws per box and he sells his client less per pound. But as Mari Muriel Santa Ana explains Roberto although suffered is noble. A chance encounter in the street prompts Roberto to help Jun. Roberto sees Jun being expelled from a taxi after being robbed while he was watching the landing of airplanes in the airport. The toy plane flying inside of Roberto's car takes him to China.It is the story of Roberto and Jun brought together in Buenos Aires where Jun goes in search of his only living relative. For the Chinese even in the diaspora the family is sacred as it is stipulated by Confucianism ancient texts. Jun insists on finding his uncle to start a new life after his tragedy. Both Jun and Roberto are orphans but Jun has insisted that his tapo uncle is his family.Though Roberto's life is totally dominated by repetition he is fascinated with coincidence. Roberto collects quirky news from around the world and permutes the characters with the people he knows in his imagination taking revenge on their enemies as Dante did in the Divine Comedy.Through the stylish Chinese food delivery guy  looking like the Chinese youth dressed in the cities in China very modern who serves as a translator Roberto explains to Jun that life is absurd does not have any sense and shows the news he had collected including one about some men stealing cows in China with a plane and how a group of peasants follows and shoots the plane in flight the plane's back door is opened and two cows are dropped one of them killing a girlfriend in a boat who happens to be Jun's as the translator then explains to Roberto. On the other hand for Jun everything in life has meaning. It all makes sense. The absurd is for those who can't understand meaning. Very touching the drawing Jun makes for Roberto before he departs to meet his tapo with a frontal cow head on the wall that he had repaired and cleaned. He is an artist who worked painting toys in China. Jun draw it with what was left of a pencil that Roberto discarded. The Chinese are very resourceful people indeed. No waste the most hardworking people in the world.I liked the film very much because it is a proof of the universality of body language. In China itself being so vast there are several languages in the different regions that's why Jun is not understood by the Chinese he met in Chinatown. However when he talks on the phone with his uncle in Chinese we understand perfectly what he is saying because of the depiction of emotion. Language is really a matter of our genuine interest to understand each Other. I have just returned from China I can assure you that.";

Instead of the number specified in the box Roberto has been gypped something he notices that occurs all the time. He curses the company that cannot even count right. He is a man of few words who does not take kindly to idiots that come into his shop. One thing Roberto loves is to cut articles from newspapers with bizarre stories.

He has come looking for a relative whose address he was given is the one where the De Cesare's Hardware is located. Roberto does not understand a thing Jun is trying to tell him and viceversa.

Roberto takes pity on the poor Jun by taking him to the embassy where they promise to contact Jun's relatives.

Mari is also interested in Roberto in a more romantic way although he seems oblivious to the way she looks at him.Through his newspaper clippings we get to know a little bit of Roberto's life and his involvement in the Falklands war.

Roberto is in for a big surprise after Jun leaves having found his distant uncle by what Jun decided to paint on his wall!An interesting film from Argentina written and directed by Sebastian Borensztein the son of well known and witty comedian Tato Bores. The film works in unexpected ways because it is a comedy with an important message sandwiched in between. The title refers to the kind of stories that are so far fetched they are not true. Roberto lives through exactly that stories that are so incredible that he puts himself in them trying to make sense to escape his lonely existence.One could not imagine what the film might have been without the great Ricardo Darin playing Roberto. The actor is without a doubt one of the best actors working today. The intelligence of Mr. Darin permeates everything he does he is no one other than Roberto the strange shop owner facing a dilemma about what to do with his life. Ignacio Huang plays Jun and Muriel Santa Ana is Mari.".

In the past there have been various attempts most recently the spoof Team America. However in all the films before the puppets were used to represent humans. Here in Strings the fact that they are marionettes is integral to the tale and the strings that hold them are as important as the characters. Each of them are aware of these cords and they play such a huge part in every scene and in the grand design of the whole thing. The details such as the city gate being just a piece of stone which is lifted to a high level preventing the strings from passing thus stopping anyone entering or leaving. The prison which is a simple grid of beams at a height leading to some poignant moments when an imprisoned family can see each other but cannot touch. Fights are enacted where the intention is to sever someone's cords. A child's birth is a different affair with the baby being carved first before the strings themselves can be attached. Truly imaginative and quite a high concept yet working so well.The marionettes are not the detailed dolls that Team America gave us. The only facial movements here are the eyes which open and close. This could have presented a problem but thanks to the marvelous animation of the wooden puppets and some passionate voice casting it doesn't. There is never any confusion as to who is speaking and what is going on as the film presents us with wonderfully conceived scene after scene. Some elements are beautiful and touching such as an underwater rescue or the aforementioned birth scene. Some are quite shocking but without being upsetting. Burning string has never seemed so dark until now.This is possibly one of the freshest most creative films of recent years and is another example of someone doing something new with a genre. Visually superb and wonderfully played out the only concern is where the market actually lies for this kind of film. As a kids story it is very mature and dark and as a mature film the puppetry is a little alienating to the masses. Instead this film lies somewhere between the two and if you can cope with a delightful tale with poignant moments enacted by some of the best 'classic' puppetry you would ever see then go and take a seat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strings is quite a unique and interesting movie going experience. This just happens to be one of those movies I had never heard of before that I ran across doing research and decided to give it a shot. My biggest problem with Strings is that the puppets do not move their mouths which made it a little hard to follow as the dialogue as it switched back and forth between characters. Once your able to get past that  this is really a beautiful little film. A little overdramatic but with some pretty high production values Strings is unlike no movie you have seen before. The cinematography voice overs and set designs are well done and very pleasing to watch and to listen to all throughout.One thing I enjoyed about Strings was the how the actual strings were incorporated in the movie. There is no effort to hide them. In fact the strings themselves are part of each characters actual being reaching all the way up in to the sky with the head string being the strongest and most valuable. Cut the head string and your dead! Get a little to playful and you might get tangled and need some help getting undone! Interesting little concept. Strings is a fantasy story about a King who commits suicide leaving the thrown to his son. When his son is lead to believe by his evil uncle that some outside rebels are responsible for his death he seeks out to find them and avenge his father. In the process he goes on a magical journey learning about life love war and the fact that people and things aren't always quite what they seem. Strings is a film that stands on its own two feet apart from anything else out there. All in all it's a very impressive piece of work and a good family oriented film. Recommended!".

The story is a stereotypical but very decent fantasy fairytale with the very interesting added element of the stringed puppet reality. It worked very well with a quite serious and emotional story a bit reminiscent of Gormenghast  all immensely well produced. But it wasn't engaging enough to maintain that much enthusiasm in the viewer. It was a bit too dark to be for children and somewhat too I dunno uninvolving to be for grownups. I appreciate it as an honest very competently produced fantasy movie with a detailed and goodlooking but also quite crude and limited universe.I do think it would be more engaging on the big screen than on a TV screen because I was slightly bored through much of it. Granted I was a bit tired when we watched it and this is not a movie one should watch while tired. But it was a very interesting experience.7 out of 10.".

The king then commits suicide by cutting his head string. Unfortunately the king's act was discovered by his evil brother and the suicide is rearranged as a murder the perpetrator members of the very enemy the king had wanted to find peace with. The Brother then sets in motion a vile plan to kill his nephew and seize the throne for himself.So begins one of the most unique films I've ever seen. Sure there have been puppet films before but none that I've seen that have ever embraced their limitations so well that they turn them into an asset. Yes you see the strings actually the strings are even more noticeable then they would be in a real live puppet show and yes the characters are very aware that they have strings. The reasoning is two fold first it creates a wonderful visual motif at times with shots using the strings to create beautiful images such as emphasizing a rain storm or the bars of a prison. The strings also are used symbolically to allude to how we are all connected how we are often on a leash and how there may be forces godpuppeteers above us. Its amazing.The best thing is that it's a great story. This is grand fantasy or grand adventure of the highest order. What happens is very human as we are forced to confront what we are told is the truth which often turns out not to be the case. It's a story of greed and hope how your worst enemy can be your best friend and how the sins of the fathers need not be visited on the sons. There is real pain and real danger. If this were a novel it would be a classic of the genre. Trust me I sat on the floor of my living room doing some sorting totally and completely enraptured by what was going on because even when I wasn't looking up I was listening to a well acted Derek Jacobi as the villain and fantastically written story. It's the type of tale you'd curl up with on a cold winter's night before going to bed.Yea I liked the film.If you want to see a great adventure a great story see this movie. Please don not let the fact that its marionettes keep you from seeing it. This is not for kids or rather too small ones since there is death and darkness and a plot that maybe hard for them to follow. It's a kick in the head and there's a chance at the end that maybe it will even cause a tear to run down your cheek.See it if you get the chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "The king commits suicide but his evil brother covers it up to make the death look like murder from a rival faction. The prince disguises himself as a slave to go out and avenge his father's death but after infiltrating the enemy camp begins to learn an alternate history of his people  sometimes the good guys have a dark past.This film was incredible. You very rarely see a film with puppets in it these days or ever really. Sure there was Team America but I really found the puppeteering on that to be average and the overall film to be a waste of time. This one had a rich back story characters with epic lives and a whole realm of fantasy that could have been real life.I think of the movie like The Dark Crystal. I don't know why but I get a similar vibe from them. With one key difference I don't like The Dark Crystal. Other films could be compared to this I suppose Lord of the Rings to some extent maybe Willow probably a hundred more. It had all the classic fantasy elements a hero a kingdom love betrayal evil an oracle battles. Everything you'd want.There was an underlying political message here too which I enjoyed although I don't know if I really got the exact parallel they were shooting for. But the idea that we are always the goo guys and they are always the bad guys when not viewed as people was very nice and could be used to talk about America and the Middle East or the Native Americans it could be used to talk about Israel and Palestine or just about any other rival groups.The love aspects were a bit much at times. I liked the idea that our strings are all attached and that love really makes that stronger. I tend to agree with the sentiment. At times I think it bordered on hippie or New Age levels my ability to digest peace and love only goes so far. But it was never so much I became uninterested in the film.If you want something different than your usual action or romance give this one a chance. You might have to open your mind a little bit because it's fantasy and puppets and voiceovers not just because they're puppets they're also Scandinavian. I think you'll find a special treat in here. Really glad I had the opportunity to catch it at a friend's house as I probably never would have found it on my own.".

This one had a rich back story characters with epic lives and a whole realm of fantasy that could have been real life.I think of the movie like The Dark Crystal. I don't know why but I get a similar vibe from them. With one key difference I don't like The Dark Crystal. Other films could be compared to this I suppose Lord of the Rings to some extent maybe Willow probably a hundred more. It had all the classic fantasy elements a hero a kingdom love betrayal evil an oracle battles. Everything you'd want.There was an underlying political message here too which I enjoyed although I don't know if I really got the exact parallel they were shooting for. But the idea that we are always the goo guys and they are always the bad guys when not viewed as people was very nice and could be used to talk about America and the Middle East or the Native Americans it could be used to talk about Israel and Palestine or just about any other rival groups.The love aspects were a bit much at times. I liked the idea that our strings are all attached and that love really makes that stronger. I tend to agree with the sentiment. At times I think it bordered on hippie or New Age levels my ability to digest peace and love only goes so far. But it was never so much I became uninterested in the film.If you want something different than your usual action or romance give this one a chance. You might have to open your mind a little bit because it's fantasy and puppets and voiceovers not just because they're puppets they're also Scandinavian. I think you'll find a special treat in here. Really glad I had the opportunity to catch it at a friend's house as I probably never would have found it on my own.";

This means travelling in disguise to infiltrate the enemy camp. But his journey brings him another truth than the one he original was seeking after.This is one of the most original Danish movies made in a long time. Never has there been a Danish movie featuring only puppets as the actors of the movie. The technical element of the movie is great. Brilliantly cinematography means that this movie is captured as another live action movie in its genre. The artdirection is beautiful and fits the puppets very well. The sound effectsmonologue editing is superb and helps create a great atmosphere along together with the abovementioned aspects.This means that it is a pity the story isn't nearly as original as the technical aspects. It is a very typical fantasyadventure bringing no big surprises. It is shaped very dramatically leaving no form for humour or funny sidekicks in the movie. This serious take at the story can be pretty linear at times but if you have the patience to watch through this it can be interpreted as a good sign. Another shame is that there are no facial expression on the puppets unlike other puppet movies like Team America World Police. The puppets have the same expression on their faces through the whole movie which doesn't help the emotional part of the movie.The movie has some weak points but even though it is still a good movie and a very original and refreshingly technical take on the puppet movie genre.710".

You really see that her feelings are taken seriously in a nonjudgmental way. Last but not least do not let the film poster mislead you into assuming that this is one raunchy movie.

Don't expect much conveyance of emotions either. I get more uneasy from watching uploaded commercials of a Thai insurance company.Cinematography was beautifully shot regardless of location with the perennial focus and zoom on Miss Sasaki's too perfect a profile not lacking. It was too much to not ponder on that I reluctantly asked my teenaged daughter whom I was watching this with and yes there where uncomfortable parts! Can they Photoshop a whole movie?.Plot was not as hard to miss just that it was progressing too fast to be expected. If it was made into a miniseries then much would rather make sense like Hotaru no Hikari which is WAY out of context. Other characters or subplots are just as forgettable as they come and go. Culture shock would be not as hard as to come by judging from various taboos the story includes excessive and disturbing school bullying disturbing parttime jobs for minors cohabitation situations etc..All in all its characters are beautiful flaws are bearable and definitely watchable just don't expect it to conform to your norms and values maybe unless you're from where this movie came from.".

I get more uneasy from watching uploaded commercials of a Thai insurance company.Cinematography was beautifully shot regardless of location with the perennial focus and zoom on Miss Sasaki's too perfect a profile not lacking. It was too much to not ponder on that I reluctantly asked my teenaged daughter whom I was watching this with and yes there where uncomfortable parts! Can they Photoshop a whole movie?.Plot was not as hard to miss just that it was progressing too fast to be expected. If it was made into a miniseries then much would rather make sense like Hotaru no Hikari which is WAY out of context. Other characters or subplots are just as forgettable as they come and go. Culture shock would be not as hard as to come by judging from various taboos the story includes excessive and disturbing school bullying disturbing parttime jobs for minors cohabitation situations etc..All in all its characters are beautiful flaws are bearable and definitely watchable just don't expect it to conform to your norms and values maybe unless you're from where this movie came from.";
