Jack and Jill vs. the World is a sweet little movie about happiness sympathy love illness and commitment with two lead characters that have opposite behaviors and backgrounds but feel attracted for each other. The story has potential and seems to be slightly inspired in Storie di Ordinaria Follia but is predictable and entertaining. However the screenplay could be improved with a better development of Jack and Jill characters in the very beginning the health situation of Jill could be deeper and more dramatic the relationship of Jack and his father Norman could be also better explored since it is one of the best moments of the movie and last but not the least the conclusion is not wellresolved and needed some improvements.

	schema:reviewBody "My wife first heard about Jack and Jill Vs. The World through a movie trailer website and it was one that she couldn't wait to see. However to me it looked like a typical garden variety romantic comedy...the type of movie that I tolerate because my wife tolerates my kind of movies. However then I heard about the little twist Manning's character's cystic fibrosis and thought that was something that could definitely add a unique element to an otherwise formulaic plot. Well the movie never came to our city and I had forgotten all about it. Then the other day my wife called me from Blockbuster to tell me the wonderful news it was now on DVD. So she rented it brought it home and we just got done watching it. First the positive. The acting was pretty decent and the movie definitely had a few shining moments. One of those included Robert Forster's character and Prinze's character sharing a touching fatherson moment. Indeed Forster was one of the best things about this film. The only problem is that you only hear him most of the time through narration. Finally the movie did have that one unique element that added some drama without ever becoming over the top or manipulative. Now the negative. And it's a big one. It is what many people would consider to be the most important component to a movie The screenplay. I mean let's be honest usually a movie will be whatever it's screenplay is. In other words if a screenplay is good the movie will probably be good and vice versa. And the screenplay here is lacking. The dialogue is never really believable and so the characters are never really believable and thus there never is an emotional connection made. That's a big problem especially in a movie where the characters need to be cared about. I never really cared because they never seemed real. I get the feeling here that this script was a rough draft and for some reason no one wanted to take the time to polish it up. That's disappointing. Because this is a movie that had some promise but because of the screenplay never had a chance to live up to what it could have been.".

She's clutching a subway map and asking for directions. He seems bizarrely charmed by someone who appears to the rest of us to be a mental patient.Then  in a sequence we don't see she gives him her resume and headshots and explains she's in New York to act and model. That's right in a scene we DON'T see.So we cut from the roof meeting to Freddie recommending her for a topless modelling job. Hey now and the what now ??? She accepts no questions asked. Then he supports her in a friendly kind way during the shoot. Even though she's just wearing bikini bottoms she seems completely happy with it.Isn't that what mother's warn daughters would happen if they trust strange men in the big city ? This film also has the worst first kiss moment neither romantic or sexy  expected or wanted. Freddie and Taryn have less chemistry than an organic fruit farm. Although Mr.Prinze can be happy with his first real grown up role he's a convincing fleshed out adult man now and this performance will see him get much better roles.Contrary to the previous review this film really embraces many Hollywood clichs the terminally ill heroine  the 'set in his ways' businessman realising there's a freer way to live the 'falling in love' montage the colleague who keeps fixing up Freddie with unsuitable women ! The kooky girl who just wants the whole world to have fun !! On and on..Taryn keeps saying ' I love New York'  but as this film was made in Toronto you barely see it. There's only enough cash for stock footage ? This film takes the idea of 'Dharma and Greg' removes the jokes and stretches it to 90 minutes This film is neither 'romantic' or a 'comedy'.And finally I checked all the people who have left comments the negativeaccurate ones come from people who've made other comments on other films both good and bad. Whereas the positive ones are all submitted by people who have only every made one comment  this one and it's a RAVE ! They also go out of the way to praise the director. This isn't Kubrick or Spielbergit's just an underpowered chickflick. I can only presume it's family and friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Freddie Prinze Jr. lives by the C rule. Having a terrific job as an adman in Manhattan he believes the right CAREER the right CAR the right CLOTHES and yes even the right COFFEE makes Jack a bright boy. Therefore our Jack is in for a headturn when he meets pretty bohemian Jill Taryn Manning on a busy street. She asks him for directions pulling out a map but Jack points out that the guide she has is for the subway alone. Laughing together briefly Jack seizes the moment to ask Jill to star in a minor television commercial THAT DAY and whisks her off for a shoot. Later he gives her a ride home to a youth hostel as she is newly arrived in town and doesn't have a permanent place. But Jack drives a mere half block up the street before heading back. Telling Jill that he has an extra bedroom in his plush apartment he asks if she would like to stay with him until she finds the right digs for her. Well of course she would! It isn't long before Jill is crowding his refrigerator with healthy vegetable dishes and telling him she will only drink fair world coffee. Not only that the relationship soon turns intimate although Jack tries to establish more restrictive boundaries. Further complications arise when Jill appears to have some health secrets for she eats constantly despite being thin and has a wicked cough from time to time. Even so Jill leads Jack into some fun activities like tree climbing and makes him realize that the ad business like Jack's existence lacks depth and meaning. What does the future hold for Jack and Jill? This is one of the best romantic dramas I've seen all year. Oddly similar to Sweet November it nevertheless can stand well on its own merits. Prinze and Manning give lovely touching performances that shine brightly while the other cast members do nice work too. Costumes settings camera work and a deft lively direction are also assets. Best of all the story uses plenty of humor and drama to illuminate the aspects of a serious disease cystic fibrosis. If you are a fan of Prinze or romantic drama make time for this one. Go up even a steep hill if need be to fetch this very fine flick.".

Notwithstanding that Freddie Prinze Taryn Manning and Vanessa Parise all compliment each other and the story begins to take hold and gain momentum after the first 30 minutes. The film also brings awareness to cystic fibrosis and has more substance than a typical romantic comedy. There are definitely scenes that will make you laugh and make you cry  some of the best parts of the story line are when the writers very deliberately avoid Hollywood clichs. There is a truth to the characters mannerisms habits and reactions which set the movie apart from other romantic comedy's. Overall the movie is positive and hopeful which is a welcome change of pace.".

However that didn't derail my enjoyment of seeing it through to the end. Additionally the film maker makes a few featured appearances that are hysterical.

The movie jumps into it's story way to fast almost as fast as the two characters jump into bed. I assume the narration is suppose to do all the introductions of these characters but at a whole three minutes worth that's not enough to make me give a crap. The only remotely positive thing about this film was Prinze's character's job and the characters there if only the movie would have been based around that and dropped the girl they may have had something. The typical romantic comedy best friend character on the guy side of things was in fact funny a couple times so I guess not a complete waste. I'm sure are a few girls out there that think calling a bomb threat into their boyfriends place of business so you can reconcile things with him is romantic I see it as illegal.

And one that can not be attributed to any sensible emotions and reactions but solely to a script which is the movies biggest liability. Not for one moment would I believe that a real Jack would have kicked a real Jill out solely due to finding out that she is fatally ill...Freddie Prinze Jr. pulls the movie along together with his less than competent and extremely irritating accompanying actress but given how falsely the notes sound the believability factor kills any good intentions. The duet lacks any proper dramatic pull and chemistry is really down to a basic level. This isn't helped by rushed storytelling which suddenly throw us from the beginning of their relationship into a I can't bear to live without you type of affair. After effortlessly ignoring to create a backdrop and focus on some buildup Jack and Jill are never fleshed out sufficiently for you to real care what happens to them.Somewhere in between all this are some chilly attempts at humour which only drown out any initial interest you may have had in the movie.".

	schema:headline " Details people details!";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm usually not a stickler for continuity errors or anachronisms in a film. Making a motion picture is a very complicated beast and you can't get all that upset if a few minor mistakes creep in. A line has to be drawn somewhere however and I have to draw it right down the middle of Jack and Jill vs. The World. The character played by Freddie Prinze Jr. has a fairly large shoulder tattoo and throughout the movie it moves from the left shoulder to his right to his left to his right to his left to his right and finally back to his left. That's pretty egregious but it's not why I'm pointing it out.The tattoo is at least 6 to 8 inches long and 3 to 5 inches wide not the sort of thing anyone gets as a lark. Yet there's no explanation ever given for it and it doesn't in any way fit the character Prinze Jr. is playing. If the tattoo had served some purpose in the story somebody probably would have noticed that it kept switching from one shoulder to the other. But it was just some random detail inserted into the script for no particular reason which is how I'd describe a lot of things in this film. Jack and Jill vs. The World is littered with random details and excess scenes that aren't even tangentially connected to the story being told.Jack Freddie Prinze Jr. is a successful young ad man in New York City. He meets a bohemian aspiring actress named Jill Taryn Manning and instantly invites her to move in with him. You'd think it would be because he would want to bang her but that would require the screenplay to treat Jack like a real human being. Instead he does it out of the platonic goodness of his heart until Jill finally throws herself at him. They then proceed to hang out more like college roommates who occasionally boink instead of boyfriend and girlfriend only to eventually break up over a secret that Jill keeps from Jack long after any decent person would have told him. Jack responds to that like a complete dick but they get back together becausewell I think it's legally required under federal statute that every feeble attempt at romantic comedy finishes with the two stars back in each other's arms.While Jack and Jill are doing their whole thing Jack also spends an inordinate amount of screen time at work with his ad writing partner George Peter Stebbings. Now it's standard for the male lead in a rom com to have a best friend and it's not unusual for those two guys to have a lot of scenes together but this movie takes the cake. There is so much more interaction between Jack and George than Jack and Jill that it would have made perfect sense for the story to end with the two guys admitting their gay love for each other and running away to Fire Island. And of course Jill also has a zany best friend of her own in Lucy Vanessa Parise. Jill and Lucy have far fewer scenes together than Jack and George which is also weirdly standard for rom coms but Lucy does have two scenes that are entirely about her character something George never has.If Peter Stebbings and Vanessa Parise hadn't written this script and Parise hadn't directed this movie the roles of George and Lucy would have been greatly reduced or possibly eliminated. Neither of them ultimately contributes a damn thing to the story except as plot devices. Maybe the time spent on them could have been used to develop the relationship between Jack and his father Robert Forster rather than having it reduced to three scenes that only make sense if you realize they're trying to do the exact same fatherson garbage you've seen in umpteen other films.And I can't forget about the alarm clock. Jack lives in an apartment with otherwise modern moderately stylish furnishings. But in his bedroom is an alarm clock straight out of the 1970s with the numbers that flip over like an old scoreboard. The clock is also patched together with a bunch of duct tape. Am I wrong or does it sound like Jack having such an incongruous appliance should have some sort of significance? Where did it come from? Why does he still have it? That sort of thing. You won't be surprised to learn there's no explanation or reason given for the clock even though it's prominently featured several times. I suppose the whole clock back story could have been edited out but this film is barely 90 minutes long. Another 2 or 3 minutes couldn't have been added so that at least one frickin' detail wouldn't have been so random?Jack and Jill vs. The World is a flabby unfocused mess with a fundamental premise so clichd and hoary that it can't carry the extra weight and collapses long before the movie is over. Unless you need to see a Taryn Manning nip slip skip this thing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm usually not a stickler for continuity errors or anachronisms in a film. Making a motion picture is a very complicated beast and you can't get all that upset if a few minor mistakes creep in. A line has to be drawn somewhere however and I have to draw it right down the middle of Jack and Jill vs. The World. The character played by Freddie Prinze Jr. has a fairly large shoulder tattoo and throughout the movie it moves from the left shoulder to his right to his left to his right to his left to his right and finally back to his left. That's pretty egregious but it's not why I'm pointing it out.The tattoo is at least 6 to 8 inches long and 3 to 5 inches wide not the sort of thing anyone gets as a lark. Yet there's no explanation ever given for it and it doesn't in any way fit the character Prinze Jr. is playing. If the tattoo had served some purpose in the story somebody probably would have noticed that it kept switching from one shoulder to the other. But it was just some random detail inserted into the script for no particular reason which is how I'd describe a lot of things in this film. Jack and Jill vs. The World is littered with random details and excess scenes that aren't even tangentially connected to the story being told.Jack Freddie Prinze Jr. is a successful young ad man in New York City. He meets a bohemian aspiring actress named Jill Taryn Manning and instantly invites her to move in with him. You'd think it would be because he would want to bang her but that would require the screenplay to treat Jack like a real human being. Instead he does it out of the platonic goodness of his heart until Jill finally throws herself at him. They then proceed to hang out more like college roommates who occasionally boink instead of boyfriend and girlfriend only to eventually break up over a secret that Jill keeps from Jack long after any decent person would have told him. Jack responds to that like a complete dick but they get back together becausewell I think it's legally required under federal statute that every feeble attempt at romantic comedy finishes with the two stars back in each other's arms.While Jack and Jill are doing their whole thing Jack also spends an inordinate amount of screen time at work with his ad writing partner George Peter Stebbings. Now it's standard for the male lead in a rom com to have a best friend and it's not unusual for those two guys to have a lot of scenes together but this movie takes the cake. There is so much more interaction between Jack and George than Jack and Jill that it would have made perfect sense for the story to end with the two guys admitting their gay love for each other and running away to Fire Island. And of course Jill also has a zany best friend of her own in Lucy Vanessa Parise.

While Bride was like an Italian version of My Big Fat Greek Weddingthough better this is about a couple just getting to know each other. Evidently this was one of Freddie Prinze's first adult roles. Maybe he should call himself Fred if he wants to be taken seriously. He certainly had a deeper voice in this movie but the role really wasn't much different from some of his earlier rolesDown To You She's All That etc. a young man unsure of what he wants out of life and love. I thought Taryn Manning gave a better performance. Her character's disease was an interestingthough probably not original twist on the typical love story. I felt sorry for her and the sick girl. The story is pretty clichd. A cynical man falls for a his exact oppositea freespirited woman. But clichd stories are usually so because there is a truth in them that is worth repeating. The love between a man and a woman is just such an ideathough some would decry it as being too heteronormative. Personally I was disappointed that such love and the attendant sex was treated in such a morally lax way. I know it may be too oldfashioned for most viewers but I value movies that emphasize the beauty and importance of marriage. Ordinarily it would be pointless to make light of that with regard to a modern movie. However Parisse did to a good job of presenting that view of marriage in Bride. For that and other reasons I would say that Parisse's earlier movie is better than this one. Of course the two characters here probably get married at some point in the future. All we can do is infer.".

The characters too often lack any redeeming qualities and yet we are apparently supposed to care about them for more than two hours difficult when there is so little to work withEarly Spring is certainly not a stinker by any means but for me a lesser Ozu and if you want to start with something more characteristic begin with either version of Floating Weeds or with his masterpiece Tokyo Story.";

We learn much about Japanese life in the early years of the boom the look of homes and offices the way people commemorate the happy and sad events of their lives how people eat in a noodle shop a dying man's way of facing death playing mahjong the switch from western to Japanese clothing for different moods and times of day. The camera moves hardly at all and records everything carefully and beautifully almost like an ethnographic documentary from its location near the level of a tatami mat. The vistas of office corridors and train lines are breathtaking not boring. The plot is both moving and slowmoving a lyrical and thoughtful Japanese version of The Seven Year Itch married salary worker tempted by flirtatious fellow commuter. Ozu makes traditional values seem convincing and necessaryhe doesn't hit us over the head with family loyalty but portrays it as an essential part of life that the protagonist ultimately embraces voluntarily and with full understanding of its meaning though not without a sense of loss and resignation. Only a filmmaker of Ozu's stature could make me tearful with joy at the sight of a brickyard!".

	schema:reviewBody "Early Spring came between Ozu's incredible masterpieces Tokyo Story and Tokyo Twilight. No surprise then that it kind of falls flat in places. It's by no means a bad film but it adds a bit too much complexity making the focus confusing at points. The film starts as a comment on the salary man. The opening scenes are both funny and sad as we see the empty streets of Japan gradually fill with men and women in white shirts. They all come together at the subway station and then we see two men in an office building looking down at the madness below. These are the kind of details one must love about Ozu. It is all represented there on the screen and without many words we know what is going on. As the film continues we see the workers on their breaks and finally arranging a weekend trip. On this trip is where the real story begins. A young married man named Shoji is attracted to a young girl nicknamed Goldfish. They are unable to hide their attraction as their colleagues start spreading rumors and noticing the smiles between the two. Eventually they give into their temptation. It's the effects after this betrayal that are the key focus. The young girl is surprised that she develops emotions while Shoji is instantly ashamed of himself. His guilt soon grows and he avoids his wife. Because of this his wife begins to suspect he is cheating on her. The film shows how destructive guilt can be. As Shoji tries to keep his mind off the affair he ends up forgetting the anniversary of his son's death. The film is too long for its material. There simply isn't enough going on in the middle and too much at the beginning and end. What it does offer is Ozu's look at relationships without the arrangement of a marriage. Instead this shows the hard work and commitment a marriage takes. A theme that was handled a lot more competently and economically in his next feature.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen quite a few of Yasujiro Ozu's films and while I enjoyed this film it is not among his bestmostly because of its sluggish pacing. If the film had about 20 minutes cut from it I really think it would have worked better. Now I am not against long filmsprovided they merit the additional time. This is one of the few Ozu films I had to force myself to finish as I found it hard to concentrate on what was occurringa first for one of his films.The film is set in a Japanese company where there are lots of lower to midlevel drones doing their jobs. The theme at times is that no matter how hard you work and devote yourself to your job you will one day die...and most likely not appreciated or sufficiently recompensed for your hard work. A depressing view to be sure as the film was apparently trying to make a point about alienation during the industrial age a common theme in Ozu films.In addition to this theme there is another plot involving one of the workers having an affair with a coworker. What actually made this pretty interesting and poignant is that the man's marriage was already in trouble as their son had died several years ago as a small child and the couple became distant in the aftermath. Also interesting is the reaction of the man's coworkers when they think they've discovered the affair though they still aren't sure. The men all seem to condemn them very quickly and say this is disruptive to the company. BUT they also later sound incredibly envious of the couple! Additionally instead of confronting both of them they only invite in the womanan interesting double standard.Overall the film is typical in style to what you'd expect from an Ozu film. The camera remains stationary and slightly lower than the actors and there are no lens movements. Instead scenes change by cuts not by a roving camera. Also the film's subjects are the countless lowerlevel white collar workers. Atypical is the film's slow pace slow even for Ozu as well as the subject matteradultery is not something he talked about often.So is it worth seeing? Well anything by Ozu is worth seeing as far as I am concerned. Just don't expect quite the same magic and poignant moments like you'd find in such classics as FLOATING WEEDS or LATE SPRING.".

Nothing is exaggerated or simplified to artificially enhance the drama or make a point.Many of the characters are recent arrivals to the middle class thanks to jobs on lower rungs of corporate offices. Business and personal lives are realistically interconnected which is rare in movies. Exceptions that come to mind are The Sopranos The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz and movies by the Dardenne brothers. Even when there is a collegial work atmosphere the jobs can be punishing. The people don't fail to appreciate the benefits and memories of poverty are fresh enough to keep them from romanticizing the alternatives. Orwell wrote that Dickens pointed to problems of capitalism but offered no systematic program to fix them and that the latter may be depth rather than shallowness. You could say the same about Ozu.

However this is not a feeling of an old and ended passed time but the somehow sad premonition of the society we still live in.At the beginning Sugiyama couple wake up with an alarm and the wife starts her duties while the man is going to get the train bound for Tokyo. And the train itself that opens this movie gives us the idea of a time no more natural but subjugated to work and money. Another thing that suggests this mood is the job of the main character of this story Mr. Sugiyama. He works in a busy and big office in Tokyo as salary man. He is nothing without a company that can provide him a sum of money to live. A salary. We can understand it when Sugiyama speaks to two of his former comrades that are artisans that's to say people still making something tangible. More simple minded but also less stressed and unconscious of the future. The Japanese salary men especially in this movie filmed soon after the WWII seem young students without concerns. They eat near the imperial palace as in school trip and they organize a daytrip to sea a noodle party and this the main point of the movie romance between them. The romance that so develops between Sugiyama and Kingyo the young and single female secretary of the company the main character works in is the symbol of a new generation. People far from house without material skills and less practical and patient. As children of a new future. The one made by train timetables offices papers and ties we as well as Japan nowadays live in. The betrayed wife of Sugiyama after her discovery of the relation of the husband decide to leave him in order to make him concern. However after the solicitations by her mother and the old colleague of his husband decide to come back to him transferred in Okayama for three years. This shows how the maybe old fashioned and domestic patience can resolve things in order to not make them more difficult than they are as the mother of Mrs Sugiyama says. Because as the colleague suggest these are proofs that can enforce the couple and not make it end. At the end the couple decide to stay together after all happened in a town of offices and business but no patience and warmth. Not as in their final destination Okayama. A city below chimneys and so more practical but also more traditional and patient.Ozu seems to say us that the patience that helped Japanese people during war and natural disasters the one which the foreigners still today admire the most can be blown away if the practical and stoic spirit loses the strength in front of a crazy rush for money. The money itself the samurai of old Japan despised. This movie so can be read as the warning of an father in front of a son that is going to became adult and the leader of a new generation. We have a sort of Tokyo Story without the two old parents as main characters. However also here the wise and elder helps the younger. The gloomy smoker mother and the humble smiling colleague.Japan should have seen this movie more before the bubble era the crazy consumer tendencies and today lack of identity among many of its people. That time was early spring but now we are already in full summer.".

	schema:headline " Thoughtful but slowpaced chronicle of repercussions of extramartial affair";
	schema:reviewBody "This is another 'slice of life' film from famed Japanese director Yasujir Ozu. The protagonist is Shoji Sugiyama a late 30s 'salary man' white collar office worker who lives in Tokyo with his devoted wife Masako. The couple had a child who died for unknown reasons and they now appear to resign themselves to being a childless couple for the rest of their marriage.Ozu spends a good deal of time also focusing on Sugi's colleagues at the office. One major theme is dissatisfaction. There is little chance that any of the workers have a chance to advance to a higher position and all seem to agree that it's very difficult making ends meet on such a low salary. Prospects for retirement are even more dim given the virtually nonexistent retirement benefits. Nonetheless the workers try to make the best of their drab and routine lives by engaging in communal activities such as 'noodle parties' and trips to the beach.It's on one such trip to the beach when Sugi gets to know a younger office worker 'Goldfish' played by Keiko Kishi the super attractive Kishi can be seen in middle age in the acclaimed 1983 film 'The Makioka Sisters'. She aggressively goes after Sugi and they end up having a brief affair. The rest of the film focuses on the conflict between Sugi and Masako after she gets wind of the affair and how they eventually resolve the conflict.Ozu wisely does not simply focus on the conflict between the two principals but also brings in other characters that depict the wider canvas of the community. Two strong scenes come to the mind first after Sugi's get together with some war veteran buddies he invites two of them home and in perhaps the film's most comic scene the two make fools of themselves as they are completely intoxicated a later more dramatic scene features the male office workers castigating Goldfish for her rumored affair with Sugi. What's interesting about this scene is how Goldfish steadfastly denies any involvement with Sugi despite our knowledge to the contrary.The major problem with 'Early Spring' is its slow pace. It's a good half hour before the break into the second act the aforementioned extramarital affair actually occurs. Ozu also throws in a seemingly unnecessary subplot of the dying coworker Miura. Is the point to introduce the more universal theme of the 'fragility of life' or to suggest that this particular officer worker was freed from the shackles of a lifetime of drudgery as a devoted 'salary man'? Whatever the case it simply is dragged out and goes on for much too long.While Sugi and Goldfish's affair may have been risqu for its time the resolution is markedly more staid. After Goldfish gives up on 'stalking' Sugi she has a number of 'meltdowns' in front of Sugi when it's clear he's no longer interested in her eventually she shakes his hand at a farewell party and now has given up on the idea of pursuing him.As for Masako against her mother's advice she decides to leave Sugi to teach him a lesson.

	onyx:emotionText "This is another 'slice of life' film from famed Japanese director Yasujir Ozu. The protagonist is Shoji Sugiyama a late 30s 'salary man' white collar office worker who lives in Tokyo with his devoted wife Masako. The couple had a child who died for unknown reasons and they now appear to resign themselves to being a childless couple for the rest of their marriage.Ozu spends a good deal of time also focusing on Sugi's colleagues at the office. One major theme is dissatisfaction. There is little chance that any of the workers have a chance to advance to a higher position and all seem to agree that it's very difficult making ends meet on such a low salary. Prospects for retirement are even more dim given the virtually nonexistent retirement benefits. Nonetheless the workers try to make the best of their drab and routine lives by engaging in communal activities such as 'noodle parties' and trips to the beach.It's on one such trip to the beach when Sugi gets to know a younger office worker 'Goldfish' played by Keiko Kishi the super attractive Kishi can be seen in middle age in the acclaimed 1983 film 'The Makioka Sisters'. She aggressively goes after Sugi and they end up having a brief affair. The rest of the film focuses on the conflict between Sugi and Masako after she gets wind of the affair and how they eventually resolve the conflict.Ozu wisely does not simply focus on the conflict between the two principals but also brings in other characters that depict the wider canvas of the community. Two strong scenes come to the mind first after Sugi's get together with some war veteran buddies he invites two of them home and in perhaps the film's most comic scene the two make fools of themselves as they are completely intoxicated a later more dramatic scene features the male office workers castigating Goldfish for her rumored affair with Sugi. What's interesting about this scene is how Goldfish steadfastly denies any involvement with Sugi despite our knowledge to the contrary.The major problem with 'Early Spring' is its slow pace. It's a good half hour before the break into the second act the aforementioned extramarital affair actually occurs. Ozu also throws in a seemingly unnecessary subplot of the dying coworker Miura. Is the point to introduce the more universal theme of the 'fragility of life' or to suggest that this particular officer worker was freed from the shackles of a lifetime of drudgery as a devoted 'salary man'? Whatever the case it simply is dragged out and goes on for much too long.While Sugi and Goldfish's affair may have been risqu for its time the resolution is markedly more staid. After Goldfish gives up on 'stalking' Sugi she has a number of 'meltdowns' in front of Sugi when it's clear he's no longer interested in her eventually she shakes his hand at a farewell party and now has given up on the idea of pursuing him.As for Masako against her mother's advice she decides to leave Sugi to teach him a lesson. Eventually after Sugi is transferred to a provincial town she takes her mother's advice to 'not make things worse' and joins him there and agrees with him to 'start over'. If only more couples in America were willing to follow Sugi and Masako's course of action martial disputes that occur here might have better resolutions.I ended up watching 'Early Spring' a second time and found it more absorbing upon second viewing. Nonetheless this is a film that still needed quite a bit of judicious editing. The running time of 145 minutes is way too long for a film that could have been 45 minutes shorter.";

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so we expect a certain clarity from cinema about the conundrums of life. In Ozu this appears in a combination of things. The spatiotemporal eye is empty grounded it's a dispassionate awareness that sets the room for life to play out. It's more than realism it's a way of creating realization about the point things are more sensibly viewed from.Narrative then is a matter of having something to view. Here several things blend. Officework for the salaryman in the audience. War reminiscence. A marriage grown distant to illustrate the tension in the home. So each of these threads poses an aspect of life the idea is that life also extends a bit in this or that direction. This is the opportunity to create that realization that in the first place informs the passage of time. It's not that things were better in the old days this is never the point in his films. Viewers who miss this are stuck with a sentimental uncle. It's that things are not different that slightly changed the same conundrums repeat salarymen are not more distinguished than the old craftsmen husbands will stray as before and so on. In the same swoop it creates both melancholy and a certain kind of relief.Ozu is quaint then in this sense of being content by the way life envelops and figures itself out letting the drama peter out as a way of saying it was never worth being caught in. This was most elegantly seen in Early Summer in the girl's spontaneous decision one night to marry. Here the wife in the end makes her choice to follow her husband in his transfer not because anything has been solved but because it is now seen to not matter.But he removes the self from the camera only to put it back in the characters. This is a great and difficult balance that to my mind he only accomplished once or twice how little to show and say. There's no precise answer just different brushstrokes to try. Push with a little more force and it becomes a moral smudge push less and maybe there won't be an intelligible trace.Ozu traces faintly the turmoil but too hard the worldly lesson it seems every minor character is encountered to offer advice at some point. It defeats the whole point of a world that is not yet figured.".

	schema:headline " Finally they're starting to get it right";
	schema:reviewBody "I didn't really know what to expect from this directtovideo release. I certainly expected the Christian basher reviewers to come on full force. They never can stand us to say anything about their stuff but I'm sure they'll have words to say about ours. Anway the previous two movies were passable but nowhere near the quality of the books they were based on. That's not the case with Left Behind World at War.At the helm this time is director Craig R. Baxley whose previous work makes it no surprise that directing movies with suspense apocalyptic themes and action should come naturally to him. The movie is directed and edited much differently than the previous two. The movie relies very little on special effects. Baxley's used to letting set pieces and camera angles convey the mood and tell the story of a postapocalyptic world.It's a lot darker this time around. There's a more palpable feeling of despair and tension as Nicolae tightens his grip over the world and tries to stamp out Christianity and other opposing governments. The action is more grim and gritty and the film is often graphically violent.Somehow almost all of the original cast have returned with the notable exception of Clarence Gilyard Bruce Barnes. The tradeoff is good though with Arnold Pinnock taking over Bruce's character. Pinnock delivers the character more believably and was a welcome breath of fresh air. Unfortunately the character of Bruce won't be able to return for the next film. Janaya Stephens has gotten better as Chloe and even Kirk Cameron appears to have ratcheted up his game as he pours his heart and soul into his role. Chelsea Noble's back as Hattie. Gordon Currie returns as the embodiment of all evil Nicolae Carpathia though he gets very little screen time. I was most surprised to see film vet Brad Johnson return as he seems to be rather busy lately but I'm glad he did because no one else really could be Rayford Steele. New to the cast is Laura Catalano as Amanda White Rayford's wife. Also joining the cast is Oscar winner Lou Gossett Jr as President Gerald Fitzhugh. He is a very welcome addition and brings credibility to the series.If you were hoping that the movie would adhere strictly to the books you'll be disappointed. That being said there are definitely connections there but the movie takes its own liberties. Fortunately that's not always a bad thing. The movie explores a character President Fitzhugh that was glossed over in the books and spends most of the time following his story. What happens is sort of like a sidetrip within the books...something we didn't know about that could have happened in the continuity. Chloe and Bruce get sick off infected Bibles which brings about the end of Pastor Barnes which many of you will remember from the book series. The connection between Ray and Hattie is touched on once but kind of glossed over. Part of the difficulty of fitting all these characters into a 90 minute movie is that a lot of character development gets left out and some characters just sort of sit like window dressings. One gets the feeling that the movie would've been able to pull it off better if the run time was stretched out to 2 or 2.5 hours. However the story we do get is interesting and relevant and it ends up coming off a lot better than the fractured piecedtogethersoastonotdivergetoomuchfromthebook way of the first movie. And the story is treated as real and taken seriously.The movie doesn't get too preachy either. It references the previous rapture maybe twice. And when the characters are having a conversation it isn't stilted in the manner of the first two movies they're having a conversation but you know it's a thinly veiled sermon pointed at the audience. There's only one person to get saved in this movie and it's at the end and doesn't feel as artificial as those in the previous two. This doesn't weaken the message though. It makes it more powerful as the whole movie builds itself up to this point.There are no supercheesy special effects in this movie think about the air raid at the beginning of the first and they left out the cheesy CCM soundtrack this time think i know that i will not...be...left...behind... shudder. All in all this movie's a thousand times more well done than the others and will appeal to more than just the target audience of Christians.If you don't happen to believe in the rapture and the millennium many Christians don't you can still learn a lot from this movie. There's a great deal spoken here about persecution of the church and the images here could very well be images of the future prior to Christ's return if the religious atmosphere in this country continues on its current trend. Oppression of religion has been a factor in this world for a long time and it's very eyeopening to see the portrayal of persecution on our own soil in this movie.Now for the DVD extras. Kirk Cameron fans will be happy to know that there's a Way of the Master extra on this DVD that features Kirk and Ray Comfort. It includes a message from Kirk and a portion of their video seminar. Also included on the disc are a couple of music videos deleted scenes a technical making of featurette a character featurette bloopers and outtakes and an audio commentary.All in all it's worth your watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "I didn't really know what to expect from this directtovideo release. I certainly expected the Christian basher reviewers to come on full force. They never can stand us to say anything about their stuff but I'm sure they'll have words to say about ours. Anway the previous two movies were passable but nowhere near the quality of the books they were based on. That's not the case with Left Behind World at War.At the helm this time is director Craig R. Baxley whose previous work makes it no surprise that directing movies with suspense apocalyptic themes and action should come naturally to him. The movie is directed and edited much differently than the previous two. The movie relies very little on special effects. Baxley's used to letting set pieces and camera angles convey the mood and tell the story of a postapocalyptic world.It's a lot darker this time around. There's a more palpable feeling of despair and tension as Nicolae tightens his grip over the world and tries to stamp out Christianity and other opposing governments. The action is more grim and gritty and the film is often graphically violent.Somehow almost all of the original cast have returned with the notable exception of Clarence Gilyard Bruce Barnes. The tradeoff is good though with Arnold Pinnock taking over Bruce's character. Pinnock delivers the character more believably and was a welcome breath of fresh air. Unfortunately the character of Bruce won't be able to return for the next film. Janaya Stephens has gotten better as Chloe and even Kirk Cameron appears to have ratcheted up his game as he pours his heart and soul into his role. Chelsea Noble's back as Hattie. Gordon Currie returns as the embodiment of all evil Nicolae Carpathia though he gets very little screen time. I was most surprised to see film vet Brad Johnson return as he seems to be rather busy lately but I'm glad he did because no one else really could be Rayford Steele. New to the cast is Laura Catalano as Amanda White Rayford's wife. Also joining the cast is Oscar winner Lou Gossett Jr as President Gerald Fitzhugh. He is a very welcome addition and brings credibility to the series.If you were hoping that the movie would adhere strictly to the books you'll be disappointed. That being said there are definitely connections there but the movie takes its own liberties. Fortunately that's not always a bad thing. The movie explores a character President Fitzhugh that was glossed over in the books and spends most of the time following his story. What happens is sort of like a sidetrip within the books...something we didn't know about that could have happened in the continuity. Chloe and Bruce get sick off infected Bibles which brings about the end of Pastor Barnes which many of you will remember from the book series. The connection between Ray and Hattie is touched on once but kind of glossed over. Part of the difficulty of fitting all these characters into a 90 minute movie is that a lot of character development gets left out and some characters just sort of sit like window dressings. One gets the feeling that the movie would've been able to pull it off better if the run time was stretched out to 2 or 2.5 hours. However the story we do get is interesting and relevant and it ends up coming off a lot better than the fractured piecedtogethersoastonotdivergetoomuchfromthebook way of the first movie. And the story is treated as real and taken seriously.The movie doesn't get too preachy either. It references the previous rapture maybe twice. And when the characters are having a conversation it isn't stilted in the manner of the first two movies they're having a conversation but you know it's a thinly veiled sermon pointed at the audience. There's only one person to get saved in this movie and it's at the end and doesn't feel as artificial as those in the previous two. This doesn't weaken the message though. It makes it more powerful as the whole movie builds itself up to this point.There are no supercheesy special effects in this movie think about the air raid at the beginning of the first and they left out the cheesy CCM soundtrack this time think i know that i will not...be...left...behind... shudder.

	schema:headline " World at War proves that sometimes the movie is better than the book.";
	schema:reviewBody "There have been three Left Behind films based on the first two books and I have to admit that the films are a great deal better. Many events are changed but the changes are for the better. Whereas the book is kind of a rolling mindless narrative that seems to randomly change and has no real structure except the author's random whims the films have a plot and quite a bit of substance. They've taken the creative characters that Jenkins somehow concocted and made them people much more real than the 2D stereotypes they previously were.The third film Word at War which is based on the last 50 pages of the second book was much better. In terms of style and narrative  well Cloud Ten hit it right on this time. There was very little that reeked of Christian film here and that's a good thing. The narrative and style are refined and consistent. The acting is all much better. In particular series regulars Brad Johnson and Janaya Stephens both turn in great performances. Kirk Cameron is still Kirk Cameron which doesn't work too much in his favor. His reallife wife Chelsea Field has always sounded like she's reading lines instead of becoming the character and it's really noticeable here. There's a scene where she's trying to seduce Rayford and it just drags on endlessly. Probably the only real cringeworthy moment of the film. The newly recast Bruce Barnes played by Arnold Pinnock did a decent job. Unfortunately his unfamiliar face at this very crucial moment in Bruce's life really detracts from what should be a very very pivotal moment in the film. Given the choice I would have preferred Clarence Gilyard who payed Bruce in the first two films.I was extremely impressed with Laura Catalano who played Rayford's second wife Amanda. I was annoyed that her introduction was shorted so greatly  Rayford goes from weeping over his first wife in the previous film to getting married again in the opening moments of this one. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed Amanda  Laura Catalano brought her to life in a way Jenkins couldn't begin to figure out. Her character was a highlight of the film despite her short amount of screen time.The story was put together pretty well. It focused more on President Gerald Fitzhugh played by the fantastic Lou Gossett Jr. than on our band in the Tribulation Force. This really annoys some people but it's an approach I can understand. The events of the last fifty pages of Tribulation Force had no cohesion whatsoever and frankly are so earthshattering that they deserve their own story. And while many people dislike the focus on President Fitzhugh I found it quite interesting to get inside the mind of one of the most overlooked characters in the series. Lou Gossett portrays this guy as someone who even I would vote for  noble distinguished but not afraid to draw his own gun and kick some ass when necessary. His gutsy move at the end  though contrived  worked well for the story and provided a bit of redemption for the character that he lacks in the books. This is one instance where deviation from the books allowed the film makers to craft a MUCH better story.The story finds a biological agent poisoning the Christians of America who are proclaiming Nicholae the Antichrist of the book of Revelations. It's definitely an interesting if somewhat scifi style notion that wasn't included in the book. It brings some dignity to the death of Pastor Bruce Barnes which is the first of many losses the Tribulation Force will suffer before the end of history. But the cure for this agent is so patently absurd I find it hard to believe it was actually used. While this is happening we follow Fitzhugh's exploits as he learns his friend Carpathia isn't all he appears to be.There has been some debate on the validity of Nicholae's powers as seen in this film. They're a bit more Charmed in nature with Carpathia levitating the president and smiling when Fitzhugh tries to shoot him and the bullets kill the guy standing behind him. Though the books are never so blatant this kind of thing isn't unprecedented. Either way it didn't bother me since I view this particular theological mindset with a pound of salt anyway. I don't buy into the complaints of Carpathia's duplicity  seeing him as more monster than man is part of the progression of the books so it's fitting that we see less of his public face and more of his evil face here. Eventually all we'll ever see is monster.I was glad to see some things being set up for later  Hattie's pregnancy for example and the seeds of her own salvation. The ending of the film gives me continued hope for a fourth film. But if they try to recast anyone else  especially any of the remaining 3 original Trib Force members  the series may lose some serious meaning.By the end of the film we arrive at a very similar position to where we are by the end of the second book a world at war a dead president a pastorless Trib Force and with much of the world we knew gone. I would expect the next film to focus a bit more on the Trib Force and continue to progress the overall story. I hope that the improvement in quality continues and especially that they're able to do justice to what is about to become a vast array of characters. The books introduce a crap load of Trib Force members in the coming volumes and doing justice to them all in a 2 hour film will be tough. Hopefully the brothers Lalonde will continue what they've begun.".

All the people who loved it on this site were the main targets for the movie. So they were going to love it no matter what. But the movie has horrible acting dialogue and is pretty much a snooze. The first two actually had more genuine drama to it even though they were still cheese.The theology behind the movie is about 200 years old a manmade innovation into Christianity that never existed in the prior 1800 years of the faith and has no biblical basis. They've been calling for the rapture for years and will continue to do so forever. Jack Kinsella Hal Lindsey's best bud last year said he'd be surprised to see 2006. Well now he'll be surprised to see 2007...and 2040. It will go on forever. Essentially the rapture as they understand it will actually not happen till the very end as any plain reading of the text states. So don't worry no one will be left behind.Since it is such a terrible movie it will fail as an evangelizing tool to nonbelievers. It will just get the raptureites all excited. But one day they will come to the same conclusion the Millerites came to when the end never arrived when they thought...that they were wrong and should get with the program.Bottom line? If you like bad movies like Glitter for entertainment and laugh value see both Omega Codes. Those are funnybad movies. This one is just a stinker.".

But one day they will come to the same conclusion the Millerites came to when the end never arrived when they thought...that they were wrong and should get with the program.Bottom line? If you like bad movies like Glitter for entertainment and laugh value see both Omega Codes. Those are funnybad movies. This one is just a stinker.";

Jenkins series which I really really enjoy.I had ... not bothered with the first two movies and still have yet to see them though I am more curious having since read the books and since what I had heard about them was less than positive I expected absolutely nothing from this movie. I think that perhaps I should go into EVERY movie expecting nothing because I actually rather liked Left Behind 3. Revelations is scary but it has a great ending but has always been one of my favorite passages in the Bible so it was nice to see it depicted. I thought Louis Gosset as President Fitzhugh was quite good I enjoyed seeing Charles Martin Smith for the about two seconds he was in there. Kirk Cameron bears the curse of having appeared in a show I watched as a child which means I can never really take him seriously in any other role the casts of such shows as Saved By the Bell and Just the Ten of Us share the same fate but he was fine as Buck Chloe Ray and Mrs. Kirk Cameron as Hattie were fine as wellalthough there's just no other way to say this Mrs. Cameron is a little too old to be Hattie who was supposed to be about 27. Considering I had heard lessthancomplimentary remarks about the acting I was rather satisfied with the performances of everybody and actually rather pleasantly surprised with Gordan Currie who I knew from the ohsodistinguished guest starring role of paralyzed Cousin Bobby in Beverly Hills 90210 and has... come a long way since then. Before reading the books I considered his performance besides Gosset's who with all due respect was clearly in another league the most impressive and now having read the books.. his eerily smooth portrayal is the most how I would imagine Nicolae from the books would like and act like.What's not really faithful to the series is the script. Part 3 of the series is definitely not oneinthesame as Nicolae the third book in the series. Instead of the Wrath of the Lamb and Tsion BenJudah President Fitzhugh who is the film's main character joining in the militialead resistance movement against the Supreme Regional Potentate 'sadly' I don't think he was referred to by that title Nicolae Jetty Carpathia while newlyweds Chloe and Buck and Rayford and Amanda and Pastor Bruce Barnes are faced with assisting the President in the resistance and in changing his nonreligious ways and dealing with a mysterious virus that seems to be hitting the churches... The story more than passes the time and included some meaningful scenes that made me and hopefully others 'think.' While I wouldn't have minded if they had stuck more to the books why were there no witnesses at the Wailing Wall for example and they'd best not do any more of these movies without including Tsion BenJudah who is only one of the most pivotal characters for the rest of the series I thought they well with this movie. I was pleased with the direction of Craig Baxley who directed The Storm of the Century which while not a masterpiece by any account was entertaining and well worth a viewing and I hope that as long as they make these they will bring in some more strong performers not stray so far from the stories that they are not being faithful to Revelations and that they will not leave behind such important characters as Chaim Rosenweig Moishe and Eli and especially Tsion BenJudah.".

It's been nearly two years since Nikolai has been the dominant world force and now he is outright taking over the world through the destruction of key cities worldwide.The same characters from the previous two movies are back with the exception of the pastor however his replacement brings a greater dimension to his role. The casting of Lou Gosset Jr as the president brought the series up a notch in credibility. This third installment of the series based on the phenomenally popular Left Behind series is the best one yet. There is more of everything more action greater character development more interesting plot. The camera work alone makes the movie more interesting as the film departs from the usual static set up to one of the almost artful.The DVD special features are noteworthy. The behind the scenes are always informative yet this time the characters talk about their personal faith which brings more meaning to both the movie and the characters portrayed.Granted the movies are based on the Left Behind books. So purists don't complain about the lack of continuity plot changes characterization etc.instead sit back and enjoy how the books complement the series. And those not familiar with the series simply sit back and be both entertained and contemplate what could happen in the near future.".

It's been nearly two years since Nikolai has been the dominant world force and now he is outright taking over the world through the destruction of key cities worldwide.The same characters from the previous two movies are back with the exception of the pastor however his replacement brings a greater dimension to his role. The casting of Lou Gosset Jr as the president brought the series up a notch in credibility.

World War 3 just started shall we proceed to the nearest bomb shelter or find a safe spot? Nay let's hold hands and pray.This movie could possibly be enjoyed by the people who feel the need to have a capital letter every time they refer to a religious character such as He His etc... or you could end up offended by it as wellAll others who are not interested in watching a bad Christian propaganda film should look elsewhere. The acting is nothing special the special effects are pretty outdated and are few and far between the story is fantasy where no one responds to the presented situations as a normal human being would. No distinct musical score and looped sound effects at the burning white house you hear the same helicopter pass 3 times.All this put together it makes for one hell of a bad movie. Pardon the pun!".

	schema:headline " The unfortunate unraveling of Left Behind";
	schema:reviewBody "Any movie loses steam as it continues...there is nothing exempt from that and sadly Left Behind after two remarkable entries meets that road block with the third installment which really could have been their take off point. When I heard several changes to the production crew including bringing on director Craig Baxley and Sony Pictures coming on board I was thrilled!! I figured this could change the series into a real contender for a mainstream film series. Baxley like the other directors from the series has been around a long time but he's best known for his work on Stephen King films such as the brilliantly done Storm of The Century and Rose Red. He could bring exactly the dark twist necessary to the Left Behind series.The film as part of the trilogy is of course still worth seeing they just seem to make so many grievous errors. First of all they left the book series practically in the dust when they created this one. Normally I would be okay with that but the first two installments were so closely related to the book that it just doesn't make sense to have this one so far from it. They brought on award winning actor Emmy Academy award Golden Globe etc. Louis Gossett Jr. and they used him as the star power of the film as though he was HUGE!! The entire film revolved around him and in the process it left the rest of the returning cast in the dust. Kirk Cameron in his role as Buck Williams still continues to improve his role and his acting. This is his best performance yet as Buck far more believable and starting to look the part. Brad Johnson probably would still do great as Rayford Steele if not for that fact that he's hardly in the film!! Janaya Stephens is great as Chloe and really gets to show off her acting chops when she becomes terminally ill. Cast replacement Arnold Pinnock as Pastor Bruce Barnes is okay but the previous actor was far better. The addition to the main cast Laura Catalano as Rayford's new wife Amanda is great. She looks and seems like she's perfect for the role but again...she too is hardly in it!! The whole film revolves around the President and his attempt to stop World War III.Gordon Currie returns as the evil head of the Global Community Nicolae Carpathia. Unfortunately the screenplay writers and director forgot some key elements of this. Currie's best performance is that he can perfectly balance evil and his alternate public face. They never use his public side. The public adore this man and yet they make him out to be pure evil right now. They also created him to be indestructible which is wrong!! He's not indestructible he's flesh and blood and furthermore will be flesh and blood until his assassination much later on. They made him far more supernaturally powerful than he should been. The evangelistic message is still there quite heavily in this installment but not nearly as evident as the others. It was done with far more subtlety. An attempt was made to mainstream the film but to do so I think they changed everything about the series that was great. I also think they made it very hard for themselves to continue this series which could go on for 10 more amazing films!! There is so much content to cover it would be a piece of cake. But because they chose to stray from the original story they made it very hard. I have become a big fan of the original cast and they were the ones who got left behind in this film all in the name of someone they hoped would be recognizable. This installment of the series if definitely far more polished which is great!! The acting has improved a great deal. The budget has remained the same and the story line is a little more complex than the second film. It just wasn't fit together properly. The film jumps from location to location. The characters move around the world in seconds setting doesn't seem like the important issue but it is!! And despite the fact that World War III is happening in the U.S. we never get to see any of it. We don't get to see the actual war and that is disappointing and unfortunate because that's what this installment is all about!! Some may like this far more than the original films but for me...a fan of the books and the original films I felt disappointed. I hope someone turns it all around!! 610".

Garden Of Evil Broken Lance The Tall MenWarlock and The Bravados etc. were all part of Fox's Fifties Cinemascope Western Cycle but THE LAST WAGON stands out in front as being arguably the most beautiful looking among them! Directed by the stalwart yet somewhat underrated Delmer Daves whose movies always had a certain glossy and radiant look to them. Particularly striking about his films was the rich location photography i.e. Broken Arrow Jubal The Hanging Tree Susan Slade Spencer's Mountain etc. THE LAST WAGON is no exception with the beautiful Arizona locations looking even more spectacular than usual.Lionel Newman's strident Indian theme over the titles immediately sets the tone for the adventure that is to follow. Richard Widmark  sporting the colourful name of Comanche Todd  plays a wrongly accused outlaw guiding a group of teenagers across hostile Indian country after their folks have been massacred by Apaches. Widmark is terrific in the part bringing to his role a palpable authenticity and hard bitten realism. It is one of his great heman outdoor action roles and not unlike the part he played the same year in Run For The Sun itself a splendid reworking of The Most Dangerous Game. The supporting cast are excellent. George Mathews as the unsavoury and brutish sheriff Douglas Kennedy as the upright Wagonmaster the beautiful Susan Kohner whatever happened to?as his half breed daughter Stephenie Griffin as her bigoted sister Ray Stricklyn the illfated Nick Adams and Tommy Rettig as the young brother of the film's leading lady the lovely Felicia Farr. Trivia fans will no doubt remember the illfated Rettig played Widmark's eight year old son in Kazan's brilliant Panic In The Streets six years earlier. Also in the cast is a young James Drury as a cavalry officer in one of his early Pre Virginian roles.The DVD looks gorgeous! With glowing colour well defined sharp as a button images and the Cinemascope camera of Wilfrid Cline taking full advantage of those eyecatching backdrops the incredible red rock locations at Sedona Arizona. And not forgetting the wonderful score by Lionel Newman which is probably the best thing this younger brother of the great Alfred Newman ever did. Extras include a good trailer and a couple of photo galleries. A must for the collection of every western and every Widmark fan.Typical line from Widmark  referring to the Nick Adams character.... We've got six bullets and that idiot uses up three of them on a stinkin' rattler you could kill with a stick. Great Stuff!".

Richard Widmark is the tough steely hero who aims to guide the survivors to safety through the desert and clear his name in a murder case. The plot is basically one of survival and redemption and the picture fleshes out Widmark's character in dramatic fashion first as an abused prisoner then as a trail savvy outsider who must bring to safety folks who dislike him because of his reputation. The film has fine action scenes but tends to dwell on the attitudes of the young whites who resent being dependent on Widmark yet realize they need him to pull them out of harm's way. Felicia Farr is good as the woman who falls for Widmark in spite of his troubled past as are Susan Kohner and Stephanie Griffin the latter as a highstrung lass with a quick temper. Nick Adams and Tommy Rettig do fine in their roles and round out the survival party. The cinematography and music are top notch.".

The deep blue skies and reddish rock colour go perfectly with the steely blue eyes and yellowish skin of Richard Widmark. Even the colour of his tunic blends in with the rest. The cameraman here must have been a real genius as every shot is perfect.Great attention seems to have been paid to the color of the sky the position of the sun and even the shots in contrejour come out perfectly  in short a real FEAST for the eyes. This film has only recently been made available on DVD in the USA and is of course absent from Europe though we have plenty of other and many inferior quality Westerns available on DVD....this should have been one of the first to come out...but this was not to be the case. Plotwise the film is quite enthralling and it's interesting to note the change in attitude of the people with time towards Widmark from suspicion and hate towards gratitude and love by the end. The other actors give reasonable performances but of course in this film Widmark steals the show just as he did in No Way Out. The scenes with the Indians smoke signals etc are awesome and very colourful. Also the soundtrack is very good I even thought it was Dimitri Tiomkin who had composed it but I was wrong. When I saw the film initially I was fearing some ghastly sad ending thinking that Widmark would inevitably come a cropper but fortunately love rules OK and all turns out right ! Phew ! This is a film that every true Westernlover should have on the shelves of hisher DVDthque.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film begins with Richard Widmark being chased by a posse. In the process Widmark kills several of the deputies until he is ultimately captured. The sheriff along with Widmark soon meets up with a wagon train and tags along with them until he can get his prisoner back to town for a proper hanging. As for why Widmark did all these nasty murders he is supposedly part Comanche he sure doesn't look itthat's because he was a white orphan raised by the tribe and has a total disregard for societyand somehow this entitles him to kill with abandon.Problems soon develop with the settlers. They are devout people and can't stand the way the sheriff takes pleasure in tormenting Widmark who is now handcuffed to a wagon wheel. What happens next with Widmark and the sheriff is something you'll need to see for yourself.Soon another parallel story begins as well. One of the ladies in the wagon train is angry because her father was previously married to an AmericanIndian and she has a halfsister as a result. There is obviously much hatred of the 'halfbreed' sister and the racist feelings the white sister feels is a parallel to the story of Widmark. Occasionally this tension seems a bit overdoneespecially since you'd think the angry white sister would have come to terms with her halfsister and the white settlers would get tired of using words like 'savage' so much. Subtle its message ain't and the one young lady in particular plays a character too unlikable and annoying to be realthe one and only real deficit in an otherwise good film.Unfortunately for the wagon train the land they eventually enter is Indian land. Soon it appears that the Indians are angry about their land being invaded and it appears that all of the settlers' lives are about to be snuffed. At this point the tables are turned and it's up to the coldblooded killer Widmark to save the dayescorting the survivors to safety and teaching them to live off the land like natives.By the way as you watch Widmark chained to the wagon wheel and doing some stunts as well while connected to the wheel you are impressed by how much he was willing to do for this role. Occasionally you assume it's a stuntman doing some of the scenes but in many cases it is clearly Widmark being tossed about in this very uncomfortable manner. What a guy...and what a good film.Overall a very good film that is worth watching for its fine performance by Richard Widmark as well as an interesting and thoughtprovoking script. As I already said the story isn't always subtle nor are a few of the characters but it still is an earnest and enjoyable flick.".

Severely depleted and ill equipped to deal with the terrain and threat of further attacks the remaining settlers must put their trust in Todd to hopefully steer them all to safety.The Last Wagon is one in a long line of Westerns that feature a similar plot but this Delmer Daves Dark Passage  310 to Yuma picture is a touch above many of the others due to having a few things in its favour. Primarily the picture's major draw card is the performance of Richard Widmark as Todd. In what could have been a by the numbers character Widmark fills the role out with a sort of resentful angst. Resentful and angry angst that is coated with delicate flecks of romanticism! With the romantic plot strand here being no hindrance at all. In fact the romance here with Felicia Farr's delightful performance Jenny is sexy and mixes well with the dramatic core of The Last Wagon's being. As a character study of a group of people under duress Daves and his co writer James Edward Grant have excelled and broken away from maudlin tendencies so rife in films of this ilk. Virtues and vices come under the microscope as does the art of being humanitarian regardless of circumstance and being armed with basic facts or foolishly acting on hearsay.Also containing some beautiful location work at the afore mentioned Oak Creek Canyon Arizona filmed in Cinemascope and Technicolor it's most certainly looking like a film that has apparently been forgotten outside of the Widmark and Western purists. And that's a damn shame because although the ending doesn't quite sit right with all that has gone before it it's a fine Western picture just begging to be discovered by any prospective newcomers to an often derided genre. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that I am a huge fan of westerns which may in part explain why I enjoyed The Last Wagon so much. But I think even those who don't watch offerings of the genre that much would enjoy it. Richard Widmark makes for a compelling central figure convincingly showing a heroic streak while at the same time showing some dark sides to his character. He is aided by a screenplay that gives him ample opportunity to flesh out his character as well as the other protagonists he helps. The movie moves at a brisk pace and the outdoor locations are attractive and brightly shot. There are also a few action scenes that are pretty exciting.The movie is not perfect. There are two minor quibbles I have with the movie. The first is that Widmark's character is seen killing an innocent man in front of the other characters early in the movie. Even with what he does to make up for that during the long stretch of the movie it's kind of hard to believe his eventual fate in the end. Also while I did often welcome the screenplay's ample dialogue  which fleshes out the characters  there is a little too much. I think had there been a little less dialogue and a bit more action the movie would have worked even better than it does now. But the movie is still very enjoyable despite those two small quibbles.".

But I think even those who don't watch offerings of the genre that much would enjoy it. Richard Widmark makes for a compelling central figure convincingly showing a heroic streak while at the same time showing some dark sides to his character. He is aided by a screenplay that gives him ample opportunity to flesh out his character as well as the other protagonists he helps.

Seeing it again last night I'm happy to report that this 1956 Western holds up well despite the dated score.THE STORY Richard Widmark stars as Comanche Todd a white man raised by Comanches and under arrest for murder. Deep in hostile Apache territory he soon finds himself the leader of a small group of youths from a wagon train. Will they make it out alive? And even if they do can Todd escape the sentence of deathbyhanging? First of all this film is gorgeous to look at  shot on location in Sedona Arizona at the mouth of Oak Creek Canyon.Secondly not only is the plot excellent so are the characters cast and everything else. The film successfully takes you back to the late 1800s and gives a good glimpse of what it must have been like to travel out West during that time.Felicia Farr and Susan Kohner stand out in the supporting cast both are incredibly beautiful. Each youth has hisher issues and grows much as a result of their experiences with Comanche Todd and the dire situation. For instance Susan Jolie is ashamed that she's halfIndian but Todd teaches her to be proud of who and what she is. Others hate Todd for being an injun lover but later see the error of their ways. Todd himself is lost in in a fog of bitterness  revenge but a new potential family is thrown in his lap. Can he get over his disillusionment to see the blessing in his current situation? This is just a taste of the character arcs addressed in the story.Stop the presses! Christianity and Christians are actually portrayed in a positive light  amazing! Yet so are the beliefspractices of the Natives. The film does an outstanding job of taking the middle road with the settlers and the natives. Not to mention the Indians are portrayed realistically unlike many 50's Westerns where you just roll your eyes at their silly depiction.Aside from the dated score which isn't bad just dated the only negative I can cite would be the way in which the conflict with the Apaches is concluded. But the film makes up for it with a powerful endcommentary on the nature of universal justice.The DVD features both the widescreen and fullscreen versions.MY GRADE A".

They take exception to the sheriffs sadistic treatment of Widmark and much character development ensues before a scuffle in which Widmark emphatically disposes of the sheriff and he is eventually allowed to reveal that the sheriff's no account brothers raped and killed his Indian wife.Most of the interaction between Widmark and the wagon train has been with the younger crowd who are less set in their ideas and now it is arranged for them all to be conveniently out of camp while the faceless horde of Indians massacre the adults.Somehow Widmark survives despite being attached to a wagon wheel that was pushed over a cliff... and he is left to try and lead the small group of youthful survivors to safety against overwhelming odds while educating them in the ways of racial tolerance along the way in between well staged action scenes involving manageable numbers of hostiles. So the characters undertake both a physical and a metaphorical journey if you will.However the ending is pure Hollywood explosives arrive to provide the great equaliser and a kindly judge sentences Widmark to spend the rest of his life in the custody of one of the nubile young women he has saved. Presumably they go off to live happily ever after with her little brother in Widmarks wigwam although I think he had another term for the Indian tent dwelling.The scenery is magnificent and our perspective of it is enhanced by the fact that much of the movie is set half way up the side of the mountainous valley where the action is set.The Indians are used as a faceless plot device representing danger however their historical plight is also well represented and advocated by Widmark the white man who has lived long among them.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to watch this movie in Italian which I don't speak. Thanks to Eva and my Spanish I can understand it. I might have missed some of the more subtle nuances but this will be a beloved movie all my life. It is so important to show films that highlight that it wasn't only Jews who were victims of fascist hatred. This is one of Rupert Everett's best yet so little known. It should be available in every country and language. It moved me more than Captain Correlli or Tea with Mussolini . The demise of the doctor is sickening and the cowardice of the majority of David's fellow students deplorable. These were the intellectual elite who should have been able to see through the lies and hatred of fascism. As a friend said maybe we would all do what Nora does to try to save herself but she is a fool. You probably could hide Jewish roots but very rarely I am sure. How much better to keep your dignity and know that with so much hatred these evil people would lose because they would make most of the World their enemy. I recently found out that Ferrara is noted for rain and bicycles all of which feature along with the beautiful settings .I look at David's little sister and then I want to weep for all the children killed by that evil. This film should be used for educational purposes  as beautiful as it is I can't call it mere entertainment. There is a book that I have on order that will fill out more detail. How sad that it might be only Eva and I who have bothered to celebrate this movie .".

	schema:reviewBody "I was deeply moved by original version of this movie despite my survival Italian. Recently I had the chance to see it again with English subtitles. Yes indeed watching as The Gold Rimmed Glasses verifies my earlier conclusion that it delivers a timeless story on rise of oppression and versatility of human emotions  in the very negative sense depending on political climate in other words societal readiness for submission. Based on Giorgio Bassani's novel The Gold Rimmed Glasses unfolds story of outcasts on two levels socialpolitical and individual. Set in 1938 Ferrara Italy those layers are interwoven beautifully. University student David Rupert Everett a wealthy Jewish family witnesses in great despair the rise of Mussolini fascism along with increasingly alarming racial laws and neighborhood hate and hostility. Staying calm on the eve of a world war becomes a virtual reality for Jews and anyone different which brings second layer of the story come into play. Played by Phillippe Noiret doctor Fadigati is not a Jew but feels like one of the others because of his homosexuality. He wants his own life and keep cool as much as possible however the inevitable game of survival with rise of fascism haunts him in the aftermath of his boyfriend's abuse. In a poisoned atmosphere where Mussolini finds alliance with Hitler only David and Fadigati can understand and support each other. Dismayed by his girlfriend's decision to convert to Catholicism David does his best to rage against changing times whereas Fadigati yields to his fate. Under Giuliano Montaldo's direction Phillippe Noiret and Rupert Everett are wonderful in their roles. They deserve extra credit by playing Italian characters considering former being French and latter being British. A great movie in Italian I hope The Gold Rimmed Glasses gets digital restoration eventually to receive international acclamation it deserves.".

	schema:headline " One of Bergman's best films major spoilers below";
	schema:reviewBody "Film lovers with a slightly more than rudimentary knowledge of the subject recognize that Ingmar Bergman was active long before he directed The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries. Still few of those earlier films are known that well besides perhaps Smiles of a Summer's Night which I don't care for much myself though I owe it a reassessment. In 1953 Bergman made two of his greatest works Sawdust and Tinsel and Summer with Monika distributed in the US as simply Monika but I prefer to use the entire title as it just sounds better. Sawdust and Tinsel as I say is another masterwork do see it. But it is not the issue at hand here. Summer with Monika has a classic art film story behind it Bergman came up with the idea quickly having gotten some money and he just took his few actors and crew on a summer vacation with very little planning involved. What results is a simple story but one that is very mature and emotionally complex. Two teenage lovers escape the tyranny of their parents. Stealing a boat they travel around the southern islands of Sweden together revelling in their adolescent lust. A few things happen along the way but they aren't really worth mentioning. Not that these events are unimportant only that to describe them would not be useful here they ought to be experienced as they happen.What makes this film a masterpiece is the third act. Teenage love is often so idealized by artists born from an air of irresistable nostalgia. Maybe Ingmar Bergman was too much of a pessimist for his characters to find neverending happiness by the time the film fades out. Harriet Andersson a Bergman regular of course plays Monika. There is a love in her and she may even really love Harry played by Lars Ekborg when they set out together. On the other hand part of it is she just wants the experience of an adventure of independence from her cluttered and sad homelife and parents of love and not least of all of sex. Monika is first and foremost a sexual being. Andersson is not exploited though as she so easily could have been French actress Brigitte Bardot provides the best example of just how an actress' career can be harmed by these kinds of highly sexual roles. Andersson arouses the audience but Bergman is careful as he is with all of his women not to make her into some cheap male fantasy. We want Harriet Andersson yet we realize that she is not to be had. She is her own person.This manifests itself in a pretty nasty way in the third act. Eventually as the summer begins to fade Harry decides that the two of them cannot spend the rest of their lives drifting around on a boat. They also have realized that Monika has become pregnant. Bergman thus eschews the type of ending where the two return home maybe in love maybe not and that's that. Instead he gives these two characters a reality check. Harry jumps into it with gusto marrying his sweetheart and getting a decent job. When his child is born he is overjoyed. Unfortunately Monika who is two years younger than Harry at 17 cannot make the same leap. This monotonous routine life which she was hoping to escape falls back down on her. The fact that she has a child annoys her no longer is she free to do what she chooses. And her lust is now left unsatisfied Harry sees her as the beautiful mother of his child not so much as his lover anymore. Ultimately because Harry is away so much with his work Monika's lust breaks loose. In the film's most memorable scene she picks up a new boyfriend at a bar. Bergman allows her to look straight into the camera one of the earliest examples of a filmmaker breaking the fourth wall. Monika looks into our eyes and we see the pain fear and loneliness she has acquired. The shot is held for what seems like forever even though it comprises only a few seconds.Monika leaves Harry and their baby. The film ends with Harry alone staring at himself and his child in the mirror. He is hurt that is certain but I do not believe that he judges her too harshly. After all he does understand Monika and her temperament. As he remembers the beauty of the summer he and Monika shared he cradles in his arm the only physical evidence left of that time. It's a sad ending but with the warmness we see in Harry's expression we know that the child will be much loved by its father. Life continues.".

	schema:headline " a sleeperclassic naturalistic with trademarkBergman imagery";
	schema:reviewBody "Summer with Monika is a very fine sometimes masterful showcase of what would be to come with Ingmar Bergman's more notable and personal dramas. That is in the technical side of things here he uses a lot of shots that are simply there for the location the imagery of the rocks and beach and waters where the characters are at. It's much more in a sense of a documentary of these two people than a usual tale of young love. But it's a good story at the core and in it Bergman also establishes one of the actresses that would become crucial to his career. Harriet Andersson is remarkable as the happy though high strung and as one in my generation might call 'needy' Monika who works at a vegetable stand. She meets Harry Ekberg in a bar one day and the two hit it off after later seeing a movie. Monika's home life is the pits as is Harry's work environment. So they act on an impulse to get away for the summer to an island. Out of that comes what is very natural in a relationship happiness love despair hunger and the oncoming unplanned child. The third act goes as how one might expect but the way it's filmed and acted is still extraordinary.Once Bergman gets his film on the water he just shoots and shoots. Some of this may not seem to go anywhere some of it may just seem like shots of animals and rocks. But I have a feeling Bergman was likely inspired by either painters or the neorealists with their documentary feel. If nothing else everything feels very much alive and real with how the characters talk and act to each other and that doesn't lose its ground after fifty years. Some shots here and there one when Monika is out one night when Harry is not at home is intriguing on how it just stays on her and how it's lit are some of the more memorable ones of the 1950's for the director. I also liked how the characters were believably stuck in the middle of a very plausible dilemma do they keep on going on with a great bit love affair alone and off from civilization or do they face up to what they have to do with living? It's a tragic somewhat obvious conclusion but the way it's told is how it scores some points.Basically Summer with Monika is a fresh dark love story that may appeal to those looking for a good alternative to a film of today loaded with cynicism or delight in the shrill conventions with the characters. One may have seen characters like Monika and Harry in other films yet they are fitting for the style of Bergman's precise bittersweet whimsy and depth.".

This first powerful feature by the Swedish master is simple and sweet but nonetheless rich in emotional wrenching events. The film which depicts teenage unwed sex was shockingly sensual for its time.

It was during the filming of this movie that Ingmar Bergman left his wife for the actress Harriet Anderssonan act which he would regret and influence him for the rest of his career.  This act would greatly influence Wild Strawberries1957 Persona1966 The Touch1971 Cries  Whispers1972 and would inspire the Liv Ullman film Faithless.

It is one of those films in Bergman's oeuvre which hasn't completely lost the hope for the good and love yet and from that period Sommaren med Monika is probably his most impressive work. The film is an ode to the vitality and joie de vivre of the youth about it's rebellion and breaking out exploring and checking and therefore compared to Bergman's sixties a pretty hopeful take on life. For the first half at least until the couple is confronted with reality after a few days of liberation and from now on they have to suffer the loss of their courage spirit of adventure the faith in each other and consequently the loss of their young love. The wonderful time with Monika does not remain  the only thing everyone can bank on.It's remarkable now from a perspective of more than 50 years ahead how this film is also a homage to Harriet Andersson. At that time there hardly was a similarly fresh natural and at the same time sublime appearance in Europe's auteur cinema. With every shot Bergman and cinematographer Gunnar Fischer capture her beauty and lightness perfectly. In one of the earliest nude scenes of European cinema they underline her innocent naturalness and love for nature a naturalism in acting which is Andersson's strength when you think of the death scene in Cries and Whispers or the madness of Karin in Through a Glass Darkly. Her face her entire guise stands next to Liv Ullmann's Bibi Andersson's or Ingrid Thulin's for more than half a decade of superb Swedish cinema history.".

Summer with Monika is Ingmar Bergman's early masterful classic. It's European modernism and as many of Bergman's films of that era this film too dealt with social issues. Even that Ingmar Bergman himself was from a bourgeois family Summer with Monika builds around the working class. It's a story about two youngsters who fall in love and start living a life of their own.Monika is a minor girl who doesn't get along with her parents. Her only escape from the harsh family life is romantic cinema and her boyfriend Harry. In result of the distressing life Monika and Harry escape the city to archipelago for the summer. When the summer's over and they come back the love between them starts to fade.I have yet not seen as strong film about young parenthood as this. It shows the truth in a very realistic light Bergman doesn't add any glamor to its characters' lives which he never does. This is the social theme of Summer with Monika young parenthood and the subject is still very current which makes the film timeless. No director of today has succeed in making as good description of the life like that.Summer with Monika is so beautifully made that it delights you. The plot also has some points that delight the audience but I was mostly touched by the beauty of the narrative and cinematography. Both of these are clearly European modernism in Summer with Monika. The camera goes behind the reality it shows the true emotions of the characters. A very impressive scene of the film is when Monika watches directly to the camera. This shocking destruction of the fourth wall and the illusion of cinema was probably the first one ever made. My information of this is not accurate or reliable but at least Summer with Monika was one of the first ones that did this.A very powerful film of love youth parenthood frustration and life.".

The film's point of view sometimes felt a bit one sided to me with 'bad girl' Monika from a crude poor family less willing to extend herself than her upperclass boyfriend Harry. Of course along with being selfish she is also the more complex and fascinating character especially as played by the young Harriett Andersson. Some critics make the argument  with merit  that the film doesn't judge Monikathe audience does. Indeed it could be argued that the film is meant to make us question our own judgment of a poor girl who is brought up with dreams of marriage as a glamorous escape and not just a humdrum existence. It's not for nothing the heroine is obsessed with Hollywood love stories. Andersson's performance may be the first of the many hyperreal and extremely complex characters in Bergman's body of work transcending 'type' and moral judgment. The film was beloved by the French New wave filmmakers who saw in it's complex attitude and very brief nudity a throwing off of the shackles of conventional characters and storytelling.".

	schema:headline " While this Swedish forebear of the British kitchen sink dramas entertains it is not among Bergman's greatest work";
	schema:reviewBody "In Ingmar Bergman's 1953 film SOMMAREN MED MONIKA The Summer with Monika young idealistic Harry Lars Ekborg meets the freespirited Monika Harriet Andersson. Fed up with their dull stockroom jobs as midsummer approaches they quit and and escape together to one of the myriad islands in the Stockholm archipelago. But while Harry is keen to get back to civilization and further his education in order to support the child they will soon have Harriet thinks little of the future pursuing her own whims of the moment.

The first third of the film is almost like listening to an Allan Pettersson symphony.All in all the film is entertaining and teaches us something about an earlier time and place but don't think this is one of the more serious films that established Ingmar Bergman as one of the most daring and insightful filmmakers of the 20th century.".

Fed up with their dull stockroom jobs as midsummer approaches they quit and and escape together to one of the myriad islands in the Stockholm archipelago. But while Harry is keen to get back to civilization and further his education in order to support the child they will soon have Harriet thinks little of the future pursuing her own whims of the moment.

	schema:reviewBody "For a film which was released in 1953 'Summer with Monika' has some scenes that are pretty risqu. Bergman uses some eroticism to decorate the intensity of the young love that blossoms between Monika and Harry. This is at its core a comingofage film specially from Harry's point of view. Two youngsters of contrasting attitudes contrasting backgrounds and contrasting aspirations get attracted to each other and we witness their innocent yet intensely passionate love affair. They leave the civilisation of the city behind and start exploring life in a new way together in the midst of the wilderness of the country isolated from the general population.However as it invariably happens life refuses to allow these youngsters an extended spell of joy and somewhat inevitably worldly realism starts to eat into romanticism. But as happens with every unhappy reality this proves to be a learning experience for Harry and it ends up learning something about himself about others and about life. Some viewers might opine that Bergman goes a little overboard and somewhat vilifies Monika a bit too much but I think it is a depiction of the reality that awaits everyone who embarks on a journey which requires maturity while still being immature.'Summer with Monika' includes some of the quintessential Bergman elements like long takes extended extreme closeups to underline internal conflict or emotional shift lingering shots of nature symbolism etc. However the metaphors get a bit too onthenose at times here. Specially the character of Lelle appears abruptly on multiple occasions without any logic just to act as a metaphor which is somewhat offputting.Harriet Andersson and Lars Ekborg are really good as Monika and Harry respectively. They make their characters as well as their relationship believable and passionate which makes us root for the 'happily everafter'.'Summer with Monika' is certainly not one of Bergman's best films. But it does contain some of the masterful touches that Bergman would polish even further to make numerous masterpieces. But even then I think 'Summer with Monika' deserves to be seen as an early piece of work from one of the masters that has something to say about the brutality of life.".

And there are other times when life is harsher and you have to take responsibility or suffer consequences. So the lesson of life is hard in the end. But the story of Monika and her lover Harry is so much more than a moral tale for yesterday's and today's youth. It is also a summer of impatience defiance and rebellion. Monika's naked body for instance was a striking image for 1953 audiences but it still is a cry for liberty from social constraints to today viewers. The Swedish natural scenery also calls for freedom in sharp contrast to the shady life in town to family rules to the violence of men who drink and beat women to the greedy merchants and employers. At the same time the film shows us the flip side of total freedom. That is to say you can't just run away from life but you should and you can make it better through commitment and hard work. Don't be afraid of the big names it's a film by Bergman but it is fascinating easy to follow and even very funny at times. My vote is 8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Superb portrait of a young woman who isn't who she appears to be";
	schema:reviewBody "Right before the release of 'Sawdust and Tinsel' which marked the beginning of Ingmar Bergman's long string of profound films with metaphysical themes he served up 'Summer with Monika' a film more in the tradition of the Italian neorealists about a young couple who spend a summer of abandon amongst the islands of the Swedish archipelago before returning to the city and getting married.The film's principals Harry and Monika are introduced when they meet at a bar. One is struck right away by Monika's liking for Harryhe really doesn't have to do anything and immediately scores a date with her at the local cinema. We soon discover that both young people are very needy. Monika comes from the more lower class background residing in a tenement apartment with her mother and an alcoholic father along with younger siblings who can't keep quiet. Harry lives in a bigger home but lost his mother when he was eight and hardly speaks with his father who suffers from health problems.In the film's first act Harry and Monika are at the point where they both want to run away as they both hate their jobs. Harry is a delivery person for a glass and porcelain factory and is constantly berated by his superiors as he's often late for work and shows little enthusiasm for the job. Monika works in a produce store and must endure the salacious comments and outright groping by crass coworkers and supervisors. It's understandable how Monika is so immediately attracted to the kindly Harry as he doesn't treat her as a sex object like many of the men she knows from her side of the tracks.Perhaps the only unsatisfying aspect of 'Summer with Monika' is the underdeveloped character of Lelle one of Monika's neighbors who we can presume has either had a prior relationship with Monika or admired her from afar. Out of jealousy he socks Harry in the face out of the blue after observing him escorting Monika home and saying goodbye. It's an awkward scene because we find out nothing about Lelle before and wonder simply who this guy is.The film's second act where the principals commit themselves to an adventure outside their ordinary lives occurs after Harry is fired from his job and Monika quits hers Harry ends up convincing Monika to take his father's motor boat up to the islands in the archipelago and 'live free' from the constraints of their drab lives back in the city. The cinematography highlighting the natural wonders of this part of Sweden is magnificent. The second act machinations include more revelations about Harry's upbringing as well as another awkward scene with Lelle fighting Harry after he attempts to torch their boat has he been stalking the couple the whole time? Again he's a character who always seems to be popping up out of the blue without a back story.One of the great things about Bergman is that you can always count on him for his deeply nuanced female characters. 'Summer with Monika' is basically a brilliant character study about a very young woman who turns out to be quite different than what we're first led to believe. At first Monika appears quite sympathetic as she cradles Harry in her arms after he reveals how lonely he was as a child due to the loss of his mother and distant father. Even before Monika's sudden transformation there are clues that she has quite a different temperament than Harry. When Harry is fired he only brings himself to tip over one glass in the factory instead of smashing many more glasses as he could have done. When Harry knocks Lelle down during the boating trip Harry restrains Monika who could have ended up killing him by striking him with the oar.Monika begins to sing a different tune when the intrepid couple find themselves subsisting on mushrooms for breakfast lunch and dinner. Like a savage animal she breaks into a welltodo home on one of the islands and steals a pot roast. The husband calls the police but Monika breaks free and returns to the boat where Harry chastises her for committing an illegal and hence immoral act. Monika has no scruples and believes that the 'ends justify the means'.The third act perhaps the strongest of the film chronicles the dissolution of Harry and Monika's relationship. They end up marrying due to Monika's pregnancy. She turns out to be the wife from hell as she doesn't want to care for her child and would like to resume the life she had when she was single. Meanwhile Harry takes steps toward maturity by finding a job with coworkers who treat him with respect.Things go from bad to worse when Harry discovers that she's been sleeping with Lelle and also spent the rent money on an expensive suit. When he asks her why she went to bed with Lelle she cynically claims that she loves him. Harry then slaps Monika who ends up leaving him. Bergman's portrait of Monika is sympathetic but he doesn't excuse her behavior. In effect she goes back to the very men she was trying to escape from in the first place. The famous closeup of Monika suggests that she's as empty on the inside as that vacant stare we see on the outside.On the other hand when we see Harry closeup in the last scene we're first treated to a montage of the young father's memories of his summer with Monika. His expression changes from pride in his newborn to a look of sadness as he realizes that he has a tough road ahead as a single parent. The brilliance of Bergman is that he never sugarcoats reality. Monika's actions are vile but her difficult upbringing is no excuse for rejecting responsibilities as a mother. Indeed Bergman is saying there ARE people like Monika in this world! Deal with it!".

	onyx:emotionText "Right before the release of 'Sawdust and Tinsel' which marked the beginning of Ingmar Bergman's long string of profound films with metaphysical themes he served up 'Summer with Monika' a film more in the tradition of the Italian neorealists about a young couple who spend a summer of abandon amongst the islands of the Swedish archipelago before returning to the city and getting married.The film's principals Harry and Monika are introduced when they meet at a bar. One is struck right away by Monika's liking for Harryhe really doesn't have to do anything and immediately scores a date with her at the local cinema. We soon discover that both young people are very needy. Monika comes from the more lower class background residing in a tenement apartment with her mother and an alcoholic father along with younger siblings who can't keep quiet. Harry lives in a bigger home but lost his mother when he was eight and hardly speaks with his father who suffers from health problems.In the film's first act Harry and Monika are at the point where they both want to run away as they both hate their jobs. Harry is a delivery person for a glass and porcelain factory and is constantly berated by his superiors as he's often late for work and shows little enthusiasm for the job. Monika works in a produce store and must endure the salacious comments and outright groping by crass coworkers and supervisors. It's understandable how Monika is so immediately attracted to the kindly Harry as he doesn't treat her as a sex object like many of the men she knows from her side of the tracks.Perhaps the only unsatisfying aspect of 'Summer with Monika' is the underdeveloped character of Lelle one of Monika's neighbors who we can presume has either had a prior relationship with Monika or admired her from afar. Out of jealousy he socks Harry in the face out of the blue after observing him escorting Monika home and saying goodbye. It's an awkward scene because we find out nothing about Lelle before and wonder simply who this guy is.The film's second act where the principals commit themselves to an adventure outside their ordinary lives occurs after Harry is fired from his job and Monika quits hers Harry ends up convincing Monika to take his father's motor boat up to the islands in the archipelago and 'live free' from the constraints of their drab lives back in the city. The cinematography highlighting the natural wonders of this part of Sweden is magnificent. The second act machinations include more revelations about Harry's upbringing as well as another awkward scene with Lelle fighting Harry after he attempts to torch their boat has he been stalking the couple the whole time? Again he's a character who always seems to be popping up out of the blue without a back story.One of the great things about Bergman is that you can always count on him for his deeply nuanced female characters.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1950s Sweden two young working class kids still in their teens the reckless and rebellious Monica and the handsome if quiet Harry decide to elope from their families in his father's boat and have a torrid affair in an island in the Stockholm archipelago during the summer. When she becomes pregnant the couple has to return to the city and face reality. Harry gets a stable job and strives to become a responsible parent but Monica rejects the routine of married life and eventually the responsibilities of motherhood because as she says being young she prefers to have fun. This film was reputedly extremely daring at the time it was filmed Monica appears in a few scenes partially nude at the beach but it really seems almost quaint now. One problem is that films dealing with social issues tend to age quickly much more so than other type of films. Since social mores change a film portraying a conflict with the social norms of the era that seems daring at the time it is released looks more and more dated once the social norms are changed. The beginning portraying Monica fighting with her coarse working class family in their crowded apartment and at their grocer's post seems to belong to a socialist realism movie. Maybe director Ingmar Bergman was at that point too influenced by the Italian films of the time but it doesn't look a Swedish milieu at all. Harry is portrayed as the more mature of the two but at times he is also totally irresponsible like when he decides to elope with Monica at the moment when his father is gravely ill at the hospital and what happened to him is never said apparently he died while the couple were at the island. It is said that Monica became an inspiration to many rebellious girls in the 1950s and 1960s but I found her character unappealing all way through not terribly physically attractive and also irresponsible immature callous capricious. And there are some really inept scenes in the movie yes I know the scenes were directed by Bergman but I still would called them ineptly filmed like when he fights the other guy in the beach or when Monica steals a roasted meat to a middle class family. The movie has a great scene though that seems to belong to a better and more recent movie when Monica after she becomes a mother and is dissatisfied with conjugal life with Harry flirts in a bar with a new lover and suddenly breaks the fourth wall looking straight at the camera with a seducing look. So this is not a great movie in my view though at least it gives some material for thought.".

	schema:headline " Fair Game combines strong performances and compelling drama with a very personal look into the abuse of power in government";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the major events that President George W. Bush will undoubtedly be remembered for in history will be his decision to declare war on Iraq in 2003. If we recall back to early 2003 when the administration was laying out its reasons for invading Iraq the one most marketed to the American public was the idea that Saddam Hussein was in the process of creating chemical or nuclear weapons which he would then give to terrorists who could then use them to attack American cities. Of course soon after the war began it was discovered that these weapons either never existed or no longer existed and to this day no one in the CIA or federal government has been able to explain how the intelligence community could have gotten it so wrong.Fair Game places itself right in the middle of these controversial events between 2002 and 2004 and is told through the eyes of CIA Agent Valerie Plame played very convincingly by Naomi Watts and her husband United Nations Ambassador Joe Wilson played fiercely by the always great Sean Penn. The film's story follows how Plame goes from patriotic CIA agent diligently doing her job overseas to suddenly having her identity made public after her husband uncovered false information about a nuclear development sale between Iraq and Niger. This false information about a uranium sale between these two countries is important because it was implied as factual when Bush was listing information about Iraq during his State of The Union Speech in early 2003.As the film starts Plame and Wilson appear to be a very loving couple with a very strong marriage  they even have 2 small children who live with them in the D.C. area. Plame is busy traveling covertly to countries in The Middle East to shake her fist at people whom might have ties to terrorists while Wilson is back at home often finding himself in heated arguments with friends at the dinner table whom hold a different opinions from his own. Both Plame and Wilson appear to be relatively nonpolitical civilians working peacefully and dutifully for the federal government  until the Bush administration decides that the country should invade Iraq. After Wilson criticizes the administration's faulty information publicly Plame is then fired from her job and much of the rest of the film focuses on how the couple's marriage is stressed because of what is transpiring all over the media. People harass them often when they go out as Wilson makes rounds on the media circuit to try to restore his name. The film has a little bit of a soapoperish feel to it during the 2nd half in that it is mostly focused on the couple's relationship but the acting performances by Watts and Penn are just so sharp that they make up for some of the film's small flaws when it comes to storytelling. There is also a small subplot involving a family in Iraq connected with Plame's counterproliferation efforts that should have been either developed more or left out entirely as that is the weakest part of the film  but fortunately those scenes are relatively few in the entire film.Aside from the acting another of the film's strengths is how it never gets too preachy towards the Bush administration but rather focuses on the facts of what unfairly happened to Plame and Wilson from their own points of view. In fact no actor plays Bush or Cheney in the film  we only see a few clips of the real Bush and Cheneys giving speeches on TV screens for a matter of seconds. Scooter Libby portrayed a bit villainously by David Andrews is seen in a few short scenes as a swindler who tries to convince CIA employees into manipulating the intelligence the way he sees it but his characterization is very subtle rather than as an in your face bad guy. Doug Liman's direction is also fairly fastpaced to make sure the film never gets too bogged down in pointless scenes. Even though it is very talky and dialoguedriven the narrative keeps moving forward at a crisp pace  at least if audience members are adults without ADD and I think it's pretty fair to say that this movie isn't marketed for the Transformers or Twilight crowd... The film generally works very well both as an entertaining drama spy thriller and an educational lesson. Moreover it's an intelligent reminder to the public of how people in positions in power in government will often stop at nothing to achieve their desired goals even if that means illegally abusing their power through misinformation manipulation and character assassination. As citizens we should constantly be questioning our leaders and their motives as well as keeping them honest and holding them accountable whenever they they violate our trust.On a final note I have to say that I find it very refreshing to see a film like this that has a woman in a very intelligent leading role rather than how Hollywood films usually stereotype females in formulaic romantic comedies. It seems like women in major roles usually have their sappy characters obsessing about trying to find a man and buying shoes with some slapstick and comedy at the dinner table with their parents thrown in as well a.k.a. chick flicks. It's either that or the female characters get almost zero screen time where they are relegated to simply being the cute girlfriend sidekick. It's nice to see movies like this allow womens' dramatic acting talents to shine and allow us to see them as complex real characters.".

The film generally works very well both as an entertaining drama spy thriller and an educational lesson. Moreover it's an intelligent reminder to the public of how people in positions in power in government will often stop at nothing to achieve their desired goals even if that means illegally abusing their power through misinformation manipulation and character assassination. As citizens we should constantly be questioning our leaders and their motives as well as keeping them honest and holding them accountable whenever they they violate our trust.On a final note I have to say that I find it very refreshing to see a film like this that has a woman in a very intelligent leading role rather than how Hollywood films usually stereotype females in formulaic romantic comedies. It seems like women in major roles usually have their sappy characters obsessing about trying to find a man and buying shoes with some slapstick and comedy at the dinner table with their parents thrown in as well a.k.a. chick flicks. It's either that or the female characters get almost zero screen time where they are relegated to simply being the cute girlfriend sidekick. It's nice to see movies like this allow womens' dramatic acting talents to shine and allow us to see them as complex real characters.";

	schema:headline " Redressing a small but nasty piece of political bastardry";
	schema:reviewBody "In retrospect the George Dubyah Bush administration seems to have been more incompetent than evil but this movie holds the Bushies to account for what was a completely malicious and unjustified act the outing of the covert CIA operative Valerie Plame which put numerous undercover operations and informants at risk solely because her husband former Ambassador Joe Wilson IV had the temerity to dissent publicly from the White House line that the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had tried to buy uranium from Niger for bombmaking purposes. It is also evident that the CIA's soundly based advice that Saddam's bombmaking activities had ceased after the first Gulf War in 1991 was studiously ignored by the White House in the runup to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.The actual leaker Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage got away scotfree a crucial matter not discussed in the film  but Scooter Libby Vice President Chaney's chief of staff carried the can and nearly spent 30 months inside for lying to investigators before being pardoned by the President. The film focuses on Libby and implies he was the leaker acting with the knowledge of Karl Rove the man who described Valerie Plame as fair game and Vice President Cheney.Director Doug Liman is best known as a producer of thrillers Bourne Ultimation etc but here he and the Butterworths Jez and John Henry as scriptwriters have focused not only on the political intrigue but also the effect the Bushies' bastardry had on Joe and Valerie's personal lives. This gives some great acting possibilities to Sean Penn as Joe and our very own Naomi Watts as Valerie and they both rise to the occasion although Sean Penn might be a little selfrighteous for some tastes. The personal impact aside what the leakers did was a good deal worse than anything Julian Assange has done and it is ironic that some of the conservative commentators who tried to discredit Joe and Valerie are now in the front line of those attacking the Wikileaks founder.Regardless of the politics this movie is entertaining enough to pass the watch test despite some dodgy handheld photography. Near the end Valerie has a meeting with a very senior CIA officer glimpsed earlier on a park bench in front of the White House. This man played by Bruce McGill bears a remarkable physical resemblance to the then director of the CIA George Tenet. He warns her that she and Joe are up against the most powerful men in the world and asks her to stay silent for the sake of the agency. Valerie points out the agency won't even give her family any protection against death threats to which Tenet if that's who it's meant to be merely shrugs his shoulders. What are the film makers trying to say here  that the agency doesn't look after its own? Both Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame were patriots and I believe from Republican backgrounds. This did not bother the leakers who clearly couldn't care less who they hurt in the propaganda battle over the Iraqi invasion they were determined to launch. This film is based on two books by Joe and Valerie so I suppose it is a somewhat partisan account. Nevertheless it is hard to imagine a film treatment justifying what was done to them. George Bush in his memoirs mentions the Libby pardon issue but is otherwise silent on who did what. Never mind his place in history as one of the lesser presidents is assured.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fair Game is a film directed by Doug Liman The Bourne Identity Mr. and Mrs. Smith based on the memoir Fair Game My Life as a Spy My Betrayal by the White House by Valerie Plame. Sean Penn is back after taking a twoyear acting break since his second Best Acting Oscar for Milk in 2008. He plays the character of Politician Joe Wilson alongside Naomi Watts' portrayal of CIA agent Valerie Plame. Together these two tell the true story behind the weapons of mass destruction scare in 2002 and 2003 in Iraq that ultimately lead the United States to war. Valerie Plame is in the middle of the investigation of WMDs in Iraq. In order to learn more about the possible WMDs the government has Valerie's husband Joe travel as an ambassador to Niger in order to get information about the sale of uranium from Niger to Iraq. Joe learns that there is not going to be a sale but the government twists the story. After viewing the State of the Union Address Joe Wilson decides to write an article in the New York Times stating the truth behind what he found in Niger challenging the White House directly. In response the government declassifies Valerie's status as a CIA agent making her Fair Game and putting her directly in the public eye in order to bring shame to her husband and her family. This sparks a fire within Joe to fight the White House but also begins to tear him and his wife apart. Fair Game allows Naomi Watts and Sean Penn to let loose and take over the screen with their acting talents. Watts doe a very good job with her role portrayal of hard shelled Valerie Plame. She is able to create the stubborn exterior of Plame while showing her emotional side deep within. Congratulations is in order for her being able to stand out while on screen with Hollywood superstar and Academy favorite Sean Penn. All of the talk about the film has been directed towards Watts as Oscar season approaches but it would be no surprise if Penn receives an Oscar birth as well. He is phenomenal in the film creating a very unique character breaking through the clichs that could have been. Both of these actors are able to give the film heart and show the strength that the couple had in order to fight the corrupt government sector leading to the fall of Scooter Libby.The film is slow to start as the back story is built however while the characters of Valerie Plame and Joe Wilson are developed completely all of the other characters seem to be left behind. They come off as just walking through the motions making it very hard to connect and differentiate between them. This can be attributed to one of two things. Either the acting is less than adequate or there are so many characters that Watts interacts with at the CIA it are hard to put a name with any of the faces. Fair Game is a political thriller that needed to be made. However it is your job as the audience to reach out and see it because of its limited film release. Go see it now in order to learn about the story and note that a Best Picture Oscar nomination may be waiting for this dark horse of this year's award season.".

	schema:headline " Fact and fiction balanced with terrific performances";
	schema:reviewBody "From the opening scene in Malaysia to the mines of Niger and then to the streets of Baghdad Fair Game begins as an espionage thriller a Bourne film without the obligatory car chases shootouts and fights but rather with a woman who uses her brains and intellect.Once the film shifts its focus back in the United States of America the film takes a slight turn to the dramatic route and thus may seem melodramatic with this married people's lives being tinkered with and with no one but each other to help them. Having said that Fair Game no not that dreadful Cindy CrawfordWilliam Baldwin cheeseball is a remarkably wellcrafted political thriller that is driven home with outstanding terrific performances by both Naomi Watts and especially Sean Penn.Whether you believe the many questions posed in the film are truth or merely lies whether the agency really did take that drastic measure to cover up what the government did not want to hear to prevent the war... or is this all propaganda from the start? I really can't say because this happened in another country far away from my home so I have no right to say whose side I'm on.Watts plays CIA agent Valerie Plame whose cover gets blown and who gets blamed for the leak of wrong information to the White House who uses said information to invade Iraq. Is this all true? Suppose it is given that the news footage of both atthetime President Bush and Vice President Cheney look strikingly foreshadowing when compared to the events in the movie  this is meant to provoke outrage at the government's socalled ignorance and stupidity so they say so what? I'm not saying anything to make myself sound like I'm on the wrong line nor am I saying anything to disprove the film's facts either. I'm just stating that this is a great drama no matter what you believe.See the thing with drama is that fact can and will be fictionalized so that it may be accepted easily by the everinterested audience. Fair Game may be slowpaced and devoid of action sequences ala Doug Liman's previous blockbuster efforts but here not a moment lost my interest even the dramatic ones between Watts and Penn as they ignite the screen with fiery performances as this political scandal isn't only affecting their jobs and their reputations it's also affecting their love life. And it's crumbling as things go from bad to worse in this film.Watts is superb in this film. In the beginning she acts very convincingly as a strong determined ironwilled woman mother and wife who is very confident about herself and not willing to push into any demand that comes at her way. Later after the scandal is spread she slowly but surely devolves into a woman that is filling with desperation and fear until she nearly loses control of her downward spiral. Ditto with Sean Penn here. He is absolutely mesmerizing as always as Plame's husband Ambassador Joe Wilson. Soft spoken and charming when he needs to but when he's angry he makes everyone feel the rage without becoming too overdone. Wilson as portrayed by Penn is a character who's not about to let this scandal get in the way of his family so he decides to clear his and his wife's name by using the media and criticizing the government. Of course his wife isn't happy about this and it causes more tension between them. Penn and Watts show terrific chemistry together that hasn't been lost since 21 Grams and both of them vividly portray not politicians trying to get the truth but rather more of a family trying to pull themselves together. So it's not entirely an espionage thriller like this film was sadly marketed as. The supporting actors are also great in their own right.This film does pose a lot of questions that make one think during the movie about the purpose and cause of the Iraq war the invasion and more importantly the power and impact the US government has on their own people and the various ways they can abuse it on them to get whatever they want. And this is proved with the decaying lives of Plame and Wilson from American citizens to branded traitors. You can't imagine how they really felt but Penn and Watts come really REALLY close to it.The film has it's flaws though. The pacing could be a little bit tighter and the dialog in Iraq doesn't sound genuinely Iraqi. However Doug Liman's direction is enough to keep the tension gripping and the film focused on the characters and not just glimpses of the war and scandal themselves. John Powell's music score is refreshingly lowkey and it suits the dramatic mood of the film even better. Liman's cinematography pulling a double duty here is nicely framed without excessive style to it making it simple easy to watch and gripping. Editing is fluid and the screenplay is written very well with equal amounts of intelligence and emotions.In short this is a superbly fine drama of the lives of the people in the limelight of this political scandal with terrific performances and strong direction worthy of a theater ticket. Go see this movie and savor the performances and the question of the US government on its own people.I find it strangely coincidental that the filmmakers from the Jason Bourne series both released movies this year that criticize the Bush administration. Doug Liman made this film while Paul Greengrass made the slightly superior Green Zone and even managed to bring star Matt Damon with him. Composer John Powell scored both films. You can think of this movie as a companion piece to Green Zone hell you can imagine the events in both movies happening at the same time. Now THAT would be a wicked idea.Overall rating 80100".

	onyx:emotionText "From the opening scene in Malaysia to the mines of Niger and then to the streets of Baghdad Fair Game begins as an espionage thriller a Bourne film without the obligatory car chases shootouts and fights but rather with a woman who uses her brains and intellect.Once the film shifts its focus back in the United States of America the film takes a slight turn to the dramatic route and thus may seem melodramatic with this married people's lives being tinkered with and with no one but each other to help them. Having said that Fair Game no not that dreadful Cindy CrawfordWilliam Baldwin cheeseball is a remarkably wellcrafted political thriller that is driven home with outstanding terrific performances by both Naomi Watts and especially Sean Penn.Whether you believe the many questions posed in the film are truth or merely lies whether the agency really did take that drastic measure to cover up what the government did not want to hear to prevent the war... or is this all propaganda from the start? I really can't say because this happened in another country far away from my home so I have no right to say whose side I'm on.Watts plays CIA agent Valerie Plame whose cover gets blown and who gets blamed for the leak of wrong information to the White House who uses said information to invade Iraq. Is this all true? Suppose it is given that the news footage of both atthetime President Bush and Vice President Cheney look strikingly foreshadowing when compared to the events in the movie  this is meant to provoke outrage at the government's socalled ignorance and stupidity so they say so what? I'm not saying anything to make myself sound like I'm on the wrong line nor am I saying anything to disprove the film's facts either. I'm just stating that this is a great drama no matter what you believe.See the thing with drama is that fact can and will be fictionalized so that it may be accepted easily by the everinterested audience.

	schema:headline " A powerful film that forces us to relive the outrage";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the key ingredients in President George W. Bush's campaign to convince the American people of the necessity of invading Iraq and removing Saddam Hussein from power was the sixteen lines in his January 28 2003 State of the Union address in which he claimed that the British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa presumably to build a nuclear bomb. Though the CIA and the State Department told the White House that this was not good intelligence by repeating this false statement Bush was able to push through a vote in Congress to authorize the war in Iraq warning of mushroom clouds over American cities.Directed by Doug Liman The Bourne Identity and based on books written by covert CIA operative Valerie Plame Naomi Watts and her husband former diplomat Joseph Wilson Sean Penn Fair Game is a hard hitting political thriller about events leading up to the Iraq War of 2003 that dramatizes the Bush Administration's eagerness to convince Americans that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that were a threat to our national security. Though partly fictionalized the film points to many real events and uses the actual names of the participants involved with the exception of the invented exiled Iraqi doctor Liraz Charhi Valerie recruits and her brother Khaled Nabawy a scientist living in Baghdad.Fair Game survives a confusing opening hour that shows events around the globe from Kuaka Lumpur to Amman Jordan to Cairo Egypt and Cleveland Ohio in its effort to establish that Plame a hardened CIA spy for 18 years worked in secret on a mission to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Though Plame did work in that capacity depiction of events that take place abroad in the film's first hour are imagined since Plame's real work in the CIA is classified though Liman claims that credible scenarios were pieced together from interviews with other sources.Plame hides her secret life by telling friends that she is working as a venture capitalist and even her husband knows little of her whereabouts and what exactly she is working on. Liman describes the Wilson's home life including their relationship with their two small children and reminds us how difficult it was for both spouses. According to the script by Jez Butterworth and his brother JohnHenry Plame is soon asked to lead a special Task Force to ascertain the legitimacy of reports that Niger has sold 50 tons of yellowcake uranium ore to Saddam Hussein. Consequently her husband Joe Wilson a former US diplomat in both Niger and Iraq and knowledgeable about Niger was dispatched with Valerie's approval to Africa to investigate.Wilson in reporting back to the CIA on his mission established to his and the agency's satisfaction that not only were these reports false but it would have been impossible for Niger to make such a uranium sale. The White House was informed by the CIA of this fact in March 2002 10 months before the president's speech. In a July 6 opinion piece for the New York Times Wilson wrote Based on my experience with the administration in the months leading up to the war I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat. He added that given the administration's rejection of his and the CIA's analysis because it did not fit certain preconceptions about Iraq then a legitimate argument can be made that we went to war under false pretenses. Shortly thereafter Wilson's wife Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA spy was exposed in a column written by Richard Novak a reporter friendly to the White House. Though the reason behind the exposure is not known with certainty Wilson claimed that Karl Rove told reporters that outing Plame in the newspaper was fair game and the former diplomat calls his wife's exposure an act of political reprisal for the piece critical of the White House. Whatever the motive it was a violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act and led to the appointment of a special prosecutor and the indictment and sentencing of Cheney's Chief of Staff Scooter Libby a sentence commuted by President Bush.With Valerie's cover blown she is dismissed by the C.I.A. called a traitor by sycophants in the media threatened with death by phone calls to her Washington D.C. home and rejected by her friends who ask her if she carries a gun and has she ever killed anyone? Plame is reluctant to go public but her husband willingly talks on TV shows to clear their names and bring to light the administration's chicanery. This public display however threatens the stability of their marriage as Wilson attempts to convince his wife to speak out but is met with strong resistance.The turning point according to the film is Valerie's visit to her parents especially when her father Sam Shepard a retired Air Force officer convinces her that loyalty to one's country can work both ways. Labeled as inspired by real events and told from the viewpoint of Plame and Wilson with events in the White House taken from actual court transcripts Fair Game is a timely reminder of the abuse of governmental power and the lives of innocent people that are caught in the crosswinds. Though the film's second half feels strangely rushed and incomplete Fair Game is a powerful film that forces us to relive the outrage of those days when government deception was an everyday occurrence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fair Game may not do well in the US despite being Doug Liman's best directorial effort to date. If that's the case I hope not it'll be the fault of American audiences' inability to deal with the condensed truth of Jez Butterworth's screenplay derived from the individual memoirs of Valerie Plame and her husband Joseph Wilson. I almost didn't see FG myself.Those who somehow knew next to nothing about the larger global context of what came to be known as the Plame AffairPlamegate were dumbstruck.Even though I knew the facts and long ago decided that something seriously wrong had happened at the conclusion of FG applause was the furthest thing from my mind.FG left me feeling freshly mugged  mentally emotionally and Constitutionally.Headline factoids are drilled down to a personal level without jettisoning the larger context.Valerie Plame is a veteran CIA NOC operative tasked with global nuclear counterproliferation. The details of Plame's gritty human intelligence work fuels the thriller side of the story debunking spy mythology. She's recruitingturning assets and running ops with lifeanddeath stakes. None of these details as depicted are facts because Plame hasn't revealed specifics about her classified CIA work. Liman claims that credible scenarios were pieced together from interviews with other sources who spoke hypothetically. It's riveting stuff.VP Cheney tasks the CIA with a DFU mission to investigate reports that Saddam's Iraq has purchased 500 tons of yellowcake uranium from Niger. Someone must be sent into Niger who knows how that government and its uranium mining industry work to see if there is credible evidence that this transaction took place.REDACTED in DCI suggests that Plame's husband former US Ambassador to Niger Joe Wilson is an ideal candidate for the job. Plame is asked to write up Wilson's qualifications. The decision to send Wilson is made by people several pay grades higher.Wilson agrees to conduct a factfinding mission about the yellowcake. This isn't clandestine it's diplomatic. He goes to Niger as an unpaid patriot works contacts in and out of official service and beats feet looking for any signs whether mining paperwork or convoy tread tracks that 500 tons of yellowcake went anywhere. The film never reveals that Wilson's was the second US diplomatic debunking of these allegations.There's also highly speculative minority dissent among CIA analysts about the significance of aluminum tubing shipped to Iraq from China. Are they centrifugegrade for weaponizing yellowcake into fissile uranium? Or are they more likely parts for strictly conventional missiles? A second invasion of Iraq hangs in the balance.When Wilson's report comes back stating emphatically that no yellowcake ever left Niger for Iraq Cheney's Chief of Staff Scooter Libby David Andrews engages in a concerted campaign to pressure dissenting CIA analysts and ultimately to cherry pick findings in support of claims of an active Iraqi nuke program that's on the verge. The White House neutralizes Wilson's report with British intelligence that directly contradicts Wilson's findings. A painfully funny and literally profane joke was made about strategic US use of select Middle East British intelligence in the 2008 film In the Loop. Naomi Watts' Plame more than holds her own with and against Sean Penn's Wilson. While license is taken depicting Plame's work within the CIA Watt's portrayal makes it clear that Plame was more than a timecardpunching civil servant. Plame's stoic public silence as her career with the CIA comes to an end is conveyed with measures of professional duty and inward sacrifice. As she's hung out to dry by officialdom and a rightwing intelligentsia she's solidly there for her kids. The whole of that really sold a pivotal scene between Plame and her father Lt Col Sam Plame Sam Shepard for me. Watts portrays an humanly unbreakable Valerie Plame.Some reviewers have criticized Penn's acting for feeling preachy. This is likely directed at a question Wilson poses to a lecture hall of college students where he asks how did this become a matter of my wife's cover as a CIA operative being blown and when did it stop being a question of the President lying to the American people about WMDs? That's a rough paraphrase but that's also the crux of the whole film. There are two wrongs to contend with but why must one overshadowdistract from the other? Both are grievous. If one needs to be addressed so must the other. If you disagree with that then Penn must be preaching. I'm not in that camp just as I don't shoot messengers whether I like the message or not.Penn delivers a suffernofools rapier intelligence edged with humanity along with expected moral outrage and a fighter's tenacity in fleshing out Wilson.We'll never know if any humint assets who were associated with Plame over the 18years prior to Plamegate were imprisoned tortured andor executedassassinated as a result of her NOC status being blown. All of them were made fair game too. That gets buried in memoirs and official papers that remain classified for 80 years. I've been to archives where such materials remain untouchable under seal. We know that there were never any WMDs found in Gulf War II. They were obliterated in Gulf War I.FG delivers tough punches. First the cover of a loyal and capable CIA operative is blown not by antagonistic foreign intelligence services but by people at the highest levels of the US government  sacrificial lamb and presidentially pardoned Libby unindicted and nonprosecuted admitted leaker Richard Armitage and ultimate suspect Cheney. Second manipulated NIEs are used to falselyimproperly represent WMDs as a major reason for starting Gulf War II.But the biggest punches of all Why don't more of us know this story and what are We the People doing about the messy aftermath? The oft repeated mantra of truth justice and The American Way is down for the count.".

It's riveting stuff.VP Cheney tasks the CIA with a DFU mission to investigate reports that Saddam's Iraq has purchased 500 tons of yellowcake uranium from Niger. Someone must be sent into Niger who knows how that government and its uranium mining industry work to see if there is credible evidence that this transaction took place.REDACTED in DCI suggests that Plame's husband former US Ambassador to Niger Joe Wilson is an ideal candidate for the job. Plame is asked to write up Wilson's qualifications. The decision to send Wilson is made by people several pay grades higher.Wilson agrees to conduct a factfinding mission about the yellowcake. This isn't clandestine it's diplomatic. He goes to Niger as an unpaid patriot works contacts in and out of official service and beats feet looking for any signs whether mining paperwork or convoy tread tracks that 500 tons of yellowcake went anywhere. The film never reveals that Wilson's was the second US diplomatic debunking of these allegations.There's also highly speculative minority dissent among CIA analysts about the significance of aluminum tubing shipped to Iraq from China. Are they centrifugegrade for weaponizing yellowcake into fissile uranium? Or are they more likely parts for strictly conventional missiles? A second invasion of Iraq hangs in the balance.When Wilson's report comes back stating emphatically that no yellowcake ever left Niger for Iraq Cheney's Chief of Staff Scooter Libby David Andrews engages in a concerted campaign to pressure dissenting CIA analysts and ultimately to cherry pick findings in support of claims of an active Iraqi nuke program that's on the verge. The White House neutralizes Wilson's report with British intelligence that directly contradicts Wilson's findings. A painfully funny and literally profane joke was made about strategic US use of select Middle East British intelligence in the 2008 film In the Loop. Naomi Watts' Plame more than holds her own with and against Sean Penn's Wilson. While license is taken depicting Plame's work within the CIA Watt's portrayal makes it clear that Plame was more than a timecardpunching civil servant. Plame's stoic public silence as her career with the CIA comes to an end is conveyed with measures of professional duty and inward sacrifice. As she's hung out to dry by officialdom and a rightwing intelligentsia she's solidly there for her kids. The whole of that really sold a pivotal scene between Plame and her father Lt Col Sam Plame Sam Shepard for me. Watts portrays an humanly unbreakable Valerie Plame.Some reviewers have criticized Penn's acting for feeling preachy. This is likely directed at a question Wilson poses to a lecture hall of college students where he asks how did this become a matter of my wife's cover as a CIA operative being blown and when did it stop being a question of the President lying to the American people about WMDs? That's a rough paraphrase but that's also the crux of the whole film. There are two wrongs to contend with but why must one overshadowdistract from the other? Both are grievous. If one needs to be addressed so must the other. If you disagree with that then Penn must be preaching. I'm not in that camp just as I don't shoot messengers whether I like the message or not.Penn delivers a suffernofools rapier intelligence edged with humanity along with expected moral outrage and a fighter's tenacity in fleshing out Wilson.We'll never know if any humint assets who were associated with Plame over the 18years prior to Plamegate were imprisoned tortured andor executedassassinated as a result of her NOC status being blown. All of them were made fair game too. That gets buried in memoirs and official papers that remain classified for 80 years. I've been to archives where such materials remain untouchable under seal. We know that there were never any WMDs found in Gulf War II. They were obliterated in Gulf War I.FG delivers tough punches. First the cover of a loyal and capable CIA operative is blown not by antagonistic foreign intelligence services but by people at the highest levels of the US government  sacrificial lamb and presidentially pardoned Libby unindicted and nonprosecuted admitted leaker Richard Armitage and ultimate suspect Cheney. Second manipulated NIEs are used to falselyimproperly represent WMDs as a major reason for starting Gulf War II.But the biggest punches of all Why don't more of us know this story and what are We the People doing about the messy aftermath? The oft repeated mantra of truth justice and The American Way is down for the count.";

Directed by Doug Limon of the Bourne trilogy this film is a spy thriller which is based on the unprecedented case of Ms. Plame whose identity was revealed to the world by the White House.

Criminal conduct by White House officials is not unprecedented. Watergate IranContra and the Clinton impeachment are some recent examples of high drama in the Oval Office. Fair Game is unique in that the crimes against the nation were an exercise of pure power against the truth  to cover the trail of lies which led the United States into a long expensive war for reasons which were never disclosed publicly. The State of the Union address which took the nation to war was a lie. The burden of the American and Iraqi dead rest upon these lies. The United States and Iraq are bleeding our young and our treasuries nearly ten years after the lies got us there.The movie is a great story welltold and hopefully a civics lesson for those who are capable of learning from the past".

	schema:reviewBody "Much of the rationale given by the Bush Administration for America going to war against Iraq and Saddam Hussein at the end of the winter of 2003 centered around claims made by British intelligence officials that Hussein's regime sought out mass quantities of yellow cake uranium from the country of Niger in western Africa. Those claims had been put into the State of the Union speech that Bush had given in January of that year. As it turned out though those claims when thoroughly investigated turned out to be untrue. Subsequently a highlevel couple ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife CIA operative Valerie Plame were outed by cronies inside the Bush White House and placed in the middle of a firestorm in which anyone attempting to discredit the Bush Administration in any small way was censured in the press. It is their fight that was depicted in the 2010 film FAIR GAME.Watts and Penn portray the reallife couple at the center of this firestorm. Penn as ambassador Wilson investigates the claims about yellow cake uranium and aluminum tubing supposedly being used to make nuclear weapons being exported between Niger and Iraq back in the late 1990s as it appears that America is on the brink of ousting Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. Meanwhile Watts as Valerie Plame makes it her business to get reliable sources of Iraq's intelligence out of there to give the CIA the proper information. Penn asserts that such a trade of uranium not only could not have occurred but that the aluminum tubing in question is not of the kind that would be suitable for doing what the Bush Administration says Hussein intends it forto create a nuclear bomb. Thus the rationale for going to war in Iraq has just been rendered fraudulent but a little too late for those Iraqi civilians and U.S. soldiers caught in the middle. Even so however Watts' name and status are both exposed in the media from within the bowels of the administration rendering her damaged goods and infuriating Penn.The other significant thing the whole imbroglio causes is a huge schism between the couple since Watts is initially unwilling to fight back while Penn makes the rounds on the networks to tell the truth of the matter. The allegations against both of them mount in the press which keeps hounding them for their alleged lack of patriotism and finally both of them come out of the shadows to tell their side of the story.Incisively directed by Liman who was responsible for the 2002 Robert Ludlum adaptation THE BOURNE IDENTITY FAIR GAME is a powerful expose of the Iraq war as seen through the eyes and experiences of its most noted diplomatic figures every bit as powerful a political film as any documentary or otherwise made since 911 and indeed every bit as thorough as films like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and THIRTEEN DAYS. While there are political considerations to be considered in this film especially give that Penn was one of the most ferocious and outspoken critics anywhere of the Bush Administration from the beginning this is equally a hardhitting character study as well and Penn and Watts do an excellent job of portraying the beleaguered Wilsons while a whole host of good character actors are superb in their roles of the dark underlings that work for Team Bush. Liman who also does the cinematography shoots FAIR GAME in a very documentarylike style and in the same bleachedcolor visuals that were a trademark of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN MINORITY REPORT and MUNICH.Both Valerie Plane and Joe Wilson risked everything they had to get the truth out there about the Bush Administration's dissembling with regards to a nonexistent connection between Saddam Hussein and 911 and FAIR GAME is an excellent film depicting that struggle clearly one of the best films of 2010.".

Based on the book 'The Politics of Truth' by Joseph Wilson the film has been summarized as follows 'Joseph Charles Wilson IV born November 6 1949 is a former United States diplomat best known for his 2002 trip to Niger to investigate allegations that Saddam Hussein was attempting to purchase yellowcake uranium his New York Times op ed piece What I Didn't Find in Niger and the subsequent outing of his wife Valerie Plame as a CIA agent.' and the book Fair Game' by Valerie Plame. The books have been transformed into a bitingly vital screenplay by Jez and JohnHenry Butterworth and the film is searingly directed by Doug Lyman. Why the film didn't enjoy a better success in the theaters is likely due to the still festering difference of opinion as to the preemptive war on Iraq a war declared because of the 'evidence' that Iraq had Weapons of Mass destruction that is now approaching 10 years in activity despite the embarrassingly early declaration by that the war had been 'won' soon after declaration. What FAIR GAME offers is Wilson's defense of his wife Valerie Plame's role in the CIA and how the government dealt with the coverup and smoke screen and other shenanigans by Karl Rove Scooter Libby and other White House officials who revealed Plame's status as a CIA agent and were allegedly out to discredit her husband after he wrote a 2003 New York Times oped piece saying that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence about weapons of mass destruction to justify the invasion of Iraq. The actors are consistently superb throughout the large cast  Naomi Watts as Valerie Plame Sean Penn as Joe Wilson Bruce McGill as Jim Pavitt Adam LeFevre as Karl Rove David Andrews as Scooter Libby  and the many film clips of President Bush's televised speeches and statements from VP Dick Cheney et al add credence to the atmosphere. It is a film about the value of truth and as such it makes us all think more carefully about our current further involvement in the many battles currently being fought in the countries of the Middle East. There is a speech Joe Wilson gives to his class at the end of the film that challenges his students to always defend democracy  the legacy of our Founding Fathers  and it is this speech that is the most compelling writing in the film.

As the film begins we watch her showing some muscle in the way she moves to get information from a man that had no idea who he was dealing with. During her free time she was a happily married suburban wife. Valerie was the wife of former ambassador Joseph Wilson a man who had good political connections. Before the United States entered the Iraq war Mr. Wilson was dispatched to Niger where supposedly a large amount of uranium had been sold to Sadam Hussein for the purpose of making weapons of mass destruction. He went on his mission but he could not find the information to be true. His report went ignored because the powers that be had already targeted that Middle East country for an imminent attack based on the phony evidence the people interested in making a statement after the attacks of September 11 2001 wanted to make a case for the war to happen.When Joseph Wilson's essay was published by the New York Times it was a good time to get back at him by leaking his wife's name as being a CIA agent. Valerie Plame whose career had been amazing suddenly became the scapegoat of a well designed plan to get her out of the way. The order to reveal her name came directly from an assistant of the VicePresident Dick Cheney Scooter Libby a star within the privileged circle where he had free rein to do whatever he deemed was appropriate to deal with a contradiction that ruined this woman's life as well as her family's. Doug Liman directed with sure hand. The screenplay was written by Jez and JohnHenry Butterworth and based on the books written by Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame. The story plays as though it was really happening. After all these people do exist the was a real incident that happened in the not too distant past where it played for the cameras of all the news programs while it was going on. The film speaks volumes of the arrogance which some government officials deal with the people that do not play their game.Naomi Watts shows an uncanny resemblance with the real Valerie Plame. Ms. Watts gives a fairly accurate impression of the woman that was at the center of the political front line during the investigation that ensued. Sean Penn is seen as Joseph Wilson. His character is not as important because it is his wife who is the key figure in the drama. David Andrews is Scooter Libby. The large supporting cast is too big to mention but they do a wonderful job as the people in the news that played a part of this recent page on American history.".

Doug Liman directed with sure hand. The screenplay was written by Jez and JohnHenry Butterworth and based on the books written by Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame. The story plays as though it was really happening. After all these people do exist the was a real incident that happened in the not too distant past where it played for the cameras of all the news programs while it was going on. The film speaks volumes of the arrogance which some government officials deal with the people that do not play their game.Naomi Watts shows an uncanny resemblance with the real Valerie Plame. Ms. Watts gives a fairly accurate impression of the woman that was at the center of the political front line during the investigation that ensued. Sean Penn is seen as Joseph Wilson. His character is not as important because it is his wife who is the key figure in the drama. David Andrews is Scooter Libby. The large supporting cast is too big to mention but they do a wonderful job as the people in the news that played a part of this recent page on American history.";

	schema:headline " Overcome the first hour and you've got a solid film.";
	schema:reviewBody "There are two parts in Fair Game one of which lasts far longer than the other. This part is how the film opens and despite being humorous and light in tone it isn't anywhere near as entertaining as I was hoping the film would be. After surviving the first part of the film I got to the second and was thrilled to finally get some excitement from the film.That isn't to say the first half is bad it just wasn't anything like I was expecting. Marketed although barely marketed at all as a political thriller the majority of the film isn't that at all. I'll admit that setting up the scenario and characters is nice but doing it in a somewhat confusing and overlong way hurt the finished product.The first part of the film does a decent enough job at setting up the story. We meet our two leads our antagonists but we don't get much in terms of thrills. We find out that Valerie Plame Naomi Watts is a CIA agent and that she is far more ruthless than she first appears. She knows how to get the information that she wants and she utilizes this technique whenever it is required.We also meet her husband Joseph Wilson Sean Penn who is or was an ambassador from the United States. He is sent to Niger not to be confused with Nigeria as the film tells us to find out if it was possible that Iraq was buying things that would make them able to build a nuclear weapon. He discovers that it wasn't and returns home with his report. Valerie is doing her own research regarding this and talks with many different people in Iraq promising them safety in return for information.What I just explained takes well over an hour for the film to show and that's a shame because it does feel like it drags on for too long. The second part involves deceit on the part of the government and Joseph's attempts to clear his family's name. The government decides to completely disregard Joseph's report and declare that Valerie is in the CIAsomething that is apparently not good when said agent is undercover.It is in the second half with Joseph fighting for his family's freedom the tension created from a lying government and the emotional changes in the characters we have gotten to know when the film starts kicking into high gear. Prior to this point there is some amusement in the light hearted nature of the film. There are jokes particularly humorous was one regarding the Toronto Maple Leafs but there isn't much actually going on.Once the second half begins things really start to spiral out of control for Valerie and Joseph. Their marriage starts coming apart they are receiving death threats daily the entire country seems to have turned against them. Things are going wrong and since there was such a large buildup to this point of the film we care about what is happening to our characters. When things start heading south we are saddened by it.This is also helped out by great performances by Watts and Penn who are appearing together in their third film. The previous films being 21 Grams and The Assassination of Richard Nixon. Watts plays her character incredibly seriously and it works shockingly well. She means business and it is apparent right away. Penn is more relaxed despite having the weight of the world on his shoulders for some of the film.The story is actually based on real events detailed in Valerie Plame's memoir Fair Game My Life as a Spy My Betrayal by the White House. How true the movie stays to what actually happens I'm not so sure. It would likely be best to not assume that the film is entirely truthful as with most films liberties have to be taken to make the film compelling for the audience. It would be ignorant to believe that the film is entirely truthful so if you decide to watch Fair Game keep that in mind.Not being entirely familiar with politics American politics in particular I'm not sure as to how much it defaces one side or the other but there is certainly some badmouthing going on. I would almost think that having a film based almost entirely on American politics would make the film less interesting for those not knowledgeable about the subject but thankfully this doesn't happen. The film is still overall fairly enjoyable even if politics aren't your forte.Had it not been for a slow and somewhat confusing opening hour Fair Game would have been an excellent film. The beginning is its only real problem with everything else being topnotch. The acting performances are great the story is interesting once it gets going and you do begin to care about the characters. The setup does its job establishing the characters and setting but it isn't engaging enough to keep the audience's attention. Push past it though and you'll get a great final act with tension suspense and most importantly entertainment.".

It was a subject I knew very little about but the film managed to address that and still make it entertaining and interesting while actually involving the audience in it's subject matter. Fair Game does the same.Taking place in the build up to the Iraq war Naomi Watts plays a CIA agent juggling her dangerous job with her home life. Her husband Played by Sean Penn publishes a paper scrutinizing the Bush administration of their involvement with Iraq and as a consequence his wife's name is leaked to the public. Despite knowing very little of the events leading up to the war in Iraq the film did a good job of familiarizing the audience with the motives behind doing so. Based on real events the film uses everyone's real name within each event that occurs and is not scared to show what it believes in and is trying to represent. Alongside this however we also have the conflict played between Watts and Penn as their beliefs of the American government differ. This story however isn't as strong as the message the film is showing of how governments can make mistakes and be corrupt so plays backbone to what could have made some interesting chemistry.That being said the film is a strong piece and stands up for what it believes in not shying away from any of the details. The fact that this all happened is astonishing and even people who know very little about the Iraq war will still gain and be entertained by the themes of corruption and family.".

White House officials discredit Joe Wilson's Sean Penn's account of the government falsifying information to justify invading Iraq. The abuse of power discovered by these characters is pretty incredible when you have a government that will say practically anything to protect its public image. Lots of drama and factfinding ensues and the movie is both compelling and infuriating at the same time. The dialogue is mature and smart and we draw close into the lives of the married couple who like diamonds seem to be able to strengthen their marriage through the trials of pressure.Valerie Plame Naomi Watts and Joe Wilson Sean Penn are the married couple Plame a CIA agent who's identity is exposed and Wilson who wrote the controversial but truthful piece which lead to the government's destruction of their lives or at least the attempt.

When they scam the rich and beautiful Grey Ellison into believing she backed her Mercedes into Bill they're only hoping for a free meal. But Grey is touched and over the objections of her snotty fiance insist on putting the two up for the night. As they get to know each other Bill becomes convinced that this is where Curly Sue belongs  in a home cared for by someone that can give her the advantages that his homeless nomadic existence lacks. He plans to leave the young girl in the care of Grey and take off.... but Curly Sue has other ideas!";

Alisan porter is a really good actor and i Love that movie Its so funny when she is dealing the cards. Every time i watch that movie at the end of it i cry its so said i know I'm only 13 years old but its such a touching story its really weird thats Alisan is 25 years old now. Every time i watch a movie someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they make it and when u watch it and find out how old the person in the movie really is u wounder how they can go from one age to the next. Like Harry Potter. That movie was also great but still Daniel was about 12 years old in the first movie and i was about 11. SO how could he go from 12 to 16 in about 4 years and I'm only 13. I'm not sure if he is 16 right now i think he is almost 18 but thats kind of weird when u look at one movie and on the next there about 4 years old then u when they were only 1 in the last.I'm not sure i have a big imagination and i like to revile it.I am kind of a computer person but i like to do a lot of kids things also. I am very smart like curly sue in the movie but one thing i don't like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes curly sue get taken away i would kill that guy if he really had done it in real life. Well I'm going to stop writing i know a write a lot sometimes but kids do have a lot in there head that need to get out and if they don't kids will never get to learn.Larissa".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I've finally seen Curly Sue the notorious flop widely considered The Worst John Hughes movie. I was curious but kind of dreading it. I'm not really a fan of Cute Moppet movies and find most child actors irritating.The good news is I found Alisan Porter to be a much more natural child actress than for instance Shirley Temple or the girl who played Annie. Alisan was cute without being obnoxiously cutesy. Most of the time she comes across as a Real Kid instead of one who's been coached too much and never had a normal childhood which often results in creepy andor annoying mannerisms  most child actors just can't act natural. Except for her singing which has that somewhat cheesy Broadway style and sounds overly trained. The way her singing was shoehorned into the script was pretty contrived. Still it's a pity her career didn't take off after this performance... although she might be better off not having become a big star when you consider the messedup lives most child stars lead.As for the movie as a whole... I can understand why it flopped. Sentimental family films are not very popular anymore. I know it's been said by others but Curly Sue really is an oldfashioned movie that feels like it should be set during the Great Depression like Annie and all those Shirley Temple movies were. The fact that it's set in modern times makes it harder for today's audience to accept. Many movies from the 1930s were a mixture of the gritty side of life with downontheirluck characters Homeless drifters! Plucky orphans! in povertytype situations and fairytale wishfulfillment. Audiences needed that at the time when so many were downontheirluck themselves. Having a rich and poor person fall in love despite class differences was another common element in films of the Depression however unlikely this may seem now. When Curly Sue was released this sort of escapist fantasy didn't seem relevant to most viewers I guess.I enjoy many movies from the 1930s40s and I love Frank Capra... as did John Hughes I hear. Capra's idealism is not considered cool today either unfortunately. I don't mean to say that Curly Sue is in the same league as Capra's classics. Jim Belushi is no Jimmy Stewart. Or Bill Murray although he may be trying to do an impression of him since I kept picturing Bill in the role  interesting to read on IMDb that Murray was offered the part first! Belushi's character doesn't ultimately accomplish great things or even attempt to fight the system like most Frank Capra heroes. His lifestyle as a con artist could be seen as rebellion against society but the writing lacks depth. We don't understand why he'd choose to avoid gainful employment and even resort to injuring himself in order to con a free meal out of someone. Not when he displays skills such as pianoplaying. It's not very plausible especially since the movie does not take place during the Great Depression when unemployment was not a choice but an inescapable fact.In it's depiction of women this movie also reminds me of many postWWII movies Hollywood made in an attempt to send women back to the home so they wouldn't take jobs away from the men who had returned after the war. Kelly Lynch's character is a hardhearted careerwoman who instantly melts upon meeting this child and ends up giving up her job in favour of motherhood and marriage. She is not so much depicted as conflicted over the moral problems inherent in being a lawyer specifically as she is portrayed as unfulfilled and unnatural until she becomes more womanly. There is even a subplot where this lawyer counsels a client who is halfheartedly seeking a divorce and switches gears from advising her to bleed her cheating husband dry to supporting the woman's inexplicable desire to stay with the man who doesn't love her and in fact wants to get rid of her. This reminded me of movies from the 1940s such as The Women with their lessthanempowered messages. At least the Hays Code can excuse those films but in this day and age...not so much.I can't argue with people who dislike Curly Sue for being unrealistic or sentimentalsappycorny. Personally I prefer uplifting movies with happy endings and I think more films should be made that the whole family can watch together. However I don't love Curly Sue  maybe because I've seen it's familiar elements done in many other movies and done better. Much of the criticism I've seen I agree with. The pacing is slow. The plot is predictable. The slapstick is too silly and feels out of place. But it's not as bad as I'd expected based on it's reputation. The acting is decent. Nice music. You get to see Viveka Davis the charming actress from Student Exchange! Wish her part was larger. There are far worse films...many of which have a higher rating on IMDb. Still I can't rate it higher than a 4 knocking off some points for the flaws mentioned above and because it's merely average compared to others of it's type... including other John Hughes films which I've found more heartwarming and humorous than Curly Sue. But it's not The Worst John Hughes Movie either  it's better than Weird Science! Don't let my rating discourage you if you're also curious as a John Hughes fan or looking for feelgood family films.".

	schema:headline " Adorable and syrupy sweet";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't think anyone will argue that John Hughes is a modern day film making legend especially for those of us that grew up in the 80's and 90's. He helmed and created stone cold classics like Ferris Bueller's Day Off Sixteen Candles Home Alone Christmas Vacation...you likely know the drill. It could be said that Curly Sue wasn't his best work. However that's not to say it isn't also a great movie. It just isn't as blatantly well made. It is predictable and typical but very 80's despite being released in 1991 and its just fun. It was a movie my wife loved and I realized I had never seen it so we sat down to watch it. It is the definition of a feel good film but there isn't much more than that to it which is okay. It doesn't have anything particularly memorable about it the film is sufficient being complacent in its genre and delivering exactly what anyone should expect. When a movie is like that it tends to get very low scoring from critics professional and otherwise but most of us who just love films can appreciate a genre movie. Curly Sue is safe. Its mostly clean and sweet and has romance and a few fun scenes and its easy to watch and I really enjoyed it!! I have always enjoyed Jim Belushi and he has had some great films but he never really became a Hollywood superstar. He has great charisma and is such an everyday guy that you can't help but love him. That's why he fits this role so well. He's a con artist who adores this little girl and has lived on the streets for however long but you completely understand why someone would fall in love with the guy. A conman with a heart of gold. Alisan Porter is our title character and is of course amazing. She is adorable and street smart and you just love her and its not because she's obnoxious or a trouble maker but just truly a kid who has had a rough life and knows her way around a con or two. The chemistry between her and Belushi is near perfect and definitely the heart and soul of the film. This might not have been a break out hit for her but she'll always be great in it. Kelly Lynch gives a decent performance as the rich elite lawyer who gets a soft spot for these two trouble makers. Lynch's character is a means to an end so she doesn't get a ton of great scenes but she fills her role nicely. Its a very typical role but it works and her and Belushi are good together but not amazing. The supporting cast are all decent as well and fill their roles well especially John Getz as the painfully obvious jerk boyfriend to Lynch. You gotta have a pseudovillain like him in an 80'sish family comedy.The reason John Hughes is considered such a master by some is because he knew his genre. He was a chef of a certain kind and he knew exactly what ingredients his recipes needed and he didn't try to stray too far from it. Curly Sue is presented on a plate with no surprises and as I've said that's great!! It means its not a brilliant film but it is wonderfully entertaining and I could easily watch it again and again. There were more than one heart string pulling scenes and its just written and directed very well. Usually I have a rule about writer's directing their own work but no one had vision about his own work like John Hughes. I honestly think he stopped directing this was actually his last directorial film because his style and vision was distinctly 80's where success was based on monetary value and romance was based on opposites attracting and living happily ever after. He is a fairy tale weaver of a more realistic nature and Curly Sue was delightful and familyfriendly for the most part and I always appreciate that. A wonderful addition to our collection!! 8.510".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't think anyone will argue that John Hughes is a modern day film making legend especially for those of us that grew up in the 80's and 90's. He helmed and created stone cold classics like Ferris Bueller's Day Off Sixteen Candles Home Alone Christmas Vacation...you likely know the drill. It could be said that Curly Sue wasn't his best work. However that's not to say it isn't also a great movie. It just isn't as blatantly well made. It is predictable and typical but very 80's despite being released in 1991 and its just fun. It was a movie my wife loved and I realized I had never seen it so we sat down to watch it. It is the definition of a feel good film but there isn't much more than that to it which is okay. It doesn't have anything particularly memorable about it the film is sufficient being complacent in its genre and delivering exactly what anyone should expect. When a movie is like that it tends to get very low scoring from critics professional and otherwise but most of us who just love films can appreciate a genre movie. Curly Sue is safe. Its mostly clean and sweet and has romance and a few fun scenes and its easy to watch and I really enjoyed it!! I have always enjoyed Jim Belushi and he has had some great films but he never really became a Hollywood superstar. He has great charisma and is such an everyday guy that you can't help but love him. That's why he fits this role so well. He's a con artist who adores this little girl and has lived on the streets for however long but you completely understand why someone would fall in love with the guy. A conman with a heart of gold. Alisan Porter is our title character and is of course amazing. She is adorable and street smart and you just love her and its not because she's obnoxious or a trouble maker but just truly a kid who has had a rough life and knows her way around a con or two. The chemistry between her and Belushi is near perfect and definitely the heart and soul of the film. This might not have been a break out hit for her but she'll always be great in it. Kelly Lynch gives a decent performance as the rich elite lawyer who gets a soft spot for these two trouble makers. Lynch's character is a means to an end so she doesn't get a ton of great scenes but she fills her role nicely. Its a very typical role but it works and her and Belushi are good together but not amazing. The supporting cast are all decent as well and fill their roles well especially John Getz as the painfully obvious jerk boyfriend to Lynch. You gotta have a pseudovillain like him in an 80'sish family comedy.The reason John Hughes is considered such a master by some is because he knew his genre. He was a chef of a certain kind and he knew exactly what ingredients his recipes needed and he didn't try to stray too far from it. Curly Sue is presented on a plate with no surprises and as I've said that's great!! It means its not a brilliant film but it is wonderfully entertaining and I could easily watch it again and again. There were more than one heart string pulling scenes and its just written and directed very well.

This one isn't meant to be taken too seriously the car chases and shootouts are right outta anything Dirty Harry has donebut you know John Singleton sez he intended for this to be a popcorn movie and I agree he has hit the bullseye with this.And that Isaac Hayes score gotta love it! outta  go see it and have fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Samuel L. Jackson seems to be having the time of his movie acting life portraying the title character in Shaft' John Singleton's take on the groundbreaking classic that on its release in 1971 served as the blueprint for all the blaxploitation' films that filled theatres throughout the early and mid 1970's.   Unfortunately the concept of a rogue black cop defying the rules and doing things his own way is not as fresh as it was back in the time of the original film so this new version of Shaft' has less to recommend it.  Still it is an efficient police procedural filled with crowdpleasing moments of adrenalinpumping melodrama hissable villains and a wisecracking kickass hero who seems virtually indestructible  just the way we like our heroes to be in a movie like this.Singleton pays affectionate homage to the original film in many ways. Jackson actually plays the nephew of the original Shaft and indeed Richard Roundtree makes a cameo appearance early on in the film as Jackson's seasoned mentor.  Singleton wisely uses the original Isaac Hayes recording of the hit song as background for the film's opening credit sequence and backs up many of the action scenes with an impressive instrumental interpretation as well.The story offers little that is new for this particular genre whose films often rise or fall based on the quality of the foils against whom the hero must ultimately contend.  Luckily the filmmakers are blessed with not just one but two impressive villains  Jeffrey Wright as Peoples Hernandez a tough talking thug who wants to expand out of the little neighborhood kingdom he has established into the big time of upper class drug dealing and Christian Bale as Walter Wade Jr. the racist spoiledbrat son of a New York City magnate whose hate crime killing of an innocent black man sets the plot in motion and serves as fodder for Shaft's personal vendetta. Bale proves definitively that the quality of subtle soulcringing evil he brought to his role in American Psycho' was no fluke and that he can be as effective in a big budget extravaganza like this one as he is in a smaller scale far more quirky work like Psycho.'  Vanessa Williams on the other hand who plays Shaft's partner and who is almost unrecognizable buried under a dark beret fails to distinguish herself either in her role or in her performance.Then we have Mr. Jackson himself.  Here is a man who slides so effortlessly into the role that despite the absurdity and incredibility of much that is going on around him we never question the film's veracity for a moment. Whether tossing off wisecracks shooting at unarmed criminals pounding defenseless suspects into insensibility or consoling distraught witnesses Shaft remains forever a hero acting out the impulses we in the audience feel but are never able to fully act upon in our daily lives.  Thus this new Shaft' works best as simpleminded good vs. evil melodrama  and even the most sophisticated movie watcher can use a bit of that once in a while.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review is written as a defence of John Singleton's 'homage' to the 2000 edition of Shaft. The majority of people that I know 6 in all use similar terms when referring to it average mediocre IhateBustaRhymes etcetera. However it actually isn't average or mediocre at all although Busta Rhymes is indeed a complete tool. Sure the story is linear predictable and doesn't bring anything new to a tired genre Racial injustice! Rogue cops! Black attitude! but one has to see past that to the performances because that's where the real gold lies. Well three performances to be precise. First Samuel L. Jackson. Though his roles may lack a certain amount of vicissitude they are always entertaining. And he seems to restrain himself as the sex machine to all the chicks. He doesn't actually have sex at all throughout the film which I see as a good thing. As Shaft he receives most of the animated and colourful dialogue kills the most bad guys technically murder seeing as he resigns from the police force at the beginning and gets to wear nine different varieties of the same jacket all the while looking effortlessly cool. Plus he throws a police badge into a wall... really fast! Second Christian Bale. It is no secret that Bale is now objectively the best actor of his generation but come the dawn of the new millennium he had yet to present himself to a wider audience. Unfortunately Shaft failed to do so too. However is performance is superb. Following on from his equivocal turn as Norman Bates in American Psycho 2000 Bale continues his villainous streak as Walter Wade Jr a truly horrible character whose racial attack in a restaurant provides the basis for the story. Really the only word that can describe Wade is ahole and Bale plays this role perfectly. It is rare that one could despise a character this much and that is what makes him so fun to watch.Third Jeffrey Wright. If Shaft had had a better storyline and been more popular Wright's portrayal of drug dealergang leader Peoples Hernandez would have been his magnum opus. His type of method acting is similar to that of Bale's and to see them square off against one another is THE principal reason for watching especially when Wright stabs Bale in the hand. Exciting and bloody. Wright provides entertainment in every scene whether through his exaggerated walk his bastardisation of the English language or simply a facial movement. Plus he induces an element of sympathy for Peoples after his brother is killed at the hands of Shaft of course and provokes the audience into wondering whether his eventual demise was really justified. Really the film should have been called 'Peoples' and he should have had three sequels.So there it is. A short and unconvincing advocate of Shaft based on three exemplary performances. Oh and it features Lynne Thigpen who played the DJ in The Warriors 1979 and as The Warriors is an excellent and highly realistic depiction of New York in the seventies... that means Shaft is also worth watching? Yes it does.".

To claim that Titanic and Saving Private Ryan are masterpiece's is bad enough but Shaft are you joking.Fortunately I saw the movie on TV so I didn't waste any money and I actually turned off before the end as the plot was pointless.  The problem with this movie and the others I have mentioned is you have to have some kind of realism.  Dirty Harry although it stretched the limit slightly it still remained a solid film with very believable characters.  Shaft is Judge Dredd he can beat up and kill whoever he wants break numerous laws and yet is liked and supported by the Police.  The Police who help him for some bizarre loyalty obviously have no other crimes to deal with so just spend there time helping Shaft harass and murder anyone he pleases.SpoilersThe first scene now in front of about 20 people the bad guy' is openly antagonistic and racist he then follows the victim outside on a major street and beats him to death.  Now you're telling me that there was only one witness.  Anyway Shaft then punches the bad guy' twice in front of his superiors and the TV cameras so Shaft would have been arrested on the spot put in prison sued and certainly wouldn't be allowed back on the Police force.Next scene Shaft sees an alleged criminal eating his dinner so he then assaults this man with a basketball and arrests him for no reason.  Hmmm lawsuit discipline procedures.  Now if I tell you both these incidences are just the tip of the iceberg you can see where the film goes from there. Shaft then goes on to murder a number of other people as a civilian with the backing of the local Police force.  I think a riot would ensue.Anyway as I said I didn't get any further.I can only assume the people liking these types of movies just violence and eye candy no story or plausibility are 14 years old and under or people who are much less demanding than me.".

Except that it's all been updated nicely with a feeling of the original sassiness intact. And the Isaac Hayes music is central and terrific making this a legit Shaft movie. Samuel Jackson plays the role perfectly not pulling back and not overdoing it. The idea of a black cop in a city that still has racial biases in this case emphasizing the rise of Latino drug lords as part of the fracturing is mainstreamed here. It's not as daring or shocking to see this pushed forward but it's still effective. Shaft the main character who never seems to have a first name is powerful smart and unwilling to be pushed around by authority. Even if it means losing his job or quittingShaft is always the one making his own choices. The director John Singleton is not especially well positioned for a mainstream sequel with high production values his one famous effort to date is Boyz n the Hood but he pulls it off. This is a snappy smart well made movie. It's oddly mainstream playing with clichs too easily working with bad guy good guy tenets adding only the minor twist of racial or ethnic alliances though even these we've seen before. You can't help but see Jackie Brown from three years earlier as a far more interesting well made and timely movie. That one was by Quentin Tarantino which changes the score a bit but it starred Jackson again and makes the most of him.You might say Singleton makes the most of Jackson here too but a better way to look at it is that Jackson makes the most of Singleton. He takes over the movie and it's a good thing. He has talent and presence in a classic Hollywood acting way. The cast around him is really strong which is nice. There is a cameo by the original director of the 1971 Shaft Gordon Parks in a bar scene if you are luckya white haired older black man at the table.The other terrific actor is Jeffrey Wright playing a drug king with enough realism and panache to make it real and glitzy both. The third main character is the future Batman Christian Bale who is a great bad guy and who you actually miss in the last parts of the movie.What really brings this down to earth and too much so is the story which is boilerplate stuff. There is machismo and guns and a play of one bad guy against another and one cop against another. You might say hey isn't there room for more cop and crime movies that work in familiar circles? Yes. But I again refer to Jackie Brown as a way to see out of this box. This new Shaft is good stuffit's well acted tightly edited directed with professional canny noticeable in lots of different ways and brings up racial clichs in a fun and even important way. It descends by the last third into overused chase and shoot scenes between cops and robbers. But...it's better than its reputation for sure. I say see it. Enjoy the attitudes. The acting. And the homage to the original.".

Sam Jackson plays Shaft's nephew a bigcity cop trying to track down a reluctant witness to a racially motivated murder. The killer played by a sinister preBATMAN Christian Bale is modeled on the New York preppie rapist remember him?. He hires a lowlevel drug dealer Jeffrey Wright to track down the witness a waitress Toni Collette and kill her. Shaft must find her before they do. Jackson is silky smooth the action is right out of a DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON flick and the landscape is populated by some great supporting players including Dan Hedaya as a corrupt cop and Vanessa Williams as a cop who has Shaft's back. The original Shaft Richard Roundtree even pops up a couple of times. This is one wild and funny ride that plays the way we prefer our action films to play. At times it is a little thin on plot but it keeps moving. No blood to speak of just action action and more action. And keep a close eye on Wright a noted stage and screen actor. His softspoken drug lord tenderly holds a newborn baby at one moment and in the next pokes a knife into the neck of a terrified woman. He steals every scene he is in.".

Nothing wrong with that but that way its been portrayed in the movie is so unsubtle so explicit and is ridiculously intentional.

Then everybody I mean everybody once again starts laughing so hard and cheering for our black hero for his oh so innovative come back at the white racist. The white villain is so humiliated that he kills the black guy and absconds.2 Shaft beats up the villain's white ass and takes him to court. Bad guy uses influence to get bail. Everybody I mean every single freaking one who can be seen cries and boos in disappointment. Shaft resigns by embarrassingly throwing his badge at the judge.3 The rest of the plot is about Shaft trying to locate an eyewitness brotha style beating up white boys along the way.4 The white guy is shot in the end by the black martyr's mom. More attempts at drama gone bad.I'm not even white myself but this movie is so explicitly racist that anyone of any race would find it an utter embarrassment to watch. All the drama of blaxploitation is so fake and so insincere that it makes me want to puke. There are no redeeming qualities about this movie too. The action sucks and the dialogue trying to be badass is utterly embarrassing. One of the worst movies ever made.010 stars.".

After the judge sets the bail Shaft becomes enraged and swears he will catch Wade even if he has to do it outside the law. At some point a drug lord named Peoples Hernandez Jeffrey Wright gets involved in the plot providing a new enemy for Shaft and an ally for Wade.Samuel L. Jackson delivers a topnotch performance as usual. Christian Bale really knows how to pull off a villain as he seems threatening in most of the screen time he is given altough one might argue that is just a small echo from his previous big villain role in American Psycho 2000. Jeffrey Wright is also a standout as he provides a magnificent performance as the menacing drug lord Peoples Hernandez. Overall the action was pretty solid and engaging there were some twists and turns that if you weigh them on a scale putting the positive on the one side and the negative on the other I'd say that there is a balance that is slightly turning heavier on the negative side. There were some scenes that just didn't make sense for example an infuriated Shaft throws his badge and nearly hits the judge and gets no punishment? People in movies have been held in contempt gor a lot less. Wade goes into a rough neighborhood unaccompanied with a bag full of cash? Ridiculous. Besides I felt that the ending was a way for the writers to wrap the story up really quick leaving a sensation of rush and abruptness. In this case for me quick equals lazy. Really that ending was disappointing and faulty. But you be the judge I still found an entertaining movie that heavily relies on the acting to be barely sustainable because without Samuel L. Jackson Jeffrey Wright and Christian Bale I would have probably given this movie a 5 star rating. Oh am I forgetting something? Yes! Isaac Hayes' theme song is back although we know that the lyrics talk about Shaft and his women but there were no women to be found around Shaft on this movie besides Carmen Vazquez played by Vanessa Williams. And Busta Rhymes kills it as the comic relief and Shaft's trusting friend Rasaan.".

You can take or leave the homeboyishness  I think it's actually diluted for a mainstream audience. What's less comfortable given this mainstreaming is that Shaft's unorthodox methods not only rulebreaking but invariably threatening people with violence meet no resistance. He's no antihero he's just a hero  even when he's knocking out a riotact reading superior or nipping a youthful drug dealer in his bud. Not only is it morally questionable it's also a bit boring. There's no danger to it no frisson if everyone thinks it's OK to pistol whip a teenager for the sake of a woman's smile.A simple film. 410".

Just imagining what his family and friends could have been thinking during the whole ordeal is tough to fathom but when his wife is there with him in Pakistan pregnant with his first child your heart must go out to them. Pearl's widow Mariane used her journalistic skills to write a novel on what transpired from his kidnapping to eventual murder. Her words are I'm sure haunting and filled with an unbearable amount of love both lost and strengthened. To have the courage to allow that story be told to the world is amazing. Director Michael Winterbottom is definitely the man to be trusted with such material and he does not let us down here with A Mighty Heart.Being a story of nonfiction that so many people know it takes a bit of craft and ingenuity to make it fresh and interesting to the audience. Winterbottom as a result shoots the film handheld and upclose with numerous cutins of actual news footage for added realism. The editing of documentary stock with the actors portraying our leads both in the present and in flashbacks to the past is expertly handled. There are no missteps visually at all as Winterbottom knows how to evoke emotion with economy. When the men on the search for Pearl finally confront the atrocity it is in their reactions to the video that makes us understand the brutality. We don't need to be shown the carnage because the faces of these men say it all.Give credit to Angelina Jolie for coming into this project with dedication and professionalism. Her real life persona is nonexistent as she is fully taken over by Mariane Pearl. Her accent is impeccable especially watching scenes where emotions take over and yet the accent still never falters. She embodied the strength that allowed Pearl to deal with the days and weeks desperately seeking answers. It all culminates in a heartwrenching moment of grief and release of all the feelings she refused to let take over until absolutely necessary. I was completely impressed by her performance.The other actors are fantastic as well. Dan Futterman plays Danny Pearl with integrity and love he was a fearless man who believed in his job and the search for truth. Irfan Khan follows up his brilliant turn in The Namesake with another solid role as the police captain and Denis O'Hare Will Patton and Archie Panjabi are wonderful as others trying their hardest to get through it all. This is not a vanity project for Jolie as there is a good portion in the middle of the film where she disappears. The movie's supporting cast does an admirable job in never letting it falter without the one character in the middle of it all.Much like United 93 A Mighty Heart is a story that is tough to experience but also one needing to be seen. There are few things that I can say went wrong with the film and although I may never have the necessity to view it again I'm glad I took the time to sit down with this tale of hope compassion and life in the midst of devastating tragedy.".

	schema:headline " The Might of Truth";
	schema:reviewBody "Telling the truth is generally considered to be the first step on the path to righteousness. It brings redemption to some and relieves the guilt of others. Many people have a hard time accepting the truth when faced with it. That difficulty in dealing is perhaps the main reason some run far away from the truth altogether. Given how troubling facing the truth can be in everyday reality being subjected to it in celluloid on the big screen is a very hard sell. This is even more relevant when the film in question is based on an event that was played out to the point of emotional exhaustion in the media. Just ask the producers of UNITED 93. This is the plight of A MIGHTY HEART an adaptation of Mariane Pearl's novel of the same name about her experiences during the search for her kidnapped husband Daniel Pearl in the winter of 2002. For director Michael Winterbottom this is only the beginning though. Assuming he manages to get people to see the film casting Angelina Jolie in the role or Marian Pearl certainly doesn't hurt the film's chances Winterbottom must then get people to forget that they know how it's all going to end.Winterbottom is too smart to go against the grain. Instead he uses the audience's prior knowledge of the story to incite an even deeper emotional reaction. He begins by establishing his style. A MIGHTY HEART is not a documentary but rather a fictionalized reenactment of actual events that is shot and edited like a documentary. There are no talking heads but the camera is an active participant in the drama that unfolds. Handheld movement jump cuts and an omnipresent observer's point of view lend realism to the film's already tense premise. For those who aren't aware JewishAmerican journalist Daniel Pearl played here by CAPOTE scribe Dan Futterman was kidnapped in Pakistan in January of 2002. The violent act became an international scandal as the group that claimed responsibility for the crime demanded the liberation of prisoners from American detainee prison Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The American government does not give in to the terrorists' demands. It doesn't end well. The film focuses on the efforts made by Mariane the Pakistani police the C.I.A. and the journalistic community throughout the search for Daniel. Knowing Daniel doesn't live through the ordeal and that this search is fruitless may leave the audience without hope but the dedication and fervor with which the case is attacked carries enough hope to inspire an overwhelming sympathy that sinks our hearts when what we know is coming actually comes. A blustering soundscape and tightly framed street and crowd shots elevate stress levels to unimagined heights. Mariane is alone in a foreign country searching for the most important person in her life. Knowing the odds are against her holding on to hope becomes all the more complicated when she is surrounded by strangers traffic and the sounds of incessant honking cell phones and random farm animals. The chaos is absolutely inescapable. Yet still Mariane must remain calm. After all she is the heart of this operation. If her heart fails all hope is lost and all efforts will fall apart. Jolie exhibits both outer strength and inner fragility at the same time as Mariane. She is direct and focused in face of this horrific reality holding it together for Daniel herself and her unborn child but Jolie's distant eyes and suddenly fidgeted demeanor suggest just how difficult maintaining all this composure truly is.

	onyx:emotionText "Telling the truth is generally considered to be the first step on the path to righteousness. It brings redemption to some and relieves the guilt of others. Many people have a hard time accepting the truth when faced with it. That difficulty in dealing is perhaps the main reason some run far away from the truth altogether. Given how troubling facing the truth can be in everyday reality being subjected to it in celluloid on the big screen is a very hard sell. This is even more relevant when the film in question is based on an event that was played out to the point of emotional exhaustion in the media. Just ask the producers of UNITED 93. This is the plight of A MIGHTY HEART an adaptation of Mariane Pearl's novel of the same name about her experiences during the search for her kidnapped husband Daniel Pearl in the winter of 2002. For director Michael Winterbottom this is only the beginning though. Assuming he manages to get people to see the film casting Angelina Jolie in the role or Marian Pearl certainly doesn't hurt the film's chances Winterbottom must then get people to forget that they know how it's all going to end.Winterbottom is too smart to go against the grain. Instead he uses the audience's prior knowledge of the story to incite an even deeper emotional reaction. He begins by establishing his style. A MIGHTY HEART is not a documentary but rather a fictionalized reenactment of actual events that is shot and edited like a documentary. There are no talking heads but the camera is an active participant in the drama that unfolds. Handheld movement jump cuts and an omnipresent observer's point of view lend realism to the film's already tense premise. For those who aren't aware JewishAmerican journalist Daniel Pearl played here by CAPOTE scribe Dan Futterman was kidnapped in Pakistan in January of 2002. The violent act became an international scandal as the group that claimed responsibility for the crime demanded the liberation of prisoners from American detainee prison Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The American government does not give in to the terrorists' demands. It doesn't end well. The film focuses on the efforts made by Mariane the Pakistani police the C.I.A. and the journalistic community throughout the search for Daniel. Knowing Daniel doesn't live through the ordeal and that this search is fruitless may leave the audience without hope but the dedication and fervor with which the case is attacked carries enough hope to inspire an overwhelming sympathy that sinks our hearts when what we know is coming actually comes. A blustering soundscape and tightly framed street and crowd shots elevate stress levels to unimagined heights. Mariane is alone in a foreign country searching for the most important person in her life. Knowing the odds are against her holding on to hope becomes all the more complicated when she is surrounded by strangers traffic and the sounds of incessant honking cell phones and random farm animals. The chaos is absolutely inescapable. Yet still Mariane must remain calm. After all she is the heart of this operation. If her heart fails all hope is lost and all efforts will fall apart. Jolie exhibits both outer strength and inner fragility at the same time as Mariane. She is direct and focused in face of this horrific reality holding it together for Daniel herself and her unborn child but Jolie's distant eyes and suddenly fidgeted demeanor suggest just how difficult maintaining all this composure truly is. Being a journalist herself Mariane's most endearing quality is perhaps her ability to remain hopeful in spite of all the horror she has known in her own career without coming across as nave. Jolie's balancing act upon such a tightly wound rope is truly genuine in both its intention and execution.Any movie entitled A MIGHTY HEART cannot spend all its time entrenched in fact. After all there is a delicate growing love between Daniel and Mariane that is also being held prisoner. This love though cannot be held captive and gives life to hope.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an intimate film. Basically a love story set in the political wreckage after the attack on the World Trade Center.

It's the story of a couple who find themselves being used by terrorists and whether it is mere coincidence because they are Westerners or whether more specific points are being made because Daniel Pearl is Jewish aren't really explored a wide variety of explanations are offered. Instead as a backdrop to the suspense and the couple's relationship we get a visual poem of life in Islamabad and Karachi which I found beautiful fascinating and more than just a little frightening. These are not cities for people with claustrophobia.With the story beginning the day of Daniel Pearl's kidnapping his character is fleshed out only through flashback or what others say about him as well as the devotion of all who search to rescue him. I doubt few will go to this film without knowing the outcome. I suppose some fans of Ms. Jolie might attend and find themselves unaware of the events portrayed in the movie. So Winterbottom has his work cut out for him since most in the audience know the conclusion.As Mariane Pearl Angelina Jolie gives a remarkable restrained performance. Her face is a mask and emotion is communicated almost exclusively through her eyes. It's the gift of a remarkable talent for the screen. I don't know how anyone could have been better. Others in the cast too are notable Archie Panjabi holds her own with Jolie whenever they're together on the screen. It's a particularly complicated role since she becomes the target of the Pakistani press as the reason for Pearl's abduction and her guilt bafflement and frustration give the film added suspense. And Irfan Khan the pivotal Pakistani investigatorin a role that could have been clichdbrings an urgency to his character that earned my sympathy for succeeding in what must have been an impossible task. The film opens with Mariane Pearl describing Karachi as the World's second largest city and her husband was trying to meet with one manhow impossible it must be to find a single person in such a large place. That proves prophetic as Irfan Kahn then has to find Daniel Pearl.The growing alarm of the first night of Pearl's abduction is particularly well done by both the director and actors.I'm a little shocked by others' comment here that the Pearl's shouldn't have been doing what they were doing or because they put themselves in a dangerous situation we should somehow feel less sympathetic. I'm ashamed that such comments could be made in the face of this tragedy.".

However I don't believe that that's what 'The Mighty Heart' is about. This isn't a from birth till death biopic. It particular looks at how the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl affects his wife and the people who desperately attempt to save him. It is more a character driven film rather than plotoriented.'The Mighty Heart' also succeeds because it goes against stereotype and the actors do a fascinating job of bringing them to screen. Mariane Pearl remains calm focused and controlled throughout the entire chaotic ordeal. It is only upon hearing the news of her husband's fate that she explodes otherwise she keeps her cool all through even after Pearl's death she is composed and hopeful rather than broken down. Captain is an officer with genuine intentions to save Pearl. He's a practicing Muslim and not a Western hater. He loves his job is passionate about it and his country and is revolted by what the terrorists have done. What makes the characters and their actions more effective is the fact that they were based on real people. Granted that 'The Mighty Heart' is a fictionalized account rather than a documentary but that does not take away the essence of how these people went about such a horrifying situation.Winterbottom's directorial approach in presenting this account is commendable. It would have been very easy to make this look like a docudrama or a melodramatic farce but instead he cleverly manages to keep it well balanced and the emotions under control but still visible to the viewer. The viewer views the film like a concerned outsider. And even though we know the outcome we are concerned and overwhelmingly sympathetic for Mariane and her baby for the team putting their efforts day and night to save her husband and for Daniel.The various camerawork handheld closeups jump cuts is impeccable. The glimpses and sounds of the heated and crowded Pakistani streets add to the tension. The characters react to a ringing cellphone expecting hope only to be let down.Angelina Jolie dons a new simpler look and gives a very spirited performance. Her calmness and patience displays her strength but her eyes reveal a hint of despair and vulnerability. Archie Punjabi does an equally superb job as Daniel's friend. She skillfully downplays Asra's frustration guilt and concern. The building friendship between Asra and Mariane is well demonstrated by these two actresses. In a way 'A Mighty Heart' is about these two strong women who are brought close together by this ordeal. Irfan Khan delivers a wonderfully restrained performance and he shows his character's compassion determination and frustration with remarkable ease. The supporting cast that includes Will Patton and Dan Futterman does an overall good job.'A Mighty Heart' is a sincere account of a true tragic event. It's a strong woman's story of hope. Even after having gone through such a traumatic experience Marianne comes out of it with her head high. She remains strong and patient. She does not turn hostile towards the Pakistani. In fact she is aware that many unfortunate Pakistanis have experienced similar fate and expresses her compassion. She does not go on hating the world or the authorities. She is thankful and appreciative of all those who have fought with her. Remarkable.".

And it will probably be the most controversial this whole year saddled as it is with political implications that could make it the target of activists on both the left and the right.Surprisingly enough the movie is almost politics free. The basic story we all know. Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl disappears while trying to tie up one last interview about terrorism while on assignment in Pakistan. From there his pregnant wife Mariane their close friends and various branches of various governments pull out all the stops to find him but don't get there in time. Pearl is beheaded by his terrorist captors.While the questions about politics could have dominated this story it is much more of a police procedural focusing for the most part on how you track down criminals in a city as crowded as Karachi Pakistan. And incidentally the film does a magnificent job of creating a time and place in an Asian city most Americsns know nothing about.Politics hardly comes into play although the story does touch on the topic at various places along the way noting Pearl was a Jew in a country that was a hotbed for Islamic extremism that there are consequences to US policies around the world including the operation of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay Cuba. But the politics virtually fly by in this film.For its actually the story of Mariane Pearl and how she holds up as she takes a very active role in the search for her husband but must take it from her home because she is very pregnant with their first child and can't go out and kick in doors herself.The real political fireworks here are over the performance of Angelina Jolie. Many of us have long suspected that she is among the best actresses around today but her talent is too often buried in mindless spectacle films.Here Jolie delivers not her standard tough girl performance a staple of her early career but a very nuanced portrayal of a woman who has to be strong in order to lead the effort to free her husband. So she holds it in  literally everything including at one point her urine. That makes her occasional explosions very expected. But the final eruption when she learns her husband really has been murdered is one of the most shattering scenes in recent film memory.Some people though won't like this picture because they don't like Jolie for all kinds of reasons. Some spout nonsense about her not being black yet playing a woman who is black even though the real life Mariane Pearl is French considers herself of multiethnic background and asked Angelina to play her. Others on the right attack Jolie for everything from adopting orphaned kids to visiting war refugee camps all of which they associate with liberal Hollywood and thus adoption and caring about refugees must be evil.Hopefully most people will ignore both sides for this picture is more about how one stands up in times of crisis than anything else. If this movie was a crisis Jolie stands up well. She'll probably get a best actress nomination for this role and she deserves it. See the movie.".

When the terrible news finally comes out that Mariane's husband has been slaughtered mercilessly the screaming of Angelina Jolie is so realistic and painful that it brought instant tears to my eyes.In short A beautiful homage to a horrifying true story with a terrific Angelina Jolie.";

She does not accept murder as a means of making a political statement. Her character never judged anyone for the kidnapping or the murder of her husband. And that is the message to walk out with. Terrorists seem to think that they can send messages through murder and torture but if you open your eyes and see beyond that you will be able to discover that what these horrible people are depending on is that you and I will fall to their level and start thinking of murder as a political message.

The main question for the director Michael Witterbottom was to find the right representation of the reality he depicts. And the choices he made for the movie are both logical and disturbing.Mariane Pearl as her husband is a journalist and the first form the movie adopts in order to deal with the complex reality of the world is a journalistic style with a camera always on the move. It really looks like a war reportage for television that sticks to the events and to the characters in an emergency's style. But surprisingly this realistic aesthetic also reminds a famous fiction's show about terrorism  24.

If the goals of the directors are not the same 24 only wants to be entertaining A Mighty Heart wants to be more... and the depiction of terrorism differs 24 is a show about fear A mighty heart avoids a fear treatment it's the same need to show every aspects of a situation that creates this similarities in the urge of the mise en scene.And this depiction of reality that gives an objectivity feeling to the movie is a little bit strange when you come to consider that the movie is firstly an individually and personal point of view on a situation. An between the two opposite points of view the subjective story of Mariane Pearl and the objectivity of the 24 reality representation Witterbottom seems to have some difficulty to choose. It really gives to the movie an annoying ambiguous point of view where you're unable to really understand the nature of the images you're watching. And that's an important question in this kind of movie.This ambiguity is quite surprising for Winterbottom seemed to have chosen his style in his previous movies. For a completely different subject the musical English scene from the Punk to the Techno in Manchester in 24 Hours Party People he clearly made his the Ford's sentence about reality that you find in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence  When the legend becomes fact print the legend. And this lack of a strong orientation in A Mighty Heart also gives the unpleasant feeling to watch the spectacle of a life more than a testimony about it and to be an intruder in Mariane Pearl's intimacy even if the movie claims the contrary.".

To me it was not.This film was not able to touch me the attempt of being emotionally touching was way too obvious it was not intellectually challenging the message is simple and mundane it was never funny and there was no real tension because it was very slow and the film leaves the public absolutely uninformed about the odds for some plot change. Which never comes.Summarized this could have been nice as a short movie 30 minutes at max that shows the story as it is somewhat tragic yet uncomplicated. As a viewer I registered what happened but the events had no function in the greater whole. They were simply events. Rather irrelevant ones really.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film and I really liked. The story is very well told from the point of view of a professional journalist who has to experience with integrity and courage the whole process of losing her husband. I think Angelina Jolie makes AN EXCELLENT JOB. Many times I forgot was the sexy actress and reminded me several great parts she have achieved in her career including an Academy award. There is not any importance or relevance that she is a white woman developing an African woman... She is an actress. Until when we are going to play with racial issue.

The story is very well told from the point of view of a professional journalist who has to experience with integrity and courage the whole process of losing her husband. I think Angelina Jolie makes AN EXCELLENT JOB. Many times I forgot was the sexy actress and reminded me several great parts she have achieved in her career including an Academy award. There is not any importance or relevance that she is a white woman developing an African woman... She is an actress. Until when we are going to play with racial issue.

	schema:headline " Respectful Treatment Of A Tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Essentially what we have here is a pretty well done seemingly step by step account of the investigation into the kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002 which of course ended with his tragic murder. It is not without weaknesses. Primarily watching close to two hours about an investigation that doesn't seem to be going anywhere and eventually accomplishes nothing gets a bit dry after a while  especially because we know how this is going to end. There comes a point when you just want to fast forward through it to the end. Having said that the strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses.Director Michael Winterbottom does a pretty good job of establishing atmosphere. From the very beginning the chaotic nature of Karachi sets a foreboding tone to the movie and although I sometimes find archival footage in movies to be of little use in A Mighty Heart I thought Winterbottom did a pretty good job of blending the archival stuff particularly clips of Colin Powell and Pervez Musharaff into the story. Throughout the movie the viewer wonders how Pearl's murder is going to be portrayed and again kudos to Winterbottom. In fact and thankfully the murder isn't portrayed at all. What we see are the reactions of those who see the video for the first time and their reactions to the ghastly scene on the tape is sufficient to establish what happened. There was to me at least an interesting scene that lasted only a couple of minutes dealing with a typical ugly American female FBI agent who bursts into the Pearl home ignores the Pakistani authorities tries to take charge and orders the room cleared because she gets a phone call she wants no one else to hear. She disappears immediately after this scene and was never seen again. I just for some reason found it rather typical of how I would expect U.S. authorities to act in a foreign country and her portrayal was of course balanced by the very sympathetic portrayal of the kindhearted Randall Bennett Will Randall  an official from the U.S. Embassy who provides great support to Mariane Pearl.Angelina Jolie was I understand a bit of a controversial choice for the part largely for ethnic reasons but she put on an excellent performance as Mariane hopelessly lost in the situation pregnant with Daniel's baby and totally dependent on others to try to save her husband. Her reaction to the news of Daniel's death was raw with emotion. Ethnic controversy aside no one can deny that Jolie was superb in this role. Her performance and Winterbottom's direction make the movie worthwhile. 810".

There is not a single scene of Jolie in which u r not aware she is the beautiful icon. You can see why she wanted the part Happy nervous sad anguished all the emotional range an actress could dream for each with her perfect curls and lighting to show her beauty. The movie is a whirlwind of frenzied cuts which show life in Kerachi but there's nothing else really leads phone calls emails we all know what the end will be so ultimately there's really nothing here outside of Jolie's beautiful face. Not only is there no controversy it's relatively tame Jolie utters some nonsense about misery giving rise to Muslim extremism. It's the extremism that gives rise to the misery dear. There's no relationship between poverty and radical Islam. Lastly by leaving out the beheading the movie sanitizes itself and makes Pearl's death less than it was. The death itself was something Pearl could give as example of Islamic madness but there's no guts here. No great acting either. Jolie is MORE than Mrs. Pearl she is Angelina Jolie swamping the role with her presence and having a great time acting while looking beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Daniel Pearl was of course the foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal who was kidnapped and brutally executed by a group of Muslim jihadists whom he had sought out for an interview in early 2002. His wife Marianne also a journalist and pregnant with their child at the time later went on to publish a chronicle of that event appropriately entitled A Mighty Heart. Adapted by John Orloff and starring Angelina Jolie and Dan Futterman in the principal roles the movie of the same name chronicles the efforts of Marianne and those around her to uncover her husband's whereabouts and to try to rescue him before the terrorists have the chance to make good on their threat to liquidate him if their demands  for improved conditions for the prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay  are not met. Directed by Michael Winterbottom the movie does a solid job recreating the stepbystep process by which those working on the case were able to identify and even apprehend some of the captors. But so intent is the movie on exploring every last detail of the search that the characters themselves tend to fall by the wayside at times. This includes Marianne who beautifully as Jolie embodies her often winds up being shunted off to the side when she should be taking center stage and making us care deeply about her and the plight she is facing. The format of the story is such that we are given only brief glimpses of Marianne and Daniel together and in each case they are invariably shown as deliriously happy and passionately in love which no doubt they were but it doesn't allow for much shading or depth in the relationship.The movie is of course heartbreaking in its final scenes as the story works its way to its foreordained tragic conclusion and Marianne is left to pick up the pieces of her shattered life. Yet the extraordinary courage that both Daniel and Marianne display in being willing to put their own lives at risk in confronting the injustices of the world leaves the audience with a feeling of hope for the future.Thus despite its weaknesses of characterization and drama A Mighty Heart still manages to move us in the end.".

	schema:headline " Endless drag and stiff drama";
	schema:reviewBody "A film subject dealing with true events that happened in this existing environment of this world can be too sensitive. And Mr. Winterbourne has indeed taken a brave decision by deciding to make this film and that should be commended. But braveness alone does not matter the feasibility of making this film should be known. Whether a story is feasible to be shown as a feature film or as a documentary is also to be seen. And this story with all its restrictions just wasn't worth. It was self righteous and self indulgent in the part of Angelina Jolie.The story sure would have been a great current event thriller about the kidnapping and murdering of Jewish born wall street journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan. But the intention of the movie was much more noble. It was a tribute to the fighting spirit of the then pregnant Mariane Pearl. So the focus of the film was on her life at the time of her husband's kidnapping in Pakistan's port city of Karachi than to the investigation and searching of the kidnapped Daniel pearl. Hence after the kidnapping of Daniel in the beginning of the movie the story is mainly told in Mariane's affluent bungalow in Karachi. Hence there isn't much scope for a tight grip to the proceedings. The first half drags with only the daily briefings of the investigator to Mariane at her house along with her own flashback memories of her husband. The second half of the movie does have few thrills in its first few reels as Indian actor Irfan Khan playing the captain of the Pakistani antiterrorist squad takes over with his squad's chaotic investigation and encounters through the bylines of Karachi. But those moments are few and quiet late due to the time constraints posed by the actual events. Hence the movie mostly depended on the effect the investigation had on Mariane's life and how she handled it which after a while became a drag and routine for Mariane's character which after every shocking news would go in the backyard to spell few times the Fword. In any event the movie ends up being mishmash with the director's fruitless efforts of having few thrills in this stiff drama which was a documentation of the actual events following the kidnapping. An investigative thriller focusing on the involvement of the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI in the kidnapping would have been worth.But what hurts and affects the movie most is the casting of Angelina Jolie as Daniel Pearl's wife Mariane. She proves to be too larger than life for this role which had very few emotions to depict. An unknown face could have saved the movie but not its business prospects which anyway doomed and would have brought credibility to the character. Jolie while trying to get under her character's skin ended up stifling her acting prowess which was dying to come out. Jolie was stiff and her face was not expressing much which was important due to lack of dialog's in her role. Jolie's own intention of producing the film and casting herself in the lead must be scrutinized the most as it seems the script was written with the intentions of pushing her own humanitarian image  as the drag ending proves it in the public and film fraternity domain which just proved fatal and wasn't of any good for the movie. As for rest of the cast they have nothing challenging to perform in the film except for Irfan Khan who though fails to rescue the film with his half baked character but is the only one coming out of this film unhurt with his commendable performance.The whole film overall was made with good intention except for Miss Jolie's but without much direction to it and the film ends up with its future doomed like Daniel's life in the entire movie.".

	schema:headline " A Mighty Star Turn";
	schema:reviewBody "Well it was certainly not as bad as I expected.The director has made some really good movies and most of this movie is good sometimes really good. Interestingly shot a great palette of hyper crowded Pakistani cities strange sights not lingered over but shown to give a real sense to the movie goer of what it is like to be there. Actually there though sitting in a seat in a multiplex among about twenty others in a quarter filled theater. And a decent script I never read Marianne Pearl's book so I don't know how much is fact or fiction some well rounded characters some good acting where you lose yourself in the scene and character and the movie does what good movies should and must do. A Pakistani police captain who is especially good and an American CIA agent who is not painted in the classic two dimensions of evil that is the template for anything having to do with the CIA in contemporary movies.Yes he is caused to smirk and sometimes smile in deep satisfaction as the Pakistani security forces are able to Jack Baur suspects and cause fear merely through questions but he too is made through acting script and direction a human rather than just light on a screen.As a side note you can go to You Tube and see the actual CIA agent involved in a lengthy interview describing what you are about to see on screen and he is an impressive presence and makes you feel as if there are some Americans out there doing their jobs competently in the War on Terror.The problem with the movie is Angelina Jolie. The movie misses greatness because ultimately it is a star turn more than it is an honest movie about a good man's slaughtering and police procedural of the rescue attempts and how his killers were pursued. I have thought for a long time that Angelina no longer looks remotely human and perhaps is an alien. In close ups one wonders first at what's left from her parents DNA then at the skill of her surgeon s and then when even surgical skill seems incapable of producing what we see on screen one wonders about circuit boards and UFOs and whether she is more Fem Bot or more similar to the female assassin in Mars Attacks.There is no remaining part of Angelina Jolie that is possible in nature. Her presence on the screen is disconcerting she sucks the life out of a scene as we wonder at her all. In A 'Mighty Heart' this is especially true as she portrays a mixed race French woman with a southern Vesuvian accent. A nine month pregnant alien not a refugee from Rosemary's Baby but supposedly carrying the child of the mighty heart whose heart is stilled by Islamic terrorists and may or not have been found in one of the ten parts of his body that they carved from what was once a seemingly wonderful man after making him confess that he was a Jew and the son of Jewish parent before sawing his head off with a knife live on video.But when that moment arrives on film we are not shown his agony or the reality of what happens when the Enlightenment the Renaissance liberality humanism Western thought civilization all that we take for granted as being the world we inhabit collide with the fanaticism of a religion expressed by some in 9th Century terms.

	onyx:emotionText "Well it was certainly not as bad as I expected.The director has made some really good movies and most of this movie is good sometimes really good. Interestingly shot a great palette of hyper crowded Pakistani cities strange sights not lingered over but shown to give a real sense to the movie goer of what it is like to be there. Actually there though sitting in a seat in a multiplex among about twenty others in a quarter filled theater. And a decent script I never read Marianne Pearl's book so I don't know how much is fact or fiction some well rounded characters some good acting where you lose yourself in the scene and character and the movie does what good movies should and must do. A Pakistani police captain who is especially good and an American CIA agent who is not painted in the classic two dimensions of evil that is the template for anything having to do with the CIA in contemporary movies.Yes he is caused to smirk and sometimes smile in deep satisfaction as the Pakistani security forces are able to Jack Baur suspects and cause fear merely through questions but he too is made through acting script and direction a human rather than just light on a screen.As a side note you can go to You Tube and see the actual CIA agent involved in a lengthy interview describing what you are about to see on screen and he is an impressive presence and makes you feel as if there are some Americans out there doing their jobs competently in the War on Terror.The problem with the movie is Angelina Jolie. The movie misses greatness because ultimately it is a star turn more than it is an honest movie about a good man's slaughtering and police procedural of the rescue attempts and how his killers were pursued. I have thought for a long time that Angelina no longer looks remotely human and perhaps is an alien. In close ups one wonders first at what's left from her parents DNA then at the skill of her surgeon s and then when even surgical skill seems incapable of producing what we see on screen one wonders about circuit boards and UFOs and whether she is more Fem Bot or more similar to the female assassin in Mars Attacks.There is no remaining part of Angelina Jolie that is possible in nature. Her presence on the screen is disconcerting she sucks the life out of a scene as we wonder at her all. In A 'Mighty Heart' this is especially true as she portrays a mixed race French woman with a southern Vesuvian accent. A nine month pregnant alien not a refugee from Rosemary's Baby but supposedly carrying the child of the mighty heart whose heart is stilled by Islamic terrorists and may or not have been found in one of the ten parts of his body that they carved from what was once a seemingly wonderful man after making him confess that he was a Jew and the son of Jewish parent before sawing his head off with a knife live on video.But when that moment arrives on film we are not shown his agony or the reality of what happens when the Enlightenment the Renaissance liberality humanism Western thought civilization all that we take for granted as being the world we inhabit collide with the fanaticism of a religion expressed by some in 9th Century terms. No the director decides or is forced to turn to his star and give the movie goer the scene that she and her boyfriendproducer hope will be the winning clip used just before the acceptance speech for best actress in next year's Oscar ceremony.It is almost pornographic and the camera and boom mike linger over it all and I sat there and wondered why are we hearing her rehearsed and acted screams of agony and pain while the real agony and pain of a real person Daniel Pearl graduate of Stanford University standup journalist and soon to be a father why his murder on tape his actual butchering is understated to the level of a passing incident with a raised eyebrow or two and a reddening of a face and I think I recall an epithet...maybe?Angelina an alien in distress the classic star turn the dailies parsed and screams and cries done again and again the film cut for Oscar effects and for Oscar viewers.

And I really thought that Futterman Panjabi Jolie and Khan's acting were exceptional! They handled difficult material with grace and heart and it shows in their performances. I hope to see Oscor nods for all four actors! This movie is a good movie to remember Daniel Pearl by and what true journalism really is investigative reporting not tabloid reporting. There is great journalism out there and we can see that through this movie. The sad fact is that many journalists especially those reporting from the MiddleEast lose their lives for reporting the things they uncover. This movie is a tribute to those journalists as well in my opinion.I really liked the scenes in which Mariane Asra Captain and their colleagues were collaborating with each other to try to find Danny because it shows that we can all get along no matter what our background and I feel this movie showed that very well. I didn't know whether this was a spoiler warning or not so I checked off spoiler warning just in caseUnfortunately for many people it seems that politics underscores their critical evaluation of this movie. This is the same debate as with the politics of the movie Munich 2005. Some people with extreme political opinions just do not like a balanced view and actively attack it. I can understand critical negative opinion of this movie based on good thoughtful criticism but I have read some really vile criticisms which had little to do with the movie and more with people's political biases. However I am glad to see that people with a balanced and sensitive view to world politics still get their movies made. It is obvious that people will attack the movie and even Ms.Jolie as I had the misfortune to read for reasons other than the critical merits of the film or the merits of her acting but rather her person and their political bias which is quite sad in my opinion.Kudos for everyone working on this film for having the courage to make this film the way Mariane Pearl and the crew envisioned it!".

This film is about the solo venture of Sting after separating from The Police into what became his firstif I'm not mistaken solo album 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles'. I've been an avid fan of Sting's music especially since I heard his album 'The Soul Cages'. What I like about his music is the timeless and universal quality of his lyrics the uniqueness of each and every song and at the same time a certain underlying uniformity of thought and tone. Listening to his music is like meditation...it's cathartic. I don't think there is any one aspect of human nature and human life he hasn't touched upon in his music. For this reason watching this film was really quite incredible. Paris where Sting performed and rehearsed lends its own charm and personality to the film. There are funny moments as when these bunch of tourists are led by a tourist guide into the room of the chateau in which Sting and his band are rehearsing and the guide is telling them about the portraits hung on the walls! The sequence of the birth of Sting's son in the hospital to the tune of 'Russians' is the emotional high point of the film. The interview with Sting gives an insight into the mind of this complex man and musician. Altogether an Experience!!".

	schema:reviewBody "When this first came out 20 years ago I wasn't convinced Sting was as good as some and he would have us believe. After watching it however I had no doubts that this guy was a musical genius. Arrogant at times but more often confident he gambled his future on going solo departing from perhaps the best rock group of its or any other time the Police and then rolled the dice again by allowing a film crew to capture the evolution of his new band from its inception. Shot on location primarily in and around Paris the documentarymusicconcert is full of revealing footage showing the master at work as he directs his accomplished charges down a new path. The video is also filled thanks to the wonderfully adroit editing of director Michael Apted with light and spontaneous moments banter and jockeying as the musicians get to know themselves both as professionals and as people. In addition candid and sometimes unpredictable interviews with Sting the players the band's manager photographer and others are strategically spliced into the body of the work. Fortunately free of the tantrums or heated exchanges so common in today's reality TV this is nonetheless as authentic a portrait of music life behind the scenes as exists anywhere. The triumphant culmination is the concert where Sting unveils the band as well as his new material to an enthusiastic French audience. There are some surprises along the way a questionable shot or two but overall this is a real treat and one of its kind.".

Arrogant at times but more often confident he gambled his future on going solo departing from perhaps the best rock group of its or any other time the Police and then rolled the dice again by allowing a film crew to capture the evolution of his new band from its inception. Shot on location primarily in and around Paris the documentarymusicconcert is full of revealing footage showing the master at work as he directs his accomplished charges down a new path. The video is also filled thanks to the wonderfully adroit editing of director Michael Apted with light and spontaneous moments banter and jockeying as the musicians get to know themselves both as professionals and as people. In addition candid and sometimes unpredictable interviews with Sting the players the band's manager photographer and others are strategically spliced into the body of the work. Fortunately free of the tantrums or heated exchanges so common in today's reality TV this is nonetheless as authentic a portrait of music life behind the scenes as exists anywhere. The triumphant culmination is the concert where Sting unveils the band as well as his new material to an enthusiastic French audience. There are some surprises along the way a questionable shot or two but overall this is a real treat and one of its kind.";

That's one of the primary points of the film. But despite that you appreciate that the amazing performances are solely due to the COMBINED talent of the players  not just Sting.

I think a lot of fans might have been disappointed since the music he started playing after leaving The Police was completely different from what he used to do. However I think this movie really shows what a incredible and talented musician Sting is. Bring on the night is a film that all fans of Sting  The Police MUST see. It's interesting to hear Sting talking about some of his experiences considering music. Yes he seems a little arrogant in person  almost depressed. But his stage prescens is one of a kind. His voice sounds better and more clean than when he was in The Police and it's fun to see him play other instruments than bass guitar like piano and electric guitar. Not many people know that he also plays the saxophone oboe banjo and several other instruments and is in fact very scilled in playing them.".

There is not a violent film with more validity for its actions than this one it is the maddening human mind which causes deaths here. Peckinpah shows us everything that is important in this man's life and then shows us what a man is capable of doing once all that is taken away. The difference between this film and other similar films is perhaps that the movie has such humble beginnings. We build ourselves inside of Bennie. When we first meet him he is casually and happily playing the piano quietly dreaming of settling into a different kind of love. We share a quiet picnic with him witness his wedding proposal.Perhaps also there has never been a chaotic killing spree that has seemed this environmental. While usually the hero goes on a rampage in a way that is appropriately heroic itself Bennie is no hero. He is a man forced into a situation by the world around him as it seems he is always forced into situations.

	schema:reviewBody "The following commentary should only be read by those who have seen the film.  It is in a sense a spoiler for something that doesn't exist in the film's current release.I first saw Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia here in Manhattan on the day it opened so many years ago.  After the reviews came out the studio immediately pulled the prints from the theaters and cut the most CRUCIAL scene in the film.The original release contained a scene wherein upon discovering his lover dead the Warren Oates character makes love to her corpse.  He does so tenderly and with deep regret.  Then he buries her along with Garcia's remains in the grave he's just desecrated.It is in this moment that he slips into madness.  If you watch the film again note the transition from the pregrave character and the postgrave one. Also note the somewhat disjointed transition from his holding his dead lover in his arms to his leaving the graveyard. I'm sure you could view his character change as simply being a reaction to her death. But if you imagine the missing footage his impending lunacy has greater depth and makes more sense.  It also gives the film a different resonance than his other films that employ a machismorevenge motif.It's always driven me crazy so to speak G that this most important scene was taken out of the film denying the audience a true understanding of the Oates character in the last third of the film.I eagerly await a DVD release that restores this footage. I hope it hasn't been lost forever.".

	schema:headline " Peckinpah has come full circle";
	schema:reviewBody "First I'm sure everyone commenting on this film has seen the documentary on Peckinpah and the comments made by the film critics regarding this film. If I may quote one of the critics and I'm sure you all agree It's the one film of Peckinpah's that everyone tries to imitate. Even Tarantino does to some degree. I have issues with Quentin Tarantino from a cinematic and artistic point of view but that is another review. Warren Oates' performance was flawless as he actually assumes the identity Of Sam Peckinpah as a gesture of appreciation for gracing him with his first starring vehicle.Warren Oates was taking Sam's journey for him as Sam looked from behind the lens. This movie was Peckinpah at his best and his worst at the same time. The old Peckinpah themes are there Mexico is the final frontier where one can continue to be what he once was in a changing world but eventually Mexico begins to change as well. As I said in my review of Junior Bonner be sure to check it out and get back to meprogress is the main antagonist in the lives of Peckinpah's characters.Junior Bonner and Bennie Oates' Character have a common foe the twentieth century which is why we find Bennie in Mexico. The chance to improve his situation and establish a solid relationship with his hooker girlfriend played with tough sincerity by Isela Vega arrives at a time in Bennie's life when he least expects it but it's not as easy as it is set out to be. All he has to do is bring this head to El Hefe and at the last minute BAM!! Bennie grows a conscience. Along the way he loses his woman and then just goes nuts thus revealing The Diseased Soul of Sam Peckinpah.My favorite scene is actually the picnic where Elita and Bennie discuss their future. Elita begs Bennie to ask her to marry her he does and she begins to weep. The simple fact that he says it is a tender moment and shows how the slightest thing can arouse a woman's emotions. Jerry Fielding's musical score which successfully created the mood and atmosphere for Straw Dogs my all time favorite Peckinpah film is present but very muted. Still this may be the best scene of the film.Sam Peckinpah finally had complete control to dictate the direction of this film Free from the money men and left to his own devices in Mexico where he felt at home. A lot of people say that Pat Garret and Billy the Kid was the last Peckinpah masterpiece but I think Alfredo Garcia was the last one. It throws you off at the beginning with the horses then all of a sudden a Corvette screeches by This is the paradox that really signifies that The West is over bringing Sam Peckinpah and his love for the west full circle.The critics literally hated this film but 30 years later because of it we have a Martin Scorcese a Robert Rodriguez and a Quentin Tarantino yeah to name a few as well as achieving underground cult status. I'm proud to call Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia one of my favorite films.".

	schema:headline " what can they really want with the head of Alfredo Garcia?";
	schema:reviewBody "At one point Warren Oates's character Bennie asks this and it may or may not be a rhetorical question at this point in the film. By this time several people are dead though more on the way and he's lost the love of his life and any sense of selfworth. Then again maybe he never had much of it anyway. But the question still stands what was Alfredo Garcia Al as his head is called by Bennie as he has him in the passenger seat of his car really in the grand scheme of things?He's bounty for El Jefe a wealthy Mexican rancher who sees a scandal in his daughter becoming involved with the notorious Garcia and asks not too bluntly to bring his head period. This leads to Bennie becoming involved who is basically a drifter barfly who plays piano and has it in him to want a lot of money really bad. Bad enough as it turns out to bring along Elita Isela Vega along for the ride to find the grave he's been buried in after a car accident. But as it's not too surprising to see in a Sam Peckinpah film a form of hell breaks loose...actually when it comes down to it a form of purgatory. The question as one might gather watching the film is more directed to the soul than anything how much is life worth? It's incalculable is Peckinpah's thesis I think and it's this aspect of how life can lose its value in an instant that gives his film allegorical lift.It's not just a question of the loss of life that brings some of the most extraordinary parts of 'Alfredo Garcia'. This was one of Peckinpah's most personal projects the only one he had final cut on and here and there I got the sense that it's as much a nihilistic plunge into the blackest despair in murderous revenge as it is a pulp fiction kind of take on filmmaking itself. Peckinpah therefore is appropriately mimicked through Oates it's easier to see after watching a documentary on the director though even without that it's pretty clear this has to be based on someone as a desperado who at first is fine with selling himself out as it were but then as his trip goes darker and more violent and without a slice of hope with the money turning to moot as the casualties pile up the worth of a job well done or what a job entails comes into question. Peckinpah dealt with a lot of s in the movie business and one could perhaps make parallels to the guntoting Mexicans on his trail or even the men who he's supposed to report to with said head as producers or studio execs.But without all of this in mind even as it adds a bit of fascination to how Benny's fate unfolds Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia works on the levels that Peckinpah's work at its best does it reveals violence and murder as the most unglamorous frighteningly quick and graphically empty thing known to man. And while Peckinpah isn't quite as successful as in the Wild Bunch of corralling a perfect array of the devastating effects of shootemups in his brand of subversion he comes close to that same level of ironic exhilaration with Bennie's path. He even does his best to fit in a depressing love story between Benny and Elita as they can't leave one another but all the same Elita just can't understand why he needs to get that head. It doesn't help matters that she almost gets raped in a oneofakind scene involving Kris Kristofferson in a role unlike any other I've seen him in and is ready to call off their engagement...until there's the incident at Garcia's grave. From there on in love is no longer the issue but getting back to the 'soul' theme Peckipah's after about loss. Lots and lots of loss.And all the while Oates makes this a quintessential turn in his career. An actor in more TV shows than I could even attempt to watch he took on this role which doesn't allow much for easy sympathy or sentiment and makes it completely compelling. Some may take issue with him as well as with Vega in the role of Elita and in truth she's not the greatest actress out there not to mention Peckinpah's own warped view of humanity as taken in the film. But it's a fearless turn all the same and by the end I couldn't see anyone else in the role for that moment in time anyway where Oates had a parallel wavelength with Peckinpah as to the vision of the picture. All in all Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is about as grim and almost ludicrously hopeless but it has some of the grittiest moments in American 70s filmmaking where being uncompromising just goes with the territory. That it also gets the mind going on what it means to be selfdestructive or to lose one's soul or to just be a filmmaker is a very good plus. A".

Now having seen it I have only superlatives to say about it.What makes Peckinpah's films so good in the first place is that even though they have a lot of graphic violence it's not selfserving brainless entertainment like Tarantino's or Rodriguez's films not that I don't like them as well. Peckinpah makes a point with it all especially in Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch and Al Garcia is no exception to that. Here Warren Oates is a man whose morals are challenged by greed and corruption around him who loses everything he has and thus takes his shots on the bad guys who try to capitalise things they bear no emotional relationship to. Not that I could make sense everything of it as said this film is bizarre and surreal from start to finish but somehow it grabs you and doesn't let go. Just as Ebert said there's hidden meaning even in a severed rotting head. Considering this film was made when Peckinpah was losing his credibility among Hollywood studios I would say he wanted this film to be an allegory of a maverick director surviving in the Hollywood system.How this film has remained only a film buffs' favorite I don't know. I mean come on it has everything to be a crimethriller classic Peckinpah in the director's chair Warren Oates at his best truckloads of attitude and some jetblack comedy in lines such as you guys are definitely on my st list now.

	schema:headline " Scratch the Surface and You Find Great Art";
	schema:reviewBody "I believe Sam Peckinpah to be one of the most underrated directors in modern American cinema.  We praise Scorcese to the sky albeit deservedly for ultraviolent work like Taxi Driver yet tend to dismiss Peckinpah as a shallow director of action film and westerns.Nothing could be further from the truth.  When I watch this movie it reminds me of what movies are all about it is instructive it elevates the consciousness of the form which tends to be a factor in all great art.Alfredo Garcia' actually has more in common with Cocteau's Orphee' than action vehicles like it's predecessor it is an adaptation of the Orpheus myth albeit more subtle.  I'm not going to get exhaustive in analysis but will highlight some of the most obvious metaphors and referencesThe first blatant clue is early in the film after Benny Warren Oates gets the contract to bring back Alfredo Garcia's head he tells his girlfriend this is our golden fleece baby.'  Orpheus of course was one of the Argonauts who accompanied Jason on his quest for the Golden Fleece.When Orpheus was killed his head was torn off yet it continued to sing. In the same way it is Alfredo's head luring Benny to the sweet tune of 10K enough to start a new life enough to find happiness.  Note also when Benny asksBut Benny is in fact himself Orpheus Alfredo Garcia simply his double.  To wit Alfredo had been sleeping with Benny's woman her love is split between the two of them.  More obvious is the scene when the two hit men come into Benny's piano bar showing him the picture of Alfredo and asking if he's knows his whereabouts.  Benny's reply is You got me.'  Note also the thematic foreshadowing in this scene when Benny ask the Gig Young character for his name and he replies Fred C. Dobbs' the name of Humphrey Bogart's doomed character in Treasure of Sierra Madre.'Our introduction to Benny is as a jaded singer in a low rent piano bar in Mexico.  However like Orpheus he is able to inspire even the pathetic patronage to sing with relish.Orpheus was said to be able to tame even the wild beasts with his sweet lyre and later in the film when Benny finds himself in great jeopardy having fallen under the power of two random psycho's in the badlands great Kris Kristopherson  cameo by the way he uses the guitar to overcome his captor first lulling him with song then bashing him with the instrument.Like the doomed Orpheus and Euridice before Benny can marry his true love she is randomly killed.   In the old myth Euridice is slain by an actual snake in this film she it is human snakes i.e. devious treacherous men.As Benny returns cracking up over the death of his lover he beings talking to Alfredo's severed head now rotting in the heat.  Could this be a statement on the rotten reality of the materialistic American dream? Regardless the head is clearly singing' to him although now it may be a bitter song of regret.I don't want to spoil the ending which is far more true romance than Tarantino's screenplay and the subsequent film of the same name if one is familiar with the Tristan  Isolde paradigm but suffice it to say at the gates of the underworld' home free Benny like Orpheus cannot resist looking back' at his departed lover and bring about his ruin.The opening to this film is indisputably one of the greatest in cinematic history.  As a parting note I will elucidate this claim as most people tend not to get itSet in Mexico the film is a modern western and to bring this home Peckinpah must bridge time.It opens with old time Mexican music and an antiquelooking black and white photo which shifts into color and becomes the opening shot a pastoral scene by a pond.We see a pregnant girl in a very simple homespun white gown dangling her feet in the water.  A maid in the garb of a timeless Mexican peasant complete with shawl comes up and consoles her.  Two well dressed cowboys complete with spurs and Colt .45's in their gun belts approach to fetch her.  In the background a few more cowboys on horses ride past one holding a rifle.  In the background is an old style adobe building.

	onyx:emotionText "I believe Sam Peckinpah to be one of the most underrated directors in modern American cinema.  We praise Scorcese to the sky albeit deservedly for ultraviolent work like Taxi Driver yet tend to dismiss Peckinpah as a shallow director of action film and westerns.Nothing could be further from the truth.  When I watch this movie it reminds me of what movies are all about it is instructive it elevates the consciousness of the form which tends to be a factor in all great art.Alfredo Garcia' actually has more in common with Cocteau's Orphee' than action vehicles like it's predecessor it is an adaptation of the Orpheus myth albeit more subtle.  I'm not going to get exhaustive in analysis but will highlight some of the most obvious metaphors and referencesThe first blatant clue is early in the film after Benny Warren Oates gets the contract to bring back Alfredo Garcia's head he tells his girlfriend this is our golden fleece baby.'  Orpheus of course was one of the Argonauts who accompanied Jason on his quest for the Golden Fleece.When Orpheus was killed his head was torn off yet it continued to sing. In the same way it is Alfredo's head luring Benny to the sweet tune of 10K enough to start a new life enough to find happiness.  Note also when Benny asksBut Benny is in fact himself Orpheus Alfredo Garcia simply his double.  To wit Alfredo had been sleeping with Benny's woman her love is split between the two of them.  More obvious is the scene when the two hit men come into Benny's piano bar showing him the picture of Alfredo and asking if he's knows his whereabouts.  Benny's reply is You got me.'  Note also the thematic foreshadowing in this scene when Benny ask the Gig Young character for his name and he replies Fred C. Dobbs' the name of Humphrey Bogart's doomed character in Treasure of Sierra Madre.'Our introduction to Benny is as a jaded singer in a low rent piano bar in Mexico.  However like Orpheus he is able to inspire even the pathetic patronage to sing with relish.Orpheus was said to be able to tame even the wild beasts with his sweet lyre and later in the film when Benny finds himself in great jeopardy having fallen under the power of two random psycho's in the badlands great Kris Kristopherson  cameo by the way he uses the guitar to overcome his captor first lulling him with song then bashing him with the instrument.Like the doomed Orpheus and Euridice before Benny can marry his true love she is randomly killed.   In the old myth Euridice is slain by an actual snake in this film she it is human snakes i.e. devious treacherous men.As Benny returns cracking up over the death of his lover he beings talking to Alfredo's severed head now rotting in the heat.  Could this be a statement on the rotten reality of the materialistic American dream? Regardless the head is clearly singing' to him although now it may be a bitter song of regret.I don't want to spoil the ending which is far more true romance than Tarantino's screenplay and the subsequent film of the same name if one is familiar with the Tristan  Isolde paradigm but suffice it to say at the gates of the underworld' home free Benny like Orpheus cannot resist looking back' at his departed lover and bring about his ruin.The opening to this film is indisputably one of the greatest in cinematic history.  As a parting note I will elucidate this claim as most people tend not to get itSet in Mexico the film is a modern western and to bring this home Peckinpah must bridge time.It opens with old time Mexican music and an antiquelooking black and white photo which shifts into color and becomes the opening shot a pastoral scene by a pond.We see a pregnant girl in a very simple homespun white gown dangling her feet in the water.  A maid in the garb of a timeless Mexican peasant complete with shawl comes up and consoles her.  Two well dressed cowboys complete with spurs and Colt .45's in their gun belts approach to fetch her.  In the background a few more cowboys on horses ride past one holding a rifle.  In the background is an old style adobe building.  Everything is right out of the 19th century.This timeframe is reinforced when the girl is led to her father's office the first view of which is of oldstyle oil paintings on of a conquistador. This is actually a great hall with the architecture and furnishings of the 19th century.   Her father the quintessential Mexican Don from innumerable westerns is surrounded but surrounded by women in black various functionaries a priest and some nuns all the antique garb of the era.It only towards the end of the scene if you looks very closely will you notice that one man a gringo is wearing a dark banker's suit and has on a modern looking tie.And very quickly after this we cut to a motorcycle and then a line of cars driving out of the courtyard of the great house!

Although he is offered 10000 for the reward for Garcia's noggin by a group of Americans working for Fernandez the actual bounty is one hundred times that.

Less violent than his two big masterpieces THE WILD BUNCH STRAW DOGS ALFREDO GARCIA nevertheless still has its trademark Peckinpah approach to violence though it is done in a deliberately coldblooded and calculated way.

	schema:reviewBody "Sam Peckinpah was an extraordinary and controversial filmmaker who during his career earned both respect and notoriety. Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia is a movie which illustrates some of the reasons why he achieved this reputation and also provides an offbeat piece of entertainment which leaves a lasting impression.Some Peckinpah trademarks such as extreme violence misogyny and well choreographed action scenes are featured on numerous occasions but the movie's most compelling component is its depiction of the journey taken by a guy whose motivation gradually changes from pure greed to a need to escape to a better life and then ultimately a need for redemption.When an extremely wealthy Mexican landowner called El Jefe Emilio Fernadez discovers that the man who'd deserted his pregnant unmarried daughter is Alfredo Garcia he offers a 1000000 reward for whoever brings him the head of the man who he'd previously treated like a son.A little time later in a tourist bar in Mexico City two well dressed bounty hunters called Quill Gig Young and Sappensly Robert Webber meet Bennie Warren Oates who's the establishment's American piano player. The two hitmen are finding it difficult to locate Garcia and after Bennie learns from his girlfriend Elita Isela Vega that Garcia has recently been killed in a car accident he agrees to bring them Garcia's head for a payment of 10000.Elita a prostitute who'd previously had an affair with Garcia knows where his body is buried and so she and Bennie go on a cross country journey to locate the hunted man's grave. What follows includes the arrival of two bikers who plan to rape Elita an attack by some other bounty hunters who steal Garcia's head and another attack by members of Garcia's family. Nearly all these people end up dead and the body count continues to climb inexorably until the movie reaches its violent and spectacular climax.A tremendous number of people get killed in this movie and there are many examples of Peckinpah's propensity for depicting violence very graphically. His penchant for using slow motion sequences in shoot outs is seen by his detractors as a distasteful glamorisation of violence whereas others regard it as an example of his undeniable talent. The most shocking incidents however are where El Jefe has his daughter publicly humiliated and tortured and Sappensly very casually and cruelly knocks a woman unconscious.The milieu within which Bennie makes his journey is bleak and chaotic and his efforts to progress or prosper become utterly futile. In this predicament and despite the obvious dangers involved all that he's been able to do is follow his destiny and ultimately this is what makes his story so tragic and memorable. Whilst this movie may not be entertaining in the conventional sense it is unquestionably a very powerful and absorbing drama which is also profoundly existential.".

The two hitmen are finding it difficult to locate Garcia and after Bennie learns from his girlfriend Elita Isela Vega that Garcia has recently been killed in a car accident he agrees to bring them Garcia's head for a payment of 10000.Elita a prostitute who'd previously had an affair with Garcia knows where his body is buried and so she and Bennie go on a cross country journey to locate the hunted man's grave. What follows includes the arrival of two bikers who plan to rape Elita an attack by some other bounty hunters who steal Garcia's head and another attack by members of Garcia's family. Nearly all these people end up dead and the body count continues to climb inexorably until the movie reaches its violent and spectacular climax.A tremendous number of people get killed in this movie and there are many examples of Peckinpah's propensity for depicting violence very graphically. His penchant for using slow motion sequences in shoot outs is seen by his detractors as a distasteful glamorisation of violence whereas others regard it as an example of his undeniable talent. The most shocking incidents however are where El Jefe has his daughter publicly humiliated and tortured and Sappensly very casually and cruelly knocks a woman unconscious.The milieu within which Bennie makes his journey is bleak and chaotic and his efforts to progress or prosper become utterly futile. In this predicament and despite the obvious dangers involved all that he's been able to do is follow his destiny and ultimately this is what makes his story so tragic and memorable. Whilst this movie may not be entertaining in the conventional sense it is unquestionably a very powerful and absorbing drama which is also profoundly existential.";

Taut excitement throughout  though soon becomes to drawn out  beautifully photographed and with brutal scenes and some images filmed in slowmoving . The film results to be one of the most strong and ferocious directed by Peckinpah . Tenth Sam Peckinpah film  shot with limited financial resources and total freedom .

The screenplay from S. Peckinpah  Gordon T. Dawson develops a plot of S. Peckinpah and Frank Kawalski . It is filmed on location in various localities of Mexico .

Abundant dust  odors  standing water covered with algae  watering foul  squalid housing  etc. It shows the poverty of the region  school children  nasty motorists  rapists stalking  assault  murder  shootouts  etc . Extremely violent throughout  it does show a side of Mexico rarely shot in American movies . Violence takes many forms  including long shootouts  punching pushing malicious torture in private and in public . The central motive is a cruel revenge . The film is possibly the most brutal and ferocious made by Peckinpah  when he was dominated by alcohol  melancholy  loneliness and despair . Warren Oates turns in an excellent acting as independent pianist who is searching redemption by a crazy vengeance  he and Isela Vega strike real sparks . Warren Oates is on the screen as alter ego of the director who creates one of his most candid selfportraits . It is a road movie  which develops the action as a long drive from the city of Mexico  near which lies the estate of The Boss .

It's not your fault Al he commiserates while brushing away the flies and swilling tequila out of the bottle.But I actually think the director Sam Pekinpah had a goal in mind  aside from managing to keep upright and demonstrating that treachery is ubiquitous and honor is rare and leads to catastrophe. I believe he was trying to get inside the skin of rural Mexicans. Oh not in any particularly deep way. He wasn't trying to be the De Toqueville of Guadalajara or anything.But if his idea was to show us what Mexican life on the road was like he did a decent job a more candid and honest job than say a travelogue. Some of the good people South of the Border come across as helpful and filled with religious values. Others are greedy and a little careless about the lives and deaths of strangers. And they all drive beatup cars that leave behind them a cloud of used Pemex. Some of the vehicles look as if they've been rolled once or twice.Isela Vega gives the most notable performance. She has a clean and sympatico face but her figure is a little dumpy and she is not Hollywood gorgeous. Her hair is all messed up and she seems to wear no make up. But she's loving and respectful of tradition in a way few others are.Interesting to see both Robert Webber and Gig Young as two very villainous heavies possibly a couple.As for Warren Oates the protagonist the filthy sunglassed expiano player just trying to get his nut from retrieving and returning the head of a miscreant already dead  well he's saddled with the worst role.It's as if Pekinpah had been on an IV drip of mescal for so long that he gave up trying to peer through the view finder or follow events and just told Oates to wing it. And Oates turns his character into a vicious chaotic grouch. He keeps loading his automatic and tucking it into his belt. He upends bottles of tequila gurgling down enough to float a dreadnaught. Most spectacularly he forms a BOND with the head of the young man he's never met. Ignoring the aura of cadaverine he pours booze on the packaged head  Have a drink Al!  and stuffs dry ice into the bag with it in a gesture at slowing down the decomposition.That's part of what keeps the movie from being a complete disaster.

	schema:reviewBody "Sam Peckinpah's Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is one the bleakest most violent and most depressing movies I have ever seen. It chronicles a cycle of violence and destruction that kills all who are sucked into it. There is no hero in this story and no one remotely likable with the exception of a middle aged whore. It was hated by critics and audiences upon its release and I can't blame them. But I don't agree with them either. This is a good movie.It's not a good movie because it's easy to watch or because we like the people in it or because it carries some important message. If it even has a message it's that nothing matters and everybody dies. It's a good movie because it is one of the most powerful expressions of disillusionment and nihilism ever produced. It's a good movie because it has no illusions about itself. It knows that it's about rotten people and wretched deeds and refuses to shy away from the ugliness or make excuses for the things that happen. And it's a good movie because it's absolutely fascinating.The reason that anyone wants Seor Garcia's head is that he had the poor judgment to impregnate the daughter of a wealthy crime boss who now offers a million dollars to the man who will deliver his head. There are many who wish to claim the bounty but noone knows where he is. Noone except Benny a poor bartender who learned from his girlfriend that Alfredo is already dead and buried after a fatal car accident. Now all he has to do to claim part of that reward is dig up his old friend and cut off his head. Or so he thinks.At this point the sheer futility and pointlessness of everything that will happen should be perfectly clear. A million dollars is being offered so that an evil old man can have his revenge but what's the point if he's already dead? And it only becomes bitterer and more cynical from there. Benny never had anything against Alfredo. His girlfriend once loved the man. But if desecrating an old friend's grave will get him 10000 then he'll do it. Because that head is his ticket out the slums. He's been stuck in a dead end existence without prospects without hope far too long to let anyone or anything stop him.And there will be many who try. Lots of people want that head. Some are driven by the same greed as Benny. Others have more personal reasons. But none of them will back down and none of them have anything resembling scruples or the slightest bit of mercy. And so the bullets will fly and the body count will rise. And the fighting and killing will continue long after there's any reason for it past the point where money is on the line until anger and killing have become ends unto themselves.And that is what fascinates me. Most of the people who die in this movie didn't have to die. Benny didn't have to fight them. But he doesn't know how to stop fighting. He's lost too much and his anger has consumed him utterly. When he started out he was already desperate impatient and unhappy and as his journey becomes ever more miserable he's gotten closer to the edge until killing is the only thing left to him.There's a section in the middle where he's retrieved the head and is driving back alone in his battered car. And the head is sitting in the car next to him wrapped in bloody cloth and surrounded by files. And he's talking to it almost shouting at it telling it how none of this was worth it and it's his fault that so many have died. It's like the Wilson scenes in Castaway only a hundred times more demented. And it stands out because it so perfectly sums up the madness desperation and sense of decay that permeate the entire film. It's just hard to believe that there can be a world that is so devoid of happiness or meaning where so few people have so few morals where the 'hero' will shoot a dead man Just because it feels so good. And that Peckinpah can make it so engaging and achieve such purpose out of futility is the most amazing thing of all.".

Benniealong with his girlfriend ElitaIsela Vegaheads on the road to get the head on a violent and bizarre journey.Released in 1974Sam Peckinpah's Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia is a brilliant film that was a Box Office flop and was hated and panned by the critics at the time. But years after it's release Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia has been rediscovered by audiences and film critics and has become a Cult classic and is seen as one of Sam Peckinpah's best films and next to The Wild Bunch is seen as Peckinpah's most powerful and infamous film. Violentbrutal and done with a vicious mean streak Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia is an amazing film that is a combination of an ActionThrillerHorror filmWestern and character study in the highest order and from beginning to end punches viewers in the gut with intensity and power that never stops and never gives viewers any hope or happiness. With Alfredo Garcia Peckinpah pulls out all the stops and gives viewers a movie that doesn't play by the rules and shows us a world where violence and death is the only way out with an over the topcrazy and bizarre energy that exists in this film and you will be glued to the screen. Alfredo Garcia is also one of the darkest and most nihilistic movies of alltime and probably the darkest film Peckinpah ever did because there are some moments in the film that are shocking and will disturb people and Peckinpah isn't afraid to go over the line whether it's dealing with some of the characters or the storyline and the tone is very bleak. I guess that's one of the reasons why this movie isn't for everybody and critics have been divided on the film since it's 1974 release some critics love it say it's a classic or a masterpiece while others hate call it one of the worst films ever made. While Alfredo Garcia was set in the modern day world of 1974the movie is truly a Western where there is a lot of dust and dirt capturing the harsh and gritty Mexico landscape and there are outlaws and criminals in a lawless land where criminalsmoney and violence rule the streets. You can almost say that Alfredo Garcia was one of the first modern day Western and that this movie was Peckinpah's swan song with the Western genre. The main character Bennie is a classic and iconic Sam Peckinpah characterBennie is almost like a fiction version of Sam Peckinpah because like most of the characters in Peckinpah's films Bennie is seen as a loser and a guy that is down on his luck but is still tough and gritty. When Bennie gets the opportunity to get a million dollars for Alfredo Garcia's head we follow Bennie's journey and obsession with trying the get the head and the money no matter what it costs while trying to get one last chance at winning. While Bennie isn't a likable or heroic character in the traditional sense we relate to as things begin to fall apart all around him. Despite Bennie's unlikable qualities the scenes with his girlfriend Elita bring some humanity and depth to his character. Bennie is a wonderful character that anchors the film and is a character you will never forget. The Action and violence in Alfredo Garcia is amazing and classic Peckinpah with tons of gunfights and shootouts that are fast or in slow motion to make an impact. The ending to Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia is amazingpowerful and truly matches the film's dark and pessimistic tone. An outstanding ending.The cast is great. Warren Oates is excellentunforgettable and at his best as Benniewith Oates being intenseraw and real. Isela Vega is terrific and beautiful as ElitaBennie's girlfriend with Vega having great chemistry with Oates. Robert WebberSappenslyand Gig YoungQuillare wonderful as deadly hit men. Kris Kristofferson is outstanding as a Biker that meets Bennie and Elita. Emilio Fernandez is sensational as El JefeThe Bossa Mexican Gangster and crime lord.The direction by Sam Peckinpah is fantastic and gritty with Peckinpah giving the film an atmospheric and stunning look and always moving the camera and using slow motion to great effect. Amazing directionPeckinpah.The score by Jerry Fielding is incredibleintense and beautiful and matches the movie perfectly.

	schema:headline " The head of Alfredo Garcia the heart of Warren Oates the soul of Sam Peckinpah ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere in Mexico two bounty hunters meet a bar's piano player named Bennie a cheerful and easygoing dude some drops of Tequila helping played by the late Warren Oates. Robert Webber's character asks him if he knows about a 'hombre' named Alfredo Garcia. Meanwhile a prostitute puts her hand on his crotch and gets a severe kick in the head. No doubt this is a Sam Peckinpah film.Yet if Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia features all the archetypes that cemented the legend of the ultimate Hollywood rebel through its cinematic orgy of booze flesh and bullets the sinful quest carries a much deeper meaning through its converging point the head of Alfredo Garcia. The owner of the deadly grail was a ladies' man who had one woman too many when he impregnated the daughter of a rich Mexican plantation owner General Mapache from The Wild Bunch. Whoever brings 'El Jefe' the head of Garcia would be rewarded 1 million dollars. The bounty hunter is a recurrent figure in Peckinpah films as the quest for money is generally the mark of the antagonistic side. The Gig Young's character leaves a name for Bennie 'Fred C. Dobbs' much more than a tribute to The Treasure of Sierra Madre it's also a pessimistic premonition echoing the demise of Bogart's legendary character. And Peckinpah's films of the same machobreed as Hustons' obey to the same sense of Immanent Justice all the people motivated by lust or greed get punished while killing for a matter of Honor and revenge generally belongs to the central protagonist. And it's only fitting that Bennie's love interest is Ileta a prostitute played by Isela Vega crystallizing the violent symbiosis of lust and greed a cocktail beyond redemption. She 'knew' Alfredo Garcia and reveals that after three days they spent together he died in a car crash. Bennie expresses an ironic sadness as if Garcia finally paid for his sins and had no reasons to be loathed anymore. Garcia's head was the unlikely symbol of his redemption before becoming the instrument of Bennie's revenge. Bennie accepts the bounty hunter's contract for 10000 dollars. Yet Bennie strikes as a man who'd be no more motivated by money than Bloody Sam was for awards or peers' recognition. Warren Oates's droopy eyes hidden in the same darktanned glasses that Peckinpah used to wear betray the hypnotic exhaustion of a totally ravaged soul torn between a profound desire to be happy and a sort of lucidity governing his actions as if he was sure that he would never get his break. Bennie desperately tries to reach an oasis of happiness after a life full of torments. No matter what it is he carries guilt like his conscience's eternal hangover.But the film features a very tender and relieving moment of true love between Bennie and Ileta during a picnic set in a nice bucolic garden. Bennie wants to move to some place one he doesn't know. Apparently whatever he left behind him left him with sore feelings. And then there's a heartbreaking exchange when she asks him if he ever thought of marrying her. Oates is too genuine not to be sincere he's trying to come up with the most honest answer he thought of it but never asked. Then ask me she says and those are the truest words of any woman in love.Bennie starts crying as if he was the closest ever to his own vision of happiness realizing that maybe things could change for the best. He asks her and she breaks down crying. She's a prostitute and never thought she could ever find a man who'd love her. These are cries of joy from people who're not used to happiness each one being the key to the other's redemption. This touching and human moment is ruined by the arrival of two bikers and the rape attempt on Ileta not a gratuitous display of misogyny but a pivotal scene.The scene is ambiguous because Kris Kristoferson starts as a sexual predator and then gets tenderer with Ileta when she 'gives' herself. The bikers who sinned by lust are killed but the experience proved Bennie that his woman is still a prostitute because she played their game didn't scream or shouted for help and he's still the same schmuck. Later he tells Ileta his plan to desecrate Garcia's grave she's against it but this time it's for the money. And Bennie would pay his move the biggest price and the death of Ileta annihilates every possibility of redemption. And under this Divine Justice Sam BennieOates and Garcia's ghost are parts of the same trinity tempted by the worst aspects of human nature and struggling to resist to them because they are not bad guys. Bennie is convinced that Garcia whose putrid head is packed in a bag with flies buzzing around would have forgiven him to make money out of his head just like Bennie forgives him for Ileta. It's not a parallel between money and women but a way to look of them as elements of happiness. But there's a time in a man's life where he finally sees the true value of things and that no reward no bounty not 10000 not even one million dollars can buy a man's soul.At the end like for The Wild Bunch the true redemption comes up when the man decides to live his life on his own terms. So call it modern western campy Bmovies a bizarre mess an autobiographical essay the film is beyond any label. BUT if you take movies as the greatest art form when it comes to convey human emotions Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia IS a masterpiece. Like a true author Peckinpah really opens his soul to the audience and to appreciate this film is to understand him and to respect his legacy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warren Oates in a career best performance unravels magnificently down Mexico way in Peckinpah's criminally underrated nouveau Gothic masterpiece. This film is gradually coming into it's own as a unique prePulp Fiction nightmare. Initially marginalised in the scheme of the director's work it is now reappraised as one of his major achievements. Weird romanticism shattering violence morbid subject matter all combine to make it a truly original cinematic experience.The obvious signpost to the progressively nihilistic tone of the movie is given earlier on when Gig Young is asked for his name by Bennie Warren Oates. He replies Dobbs. Fred C. Dobbs. The name is that of the Humphrey Bogart character in John Huston's classic The Treasure of The Sierra Madre. Bogart's character was driven mad by greed in that movie in his futile search for an elusive treasure. Peckinpah's vision encompasses many of the same themes yet is far darker. As Oates' character spirals into psychosis during his journey through the searing and filthy Mexican badlands he maintains a fractured rambling dialogue with the decaying severed head of Alfredo and coldly guns down those who get in his way.Bennie is a loser a pianist in a dead end bar cuckolded by the woman he loves who got it on with Alfredo a friend of Bennie's he's broke and living in squalor he perceives obtaining the severed head of his dead friend as a way out. This is his golden fleece a passport to a better life. In the process of digging up the body his girl is murdered and Bennie's personality disintegrates. As he pumps bullet after bullet into the corpse of one of the hoods who whacked his chick he spits Why? Because it feels so damn good! The role is one that Warren Oates was made for. Seldom a leading man in Hollywood his history of character parts provide him with the experience needed to invest Bennie with the complex traits of a complete antihero. Each tic each mannerism the almost improvised quality of his dialogue delivery results in a totally believable performance.Although many believe that Peckinpah's direction here is messy and unfocused on reflection it seems more of a deliberate ploy to accentuate the nightmarish quality of the narrative. Bennie swigs Tequila almost constantly throughout the movie and very often  combined with the obligatory slow motion violence and gunplay  the result is as if the audience is viewing the action through the languorous gaze of a drunk. Or maybe that's just my imagination running away with me. Or my own alcohol intake influencing my perception.This is probably Peckinpah's most personal film and his last grand masterpiece. As such it is one of the most original pieces of mainstream cinema ever produced. If you like Tarantino and Rodriguez this movie will give a sense of where some of their roots are sunk. Ultimately a journey into the heart of darkness that makes Apocalypse Now seem like a paddle through a Disneyland water park.".

	schema:headline " A Neglected Landmark More Often Discussed Than Actually Seen";
	schema:reviewBody "THE Divorce was created in the first wave of all talking pictures an era in which directors writers and actors often struggled to find styles appropriate to the new technology. At the time it was hailed as a masterpiece of realism today however it is a film more often discussed than actually seen for there is no escaping the fact that the film is stylistically dated. Even so it remains a landmark of its eraand given its historical importance it should be seen by any one with a serious interest in the history of American cinema.The film is precode which is to say that it was made during a handful of years in the early 1930s when Hollywood's selfcensorship was more the subject of jokes than of reality and THE Divorce was among the first Hollywood talkies to openly address both female sexuality and the sexual double standard. The story finds Jerry Norma Shearer and Ted Chester Morris happily marriedbut on their third anniversary Jerry discovers that Ted has been unfaithful something that Ted dismisses with the words it doesn't mean a thing. Angry and hurt Jerry responds by having a one night stand of her ownand then is astonished by Ted's hypocrisy when he declares that her infidelity isn't the same thing. The same story has been told so often that today we take it for granted but in 1930 it was extremely controversial and the cast plays it out with considerable intensity. Most notable is star Norma Shearer although changing styles have left her sadly neglected in her own era she was considered among the finest actresses on the screen and noted for her unusual beauty memorable speaking voice and tremendous star quality. In THE Divorce she gives it everything she has and her power is such that most viewers will find she quickly transcends the stylistically dated aspects of both the film and her own performance.Over the years I've seen the film several timesmost impressively on the big screen where the larger than life performances seem considerably less affectedand I've enjoyed it quite a bit every time. If you are interested in exploring early 1930s Hollywood films you could do considerably worse than to begin with THE Divorce which was my own introduction to that film era. If you are already interested in early 1930s film and have never seen it... this one belongs on your shelf and no excuses.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT".

	schema:headline " One of the best women's films of its time or any time";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS The Divorcee takes a hard look at the double standard. This is one of my personal favorite films of the PreCode Era because it's exactly the kind of film that the Code guarded against. Norma Shearer's character is extremely strongwilled and essentially proposes to her boyfriend at the beginning of the film. Later on she finds out her husband has cheated on her and she does the only thing she could think of to do she balances their accounts. Ted cannot handle being cheated on himself and when she states plainly what she has done he asks her for divorce. Throughout the rest of the film though they both regret not being together it is Ted who dips the lowest becoming too drunk to even go to work. Jerry is still strong sad that it had to end the way it did but strong and has many exploits with various men but she knows she still loves Ted. In the end it is Ted who needs Jerry the most and they end up back together on New Year's. The moral of this story is not that the married couple gets back together where it should be the moral of this story is that no double standard should ever exist. A woman is not going to sit idly by while her man cheats on her nor should she. A man has to realize that he cannot ask for forgiveness if he is not willing to forgive the same act. That is why this film defines PreCode in my mind Jerry states at the beginning that they'll have a go at it only if they are equals. She finds out that she is not his equal she is the better man. This movie would not only never have been made after the Code was enforced due to the adultery allusions to sex and the strong female protagonist I don't think it would be made now. What a great female protagonist  Shearer is magnificent as she usually is. Chester Morris is great and Robert Montgomery is the funloving best friend who acts as an organ grinder's monkey at one point just delightful! Needless to say I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!".

That the woman in question was none other than Norma Shearer in a very risky move which paid off and gave her the Oscar for Best Actress proves the mettle in Shearer but also proved the implicit involvement of Irving Thalberg.Like early talkies there is a tinny flat quality to the sound which lessens some of the emotional impact from the movie and the way these people talk is a little too rapid at times with an emphasis in staging every sentence with meaning  a holdover from the silent movie days. Harsh lighting doesn't help as some of the cuts between scenes and dissolves which indicate either the passing of time and their debauchery and Jerry's liaisons with other men shown awkwardly in closeups of their hands and offscreen dialog.This is a movie to view as a study of American culture at the very end of the Roaring Twenties when women were assuredly emancipating their position in society but there isn't a dated bone in this story's body women even today are still punished in many societies including ours if they decide to take matters into their own hands a point THE Divorce makes very well. The only segment in which it falters is right at the end when Jerry decides she loves Ted after all and would like to renew their marriage on seeing their brittle relationship it somehow comes off false although Shearer's performance and the way her character is written does not make it so. However her choice to be happily married over being a swinging baby comes off as a reflection of not only women but people even today and in that way this film is a great example.Shearer gave much better performances than the one she was awarded for however it's up to the viewer to decide if hers Oscarworthy.

I wouldn't miss it.";

The fact that it was made in 1930 and was still as good as it is is a testimony to the screenplay and the underlying themes. If you like any variety of chickflicks you'll like this movie. If you have any interest in relationships you'll like this movie. If you watch the movie and you don't like it because it's not in color there are no special effects etc. then you need to get used to these old movies. Some of them are fabulous and this is one of them. I shouldn't focus on the dating of it but I enjoy considering the fact that this was made in 1930.

	schema:reviewBody "The dramas of the early sound era were often awkward phoneylooking things. A lot of this has to do with the acting. Most actors were of course experienced in silent cinema but a lot of players with stage experience had also been brought in as was deemed appropriate for talkies. Silent screen acting tended to be overthetop so that meaning could be expressed without words and stage acting also tended to be overthetop so that meaning could be expressed to people sitting in the back row. But this excessive style didn't really work in the more authentic setting of sound cinema. Of course movie people weren't stupid they were aware of what did and didn't work and the industry adapted quicker than is sometimes thought.And of course there were some actors and actresses who simply seemed to get the hang of it straight away. Norma Shearer was among a small number who survived the transition from silents to talkies with her career completely intact. One thing Shearer had was a remarkable presence  she's able to project herself with just a simple gesture or pose and in The Divorce she's often standing with her shoulders slightly forward in understated aggression. And within this context she is able to give a restrained performance conveying a great deal but with a degree of credibility that makes the drama seem more believable. Shearer deservedly won the Academy Award for her work here. Compare her to previous year's winner Mary Pickford in Coquette a slice of ham from a bygone era and you can see how much things have changed.Let's also take a look at the director Robert Z. Leonard. He's not too well remembered these days because he isn't deemed an auteur but at the time he was among the forefront of Hollywood professionals. Two things in particular are worth noting about his style in The Divorce. First is that he uses a lot of camera movement to really engage us in a scene who says early sound films were static? often using a noteworthy pan as a character appears. Secondly he gives us an awful lot of the interplay between characters in simple wordless glances between them for example the jealous look of Conrad Nagel when Shearer and Chester Morris announce their betrothal or later a silent spiteful exchange between Shearer and Mary Doran. There was a temptation for talkie directors to shoot things before the assembled actors as if for a stage play but here Leonard is making subtle closeups that cut across the action and in so doing giving depth to the story outside of the dialogue.This picture is now often classified as a precode movie for its depiction of Shearer's promiscuity after she becomes the titular divorce although even by the standards of the day it's pretty tame. However thanks to its fluid direction and naturalistic acting it is nevertheless a movie that seems a few steps ahead of its time and points towards the increasingly sophisticated sound cinema of the 1930s.".

Actually I find it fun to hear these odd expressions of the day but all the darling this and darling that get a little nauseating after a short time and the corny lines hysterical women sexist men etc. wear thin fast.In essence this was a woman's movie with the message that it's NOT all right for a man to cheat on her husband but bad if a woman does.

It's hard to appreciate the edginess of this film today but back then a movie about an exwife getting back at her former cheating husband by matching his every infidelity was quite the coup. Even today showing a woman taking matters into her own hands is a tricky business. Norma Shearer a fine actress mostly forgotten today took her career in a different direction with this movie after several years of playing cleancut women she wanted something a little more provocative and went to great lengths to prove to her producerhusband Irving Thalberg that this was the role for her.

Overall this is a nice little look at PreCode and early sound and a nice showcase for Oscarwinner Shearer.KEVIN I was surprised by The Divorce not just because it's one of the tamer and less cynical preCode movies but also because it holds up as a compelling drama. At no point was I able to guess which man Jerry Norma Shearer would be with at the end. Paul Conrad Nagel probably had the worst chances since he was already married although in a fine twist he thinks he has the best chance. The scene where Jerry convinces him otherwise was my favorite scene and really showed Jerry to be not just the protagonist but the hero of the story. I liked that the story didn't seem to take sides with Jerry or Ted Chester Morris and treated their plights very fairly even though the focus was primarily on Jerry. I was a little annoyed that we don't really see what leads Ted to his affair sure Janice is smokin' but so is Jerry but we see every heartbreaking step in Jerry's path to infidelity except the actual getting naked of course. Although it is in all ways Jerry's story I think more could've been done with Ted. Still Chester Morris' performance does an excellent job of making Ted sympathetic even when he's done wrong. Norma Shearer's Oscarwinning performance has aged well. Most of the awards in those days went to performances that today would be considered hammy but Shearer brings just the right amount of weight to the character and shows her disillusionment from love found to lost to found to lost to found again.Last film viewed The Love Parade 1929.

	schema:headline " Very stylish and surprisingly relevant and fresh";
	schema:reviewBody "I just rewatched this one last night. This 1930 MGM film tells the story of a happily married couple whose marriage crumbles under the taint of infidelity.Norma Shearer portrayed Jerry Martin a happily married New York socialite who discovers that her husband Ted Chester Morris had a drunken one night stand with some blowsy woman. She tried to pretend that it was water under the bridge and openly forgave him. But his infidelity continued to bother her. And when he leaves New York for a business trip to Chicago she has a one night stand with his best friend Don Robert Montgomery. Jerry confesses her infidelity and discovers that as far as Ted is concerned what was good for the goose was not for the gander. Furthermore Ted is not so concerned about the pain of the infidelity as he is about his pride and that someone in their set is laughing at him. This is the last straw for Jerry and a divorce follows with what must be a pile of alimony because Jerry seems to lack no luxury even though she lacks a job. Not bad work for a fairly short marriage.I understand that the Jerry Martin role nearly evaded Norma Shearer because husband and MGM production chief Irving Thalberg did not feel that the role suited her. She used a series of sexy photographs taken by George Hurrell to convince Thalberg that she could do the role. And she certainly proved that she was the right woman for the role. What I liked about Shearer's take on Jerry was that she was a complex woman who discovered that she could not hide her feelings  whether she was disturbed by her husband's infidelity and hypocrisy or her longing to reconcile with him despite enjoying the company of other men. Shearer certainly deserved her Oscar.Although he had some moments of overthetop acting as Ted Martin  Jerry's husband Chester Morris did a pretty good job portraying the newspaper man who tried to dismiss his own infidelity and discovered how his wife truly felt in the worst possible way. What I found interesting about Ted is how alcohol led to a great deal of his troubles. It was booze that encouraged him to cheat on Jerry. And it was booze that he indulged in following the breakup of his marriage and loss of his job.Robert Montgomery was at turns rather funny and sexy as Don Ted's best friend with whom she cheated. There's a funny midnight scene in a deli where everybody is in top hat and tails and Ted is talking to Don about how he would still like to kill the guy that broke up his home if only he knew who that was. Don makes a polite but speedy exit.Many have dismissed Conrad Nagel as a boring actor who performance in the movie was not worth mentioning. Mind you his role as Paul Jerry's former boyfriend was not as splashy as Morris or Montgomery's role Nagel still managed to invest quite a bit of angst in his role as a man who is dealt a double blow in life when the woman he loves Jerry marries another man and he finds himself in a loveless marriage to a woman Judith Wood whose face he had disfigured due to a drunken car accident.The attitudes and personalities of most of the major characters seemed relevant today. Despite the late 20searly 30s wardrobe and slang the socalled Bright Young Things were not really different from the Twenty and Thirtysomethings in the dating scene today. Do rememberalso that though this film was post stock market crash that it was still pre Depression. Things were still rolling pretty good for most people at this point.I realized that the movie had a happy ending that many modern viewers might not care for. But for me it was an ending in which both husband and wife were humbled. They not only forgave each other but forgave themselves. I bought it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I just rewatched this one last night. This 1930 MGM film tells the story of a happily married couple whose marriage crumbles under the taint of infidelity.Norma Shearer portrayed Jerry Martin a happily married New York socialite who discovers that her husband Ted Chester Morris had a drunken one night stand with some blowsy woman. She tried to pretend that it was water under the bridge and openly forgave him. But his infidelity continued to bother her. And when he leaves New York for a business trip to Chicago she has a one night stand with his best friend Don Robert Montgomery. Jerry confesses her infidelity and discovers that as far as Ted is concerned what was good for the goose was not for the gander. Furthermore Ted is not so concerned about the pain of the infidelity as he is about his pride and that someone in their set is laughing at him. This is the last straw for Jerry and a divorce follows with what must be a pile of alimony because Jerry seems to lack no luxury even though she lacks a job. Not bad work for a fairly short marriage.I understand that the Jerry Martin role nearly evaded Norma Shearer because husband and MGM production chief Irving Thalberg did not feel that the role suited her. She used a series of sexy photographs taken by George Hurrell to convince Thalberg that she could do the role. And she certainly proved that she was the right woman for the role. What I liked about Shearer's take on Jerry was that she was a complex woman who discovered that she could not hide her feelings  whether she was disturbed by her husband's infidelity and hypocrisy or her longing to reconcile with him despite enjoying the company of other men. Shearer certainly deserved her Oscar.Although he had some moments of overthetop acting as Ted Martin  Jerry's husband Chester Morris did a pretty good job portraying the newspaper man who tried to dismiss his own infidelity and discovered how his wife truly felt in the worst possible way. What I found interesting about Ted is how alcohol led to a great deal of his troubles. It was booze that encouraged him to cheat on Jerry. And it was booze that he indulged in following the breakup of his marriage and loss of his job.Robert Montgomery was at turns rather funny and sexy as Don Ted's best friend with whom she cheated.

Florence Eldridge in one of her few films without her husband Fredric March plays her best friend and Helen Johnson plays the tragic wife of Conrad Nagel who only marries her after she's disfigured in a DWI that Nagel had after Shearer jilts him early on in the film.All of them are quite good but the film is really Norma's show. She runs through quite the gamut of emotions and the technical virtuosity of her performance is what got her the Oscar. That and the fact she was married to one of the most powerful moguls in Hollywood certainly helped.There's a quite good performance by Tyler Brooke as the perpetually inebriated hanger on with their set.

In the 30s there obviously existed a double standard that taught it was different or somehow o.k. for men to cheat on their wives but not right for wives to cheat on their hubbies.Today the situation is reversed. In chick flick after chick flick we are treated to married women finding relief both sexually and emotionallyin the arms of a man other than their husband. This of course is often shown as romantic and in fact is often billed as a great romance story.Really? I doubt if a move like The Divorce would be re released today simply because now it is so widely accepted that adultery for women is therapeutic or liberating that no one would seriously accept that any man would think it is right for him to have a little on the side and that his wife should not.The basic premise of many chick flicks is that if the husband is fill in the blank with any one of hundreds of acceptable male put downs...too boring too nice too caught up with the kids too tired...the only possible romantic response is to shag your doctor or a sexy Greek tavern owner or a dance instructor or...the list is long if not predictable.So no there will be no remake of The Divorce given the double standards that prevail today adultery bad for men good for women.".

	schema:headline " Not quite so daring";
	schema:reviewBody "The book Complicated Women Sex and Power in PreCode Hollywood by Mick LaSalle makes a big deal about this movie as being an affirmation of the sexually liberated modern woman. His emphasis is misplaced. This movie is really not that daring. However innovative it might seem in terms of the sexual mores of women this is only superficial. Ultimately the movie serves to reaffirm the old values of marital fidelity. The movie concerns the wide latitude of the male perspective that says affairs in marriage don't mean a thing and can be kept from the wife and whether a modern woman can adopt this perspective. After finding out her hubby Ted Chester Morris has had an affair Norma Shearer's character Jerry tries to out of anger by sleeping with his best friend Robert Montgomery. However she comes to reject these ideas. She can't help but tell Ted of her affair the moment he gets back from a trip and expresses regret. When Ted asks for the fellow's name Jerry mockingly says Oh don't be so conventional! in a great line delivery by Norma Shearer. Ted is though and ends up divorcing her.   Despite the divorce Jerry can't bring herself to adopt the male perspective of looseness when it comes to sex. There's scene after scene of Jerry stopping cold suitors who want to have sex done through closeups of their hands interestingly enough. She does try to act the part of the vamp but it's out of selfloathing not because she has accepted the idea of sexual freedom. Furthermore it's made clear that it's only acting Jerry never really follows through by sleeping with dozens of men. In any event the movie ends conventionally with Jerry reprimanding herself for giving up on her marriage so easily and running off to find her exhusband hoping he will give her another chance. The message is clear a previously innocent woman trying to act like a freewheeling man sexually is wrong. What gives the movie a superficial sense of daring though is some of the dialogue that Jerry says. But again most of it is said in anger and selfloathing and never truly acted on.Another theme of the movie is that of superficial friendship and the negative effect that friends can have. It is the fear of being laughed at by friends that causes Ted to divorce Jerry in the first place. Particularly loathsome is the character of Helen a true bitch if there ever was one played beautifully by Florence Eldridge. She casually brings along the woman that Ted had an affair with to Ted and Jerry's 3rd anniversary party knowing full well who she is. When at the end of the movie there's a possibility that Jerry might move on and marry an old chum Conrad Nagel Helen doesn't miss a beat by telling her how miserable Ted is and how still in love with her she is. Her motivation for doing all this seems to be simply that it's fun. With friends like these...All in all this is a good movie. It's definitely PreCode with its moments of risque dialogue like Ted actually telling Jerry I would like to make love to you until you scream! and Jerry responding I can't scream! The performances are also fine. That of Norma varies from excellent understatement and bewilderment in the scenes where she reveals her affair to Jerry to silly overacting in the scenes on the train with Jerry as a selfloathing vamp but she does do a good job. Note that the dialogue is a bit tough to hear in places not surprising with it being an early talkie. Overall I'd rate this movie as a 710 based on performances and the frank early presentation of the subject matter.".

The human nature with ups and downs is well presented in this film. It is a film about the special relation between people and God and the relations among the people. The trip of the three monks forced to leave their peculiar unique monastery from Germany broken belonging to an order excommunicated centuries ago by a pope to the sister monastery from Italy the last one of their order of cantors is both a material and a spiritual trip. The play of the principal actors is sometime funny and sometime very touching like the three monk group itself. Although they are so different one from each other Benno is the erudite guy the intellectual type Tasillo is the natural while Arbo interpreted by Daniel Bruhl is the young of the group the artist they are united in their love for God and for the music the milestone of their order. The Gregorian chants which I always loved are superb both as plays and as interpretation.Once escaped in the real world Arbo would fell in love with Chiara the sharp journalist. The three monks and the journalist will have a lot of adventures. At the end Arbo chose Chiara and the real world.The character Chiara interpreted by Chiara Schoras is both brilliant and very sexy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vaya con Dios is a German movie from 2002 so it has its 15th anniversary this year that runs for 105 minutes approximately and was written and directed by Zoltan Spirandelli. This is probably his most known work as of this day and a lot of that also has to do with the fact that the lead actor here is Daniel Brhl maybe Germany's biggest star in Hollywood right now if who don't count Austrian 2time Oscar winner Chrostoph Waltz. He was still in his earlymid 20s back then but it was an amazing year for Brhl careerwise perhaps even his best. However this does not mean we have a great film here admittedly. But this should be no surprise looking at Spirandelli's other work to be honest. it may sound interesting and the execution may not always be disappointing but as a whole I don't think the premise was elaborated on in a way where I would say this is actually a quality movie. The focus is on a trio of monks on their way to Italy where they are trying to find a new monastery that they can pay for financially. This is mostly comedy with occasional romance as well. First cast here is Michael Gwisdek and in my opinion he does nothing to justify this fact. The film is clearly much more about Brhl's character but then again I am not a great Gwisdek fan at all and always found him very overrated. the story has a decent moment here and there but I still felt that there are a handful of lengths and this film may have worked better without lots of the unimportant stuff with a runtime of 80 minutes perhaps. Brhl does what he can but eventually the only thing remarkablememorable about him is probably his haircut. Visually with sets and costumes the film is okay. This is probably also the strongest area but not because it is any kind of great but because the rest is entirely forgettable. This is nowhere near the level of the new Scorsese film about two monks Silence. That's the one you want to check out. This one here is the one you want to skip.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing All in a Night's Work when it first came out in 1961. It was at a drivein movie with my cousins who I was visiting at the time. It was and still remains a very funny film with Dino and Shirley giving some great performances.If this had been made at Universal instead of Paramount All in a Night's Work would have been starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day. Dino steps into a Rock Hudson part as the wolfish heir to a publishing empire. And Shirley though she invests the part with her own brand of kookiness is really Doris the eternal virgin. After all she does go to Florida for the sunshine on her vacation.Shirley gets a bit more than she bargained for. After saving a lecherous old playboy from drowning she has to fend off his advances in the best Doris Day manner. In doing so she stumbles into the room of her boss the owner of the magazine she works for and Dean Martin's uncle wearing nothing but a towel.A very officious house detective Jack Weston spots her in said towel as she's leaving the room. It turns out that her boss had passed away that night and Weston's beady little mind suspects scandal. The rest of the film is that proverbial comedy of errors.Though it's not heard in the film Dean Martin did record a song All in a Night's Work for Capitol and he sold a few records of it back in the day. The song fits perfectly in his style can't imagine anyone else doing it.Gale Gordon and Jerome Cowan play colleagues of Dean's uncle and Cliff Robertson plays Shirley's fianc a veterinarian. Dean has a fabulous scene in Robertson's office where on impulse he grabs a dog and takes the poor hound to inside so he can get a line on Robertson. He uses the fake name of Julius Hemmenschlager with Robertson. It's Dino's best scene in the film.And Shirley gets quite plastered while nightclubbing with Robertson and his visiting parents the stuffy Mabel Albertson and the slightly pickled Charlie Ruggles. Quite a sight to see MacLaine and Ruggles singing the school song of the Kansas Institute for Vetrinary Medicine.One thing does puzzle me. After Weston removes the towel through the elevator door. Just how does a nude Shirley MacLaine get back to her room?".

	schema:reviewBody "The film has received a lot of criticism for not being true to the book. Adapting novels is no easy task especially when you have to fit it into a 100 minute. I haven't read the novel and based on what I've seen of this film I don't think it's as bad as a majority have called it. I do agree that it could have been a lot more. The film could have further explored the tension and terror of the Franco regime. The angle with the daughter and her boyfriend is very poorly developed.In the end the focus of Rafael Azcona's script is on the infatuation of a young deacon and Elena and Ricardo's attempt to live together in secret. The infatuation theme is well explored. The character Salvatore is constantly in doubt and gives in to temptation which eventually gets the better of him. Ricardo is presumed dead or escaped. He continues to write against the regime in secrecy. The conflicts that arise between him and his wife and his own anguish and struggle could have been further developed.The plus is that 'Los Girasoles Ciegos' is a well made film on the technical side. It 'looks' clean. The polished sets costumes locations etc are nice to look at. The score is pretty good too. This film does provide some insightalbeit a toned down one to those who know very little about Spain under Franco's power.The performances stand out. Maribel Verd does a fine job as the wife struggling to hide her husband to maintain the family secrecy and deal with the deacon's infatuation. The role itself is a little bleak but Verd manages to rise above it. The Ricardo character is sketchy but Javier Cmara does the best he can. Raul Arvalo is brilliant in a complex role.Given the source 'Los Girasoles Ciegos' had potential. However as a standalone film in my opinion it's not a complete failure as I found it to be quite a watchable film.".

I haven't read the novel and based on what I've seen of this film I don't think it's as bad as a majority have called it. I do agree that it could have been a lot more. The film could have further explored the tension and terror of the Franco regime. The angle with the daughter and her boyfriend is very poorly developed.In the end the focus of Rafael Azcona's script is on the infatuation of a young deacon and Elena and Ricardo's attempt to live together in secret.

So the story focused on the problems of a priestsoldier and practically the whole 100 minutes are about this boring character and his boring conversations. I'm really sorry about the result because there were many great expectations about this movie in Spain. Everything is bad in the movie and reminds all the worst of Spanish Cinema. For instance the scene when the hidden father jumped through the window to suicide is absolutely surrealistic with the boy it is supposed he is clever asking his mother why is she crying. 'Cause your father has killed himself! Didn't you notice? The mother should have answered that to the boy to make the scene even more surrealistic or just to turn it directly into a comedy.

The screenplay by the late Rafael Azcona was adapted from the widely popular Alberto Mendez novel and the setting is northern Spain in the immediate post Spanish Civil War period. Elena Maribel Verdu has assumed the role of head of the household as her left wing school teacher husband Ricardo Javier Camera is being south by the right wing government and is believed by them to have been killed but in fact he is in hiding in the house. Another left wing fugitive is Lalo Martin Rivas who has also been hiding in the home but now must flee to the safety of the Portugal border with his pregnant wife and daughter of Elena and Ricardo Elenita Irene Escolar. Elena and Ricardo's youngest child Lorenzo Roger Princep is enrolled in a catholic school where his teacher Salvador Raul Arevalo is a former military conscript who has returned to studying for the priesthood and is a parttime school teacher and sympathetic to the right wing government. He also is obsessed with the beautiful and supposedly widowed Elena and is torn between trying to win her affections or becoming a priest. From director Jose Luis Cuerda it offers nice cinematography from veteran Hans Burman and beautiful art direction from Baltasar Gallart but it's nothing more than a made for TV movie like you might find on Lifetime. I'm sure the film must have fallen far short of the novel. It comes across as forced silly and even laughable in places where it isn't supposed to be funny. I suggest you pass on it and I would give it a 5.5 out of 10.".

The father Ricardo played by Javier Camera declared dead lives hidden in the family basement with his subversive and prohibited books and types works on his wife's behalf to earn some money.

Nothing new in the exploration of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War.Regarding the acting Maribel Verd and Javier Camera do not believe what they are playing and their performances are mediocre much below their acting abilities and quality. Raul Arevalo is good in his portray of the confused tempted priest. The rest of the supporting actors are OK in their roles but child Roger Princep was awful to watch.There is nothing excellent or memorable about the film just mediocrity. To be honest the things I liked the most about this film were its atmosphere the views of the Orense's city and the title.

It's easy to see why people see this as being a bit of an oddoneout in Bergman's output it's very direct in it's depiction of disturbed states of mind directly illustrating hallucinatory states rather than just hinting at them. Others have pointed to references to other films of the horror genre which seem undeniable.Not that you'd mistake this for a film by anyone but Bergman. It's rich in connections with other of his films and autobiographical references such as the terrifying description of being locked in a cupboard as a child. It can be reasonably thought of as Bergman's 'horror film' but he takes on the genre very much on his own terms.It's a film that lingers long in the mind with many unforgettable scenes including the amazing Magic Flute scene aided by Sven Nykvist's wonderful chiaroscuro photography. The use of music is as ever with Bergman the most musical of directors extremely intelligent the scene with the boy is set apart from the rest as much by the music as the photography.Given the quality of the cast you'd expect superb performances. As ever von Sydow and Ullmann are excellent with equally good supporting performances.At times I was reminded of Rilke's only novel The Notebook of Malte Laurids Brigge. If you don't know this I urge you to seek out a copy there's a distinctly Bergmanesque atmosphere to the whole work but there are specific images that seem to link to this film.This is a film that repays repeated viewings. Despite it's extremely disturbing subject matter to me it's not as emotionally draining as many of Bergman's other films such as Shame or Winter Light in spite of or perhaps because of the visual horrors on display. Still I recommend it very highly.".

	schema:headline " The hour when ghosts and demons are most powerful";
	schema:reviewBody "Hour of the Wolf 1968 is one of my favorite Bergman's films. I place it close to Persona to which it is a perfect matching piece. This impressive and disturbing movie about the loss of sanity by a tormented artist is another magnificent work of Ingmar Bergman the closest to the horror genre he ever directed with his regular actors Max von Sydow who is amazing as Johan and his Muse Liv Ullmann who is equally compelling as Alma Jonah's wife. The film takes place on an isolated windy island where Johan and pregnant Alma moved in hope for Johan to work on his paintings and where he is haunted by nightmares from the past that may or may not be just his dreams. They come to torture him during The Hour of the Wolf which Bergman describes as the hour between night and dawn. It is the hour when most people die when sleep is deepest when nightmares are more real. It is the hour when the sleepless are haunted by their deepest fear when ghosts and demons are most powerful. The Hour of the Wolf is also the hour when most children are born.Bergman has always been obsessed and fascinated by the inner demons that imagination can create and like no other filmmaker has explored the deepest mysteries of human soul and mind. Surrealistic Gothic and dark horror film with its magnificent black and white cinematography provided by Bergman's long time friend and collaborator Sven Nykvist The Hour of the Wolf is a frightening view of the mind of a mad person. It's been mentioned in more than one comment and I agree that David Lynch might have seen Hour of the Wolf more than once and was influenced by it when working on his own dark and surrealistic Erazerhead.9.510".

	schema:headline " A bottomless pit of pure psychological horror and endless interpretation";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes broadly categorised as a horror film Hour of the Wolf 1966 is in fact one of director Ingmar Bergman's most potent and interesting examinations of the artistic psyche with all of the usual psychological elements and interpretations that such a subject can present. The film was initially devised alongside the more widely acknowledged masterpiece Persona 1966 as a secondary element of that film's already complicated narrative design. Along the way Bergman presumably decided that the intense psychosexual relationship between patient and nurse presented by Persona was strong enough to survive on its own so took out the broader aspects of artistic breakdown ego guilt and paranoia and created this particular film around them.The presentation of the story begins well enough with the characters retreating to a small island off the Swedish coast and living out a quaint and idyllic honeymoon period of love and creativity. However right away we see Bergman presenting the audience with a series of questions questions that suggest certain unspoken elements of this couple and their shared past with the major question being along the lines of why would these particular characters loving and charming as they seem want to remove themselves so completely from the outside world? Are they hiding from something? Perhaps so and you could certainly draw parallels here with the central themes of Bergman's later oddly interlinked character studies Shame 1968 and A Passion 1969 in which characters haunted by the past and at odds with society retreat from certain events and further into themselves. As with those particular films the characters of Hour of the Wolf find that the solitude they so dearly sought bring out the very demons that their escape was attempting to exorcise creating in the process a hellish psychological landscape where they find themselves repeating the same actions events and mistakes as if existing within some tortured loop.As the film progresses Johan and Alma the couple at the centre of this claustrophobic drama realise that they are not alone on the island with the local inhabitants coming to represent the frightening unseen abstractions presented in the artist's work. Again we are being asked a series of questions all pointing back to the character of Johan Borg and his relationship not only with Alma but with the inhabitants of the island and the mysterious cipher Veronica Vogler who will reappear towards the end of the film. The horror aspect is not only psychological which is of course fairly common for Bergman's work particularly of this era but also surprisingly physical manifested in the old dark house and bizarre characters that come to populate the island and take an interest in Johan and his heavily pregnant wife.You could argue that the film is somewhat muddled or small in scale compared to many of Bergman's other films from this era in particular the aforementioned Persona as well Shame and A Passion which are both equally as great. Even Bergman himself admits in his memoirs that the perspective of the film was never fully developed despite his best efforts to correct the problems in postproduction something that no doubt led to the awkward though never less than interesting creation of the confessional framing device. Here Bergman to some extent predates a film like The Blair Witch Project 1999 by some forty or so years by creating a work that claims to be based on a true story  in this instance the psychological breakdown and disappearance of an artist as documented by his own wife and diary entries  despite clearly being a work of fiction. From this the film becomes weighted from the perspective of Alma the wife of the artist who discusses her husband's final days with an unseen film crew.Once we cut back into the real story and begin to unravel the central mystery of Johan Borg and the terrible demons that plague him the perspective of the narrative switches once again this time becoming entirely focused on the man presenting us with his own fragmented memories dreams and nightmares. This for me is a much more interesting angle to follow despite misgivings from the filmmaker himself. Though some viewers have obviously found this device problematic or even potentially distracting the use of this continual juxtaposition of the character's central viewpoints works in favour of the drama fragmenting the notions of fact and fiction even further and creating a really subtle shading of Borg's complex personality. You could also say that with this particular style of structure Bergman is obscuring  perhaps accidentally  the true fate of Borg's character so that we the audience are never fully aware of what exactly is going on. We can make assumption of course and draw conclusions from the snippets of information being offered to us by the characters and by Bergman himself but the film ultimately closes with as many questions as it does suitable answers.The imagery of Hour of the Wolf is very much in keeping with the imagery of Persona though perhaps lacking the Brechtian sense of narrative deconstruction and cinematic selfreference in favour of the abstract absurd and the morbidly surreal. As other reviewers have suggested there is a touch of the Hammer House of Horror evident here especially in the later scenes which take place in the old Gothic mansion and some of the more outr images of psychological torment. However the film never crosses over remaining true to Bergman's personal style and preoccupation with character examination and selfanalysis against a landscape of pure existentialist dread.".

Bergman is no stranger to the surreal Persona his most notorious feat but surrealism lurks in many Bergman works and Hour of the Wolf displays his skills at it with a precision that is uncanny. We're given a couple of characters thrust not entirely by accident into a strange atmosphere of people locations shadows the night. And with this film the audience is given images and scenes that are very new even for a modern audience but most of the film brings one back to the most chilling of the silentfilm horror classics. But that's not to say this is a relatively accessible Bergman film unless you are very much into the genre.Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman give strong performances as a couple one an artist the other his pregnant wife who arrive on an island to have some peace where he can get some work done. But this is not the case as Von Sydow's character goes through a kind of deconstruction in the night he can't sleep he's shaken to intense uncomfort by neighbors and a particular memory haunts him all the time and once Bergman shows what it is it becomes one of the most horrifying scenes I may have ever seen. If there is a climax to the film it's difficult to discern the only flaw I had with the film that sometimes it's almost TOO bizarre however what leads up to it is a skillful work at experimental theatricality. Everything seems real enough to draw the audience in and everything seems unreal enough for the audience to be disconnected enough to understand the surreal nature. To put it another way it's a good film to scare the hell out of you as a midnight movie.".

I think it's substantially less compelling and essential than SHAME made the same year with the same two principal players.It took me a long time to see VARGTIMMEN and I've finally seen it tonight on the big screen.  But while I feel it's an essential enough part of the overall Bergman canon I'd have to place it squarely in the blist as far as its coherence and overall effectiveness.While it contains an unusual level of creepiness by Bergman standards and a complete journey into surrealism brief as it is in the final reel that seems very unBergmanesque  he loves his symbolic images but rarely has he gone this ambiguously surreal route the truth seems to be that many many directors have achieved more with this kind of film than this film does.  Bergman seems a bit out of his element here.  Because most of his films utilize his trademark techniques in the service of a subtle finelyobserved provocative examination of some difficult aspect of human existence VARGTIMMEN seems to lose its coherence quite a bit in pursuit of something which is admittedly unusual for Bergman.Ultimately it seems to examine three themes 1 Can we if haunted by things that become inarticulable go mad from them? 2 Can we if we love or are attuned enough to those we love share their demons with them? 3 Schizophrenia.  This appears to me to be what Johan Borg seems to be suffering from.These are interesting themes to be sure.  But Bergman doesn't seem to really go very deeply into them.  Instead he's kind of skimming the surface uncharacteristic for him while enjoying if that can be the right word the ambiguity of our knowledge of what's going on.   Strangely while I rarely find Bergman emptily pretentious or needlessly arty which he is obviously occasionally accused of this film brought me as close to feeling that way as anything I've ever seen of his. Perhaps it's because he wasn't truly at home in these themes of supernaturalhorror etc.  This film actually seems DERIVATIVE of better films like a Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE or even DEAD OF NIGHT.   Rarely does Bergman suffer in comparison with other filmmakers who came before him.   SHAME again made that same year virtually right after this film is by contrast a deeply troubling finely wrought examination of far more to me compelling complex essential and provocative human issues.  I would return again and again to SHAME but I feel no real need to see HOUR OF THE WOLF again.It belongs in the canon yes and should be seen.  But while it is a bit unusual visually I think it winds up seeming rather minor thematically in the overall pantheon of his work.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hour of the Wolf refers to that particular moment between night and day where sleep is at its deepest where most dreams consequently nightmares gets the realest feeling where most people die and are born where we're at the most fragile and vulnerable state. In the end it is such a fascinating accumulation of superlatives of creepy undertones it would've been impossible for an explorer of the human condition like Ingmar Bergman not to tackle it.And to illustrate the eeriness of the titular notion Bergman translates it into a mysterious pathology that took possession of a tortured artist's soul a painter named Johan Borg and played by Max Von Sydow. The film is based on the fictional notes taken before his death or disappearance? and revealed in front of the camera by his widow ? Alma played by Liv Ullman. The two actors star again in a Bergmanian film in the same year than Shame Bergman's antiwar pamphlet but this is one more obscure and puzzling film even by Bergman's standards.In fact the film made me realize that despite the heavy psychological material carried by most Bergman movies they were pretty much straightforward about their subject and at the end it was always a part of our human condition that revealed to us mirrored by our relationship with time with God with the others. It's like each Bergman's movie played like a piece of puzzle that would constitute a magnificent and intelligent study of the human soul. But The Hour of the Wolf is one of these pieces of the puzzle you don't know where to put.This is not to separate the film from Bergman's other works it's his first and I guess only take on supernatural and surrealistic material and the result is aesthetically nightmarish and conveys well the horror inhabiting Johan's soul but Bergman as inaccessible as he is always found a way to guide us to his characters even at the price of a second viewing. I wanted to understand what was going into Johan's mind was that sickness? Hallucinations? In a way Alma mirrors these very feelings and like her we want to know more about him.Some shadows of answers come when she sneaks into his diary the reading episodes provide the first hints one creepy dream involving a kid trying to kill him and an idyll with a girl named Vogler and played by Ingrid Thullin. Shot in high contrast and with a pretty furious editing the kid's killing and drowning is one of the most disturbing sequences I've ever seen my guess is that it supposed to evoke the repression of some childhood episodes and maybe the child Johan kills is himself the clue comes from his revelation of a childhood trauma later to Alma.The Vogler episode is echoed during a dinner where the couple meets a group of rich and eccentric slobs to the limits of perversity bourgeois lead by Erland Josephson. They all seem to know about Johans' affair. They're obnoxious uneducated aggressive one of the lady literally jumps at Johans Josephson's wife implies that they try to take him from his wife they're the closest players to the antagonists and leave us a sentiment of total discomfort like these creepy nightmares where we don't know where we are but can't wait to get the hell out.I guess The Hour of the Wolf encapsulates this feeling of continuous entrapment and impossibility to escape from a situation without getting through it it's probably these repressed feelings that come back to the surface to better torture us. Maybe it's a surrealistic definition of guilt guilt from one man's weakness. Which might explain that Johan decided to isolate himself from the world in the remote house leaving a peaceful and dull life with Alma while he's lived quite a torturous and much more cinematically appealing life? And maybe the third act is the price he finally paid by not being totally sincere with his wife. It's made of a whole long sequence where they search Max in the forest while he's in the castle and must play some twisted and pervert games nudity makeup crows all the most unsettling archetypes of nightmares are used  and at the end nothing but absence absence of Max of explanations  The Hour of the Wolf leaves many interrogations and so does the film. Right now I'm still having this 'what the hell did I see?' expression I had when it ended.I certainly wouldn't be a fan of Bergman if I had seen this first but because I'm a fan I try to see the film with more magnanimous eyes. I can accept the absence of definite answers and the way Bergman drowns his work into his own creativity my take is that Bergman invites us to embrace these moments where we're directly haunted by our own demons where we must face the true facet of our personality when the nightmare gets its realest feeling perhaps the closest moment in life is when it looks like a nightmare.The Hour of the Wolf is certainly the closest Bergman's film to a nightmare and I wonder if the deliberate noises he made at the beginning of the film were made to reassure us that we were only watching a film as to insist that no matter how creepy this stuff is it's still the product of one's imagination. I guess I prefer Bergman when he approaches our reality but even the way we handle our reality is conditioned by our subconscious and all the feelings we try to repress. Maybe this is The Hour of the Wolf this moment where for some reason we have good reasons to act irrational.But I certainly wouldn't recommend it as a first Bergman's film.".

Strange hallucination create the artist's world  as he sees apparitions shaping a tormented vision of dreams and anxieties that seem at times utterly out of control .This Swedish movie displays haunting and powerful scenes  it's plenty of bizarre images which stay forever in the mind . Interesting  claustrophobic and surrealist film about an artist retreated to deserted island  being splendidly performed by Max Von Sidow  in Ingmar Bergman's only horror film . Weird  rare look into the personality of a depressed artist who suffers amazing nightmares . Although sometimes is slow moving  however the thoughtful and eerie screenplay is narrated with intelligence and coldness but are developed strange and moral issues as anxieties  painful memories and guiltiness . Ingmar Bergman originally penned the script in 1964 under the title The Cannibals . A serious bout of pneumonia led him to reconsider the project whilst lying in hospital he deemed it to be potentially too expensive in concept and execution . Bergman revised the script idea into a more low budget piece to accompany Persona .

	schema:reviewBody "Hour of the Wolf is nothing short of incredible. Certainly the scariest horrorthriller i've ever seen. Forget Psycho forget Friday the 13th forget everything you know about thrills and chills. Hour of the Wolf is actually scary and in a good way unlike foul ventures such as Urban Legend 2 or Exorcist 2. What i mean is its a brilliantly enjoyable movie to watch.

Forget Psycho forget Friday the 13th forget everything you know about thrills and chills. Hour of the Wolf is actually scary and in a good way unlike foul ventures such as Urban Legend 2 or Exorcist 2. What i mean is its a brilliantly enjoyable movie to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I refamiliarized myself with an Ingmar Bergman film that might be the closest this great director ever came to doing a horror picture other than perhaps Through a Glass Darkly and of course Scenes From a Marriage. LOL!. The film in question is Hour of the Wolf from 1968 original Swedish title Vargtimmen starring Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullmann. In this BW stunner a couple comes to a very isolated island. The husband is a famous painter and his wife of some five years is now pregnant. The artist we soon gather is very close to going mad as he keeps seeing visions that may or may not be real including bird people a woman whose face comes off and other monstrosities. He also thinks back to the time when he killed a young boy although whether this ever truly happened or not is unclear. Liv at one point asks if two people who live together will soon start to resemble one another and think like the other and I suppose that Bergman feels that that is indeed the case as she too starts to see visions. There is no way in the film to ever tell what is real what is memory what is hallucination what is symbolic and so on. Bergman achieves a creepy atmosphere almost effortlessly from the very first scene in which Liv talks to the camera and tells her story in flashback. Ingrid Thulin another Bergman regular appears as Von Sydow's former flame in a surprisingly topless sequence. This is a beautiful film to look at with outstanding cinematography by another Bergman regular Sven Nykvist and the acting by the two leads need I even say is world class. It is a picture that will surely be seen differently by everyone who experiences it and is most certainly very open to interpretation. It is NOT a film for the lazy viewer and is surely not an easy film. But it is a fascinating one to be sure....".

	schema:reviewBody "I will no longer mutilate and destroy myself in order to find a secret behind the ruins.  Hermann Hesse Ingmar Bergman directs Hour of the Wolf. First image a black screen over which we hear the sounds of a camera crew setting up a shot. We then get a closeup of Alma Liv Ullman the pregnant wife of Johan Max von Sydow. Alma's speaking to a documentary crew and relating a very disturbing tale. This tale she states is about the disappearance of an artist. Alma narrates a tale to us. She informs us that she and Johan escaped to a remote island. As Johan is a painter the couple hope that this location will provide Johan with both inspiration and the solitude necessary to pursue his art. As Johan has been in an adulterous affair it is also hoped that the island will bring husband and wife together. Bergman himself had a relationship with Ullman with whom he fathered a child. The couple split soon after Wolf's release.Things don't go well for Johan and Alma. Johan is immediately pulled away from his wife his artwork drawing him away from their rustic home and out toward the morose waves and craggy cliffs which line the island. As Johan is pulled toward his art becomes more selfinvolved Alma becomes miserable. What could possibly interest her husband more than his wife? What is out there? What's calling him? Seeking answers Alma begins reading Johan's diary.Johan's diary speaks of encounters with five demonic figures which Johan calls the birdman spiderman meateater insect and the lady with the hat. All five characters want a piece of Johan and together become Bergman's metaphor for the insecurities of selfloathing artists. Whilst Johan praises Alma for being one person consistent and whole he berates himself for being constantly pulled off in all directions by the demons. They want you for themselves an upset Alma says and it's harder for them if I'm here! Bergman's point is clear the artist belongs to no one human being. Can not even belong to himself. Temperamental insecure and with an identity always in flux he is not even sure who he is. Alma of course doesn't understand Johan's plight. She wants him fully always but the now suicidal Johan can't commit to this. To commit is itself a kind of charade. I can help you! Alma insists but Johan brushes her aside. Baffled Alma begins to attribute Johan's behaviour to demonic possession.Bergman's monsters are largely the product of a husband and a wife's imaginings. Alma is interpreting Johan's diaries far too literally and Johan is assigning meaning  using the motifs of the horror genre  to psychological behaviour he doesn't fully understand. Because both spouses are confused ascertaining the meaning of the film's five demons thus becomes difficult. One demon is obviously a reference to Johan's past lover whilst another is a reference to Baron von Merkens a wealthy man whom the artist is simultaneously reliant upon disgusted by and attracted to. Another demon an implike boy whom Johan kills speaks to innocence lost sexual experimentation shame and also possible homosexuality. The fourth demon a man in an overcoat Ulf Johansson is both an art critic and psychiatric curator. Johan knocks this figure to the ground unwilling to hear his diagnoses. The fifth and final demon is an elderly woman in white  the lady in the hat  who speaks of secrets hidden under beds.Bergman's third act begins with Alma and Johan attending a party at a castle in which all these figures have assembled. Whether they're a coven of witches vampires ghosts or merely a grotesque parody of a filmstudio afterparty is left up to the audience. Regardless the creatures all want a piece of Johan who is able to fend them off only with the help of Alma. The film then ends with Johan abandoning Alma who lasts sees her husband in the woods being pulled in different directions by the creatures. He then disappears.Bergman's final scene finds Alma again addressing we the audience. Looking directly at us she wonders whether living with a man long enough results in a woman becoming like her husband. She then begins to blame herself for Johan's disappearance wondering what she could have done to save the relationship. Should she blame herself? Should she assume responsibility for Johan's vanishing into thin air? Into himself? To the audience though it becomes clear that Alma must leave Johan  and so Ullman must leave Bergman  in order to retain her own sanity. The artist's isolation insomnia and neuroses can be toxic. In pushing her away Johan might very well have saved Alma from the monsters. By accepting Johan's vanishing Alma might have done the same.Hour of the Wolf's title refers to what Bergman calls the hour between night and dawn when nightmares are most real. The title perhaps also refers to the netherworld in which the artist  often most creative at night  lives a tormented place unfamiliar to most. The film's original title was Cannibal a more overt reference to the forces tearing Johan apart.The selfpitying tortured artist archetype typically carries with it a lot of conceit and selfabsorption. Wolf which essentially casts a selflacerating Max Von Sydow as Bergman himself is however largely devoid of vanity. Indeed it at times mocks the creative inner lives of men. And all the while the film's concerns remain fixated on Alma. The monsters may tear apart Johan's body but it is she for whom the film mourns. It is she for whom BergmanJohan pines for even when their love becomes an impossibility. Impeccably shot and lit by Sven Nykvist.810  See Vincent and Theo and In a Lonely Place.".

Carnival of Souls  Hour of the Wolf are direct precedents to the films Lynch would make later especially his eerie black  white opus Erasurehead.

The second half of Hour of the Wolf is a bad LSD trip on celluloid confounding compelling brutally sadistic the scene with the boy  masochistic this film will be your entrance in to alternative filmmaking of the most surrealistic kind!

	schema:headline " Great classic family film in the MGM tradition";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful family film but if you are expecting the emphasis to be on Lassie and her adventures then you will likely be somewhat disappointed. Instead the emphasis is on Dr. William MacLure Edmund Gwenn the elderly physician to a rural Scottish area in the 19th century. Donald Crisp plays Drumsheugh MacClure's closest friend and a good adviser. These two actors along with Tom Drake who plays MacClures's assistant were in several Lassie films during the 1940's playing different roles each time.MacClure is one of those doctors from a bygone era that makes house calls in the middle of the night and accepts payment in goods as well as money. At one point in the film he is sitting at a table in a restaurant having tea as patient after patient comes up to him and practically forces payment upon him. MacClure loves his work and payment is a secondary issue with him. One person though decides to cheat MacClure and gives him Lassie as payment with MacClure believing that she is a sheep dog. MacClure figures she will be a good companion and messenger dog so it doesn't matter so much that she turns out not to be a sheep dog. However it does matter that she is afraid of water since the glen in which they live has heavy snow and rain at times and crossing streams when getting to patients is a necessity. At first MacClure angry at being deceived decides to give Lassie away. However he changes his mind and decides to teach the dog not to be afraid of water. This doesn't work out so well as Lassie is willing to do just about anything short of swimming. MacClure gives up on this effort but still he keeps Lassie. In spite of his complaints about her usefulness as a working dog she is becoming a pet to him. This is something MacClure is not about to admit since his whole life has been about service to others. He has always denied himself anything he deems as a luxury and this would certainly include having an animal whose only purpose is companionship.The rest of the film is about the good doctor facing the various medical crises that impact the residents of the glen. During this time dog and master bond and become fast friends. MacClure is aware that his days as a doctor are coming to an end and thus he has picked a young man of the village Tom Drake to travel to Edinburgh to study medicine and become his replacement upon graduation. Towards the end of the young man's time at medical school MacClure is called out one snowy winter night on one of his house calls. He is knocked unconscious and will freeze to death in the snow unless Lassie is able to overcome her fear of the water and swim across the stream to bring help to the doctor.This is going to be one of those films you either love or hate.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a wonderful family film but if you are expecting the emphasis to be on Lassie and her adventures then you will likely be somewhat disappointed. Instead the emphasis is on Dr. William MacLure Edmund Gwenn the elderly physician to a rural Scottish area in the 19th century. Donald Crisp plays Drumsheugh MacClure's closest friend and a good adviser. These two actors along with Tom Drake who plays MacClures's assistant were in several Lassie films during the 1940's playing different roles each time.MacClure is one of those doctors from a bygone era that makes house calls in the middle of the night and accepts payment in goods as well as money. At one point in the film he is sitting at a table in a restaurant having tea as patient after patient comes up to him and practically forces payment upon him. MacClure loves his work and payment is a secondary issue with him. One person though decides to cheat MacClure and gives him Lassie as payment with MacClure believing that she is a sheep dog. MacClure figures she will be a good companion and messenger dog so it doesn't matter so much that she turns out not to be a sheep dog. However it does matter that she is afraid of water since the glen in which they live has heavy snow and rain at times and crossing streams when getting to patients is a necessity. At first MacClure angry at being deceived decides to give Lassie away. However he changes his mind and decides to teach the dog not to be afraid of water. This doesn't work out so well as Lassie is willing to do just about anything short of swimming. MacClure gives up on this effort but still he keeps Lassie. In spite of his complaints about her usefulness as a working dog she is becoming a pet to him. This is something MacClure is not about to admit since his whole life has been about service to others. He has always denied himself anything he deems as a luxury and this would certainly include having an animal whose only purpose is companionship.The rest of the film is about the good doctor facing the various medical crises that impact the residents of the glen. During this time dog and master bond and become fast friends. MacClure is aware that his days as a doctor are coming to an end and thus he has picked a young man of the village Tom Drake to travel to Edinburgh to study medicine and become his replacement upon graduation. Towards the end of the young man's time at medical school MacClure is called out one snowy winter night on one of his house calls. He is knocked unconscious and will freeze to death in the snow unless Lassie is able to overcome her fear of the water and swim across the stream to bring help to the doctor.This is going to be one of those films you either love or hate. If you are ever in the mood for an oldfashioned rather slowmoving story that will really tug at your heartstrings this movie really fits the bill.";

Oddly this one finds Lassie as a damaged doggy as his new master abuses the dog because it is a lousy sheepdog and won't go in the water if needed. Soon the kindly local doctor Edmund Gwen buys the dog and the rest of the film is mostly about his life in rural 19th century Scotland tending to the sick and dying...with Lassie as his constant companion and helper.Like the first Lassie film this one has a lot of polish and was made in Technicolor. It also features fine supporting actors in many of the leading rolesgiving these wonderful actors a chance to shine. In fact several were from the first Lassie film as well Gwen Donald Crisp and Rhys Williams. Additional actors rounding out the main cast were Janet Leigh and Tom Drake. All in all a fine and entertaining film...and one that might be best seen with some Kleenex nearby just in case!

Just the year before he won the award for best supporting actor for his portrayal of Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street. This time he was the lead actor.......So far about 23 of the reviewers say they loved the film while13 found it lacked appeal. Count me in the former group! I rate it as good as the first in the series of MGM films about Lassie Lassie Come Home. Think of this as being primarily a film about Dr. MacLure with LassiePal the supporting actor and maybe you will be more satisfied with it. Although it sure looks like the Scottish Highlands amazingly it was filmed at the MGM studios or at Sonora Pass in the Sierras.......Initially Lassie was labeled useless as a sheepdog or traveling companion because she had a bizarre aversion to getting her feet wet let along swimming. Several sheep drowned under her watch. The doctor tried to solve this problem by laying steppingstones part way across a shallow stream and hopefully she would be brave and walk in the water the rest of the way. But instead Lassie jumped on the doctor's chest knocking him into the water. I laughed out loud! Eventually Lassie got used to being in water and even swimming across a raging river in several scenes. This segment was not realistic however. The dog certainly would have been swept downstream a good ways while crossing. The same applies to the 2 men who were following Lassietheir crossing was not shown. Also how could these 2 carry the unconscious Dr. MacLure across this raging river when the bridge had been washed out?? In another incident Lassie rendered a service to the doctor during a raging snowstorm on a partially washed out bridge. His medical kit was tied onto her back while she tightroped cross the missing part on the still intact narrow side beam nearly slipping off several times........Tom Drake plays Tammas Milton who is an informal understudy of the doctor before he goes to medical school. Janet Leigh with a thin Scottish accent plays his girlfriend. Donald Crisp plays a friend and various others play the families of the people the doctor tends to......This lush Technicolor film is currently available in an economical 4 pack of MGM Lassie films. including Lassie Come Home.".

She is outwardly a flamboyant perpetually happy person who works as a singer at the decadent Kit Kat Klub a cabaret styled venue. Sally's outward faade is matched by that of the Klub overseen by the omnipresent Master of Ceremonies. Sally draws Brian into her world and initially wants him to be one of her many lovers until she learns that he is a homosexual albeit a celibate one. Among their other friends are his students the poor Fritz Wendel who wants to be a gigolo to live a comfortable life and the straightlaced and beautiful Natalia Landauer a Jewish heiress.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Bob Fosse hasn't achieved an immense degree of recognition but his movies have a distinctive flavour. He seems to have an obsession with the world of musichall which is felt in other movies like Sweet Charity and All that Jazz. In his other movies though musical performances tend to steal the show almost entirely. Cabaret is an exception because it has an interesting background and storyline and the musichall performances are cleverly used here to illustrate and emphasize the plot. They play about the same role as the Chorus in ancient Greek play.Of course the depiction of Cabaret's Kit Kat Club deserves attention all by itself. It is not surprising that a cabaret buff such as Bob Fosse took interest in the Weimar Republic period in Germany when divine decadence  was the name of the game. Only Bob Fosse could recreate with such consumed application the grotesque sleaze of Berlin's lowlife during the rise of Nazism a context which served as inspiration for expressionist painters and for Brecht's Threepenny Opera. During the credits check out a woman in the public with short hair and glasses smoking a cigarette something quite dodgy in 1931!. It is the exact reproduction of a famous painting by Otto Dix.An outrageously grinning clown Joel Grey introduces every cabaret number. The girls appear in all possible contorted postures keeping deadpan faces. The Kit Kat club reminds of a roman arena where the public is out for anything insane even women fights in the mud.... To give an idea of what sort of den the club is Michael York finds himself at one point standing next to a transvestite in a men's urinal...The cabaret performances get all the more provocative as the plot gets tense. The club is an essentially immoral place where anything is for sale and it adapts shamelessly to the radical political changes coming up.Liza Minelli's character is totally at home in such surroundings. Her persona is perfectly sketched in her song Bye Bye Mein Herr. She is the incarnation of the vamp both heartless and ingenuous the sort of lethal woman who drives men crazy and then gives them up like toys. Indeed a very typical stereotype of the interwar period think of Marlene Dietrich in the Blue Angel...Minelli's performance onstage with garter belts and a bowler hat still looks elegantly naughty today.Though the real nature of her character is well studied as soon as she gets offstage. While Minelli can't help being extravagant all the time she turns out to be a fragile woman neglected by her father and in demand of constant and renewed attention. As predicted in her song she proves basically unable to engage in any serious relationship despite her involvement with Michael York  And though I used to care I need the open air you'd every cause to doubt me Mein Herr.The script was based a story by British writer Christopher Isherwood called A Goodbye to Berlin based on his own personal memories. He is allegedly the character played by Michael York. A serious upper class young man he meets Liza Minelli out of blind chance while looking for an apartment to share. She introduces him to all sorts of people from riffraff to aristocracy including a gigolo a Jewish heiress and an ambiguous baron who dismisses them both after having played with the two of them. Michael York's sober performance looks a bit pale as opposed to histrionic Liza Minelli but of course that was necessary in order to stress the essential difference between those two strangers. The movie ends as they part on a railway platform but one can guess their experience together will have changed them both as as far as he is concerned was a definite coming of age.One of the scenes in the middle of the movie is quite disturbing. At a countryside inn a young S.A man sings a song called Tomorrow belongs to me which starts out nostalgic but gradually turns into an infectious Nazi march as the whole crowd joins him. This unexpected number seems to have embarrassed many viewers. If Nazism had presented itself as pure evil would it have met any success? This daring scene makes evident that it was for many Germans of the time the symbol of positive values  beauty tradition order pride future. If you didn't know how things turned out would you not have been tempted to sing along this powerful hymn to the fatherland as you watch this? Good question to ask oneself even or especially nowadays...".

The scene is Berlin Germany only two years before Hitler would come to total power. It is the Berlin that Christopher Isherwood lived in and wrote about poverty drug and alcohol escapism criminals sleazebags fighting in the streets  venereal disease the prostitution of both sexes the desperation to escape through the film industry the temporary escape from the harshness of life in naughty nightclubs like The Kit Kat Club which encapsulates it all. It's a bad scene and a good example of perhaps why so many Germans felt in need of a Hitler. There's not a single verbal reference to Hitler and yet the presence of the growing Nazi movement all around these decadent misfits is ever present in this film. But you can't blame any of these apolitical people for that. Liza Minelli and Michael York's characters are so needy so desperate just to find some personal happiness in life. They can't be bothered with what's going on in the bigger picture.      Except for the Master Of Ceremonies at the Club Joel Grey's character is a semisupernatural allseeing character mocking seeming to somehow know EXACTLY the further destruction Germany's headed for. His scary allknowing grinning face pops in regularly to remind us. The musical number Tomorrow Belongs To Me is so effective an illustration of the appeal this new Nazi hope held for impoverished suffering Germans and yet we have The Master Of Ceremonies' evil nodding grin to remind us in retrospect what it really led to.Just as every musical number aside from being so beautifully choreographed and presented reminds us of the desperation in Sally Bowles' life and in most of Germany. Money Makes The World Go Around is a perfect musical number and so illustrative of the horrendous financial state of Germany at the time. Joel Grey's raunchy Two Ladies on the Kit Kat stage to the hysterical delight of the decadent crowd reminds us that all sexual propriety has broken down including in the lives of the main characters now involved in a threeway with one of the few Germans who still has some wealth intact.

Everyone who wants an example of the artistic heights that film can reach should see Cabaret.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's a strongest film I know. Every time I watch it it bewilders me so I can't turn my eyes away from the screen even though I remember all what happens by heart. It fills me with a strange mixed feeling of interestsympathyadmirationdisgustandhorror. One of the reviewers here called this film depressing and I inclined to agree. Any picture of Berlin in 1931 must be depressing and frightening. But on the other hand there is an atmosphere of desperate reckless joy in the movie. When the entire world goes mad and speeds to a catastrophe life is a cabaret! Do what you can come hear the music play don't permit some prophet of doom wipe every smile away and end as the happiest corpse! It's one idea. There is also another more humanistic live and let live. Brian fails to understand Sally so they fall apart. Fritz for the sake of his love faces the danger of admitting that he is Jew in Germany. There is no hope for him and Natalia in this country in this time. But he couldn't do otherwise. There are plenty of other ideas too about money politics corruption perverseness decadence stupidity of middle classes talent success etc. The story is very simple and incredibly complicated in the same time. No use retelling it. It must be seen. It's life as it was in 1931 and in many ways as it is nowadays. I suppose that Cabaret would be a great film even without any musical numbers but with them it is a masterpiece. They say that history repeats itself for the first time as a tragedy for the second time as a farce. Well I would say that in Cabaret every event repeats itself for the first time as a human drama in life and for the second time as a farce on the stage but it would not be exactly true. Life and farce are shown synchronically or farce even go in advance. But every staged number in divinely decadency Kit Kat Klub ruthlessly shows the naked truth of life. Only Mein Herr and Maybe This Time have more to do with the character of Sally Bowles. And of course Tomorrow Belongs To Me must be mentioned separately. The way of German people towards fascism is presented in one startling scene. And in finale too. That distorted reflection of the audience full of Nazi accompanied by a tense silence after Master's of Ceremonies Aufwiedershen' is horrible. The movie due half of its unforgettable effect to the masterful camera shots. Actors' works are absolutely fantastical. Surely Master Of Ceremonies is Joel Grey star role. He is amazing as that demonic shameless figure that seems to know everything understand everything and deride everything. Liza Minnelli shines in every scene acting speaking singing and dancing. I know few performances equally true strong brilliant and stylish as hers as Sally Bowles. Michael York is excellent as well though he is often underestimated. It's only his character who is reserved intelligent and avoids showoff. And he is perfectly British. I really admire York's acting in the movie. There are also beautiful Marisa Berenson as noble Natalia Fritz Wepper very believable as tormented Fritz repulsively attractive Helmut Griem as the rich scoundrel Maximilian and picturesque supporting cast. John's Kander's music is wonderful and haunting. Shortly Cabaret is a work of a genius or it would be better to say of geniuses Bob Fosse and the crew and the cast. And it's flawless.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joel Grey's MC the iconic centerpiece of Cabaret is a fool in the Shakespearean sense his outrageous makeup and clownish demeanor give him license to speak the most embarrassing truths and to broach the strictest taboos. We never see him out of his MC persona but we do see two layers to his performances. As the host of an interwar Berlin burlesque he is on one leveland perhaps for him it is the only levelan entertainer for Nazi fatcats and wealthy Yanks and Brits on continental vacations. But art imitates life and we can also see perhaps all too plainly how the songs that the MC presents mirror events in the world outside the club. The Nazi party's growing boldness is displayed through rapid cuts between mob violence in the streets and the MC's cartoonish goosestepping on stage. The unusual love triangle between Liza Minelli's hopeful actress and her British and German paramours has its telling parallel in the song Two Girls. Most shockingly and ambiguously the MC lampoons antiJewish miscegenation laws by romancing a person in a gorilla suit and asking why society should stand in the way of their love. Would the Nazi party view this routine as an endorsement of their policies since the idea of a human and a gorilla in love is patently foolish or would they understand that the MC's question had truly moved the audience in spite of the veneer of absurdist comedy? The music of Cabaret underlines the plot points in very bold strokes but it works because everything is so unabashedly theatrical. Matching Joel Grey's achievement and far outshining a weak turn from Michael York Liza Minnelli gives an alltime great performance particularly in the songs Mein Herr and the title tune.".

It is my first Liza Minnelli's film as well the cabaret's international sensation Sally Bowles an innocuous vamp Liza grants her role a disarming vitality and quaintly resembles a bobbed Anne Hathaway doppelgnger not only radiates her grandeur in rendering her doughtyyetalluring show tunes she is born to do it her portrayal of Sally personal life is equally if not more affecting her doeeyed naivety and unrestrained zest for life for love for fame elevate her character as the master of her own fate her sacrifice may not gain concurrence from motley views of life but a full obeisance to her independence and pluck is duly earned. Michael York behind his gawky effeminacy plunges himself into a more contentious venture Brian Roberts his character's bookish bisexual temperament is a provocative taboo on big screen like since ever and the implicit mnage  trois temptation with Sally and the suave Helmut Griem whose gentrified debonair is utterly irresistible has been simmering to the perfect temperature undergirds a manifestation of initiating a sexliberation wave germane to the 70s era while against the Nazirising milieu in the film. There is a subplot dealing with a bromide of a downandout German guy's infatuation with a rich but prude Jewish girl there is an ironic twist near the end however never quite manages to steal the limelight from Sally and Bri but Marisa Berenson's placid performance is still worthy of backslapping the dichotomy of women's images is a trifle stale though. Joel Grey as the so called Master of Ceremonies and won an Oscar against three fellows from THE GODFATHER serves only as the performer in the film no clear attachment with the plot his musical set pieces are burlesque risqu but entertaining to the bone with a strenuous mimicry of German accent it is a hardearned honor although I don't understand how Al Pacino could lose at any rate. The film drops its curtain right before the prevalence of Nazi's atrocity the ending with the vague reflections of Third Reich audience occupying the place has sublimated the materialistic razzledazzle onto an eerily ominous scope which the film has no interest to tamper but the audiences will intuit what will happen next. A great windup neat and potent!".

A great song but to me the way it is done is very effective. It opens with a tight closeup of a young man who starts singing. All you can see is his face. He begins to sing and the camera slowly backs out to reveal that he is a Nazi. Very well done. The young people in the audience are shown in closeups rising and singing this song but like the lead vocalist not joyously. To me it was almost like they're programmed to rise and sign along with it. The faces are of hate and determination not joy about a more beautiful tomorrow. It's as if the movie wants to show that they have been brainwashed. They are willing to fight and die if needed for their ideals and one is either for or against them.Also effective is the comment by Michael York at the end of the scene where he asks Do you still think you can control them? and then in a haunting way we see Joel Gray as the M.C. in his pancake makeup with an eerie See I told you so. There is much more to come smile. Powerful stuff.

	schema:headline " The Center Jewel in Bob Fosse's Triple Crown";
	schema:reviewBody "1973 was a very good year for legendary directorchoreographer Bob Fosse. He won an Emmy for directing and choreographing the television special LIZA WITH A Z he won a Tony for directing the Broadway musical PIPPIN and blindsided Francis Ford Copolla by winning an Oscar for Best Director for CABARET the dazzling 1972 film version which is Fosse's rethinking of the 1966 Broadway musical. The stage and screen versions are quite different and as independent works they stand on their own as outstanding achievements and it is not necessary to have seen the play to appreciate the movie. The main focal point of Fosse's rethinking of the musical is that he wanted it to be a more realistic musical and therefore made sure that all of the musical numbers with the exception of Tomorrow Belongs to Meall took place within the walls of the Kit Kat Club. He cut several numbers from the original score but if you listen some of them can be heard as background music in several scenes. He also shifted the focus of the way the story is told...the play tells the story from the leading man's point of view but Fosse switches the focus to the character of Sally Bowles the brassy sassy party girl who believes in divine decadence' and wears bright green fingernail polish. Fosse also takes two secondary characters from the play who are older and makes them young and attractive in order to make their story more youthfriendly I imagine.

Minnelli makes the most of her musical and nonmusical moments in the film...her climactic confrontation with Brian Michael Yorkis brilliantly performed.

Tomorrow Belongs to Me still gives me goosebumps every time I watch the film.

	onyx:emotionText "1973 was a very good year for legendary directorchoreographer Bob Fosse. He won an Emmy for directing and choreographing the television special LIZA WITH A Z he won a Tony for directing the Broadway musical PIPPIN and blindsided Francis Ford Copolla by winning an Oscar for Best Director for CABARET the dazzling 1972 film version which is Fosse's rethinking of the 1966 Broadway musical. The stage and screen versions are quite different and as independent works they stand on their own as outstanding achievements and it is not necessary to have seen the play to appreciate the movie. The main focal point of Fosse's rethinking of the musical is that he wanted it to be a more realistic musical and therefore made sure that all of the musical numbers with the exception of Tomorrow Belongs to Meall took place within the walls of the Kit Kat Club. He cut several numbers from the original score but if you listen some of them can be heard as background music in several scenes. He also shifted the focus of the way the story is told...the play tells the story from the leading man's point of view but Fosse switches the focus to the character of Sally Bowles the brassy sassy party girl who believes in divine decadence' and wears bright green fingernail polish. Fosse also takes two secondary characters from the play who are older and makes them young and attractive in order to make their story more youthfriendly I imagine. Liza Minnelli turns in a dazzling Oscarwinning performance as Sally a gutsy selfabsorbed party girl who shows signs of vulnerability and a desperate need to be loved.

These elements are the music of the cabaret the lives of the principal characters and the world outside of their narrow domain... Director Bob Fosse captures the atmosphere and turmoil of the time and place just before Hitler's rise to power presenting a multifaceted portrait of a hedonistic increasingly dangerous society in which every brushstroke is significant and influential...The cast headed by Liza Minnelli as an American cabaret star and Michael York as the shy Englishman suffering with the fact that he doesn't like girls perfectly embodied the characters caught up in the currents of the tale...The film begins with an amorphous view of Berlin's Kit Kat Club in 1930s Germany and as the view becomes clearer we meet the nightclub's depraved customers and its host the charming painted emcee who sings 'Willkommen' as the cabaret's girls play their musical instruments... At this moment the Kit Kat Club shows a world unconcerned with events...

While Fosse's camera pans down to reveal his sinister insignia... started to sing along with patriotic passion... It is a sequence of frightening beauty made even more memorable by several quick shots of an elderly man silently sitting on a table.. disapproving the song...When the pathetic Master of Ceremonies tells us once again that 'life is beautiful' and the Kit Kat Girls break into a reprise of 'Willkommen' the irony is devastating... The final shot of the growing of Nazis in the audience reinforces the menace of the political horrors and turns the cabaret into a daring place of diverting escapism...As Sally Liza Minnelli is entirely a creature of cabaret...

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished rewatching Cabaret and it is even better than I remembered it. It is a dazzling ball at the Satan the Feast during the time of plague. It is an unforgettable film made by the master the screen version of his own stage masterwork. It is dark prophetic capture of divine decadence that paved the road to the most horrifying hell of unspeakable catastrophe that the world had not seen before. Bob Fosse proved in his only second directed film how talented he was in everything he was doing. Shot entirely on the location in Berlin with the Kit Kat Club cabaret of the title as a real centerpiece of the movie Cabaret is a marvel of directing editing color settings that in combination with brilliantly clever and catchy songs creates the doomed ambiguous atmosphere of uncertainty hanging onto the present moment and not daring to imagine to whom tomorrow belongs and what tomorrow will bring. It is impossible to talk about Cabaret and not to mention the international cast of the young talented actors who played the characters of their own nationality. Two definite stars of the film are without doubt Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles and Joel Grey as creepy devilish MC. For me the film belongs to Liza Minnelli who gave performance of such energy charisma and exuberance that it has become Liza's calling card and her claim to cinematic immortality. Under her rather intimidating makeup  her eyes that took up the good half of her face the eyelashes so long that they can reach the opposite wall of the room the impossible garish colors of her eyelids that probably glow in darkness unmistakably announcing her presence and colored in dark green finger nails that can be considered the dangerous weapon Sally is vulgar but vulnerable corrupted but lovable oblivious but lonely talented but stuck in the cabaret Kit Kat Club where the music never stops and life is always beautiful ...In 1973 Cabaret competed for the Best Picture of the Year award with number one of 250 Best Movies as per IMDb users Francis Coppola's Godfather. Not only it was the equal contender it won 8 of ten Oscars it was nominated for including Best Director for Bob Fosse Best Actress for Liza Minnelli Best Supporting Actor for Joel Grey who was against three heavy weights from Godfather  Al Pacino James Caan and Robert Duvall and Best Art DirectionSet Decoration and Cinematography. With all my love for Godfather I believe Cabaret deserved all its awards and as time goes it proves to be one of the best screen musicals ever made.".

	schema:headline " Life is a cabaret old chum! Come to the Cabaret.";
	schema:reviewBody "Willkommen bienvenue welcome! Fremde etranger stranger. This movie is phenomenal one of the best of all time musicals ever. Directed by Bob Fosse what a marvelous performances by Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli in this picture. Cabaret is a lot of fun to watch. The film is loosely based off the 1939's book written by Christopher Isherwood call 'Berlin Stories Goodbye to Berlin and John Van Druten's 1951's play 'I am a Camera'. Cabaret was made into a Broadway musical in 1966 with music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb. When it became a hit a movie was produce in 1972 to capitalize on this fame. The film is set in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931 under the ominous presence of the growing Nazi Party where a small night club call Kit Kat Klub is struggling to survive during the coming months of the harsh new regime. Since the musical kept on rewriting the script as years passed by. A lot of the source material has change over time. In this version young American Sally Bowles Liza Minnelli performs at the Kit Kat Klub while running a boarding house. A new English teacher arrival in the city Brian Roberts Michael York and moves in with her. At first they kept each other at reservations trying not to fall in love with each other. As time go on the two find themselves madly in love with each other while the world is finding new ways to keep them apart. The acting is pretty good. I really can't picture anybody else in the role of Sally Bowles. Indeed Liza singing is way too talent than her character is supposed to be but it didn't really hurt the film. Sally Bowles was based on Jean Ross an aspiring actress singer and writer who lived a colorful life. Jean Ross was offended by the character portrayal by Liza call it apolitical. After all Jean Ross is kinda right. Sally Bowles might not be the most likable character as she does a lot of pretty awful stuff but the way Liza Minnelli sink you in with her charm. You can't help feeling for her. She always had that frantic nervous almost desperate disposition in everything Liza's in. It really does explain why she didn't had much of a film career after this. Normally I find this offputting but here it works perfectly in this role. Sally always looks and sounds like she's in deep desperate denial about her life and the state of Berlin and constantly seems on the edge of a nervous breakdown. I really fell pity for Michael York's character to having to deal with her. I never understood why they change the character name from Cliff Bradshaw to Brian Roberts. It seem a bit odd. I found York acting alright but he never stood out much. I did find his big reveal to Sally about what happen to Maximilian von Heune Helmut Griem midway through the movie to be a great twist. That wasn't in the stage versions. The movie also dealt with subplots dealing with other characters like Fritz Wendel Fritz Wepper a German Jew passing as a Christian who fall in love with Natalia Landauer Marisa Berenson a wealthy German Jewish heiress. This part of the film always felt like a different movie. It never mixed well. The subplot from the novel involves the doomed romance between German boarding house owner Frulein Schneider and her elderly suitor Herr Schultz a Jewish fruit vendor never got anywhere as it was cut from the film. I also glad they cut the dead dog scene. That was pretty awful. In the traditional manner of musical theater every significant character in the stage version of Cabaret sings to express emotion and advance the plot foreshadowing every song with Master of Ceremonies Joel Grey. Fosse cut a lot of songs like 'Don't tell momma' 'So What? Telephone Song Perfectly Marvelous Why Should I Wake Up? The Money Song It Couldn't Please Me More Meeskite and What Would You Do? He replace them with new songs like 'Mein Herr' and 'Money Money. There were a lot better than those other songs. The song 'Willkommen' and 'Cabaret' were after all the best pieces in the musical. The club serves as a metaphor for the threatening state of late Weimar Germany that is clear. While this might be long stretch the film could also be a metaphor of American Ku Klux Klan movement that was gaining ground in the 1960s. After all the club had the same initials of the Klan. Indeed the KKK didn't embrace Nazism because they believes in an entirely different form of government and freedoms. But like the film the culture of the KKK embracing Nazism into their lives. It might be something to think about. Honestly the only song that wasn't play at the club was 'Tomorrow belongs to me' in the beer garden by the German youth was powerful. What a really great haunting song by two great Jewish songwriters. Great use of the elderly man in the background of that scene. Director Bob Fosse knew how to film this movie and that's one of his greatest shots in the film. For a movie rated PG. It's has strong adult themes. The ending to the film is hard to swallow. Unlike other musicals at the time this one doesn't end with a positive note. Still the movie was indeed a success and won many Academy Awards with 8. It would had won Best Picture in that year if the Godfather film wasn't so damn awesome. The movie is easy to find despite not being available in highdef or digital presentation due to a really bad scratch on the original film. Overall it's was a great commentary on the mask of normalcy people are wearing during the rise of Fascism in Germany. A must watch for any musical lover.".

	onyx:emotionText "Willkommen bienvenue welcome! Fremde etranger stranger. This movie is phenomenal one of the best of all time musicals ever. Directed by Bob Fosse what a marvelous performances by Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli in this picture. Cabaret is a lot of fun to watch. The film is loosely based off the 1939's book written by Christopher Isherwood call 'Berlin Stories Goodbye to Berlin and John Van Druten's 1951's play 'I am a Camera'. Cabaret was made into a Broadway musical in 1966 with music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb. When it became a hit a movie was produce in 1972 to capitalize on this fame. The film is set in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931 under the ominous presence of the growing Nazi Party where a small night club call Kit Kat Klub is struggling to survive during the coming months of the harsh new regime. Since the musical kept on rewriting the script as years passed by. A lot of the source material has change over time. In this version young American Sally Bowles Liza Minnelli performs at the Kit Kat Klub while running a boarding house. A new English teacher arrival in the city Brian Roberts Michael York and moves in with her. At first they kept each other at reservations trying not to fall in love with each other. As time go on the two find themselves madly in love with each other while the world is finding new ways to keep them apart. The acting is pretty good. I really can't picture anybody else in the role of Sally Bowles. Indeed Liza singing is way too talent than her character is supposed to be but it didn't really hurt the film. Sally Bowles was based on Jean Ross an aspiring actress singer and writer who lived a colorful life. Jean Ross was offended by the character portrayal by Liza call it apolitical. After all Jean Ross is kinda right. Sally Bowles might not be the most likable character as she does a lot of pretty awful stuff but the way Liza Minnelli sink you in with her charm. You can't help feeling for her. She always had that frantic nervous almost desperate disposition in everything Liza's in. It really does explain why she didn't had much of a film career after this. Normally I find this offputting but here it works perfectly in this role. Sally always looks and sounds like she's in deep desperate denial about her life and the state of Berlin and constantly seems on the edge of a nervous breakdown.

I was familiar with Unsworth's work from Superman The Movie and was amazed with his ability to make Liza look so breathtaking here. Fosse's direction and staging of the dance numbers is classic Fosse even if the film had to be tightened up by the studio prior to release.

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Fosse's most accomplished film is one of the most accomplished films ever made period.Fosse understood that the days of the oldfashioned Hollywood musical were over at least as of 1972 so he gave audiences a musical that doesn't feel like a musical. Based on Christopher Isherwood's fine collection of novellas Goodbye Berlin and the subsequent stage musical based on them Cabaret takes elements of both sources to create something completely unique. It tells the story of Brian Roberts Michael York a British professor who travels to 1931 Berlin to give English lessons to a wealthy heiress of a German Jewish family. He meets the irrepressible Sally Bowles Liza Minelli in a dynamite performance an American and fellow lodger in his boarding house and the two begin a madcap friendship and sortof romance eventually falling in with a wealthy German baron until they all fall out with one another. Meanwhile revellers come to the Kit Kat Klub the cabaret where Sally performs to join the sinister Master of Ceremonies Joel Grey recreating his Broadway performance in laughing away the dark cloud of Nazism building on the German horizon.Fosse sharpened his directorial teeth on Sweet Charity three years earlier and while I greatly admire that film I can admit how uneven it is as a movie. Cabaret proves Fosse to be a master behind the camera with a directorial style as unique and instantly recognizable as his choreography. The Kit Kat Klub and its devilish M.C. provide stylized commentary on the world rotting away outside the cabaret's decadent interior the musical numbers don't advance the plot as much as comment on it. Fosse's way of filming musical numbers is fascinating using quick edits to capture movement from multiple angles almost simultaneously. But what gives Cabaret its shattering power is the way it depicts the Nazi movement's insidious rise to power even as people were dismissing it as a joke. For all of the film's stylized panache it provides one of the most realistic documents I've ever seen of just how the Nazis positioned themselves to dominate Germany. It's no coincidence that the film's most disturbing moment comes not in the nightmare feverish world of the cabaret's stage but rather in the realistically depicted world of a German beer garden where the angelic voice of a Nazi youth raised in song becomes a rallying cry and call to arms for the German people. The acting is phenomenal. Liza Minelli gives easily the best performance of her career and one of the best performances in the history of cinema. Joel Grey creates a character who manages to be no one and everyone at the same time. One can't imagine this vampirish imp of a man existing outside of the dark lurid walls of the cabaret. And Michael York does terrific work as well even if his role isn't as showy.I think Cabaret has been underrated because people have labeled it as a musical and musicals never get taken as seriously as other genres. But I would caution anyone against dismissing this film on those grounds. Yes there is music in it but what Cabaret is more than anything else is a haunting warning about the dangers in any time and place of ignoring the unpleasantness of the present and near future for the hedonistic pleasures of the moment.Grade A".

	schema:headline " One Of The All Time Great Film Musicals";
	schema:reviewBody "When director and choreographer Bob Fosse decided to adapt the critically acclaimed Broadway musical CABARET to the screen he took on a daunting challenge. The 1966 hit a songfilled version of John Van Druten's 1952 play I AM A CAMERA itself an adaptation of British novelist Christopher Isherwood's BERLIN STORIES CABARET incorporated both the traditional conventions of the American Musical Theater boy meets girl  love songs sung by the main protagonists coupled with the more daring plot device of a ghoulishly painted Master of Ceremonies who comments on the main story's proceedings through song and dance. The musical eerily evoked the decadent devilmaycare atmosphere of Berlin in the early 30's and the apathy of the citizenry to the encroaching Nazi takeover. As with classic Rodgers and Hammerstein shows of the past CABARET included a romantic subplot this time involving an older couple A German landlady and her Jewish tenant that strongly tied in with the book's stance against prejudice. But composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb went much further than Rodgers and Hammerstein in conveying man's inhumanity to man  the nature of Evil permeated the entire atmosphere of CABARET. Albeit entertainingeven exhilarating the new musical never lost sight of the forces that would lead preWorld War 2 Germany to the brink of social and political disaster. In the process of transferring CABARET from stage to screen Fosse and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen scrapped much of Joe Masteroff's Broadway script and went back to the original source Isherwood's stories creating a more intricate storyline and eliminating certain subplots while adding new ones. The German landlady became a mere walkon role the older Jewish suitor was gone. The young British writer Cliff straight in the Broadway production became sexually ambiguous Brian in the film . British Sally Bowles the singer in the notorious Kit Kat Club Cabaret was now an American played by Liza Minnelli. Into this mix was included a wealthy Jewish heiress involved in a doomed romance  and a menage a taros involving Brian Sally and a seductive German Baron. This indeed was going to be the most adult rendition of The Berlin Stories depicted in any medium. As the Master of Ceremonies the androgynous oneman Greek Chorus who introduces the acts at The Kit Kat Club the producers retained the protean talents of Joel Grey repeating his Tony Award winning stage performance. Under the meticulous direction of Bob Fosse and abetted by master technicians Goeffrey Unsworth cinematographer David Bretherton film editor CABARET emerged as a daring  stupendous piece of work. The opening scene introduces Joel Grey the sycophantic emcee introducing the audience to the denizens of the seedy cabaret. Throughout the film these musical sequences at the Club are artfully interspersed with domestic scenes between Brian and Sally at Fraulein Schneider's rooming house and other Berlin locations. Simply put the movie walks a brilliant tightrope act  juxtaposing the cabaret numbers with everyday life outside its parameters. In a brilliant masterstroke songwriters Kander and Ebb confine the music only to the cabaret numbers dropping all of the song score sung by the principals the eliminated songs do make an appearance however as background music on Sally's phonograph and in public settings! What impresses one most now about CABARET in the thirty odd years since its release aside from its technical triumphs is the great ensemble acting of its cast. Liza Minnelli's star wattage never shone more brightly than it did in this film. Although turning Sally into an American slightly skews the story Minnelli is so strong in the part that it hardly matters. Not a subtle actress her animated delivery is shown to great advantage here  hiding a more exposed creature underneath. In scenes where Minnelli shows her vulnerability she is deeply affecting. There's a repeat of her memorable Pookie from THE STERILE CUCKOO here coupled with her dynamic noholdsbarred stage performances at the cabaret . One of the inherent weaknesses of the film is Sally's desperate longing to be a star a major film actress. She desperately desires fame but is portrayed in the rooming house scenes as a young woman with only mediocre talent who needs constant reassurance. That idea is totally obliterated when Minnelli takes the stage. She holds both the cabaret and movie audience hostage with her incredible talent culminating in two unforgettable numbers the gorgeous torch song Maybe This Time and of course Cabaret. At the peak of both her physical and vocal powers Liza Minnelli gave a performance that rightfully earned her the Best Actress Oscar that year.

	onyx:emotionText "When director and choreographer Bob Fosse decided to adapt the critically acclaimed Broadway musical CABARET to the screen he took on a daunting challenge. The 1966 hit a songfilled version of John Van Druten's 1952 play I AM A CAMERA itself an adaptation of British novelist Christopher Isherwood's BERLIN STORIES CABARET incorporated both the traditional conventions of the American Musical Theater boy meets girl  love songs sung by the main protagonists coupled with the more daring plot device of a ghoulishly painted Master of Ceremonies who comments on the main story's proceedings through song and dance. The musical eerily evoked the decadent devilmaycare atmosphere of Berlin in the early 30's and the apathy of the citizenry to the encroaching Nazi takeover. As with classic Rodgers and Hammerstein shows of the past CABARET included a romantic subplot this time involving an older couple A German landlady and her Jewish tenant that strongly tied in with the book's stance against prejudice. But composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb went much further than Rodgers and Hammerstein in conveying man's inhumanity to man  the nature of Evil permeated the entire atmosphere of CABARET. Albeit entertainingeven exhilarating the new musical never lost sight of the forces that would lead preWorld War 2 Germany to the brink of social and political disaster. In the process of transferring CABARET from stage to screen Fosse and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen scrapped much of Joe Masteroff's Broadway script and went back to the original source Isherwood's stories creating a more intricate storyline and eliminating certain subplots while adding new ones. The German landlady became a mere walkon role the older Jewish suitor was gone. The young British writer Cliff straight in the Broadway production became sexually ambiguous Brian in the film . British Sally Bowles the singer in the notorious Kit Kat Club Cabaret was now an American played by Liza Minnelli. Into this mix was included a wealthy Jewish heiress involved in a doomed romance  and a menage a taros involving Brian Sally and a seductive German Baron. This indeed was going to be the most adult rendition of The Berlin Stories depicted in any medium. As the Master of Ceremonies the androgynous oneman Greek Chorus who introduces the acts at The Kit Kat Club the producers retained the protean talents of Joel Grey repeating his Tony Award winning stage performance. Under the meticulous direction of Bob Fosse and abetted by master technicians Goeffrey Unsworth cinematographer David Bretherton film editor CABARET emerged as a daring  stupendous piece of work. The opening scene introduces Joel Grey the sycophantic emcee introducing the audience to the denizens of the seedy cabaret. Throughout the film these musical sequences at the Club are artfully interspersed with domestic scenes between Brian and Sally at Fraulein Schneider's rooming house and other Berlin locations. Simply put the movie walks a brilliant tightrope act  juxtaposing the cabaret numbers with everyday life outside its parameters. In a brilliant masterstroke songwriters Kander and Ebb confine the music only to the cabaret numbers dropping all of the song score sung by the principals the eliminated songs do make an appearance however as background music on Sally's phonograph and in public settings! What impresses one most now about CABARET in the thirty odd years since its release aside from its technical triumphs is the great ensemble acting of its cast. Liza Minnelli's star wattage never shone more brightly than it did in this film. Although turning Sally into an American slightly skews the story Minnelli is so strong in the part that it hardly matters. Not a subtle actress her animated delivery is shown to great advantage here  hiding a more exposed creature underneath. In scenes where Minnelli shows her vulnerability she is deeply affecting. There's a repeat of her memorable Pookie from THE STERILE CUCKOO here coupled with her dynamic noholdsbarred stage performances at the cabaret . One of the inherent weaknesses of the film is Sally's desperate longing to be a star a major film actress. She desperately desires fame but is portrayed in the rooming house scenes as a young woman with only mediocre talent who needs constant reassurance. That idea is totally obliterated when Minnelli takes the stage. She holds both the cabaret and movie audience hostage with her incredible talent culminating in two unforgettable numbers the gorgeous torch song Maybe This Time and of course Cabaret. At the peak of both her physical and vocal powers Liza Minnelli gave a performance that rightfully earned her the Best Actress Oscar that year.

	schema:reviewBody "It's not that I dislike musicals. Maybe it's that I don't quite get this film. But Cabaret only very rarely worked for me. In a nutshell I'll flesh all of this out more below I'm not sure I got the point of setting the film in Berlin during the transition from Weimar to Nazi Germany. I didn't really like the music or the cabaret performances. Very little of the soap opera stuff had any impact on me. I strongly disliked Liza Minnelli and only occasionally liked Michael York. And the direction cinematography and most of the technical elements did very little for me. There were a couple things I did enjoy one not so minor but you'll have to read on to discover what they were I need to create some suspense here.Cabaret is the story of Sally Bowles Minnelli and Brian Roberts York. Bowles is living in Berlin in 1931 singing and dancing in a cabaret called the Kit Kat Klub. During the opening we see Roberts just arriving in town. He ends up at the boarding house where Bowles is living hoping to acquire a room. He's taking a working vacation from graduate school in England. He plans on earning his room and board by teaching English to Germans.Roberts and Bowles' relationship evolves over the course of the filmthat's the gist of the plot. Roberts also makes two friends among his students Fritz Wendel Fritz Wepper and the very rich Natalia Landauer Marisa Berenson and Bowles meets the even richer Maximilian von Heune Helmut Griem at the dry cleaners. All of this is interspersed with occasional cabaret performances only very seldomly featuring Minnelli and even less occasional references to the rise of the Nazi party. The bulk of the film is soapoperatic relationships among the characters.Cabaret had a somewhat circuitous trip to the silver screen starting with the semiautobiographical fiction of Christopher Isherwood who lived in Berlin between 1929 and 1933. After Isherwood the material was transformed into a play and then a film both entitled I Am a Camera 1955. Finally it became the Broadway show and after that this film version for which director and famed choreographer Bob Fosse wanted to look back to Isherwood's writing. I haven't read Isherwood's work yet but from what I understand it has more of an essaylike tonality and attempts to capture life in the relatively decadent Berlin of the 1930s in detail.Unfortunately the end result is that this film version of Cabaret plays like a directionless pastiche of mostly mundane events. The goal seems to be an indepth portrait of a troubled woman in a troubledenvironment and conjointly maybe a commentary on contributing factors that led to the imbalanced state of both. But what Fosse achieved instead was a randomfeeling poorly acted hodgepodge of soapoperatic nonsense.Minnelli's performance is so loaded with annoying affectations and she so frequently overactsnot to mention that she's very disturbing to look atthat it kills what little dramatic impact the pithier developments should have. York vacillates between confusion woodenness and overacting occasionally finding a balanced middle ground that's enjoyable but it's like waiting for a slowmoving pendulum to reach its nadir.The Nazi material including the two alltoobrief instances of society embracing some of the attitudes or ideas could have been very strong and poignantespecially in contrast to the freewheeling life depicted elsewhere. But Fosse makes no kind of commitment to it so it ends up feeling like it was added on as an afterthought like scotchtaping a paper lapel to an otherwise complete cashmere coat.Fritz and Natalia the two characters that I did enjoy and who had a compelling story that was intimately bound up with rising Nazism were largely ignored. Fosse spends maybe 10 minutes on them.The music and choreography for the cabaret performances lies somewhere between banal and unpleasantly corny. It has a kind of vaudeville shake your derriere to the cowbell hamminess while the choreography involves a lot of muggingagain those annoying affectationsthat saps all of the potential effectiveness out of the art direction. Maybe that music was popular in these kinds of German clubs in the 1930s but would some melodic harmonic and rhythmic inventivenessnot to mention some finer artistry in the lyricshave killed Fosse and his composers? It can't be that John Kander and Fred Ebb were unfamiliar with Kurt Weill for instance.Besides for the other element I really likedthe art direction and production designFosse went out of his way to give us something intriguingly surreal. The look of the film especially the cabaret scenes including the garishly painted faces and bizarre costumes and overall appearance of the performers is based on the visual art of George Grosz and Otto Dixeven going so far as recreating characters from Dix paintings down to small details. I'm a huge Dix fan so I enjoyed this aspect of the film. But I wanted this aesthetic to be followed in other areas too rather than the very pedestrian and unsurprising route that was taken.By the way I know that my score of 6 may seem high given my review but remember that a 6 is equivalent to a D in my way of looking at ratings. There were at least two elements I likedwith the art directionproduction design being very important to the film and I rate on all artistic and technical elements. The film has passable cinematography lighting sound etc. even if they weren't anything special to me.".

Take for instance Julie Christie's hair in Dr. Zhivago or Kate Beckinsale's...well entire appearance in Van Helsing although was that even an issue in that steaming pile of bad FX?.One of the best aspects of Cabaret then is that it truly does feel like you're watching a movie from 1931. Well sort of. If it were made in 1931 it would almost certainly be in Black  White have primitive sound quality sound pictures still being relatively new at that time and maybe be a little less frank about its homosexual content although being that 1931 was a year precode who knows.... Perhaps a better way of putting it is Cabaret looks like you're watching actual events from 1931 not 1931bywayof1972. The costumes makeup the overly arched brows and pancake makeup of the KitKat girls is just as creepy as it is sexy if not more so sets and even attitudes are practically a living postcard of Weimar Germany as far as this 23 year old American can tell. There are no glaring anachronisms here. It's astonishing.Another is the character of Sally. Fledgling writers are always encouraged to make their protagonists as sympathetic as possible otherwise what will care about their journey? Sally is flighty shallow selfcentered and proves that she can be bought. Why do we love her so? Why do our hearts break when her father stands her up after she spent the first half an hour lying about how much he cares for her? More important than sympathy or empathy in a character IMO is dimension. With good there is bad. With pattern there is contradiction. Sally above all the aforementioned characteristics is career driven. And no one's gone to the top without a little white lie or two or three or four.... Of course dimension or no dimension the wrong actress or even poor acting by a great actress could make this character fall flat. It's because of that that one cannot speak of this role without mentioning the sparkling Liza. Those who dislike the movie often site Liza's over the top acting as a chief flaw. I don't see that here. Perhaps if she were the Sally from the stage production brought over to film this would be the case as sometimes stage actors forget how intimate a medium film is the severely underrated RENT does suffer from this occasionally for example. Her singing while jawdropping to say the least is just one part of her role. Watch this girl ACT. Look at the giddy expression on her face when Max volunteers to corrupt her and Brian. Watch her desperately and eye rollingly try to impress the upper crust at a dinner party. Watch her try and play down the immense physical pain she must be in after a backalley abortion. Yes she has an amazing voice but this is performance that would scream Oscar! even if there were no singing at all.But Cabaret IS a musical. Another sad fact is that when showtunes become standards they lose almost all of the potency they have IN CONTEXT. Sure the title track IS a fun song and all  Come to the Cabaret old chum! Life is a Cabaret!  on its own. But watch it where it belongs  it's quite depressing. She's lost a good man friends I doubt she'll be seeing much of Fritz after the wedding and in the end her career is in the same spot it was when the movie began. The Nazis once dismissed as a thuggish cult are growing in number. How much longer does she have to be safe? Better enjoy what she has left. See what I mean? This is a dark musical folks. No happy ending fade to black here. The songs all performed in the night club avoids the suspension of disbelief required for other musicals when characters randomly burst into song on the sidewalk. And though they don't further the plot along in the strictest sense they do parallel. Two Ladies is sung while Max Sally and Brian drive to his mansion. Mein Herr is sung when sexual tension begins to arise between Sally and her new roommate? Foreboding? I think so.And what can one even say about Joel Grey that hasn't already been said? Pure. Genius. No one else can make you simultaneously laugh and feel uncomfortable like that.Cabaret is a brilliant watch dark clever complex but undeniably catchy and not dated by a long shot. You'll get chills and frown at the end....but then you'll rewind to the beginning and watch it all over again.".

Instead it maintains the funk of people dancing on a volcano in search of distraction from the impending doom they face. Musicals by nature are usually optimistic and upbeat. Sober Cabaret goes against the grain and succeeds beyond expectation as one of the finest musicals in film history.".

Meanwhile in the streets the parks the clubs the Nazi Party and its brand of thuggery is becoming more prevalent.Outside of a pace slowing subplot regarding two older students Robert is tutoring Cabaret is flawless film making in nearly every area with Minelli excelling in three acting singing dancing requirements and Grey's mischievously haunting master of ceremonies delivering a character for the ages. Director Bob Fosse working in a confined space smaller than a broadway stage for his musical numbers the color muted by club smoke delivers one excellently edited solid number after the next without betraying the mood with slick flashy choreography on a stage the size of an aircraft carrier that lesser musicals depend on. Instead it maintains the funk of people dancing on a volcano in search of distraction from the impending doom they face. Musicals by nature are usually optimistic and upbeat. Sober Cabaret goes against the grain and succeeds beyond expectation as one of the finest musicals in film history.";

No matter what you will respond strongly.Director Alan Parker has been down this road before with Midnight Express another crushing gutwrenching tale based on a true story. In both cases a great deal of liberty is taken with the facts but that doesn't matter. Mississippi Burning is not a docudrama or an A  E special it is at its heart a police drama and a near perfect one at that.It is criticized by some for its depiction of southerners of the time as a group of braindead racists with no moral fiber whatsoever. I don't believe that is the movie's intention but it spends time showing this side of society to make us understand how hate breeds itself and how it becomes a way of life and an accepted standard. As one character states When we were seven years old they told us that segregation was in the bible.

Hackman and Dafoe are at their best and Frances McDormand delivers a beautifully understated powerful performance as the deputy's wife  a woman at war with her sense of right and wrong struggling with fear and loyalty.

Mississippi Burning is an intellectually challenging movie.  It demands that you immerse yourself in the worst of southern culture whether you like it or not.Based on a true story the film takes place in 1964 my birth year incidentally in a small town ugly and virulent with racism.  The good ol' boy sheriff and his stoolies ambush and in cold blood murder three civil rights workers.  The world's achanging but the powerbrokers in this place refuse to let that happen.  They'll do anything to prevent blacks from taking their rightful place at the table  literally.The FBI sends a couple of mismatched agents in to search for the three missing young men.  One agent Hackman is 'old school' sly and knows his enemies a little too well.  The other Dafoe is a naive Kennedy fireeater ready to bring the full force of the FBI and military down upon this small town's head.  Although he is easy to underestimate at first he grows into his role showing astonishing decisiveness and strength.The relationship between the town's blacks and whites is complicated and fraught with rules  spoken and unspoken.  It's a notsosecret secret that the civil rights workers have been murdered.  Hackman and Dafoe just have to get the bodies and the evidence that's all.  Fear and loathing prevent that from happening until the wife of a deputy the amazing Frances McDormand throws herself on the fire and blows her slimy husband's alibi.There is justice  of a sort  in the end.  It's not enough.  Real change crawls on it's belly in the south.Mississippi Burning is a movie of operatic gestures.  The script is spongey with regional color and snappy powerful dialogue.Hackman and McDormand are simply magical.  They don't take or make a false step from the first frame to the last.  As she would go on to prove in later films McDormand doesn't just 'play' a character  she IS that character. And Hackman is never more affecting that in this film.  One syllable from him is more subtle than an entire Shakespeare speech when delivered by a lesser actor.  Hackman is a national treasure.IMO Dafoe is a wellmeaning revelation until circumstances forces him to cave into Hackman's justgetitdone ways.  He comes to see that idealism must relent to pragmatism in extreme cases although that knowledge repulses him.  He wants nothing more than to get out of the south and go home to a world he believes is cleaner and more simple.The conclusion of Mississippi is more bitter than sweet.  The guilty are arrested and convicted although their various punishments are a joke.  R. Lee Ermey is the only one in the bunch who meets a just fate.  McDormand is brutally beaten to within an inch of her life for betraying the status quo and doing the right thing.  Although she and Hackman have fallen in love she refuses to leave with him because this  gesturing to the vandalized ruins of the house she was born in  is my home.I know the history and I know this movie inside and out.  And yet I still bawl like a baby every time I see it.  The power of this film and the fact that Mississippi is based on ACTUAL EVENTS never fails to get to me.Mississippi Burning has a place in my 'Top 50 Dramas.'".

The worst part was that I am from a very racist town unfortunately and watching the beginning of the film terrified me because I felt like this world hadn't changed since I felt like I was living that film. Being one voice sometimes can either be helpful or get you into a lot of trouble.I didn't want to see this film again because of the awful situations I saw or heard of. Now I am out on my own and I had the chance to see the movie once again and felt that I could see it. It's a terrific and very powerful movie that can get anyone to cry unbearably. It's not just the actors but Gene and William's characters I wanted to be just like them they were able to stand up even though the many times of being knocked down and caring so much just to try to in some way save that town.I honestly feel that everyone should see this movie it can change your life or make you look around and want to change things. I know this comment feels more like a lecture than a comment but that's how much this movie got to me. I think we all can do something right in this world it's just a matter or standing up. Even if this film isn't historically accurate it's accurate enough to see how people treat other people. Hopefully we will have a better future for generations to come.910".

Or is it perhaps that we are taught it?  There is a small scene in Mississippi Burning that is just as powerful as any Gene Hackman speech or any violent montage to gospel music that is in this film.  There is a rally at a park with the head of the KKK  without his hood  telling thousands of people that have gathered that he loves being white.  He loves the fact that Mississippi is segregated.  And in the crowd the camera pans across and shows three year old kids smiling and cheering as gleefully and loudly as their parent's are.  It is haunting.This film is bit like JFK in a way.  It is not an absolute recreation of the events that took place in 1964 but it is a film that tells a true story and then adds a bit of fiction to make it more interesting for a mass audience. For example the case was not cracked by Mr. Anderson fooling around with Pell's wife.  But that is besides the point the point being that this film is mesmerizing.  Everything from its direction cinematography acting writing and music it is the best film of 1988.  And having Rain Man take most of the major awards is really quite sad.  Because Mississippi Burning is much more ambitious important and well done.  Rain Man is a very good film and I will even go as far as to say that Hoffman is the only one that deserved to win best actor just as much as Hackman did.  But 1988 was a bad year for the rest of the Oscars.  Anyway...I have been edgy before.  Boyz and the Hood did that to me but this film makes me angry.  It makes me want to jump back into 1964 and try to do something to stop this.  The film is that strong at showing us how terrible and pointless racism is.  And in order to make this film work there has to be strong elements in all areas.  But for me what really made me feel the things that I did is the actors that played their roles.Hackman is brilliant.  He gives the performance of a lifetime and it is his anger that gives him his edge.  He sees things differently than Mr. Ward does and that sometimes makes them bump heads with each other.  But they ultimately have the same goal in mind.  Just different ways of achieving that goal.  Dafoe is great as well but it is the supporting cast that really makes this film.  From Dourif to R. Lee Ermey to Stephen Tobolwolski these characters are richly portrayed by the actors that play them.  There is however one actor in particular that I wanted to touch on and that is Michael Rooker.  He plays Frank the nastiest meanest no conscience negro hating person that I think I have ever seen on film.  I don't know where his anger comes from but he is the kind of character that you can imagine had a violent father that drank too much and always told stories about how bad the black man was.  When Rooker is on screen you listen.  You pay attention to what he is saying and doing.  And my hatred of him was one of my favourite parts of the film.Mississippi Burning shows us how strange people are when it comes to racism. The characters in this film don't know why they hate the way they do they just know that they do.  And they are powerless to stop themselves.  What happened to the three civil rights workers was a disgrace and a tragedy. But not just because three boys were murdered but because no one knows why they were murderedbesides racism that is.  Why did they have to die? Because they were a different colour of skin?  Because they were Jewish?  It really doesn't make any sense.Mississippi Burning is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is important and it is entertaining.  If you haven't seen it do so just for the scene with Mr. Anderson and Deputy Pell at the barber shop.  That is worth the price of the rental alone.  But for a really important film that has something to say this is one of the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "1964  The year America was at war with itself! Thats a pretty good tagline. The promotion for this film seemed to pitch it as a thriller or a buddy movie. It is neither. This is a very mature investigation of a racist Mississippi town where the brutal murder of three civil rights activists took place in 1964. The film is inspired by reallife events.Dafoe and Hackman play the two FBI agents sent to investigate. Their differing styles of pursuing the case and Dafoe's belated admiration for Hackman's method's is an interesting layer of flesh added to the structure of the film.You will see some really nasty racist characters played by familiar faces like Brad Dourif Lee Ermey and an especially violent Michael Rooker. All are excellent. Frances McDormand really steals the movie as the wife of racist Dourif.This film is far more intelligent than some of the Stanley Kramer movies of the 60's which dealt with racism. It does not shy away from showing the seriousness and sickness of the racial mindset without being excessively preachy. It is in fact very watchable  largely due to a colorful and humorous Hackman whose character was himself a Mississippi smalltown Sheriff at one time and understands the pitfalls of the Hoover boys going in all guns blazing.Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Willem DaFoe is a bythebook FBI investigator and is assisted by exSouthernsheriff Gene Hackman in the reallife inquiry into the deaths of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964. The three kids disappeared. No one black or white is willing to cooperate with the Hoover boys that poke around in the small town's business. The blacks won't cooperate because they're afraid the whites for more obvious reasons. And some less obvious ones. As the cluedin Hackman puts it They have to live here long after we're packed up and gone. Just about every character is a stereotype that's played out like a card in a hand of bridge. The head of the local Ku Klux Klan who calls himself a local businessman is a balding nincompoop who hates not just blacks but Papists and Jews and probably Brobdignagians. He doesn't have a family. Not even a dog or a cat as far as we can tell. The other heavies including the prototypical redneck Michael Rooker with his frozen sneer don't have families either except for Deputy Brad Dourif who has a wife. But he only has a wife so that the movie can show us that not all Southern whites are murdering racists. Some are sweet and lovable and attractive in the way that Carol Burnett is attractive and as just about sublimely played by Frances McDormand are so haunted by distaste for these illegal casteridden shenanigans that she's able and willing to squeal to Gene Hackman's FBI agent about the murders. That indiscretion gets her clobbered.The performances are all good and some are splendid. Hackman could not be better. Every move he makes every line of dialog carries weight. DaFoe's character is less colorfully delineated. McDormand is outstanding and so are Rooker Dourif and the guy who plays the KKK head. What a trio of villains. The tobaccochewing Sheriff is great in a small supporting role.When the FBI is stretched to its official limits without results Hackman is given license to use his own methods. Enter two unofficial FBI heavies. One is a balding redhead with bulging eyes who has since made a career out of playing serial murderers. The other is a huge black guy with an ominous and resonant baritone who threatens to castrate the Mayor unless he spills the beans which the Mayor does leading to almost all the desired convictions.The direction is tasteful. When the decomposing corpses are uncovered it's in long shot. When Dourif beats hell out of McDormand we only get a few introductory blows before the cut just so we know what's going to happen next.Location shooting is evocative. It's a convincing small Southern town shimmering in the summer heat. Most Southern scene  the silent guy on the Choctaw reservations who is carving up catfish. The characters although they may as well carry sandwich boards advertising their function in the script are pretty well drawn.If there's a problem with the film it's that it is laid out like a dramatic movie in the usual form of rising climaxes. The payoffs towards the end simply don't fit in with the otherwise realistic depiction of events. I did not for a moment believe that undercover FBI agents were brought in to kidnap the Mayor and threaten to cut off his family jewels. That belongs to a movie script or to some black hole of a CIA prison in Bulgaria not to a narrative that purports to be based on an historic event.The final impression the film leaves you with is how surprisingly easy it is for a deeply felt and thoroughly entrenched set of values to change so quickly. A generation has passed only a generation since the governor of Mississippi's neighboring state stood in the doorway of the university and proclaimed Segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever. The situation displayed here in 1964 isn't perfect now. Nothing is perfect. But it's a hell of a lot better than it was then. This is actually a curiously mixed blessing. It leaves Southern white people with still another defeat that they must get over. And it leaves blacks with a great deal of antiwhite resentment that has no place to go.".

	schema:reviewBody "I never understood why this movie was never on the Top 250. If American History X can make the Top 250 why not Mississippi Burning? Even Crash made the top 250 and this movie is way more powerful than Crash will ever be. Incredible. Mississippi Burning is a very hard film to look at but a very truthful and gritty look at racism in southern Mississippi during the Civil Rights era. The story details FBI agents Rupert AndersonGene Hackmanand Alan WardWillem Dafoe search for the killers an AfricanAmerican male and two Jewish males. Their search takes them to the heart of Mississippi where the racism is deepseated and the police are inflexible to a fault. They later realize how deep the police involvement in the killings were. No other movie about race relations has moved me like Mississippi Burning has. American History X is phenomenal but it didn't make me as angry as this movie did. I wish I had the power to stop these psychos from doing what they did. Mississippi Burning was the movie that made me question my faith in organized religion. I couldn't fathom that I was believing in the same belief system that these racist lunatics were believing in. I dumped belief in organized religions after extensive research at the age of 20 but this movie sparked my curiosity. Gene Hackman is wonderful as Agent Rupert. He steals every scene he is in. Willem Dafoe is great as his partner Alan Ward. Agent AndersonHackman handles things in an unconventional manner while Agent WardDafoe is by the book. This is where Dafoe showed his true potential before he started screwing up his career by appearing in raw sewage like Speed 2 Boondock Saints Body Of Evidence and XXX State Of The Union. Also great in this movie is Brad Dourif as the racist Deputy Clinton Pell and R. Lee Ermey as the racist mayor. I also like how they showed the views of the average ignorant Mississippian and how the cops either participated in the killing and terrorizing of Blacks in Mississippi or sat back and watched it happen. Conclusion Mississippi Burning is the best movie of 1989 hands down and is definitely required viewing. But be forewarned that this is not an easy movie to watch. But if you can stomach the racial violence and slurs you have a gem on your hands. I find it sad that the director Alan Parker didn't have many movies after this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mississippi burning shows Gene Hackman at his best and at his side is Willem Dafoe who also plays very strong. Mississippi Burning is a dramatic movie made in 1988 directed by the talented Alan Parker who has also directed Fame and Midnight Express. The lead roles are played by Gene Hackman Willem Dafoe and Frances McDorman is at her best playing a supporting role. The movie is based on the true story of the murder of three civil rights workers in 1964 so the movie is set in 1964 Mississippi.The movie begins with the three civil rights workers who are brutally murdered the viewer now already knows that the police are involved. Allan Ward and Rupert Anderson Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are sent to Mississippi to shed some light on the case. The two agents have very different personalities Rupert Anderson used to be a sheriff in a small Mississippi town just like the town where they are investigating missing civil right workers he does not like to do everything by the book in contrary to Allan Ward he is a hard working FBI agent who likes to do everything by the book. Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea. Soon there are an enormous amount of FBI agents in the small town but that only makes the townspeople angrier. The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI. The FBI agents search trough the endless swamps and find the car of the civil rights workers but they still find no bodies. Agent Anderson feels a connection with the wife of the deputy sheriff and feels that she knows something but she won't tell anything. When Ward lets Anderson do it his way they finally see what really happened.The acting in Mississippi Burning is close to brilliant Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are both good actors but together they are brilliant. Gene Hackman is born for the role of an old Mississippi sheriff who knows how it all works. Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well. Frances McDorman plays the cop who does everything by the book excellent even his appearance the glasses and his pale skin. Especially the scene where Anderson beats someone up in the barber shop you see that this goes against his principles.The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. The soundtrack is by Lannie Spann McBride she made the very powerful song ''Walk On By Faith''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. Also Kitty Wells and Mahalia Jackson have made songs for the movie which are all beautiful.This movie is a beautiful movie with a perfectly cast. The music is very well made and used. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are a perfect duo and should do more movies together they fit the term '' good cop bad cop '' perfectly as Gene Hackman really does look as a hardened bad cop and Dafoe as good cop. What they shouldn't have done was basing it on a real story because clearly the director didn't want to be restrained because a lot was different in the movie than what really happened only a couple of things are historically correct asides from that it's a must watch I give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10 so a small 9 out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "When three young civil rights workers two white and one black going missing in the deep south of America the FBI send two agents in to investigate.  Liberal young agent Ward and cynical local agent Anderson both approach the case in different ways however both come up against a wall of silence and racism which seems to go all the way through the community making their task near impossible.What do I mean when I say this is a bit too much of a film?  Well the issues history and settings here are all semifactual and therefore should be quite an interesting film that attacks the heart.  Instead however it is a thriller type film  and this becomes more and more evident as it goes on. The final 30 minutes set aside themes and discussion and go right for a thriller climax with enjoyable touches.  However it does lose sight of the issues although in fairness it didn't have too good a grasp on them in the first place.The film never really sets out to do much more than paint the community as racist  and it does it rather too easily.  All the white racists are painted as inbred and monstrous I'm not complaining! while the black characters are all pretty much a silent group of extras.  I understand why the film did it this way as to allow development of characters on both sides would have caused the thriller side of it to become baggier and less effective.  As it is the broad strokes still work because I don't think many of us need to really be convinced that such racism is tolerable it's easier just to cut out the debate in a thriller.The plot is pretty good and does paint the black situation pretty well.  It works best as a thriller though and early attempts to show the divide and so on are slowly moved to the back burner in favour of thriller touches.  Aside from a total lack of black characters and a tendency just to pigeon hole the white characters the cast do a reasonable job with plenty of well known faces.  Dafoe is good in the lead despite being a little too wideeyed for a FBI agent in charge of a major case.  Also watching it now it's funny at times because he sounds very like Agent Smith when he says Mr Anderson'. Hackman overplays to good effect and he steals almost every scene he is in although his romancing of McDormand is a little drawn out.  The support cast includes some reasonable turns from wellknown faces including Dourif Ermey and Tobolowsky.Overall this film has a reputation for being a quite powerful issue film. However it reality it is more a thriller which uses this setting of racial hatred as it's background and driver rather than looking into it as a debate.  In fairness it doesn't suffer for this and is actually an enjoyable film which also serves as a reminder of a very common situation only a few short years ago.".

Hackman overplays to good effect and he steals almost every scene he is in although his romancing of McDormand is a little drawn out.  The support cast includes some reasonable turns from wellknown faces including Dourif Ermey and Tobolowsky.Overall this film has a reputation for being a quite powerful issue film. However it reality it is more a thriller which uses this setting of racial hatred as it's background and driver rather than looking into it as a debate.  In fairness it doesn't suffer for this and is actually an enjoyable film which also serves as a reminder of a very common situation only a few short years ago.";

	schema:reviewBody "When three young civil rights activists disappear in rural Mississippi in 1964 the FBI are called in to investigate. As racial tensions rise in a state which still has segregation the local police department are implicated and the case becomes a media frenzy. Can the feds find the missing men and prove what happened ?Mississippi Burning is an incendiary movie. It doesn't worry about whom it offends and it doesn't shy away from the most horrible aspects of its drama. It presents the good old Jim Crow redneck South in a manner guaranteed to upset pretty much everybody and leaves itself wide open to criticism on a lot of fronts why do the heroes have to white why do the cops all have to be Ku Klux Klan members why do the feds resort to exactly the kind of hateful violence and intimidation they're there to put an end to do we really need to see people beaten lynched and humiliated every ten minutes and what qualifies British director Parker to depict American society in so negative a way ? All these are legitimate complaints but the answer to them all is pretty simple  that's just the way things were. Segregation was a way of life. Black voter registration in places like fictitious Jessup County was almost negligible. The movie's key exchange is when Hackman says If I were a Negro I'd probably think the same way they do. and Dafoe retorts If you were a Negro nobody would give a damn what you thought.. It takes two points of view  Dafoe's idealism and Hackman's easygoing pragmatism  and turns them into each other with McDormand as the lynchpin in the middle and all three performances are terrific. The supporting cast is very strong with Dourif and Rooker in particular as two of the scariest cops in any movie. Peter Biziou's bright day  dark night photography which won an Oscar in authentic rural Mississippi locations adds to the tension as does the grim score by Trevor Jones. It's an unpleasant film but a brilliant one and no matter how you may react to it it forces you to evaluate your own feelings about the issues and to recognise that America has always been a country with a huge gulf between the haves and the havenots. Loosely based on the reallife ChaneyGoodmanSchwerner murder case of 1964 in Neshoba County albeit with much dramatic licence. This was the third in a great trio of strange and powerful dramas Parker made in the eighties the other two being Birdy and Angel Heart and is amongst his best work.".

The problem is not with the ongoing story of how the Fed's crack the case.This is fiction based on fact and as a police story it works fine.THE COMPROMISE 1 the FBI. J.Edger Hoover in 1964 was possibly the most powerful man in the country with a file on everyone of importance or power.The FBI was his private fiefdom. Mr.Hoover believed Martin Luther King was a Communist and had no sympathy for the Civil Rights Movement.This is mentioned in one small line of script.The Bureau would have to go after murderers but was certainly on no crusade. Mr.Hoover detested the Kennedys and only kept his job because he had enough info to destroy them.So how the Defoe character as a Kennedy man  got beyond a filing job is hard to say. Mr.Hoover used Hollywood to create the myth of the Gman this myth is still alive and kicking in this film.The Gene Hackman character had been a Mississippi sheriff and obviously part of a Bureau dirty tricks squad and we are expected to believe he has a bleeding heart under his badge. What would have made it interesting if his character was more truthful.The FBI was an all white agency and it certainly was not politically correct.Mr Hoover's views were no secret so rascism would certainly not effect anybody'career.Again this is hinted at in his speech about his father. 2the KKK It seems the whole white community in the South is a member which oversimplifies the situation a lot.

It also ignores the fact that segregation had been twisted into the very fabric of the Southern states post Confederacy identity. 3the AfricanAmericans The docile passivitygospel singing over ashes of churches and the lack of anger is patronising in the extreme.The Civil rights movement was born in South and the churches were its most vocal advocates.Maybe if this film had been made in the 70's rather than the 80's these major background issues would not have been ignored.".

	schema:headline " Unscrupulous maid of honour produces neither comedy nor romance";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a popcorn movie a chick flick that leaves a lot to be desired all around in the ethics department. Normally I am a huge fan of Julia Roberts but in this woeful tale she fails to come across as her typical vulnerable and endearing self.The improbable plot revolves around a food critic Julianne who learns just days before the wedding that her long time best friend and former lover Michael is about to be married to a lovely rich blonde girl named Kimberly. In fact Michael invites Jules to be...no not his best man...but the maid of honour. Jules flies from her home in New York to Chicago for the wedding not to wish the newlyweds well but instead to steal Michael away from Kimmy and make sure the wedding never comes off at all. She has four days in which to convince the unsuspecting groom that she herself not Kimmy is the bride for him.My first of many problems with this unlikely tale is that former lovers do not tend to make ideal best friends for all the reasons revealed in this movie namely lingering passionate feelings and issues of jealousy. Furthermore Jules's second best friend as it were is also a man...her editor George who conveniently happens to be gay. Does this girl not have any female friends at all like most young women? Actually George comes off as the character in the movie with probably the most integrity which isn't saying a lot in this tale of immoral fluff. He's a true friend to Julianne flying from afar to be with her and offer comfort. He indeed gives Jules sound advice namely to just tell the guy she loves him and later when it's obviously not working out to graciously let Michael go. However George is cast as the stereotypical homosexual friend which has all been done to death by Hollywood. Jules pretends to be engaged to George in order to elicit jealousy from Michael just one of her countless lies but this fabrication doesn't seem to go anywhere. They never really officially undo the ruse. By the way I love Dionne Warwick's singing but found the entire singalong at the rehearsal dinner just too silly.Jules is a stellar example of the old expression...With friends like her who needs enemies? She's no friend at all to Michael much less a BEST one having no concern whatsoever for HIS happiness until possibly the very end. Instead she's essentially nothing more than a jealous ex lover who lies manipulates and connives. Jules uses every trick in the book to split up Michael and his fiance including attempting to get Michael fired allegedly at the behest of Kimmy and her dad. True she repents of this horrendous deed but it's hard to cheer for a heroine this unscrupulous. She doesn't get Michael in the end nor does she deserve him. One gets the impression that this is not true love but more a case of wanting what she cannot have. For some reason Scarlett O'Hara came to mind while I was watching this.Michael is indeed handsome but the description that comes to mind here is jerk. Frankly Kimmy can have him! I wouldn't want to marry a man that reminisced ad nauseum about old memories with a former girlfriend right in front of me four days before our wedding. Is he too clueless here to perceive how left out and potentially jealous Kimmy feels? I was practically waiting for him to bring up past sexual escapades with Jules and expect Kimmy to politely listen! Michael is surely one of the most insensitive grooms ever to grace the big screen. Also he sort of leads Jules on dancing rather romantically with her while they recall their old song. Not to mention jocular references to her about having seen her naked in the past. Not my idea of a nice platonic friendship for a man about to marry another woman.Personally I was cheering for the loving bride to be played to perfection by Cameron Diaz. Except that it's a little hard to buy her passive tolerance of her fianc's rather unusual close friendship with his ex girlfriend or her colossal stupidity in not seeing through Jules's motivations from the start. Otherwise she's definitely the sympathetic character of the piece as when Jules sets out to humiliate her rival by insisting Kimmy sing at the karaoke bar despite her vehement protests. Of course poor Kimmy is made to look like a female needing liberation when she announces that she's quitting college in the interests of her future husband and his career. Oh dear me no it would never do for anyone entering a marriage to contemplate any sort of personal sacrifice! I found the whole ladies washroom scene near the end tasteless and ridiculous when all the women are cheering on the potential verbal cat fight between Jules and Kimmy. Surely the screenwriters could have come up with better than this.Just an aside what is the point of the pathetic ice sculpture joke other than to be crude? I normally love the romantic comedy genre but the quality seems to be sadly deteriorating these days. This isn't the absolute worst movie I've ever seen but really it isn't that amusing a comedy nor is it much of a romance. Hopefully Jules experiences a bit of personal growth but that's about all that can be said for this story.".

She's no friend at all to Michael much less a BEST one having no concern whatsoever for HIS happiness until possibly the very end. Instead she's essentially nothing more than a jealous ex lover who lies manipulates and connives. Jules uses every trick in the book to split up Michael and his fiance including attempting to get Michael fired allegedly at the behest of Kimmy and her dad. True she repents of this horrendous deed but it's hard to cheer for a heroine this unscrupulous. She doesn't get Michael in the end nor does she deserve him. One gets the impression that this is not true love but more a case of wanting what she cannot have. For some reason Scarlett O'Hara came to mind while I was watching this.Michael is indeed handsome but the description that comes to mind here is jerk. Frankly Kimmy can have him! I wouldn't want to marry a man that reminisced ad nauseum about old memories with a former girlfriend right in front of me four days before our wedding. Is he too clueless here to perceive how left out and potentially jealous Kimmy feels? I was practically waiting for him to bring up past sexual escapades with Jules and expect Kimmy to politely listen! Michael is surely one of the most insensitive grooms ever to grace the big screen. Also he sort of leads Jules on dancing rather romantically with her while they recall their old song. Not to mention jocular references to her about having seen her naked in the past. Not my idea of a nice platonic friendship for a man about to marry another woman.Personally I was cheering for the loving bride to be played to perfection by Cameron Diaz. Except that it's a little hard to buy her passive tolerance of her fianc's rather unusual close friendship with his ex girlfriend or her colossal stupidity in not seeing through Jules's motivations from the start. Otherwise she's definitely the sympathetic character of the piece as when Jules sets out to humiliate her rival by insisting Kimmy sing at the karaoke bar despite her vehement protests. Of course poor Kimmy is made to look like a female needing liberation when she announces that she's quitting college in the interests of her future husband and his career. Oh dear me no it would never do for anyone entering a marriage to contemplate any sort of personal sacrifice! I found the whole ladies washroom scene near the end tasteless and ridiculous when all the women are cheering on the potential verbal cat fight between Jules and Kimmy. Surely the screenwriters could have come up with better than this.Just an aside what is the point of the pathetic ice sculpture joke other than to be crude? I normally love the romantic comedy genre but the quality seems to be sadly deteriorating these days. This isn't the absolute worst movie I've ever seen but really it isn't that amusing a comedy nor is it much of a romance. Hopefully Jules experiences a bit of personal growth but that's about all that can be said for this story.";

This film while not perfect is a shining example of what makes Julia so radiant and desirable in the right role.  And she sure gets it here.As Julianne Potter Julia gives the same sweet radiant glow she offered us in Pretty Woman.  Seems she's fallen in love with her best friend for ages Michael O'Neal Dermot Mulroney  unfortunately it's on the eve of his wedding to an effervescent perky girl Cameron Diaz who does her darndest to make Julianne her best friend...as well as her maidofhonor.  Of course Julianne does what any rightthinking young lady would do everything in her power to break up the wedding of the title.This is not as melodramatic as it sounds this is in fact one of the brightest smartest and allaround funniest comedies of the decade.  All the lead characters make the absolute most of their parts and revel in the glory of love doubledealing and flatout lying.  Along with being extremely romantic this has to be the most cleverlyplotted love story ever for every plot thought up by Julianne there's a twist or foulup that has everything to do with true love andor blind devotion.There are great faces in the background too.  Susan Sullivan Philip Bosco the great M. Emmet Walsh all lend able support and offer their own fine support.  But how can I mention them in the same paragraph without adding Rupert Everett into the fray?  As Julianne's gay editorfriend he adds great color to all his scenes especially at the dinner with the wedding party at the seafood restaurant you've seen it you know what I mean.I won't spoil anything by saying that true love wins out in the end face it would you WANT to see Julia Roberts as a BAD GUY?  Maybe you would but not in a romantic comedy.  In fact the main surprises lie in the twists and turns that lie throughout this film.  Every twist makes the story all the more interesting and incidentally funny.  Of course the music makes the proceedings all the better with a heavy assist from Dionne Warwick on two occasions.So to recap what else can I say if you love Julia Roberts love stories comedies and weddings here's your movie.Ten stars and a copy of Dionne Warwick's Greatest Hits on CD for My Best Friend's Wedding where true love wins but true friendship comes in a close second.Keep up the good work Julia.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe some of the negative comments I read from other contributors reviewing this movie.I own this movie on video and have seen it many times and have enjoyed it each and every time. I think this is easily one of the best comedies to come out of the 90s and I actually place it on my personal best films ever list.I can't see what people don't like about this movie.First of all these people who question how can they like a movie where the main character is so rotten just cracks me up. First of all it's a movie people it's not real life. Second of all Julia Roberts' character is not a rotten person. Her character simply gets wrapped up in the moment and loses her judgment momentarily it's a COMEDY people!!.Near the end of the movie her best friend played by Rupert Everett even asks her if she's sure she's acting out of love or out of some desire to win. I think the movie clearly shows that Julia's character and her long time friend and one time boyfriend played by Dermot Mulroney have had a long and deep friendship and that there are certainly strong feeling between the two. The fact that they made a pact years ago that if both were unmarried by the time they turned 28 they would marry each other underscores this. The movie plays itself out that Julia's character has basically always reassured herself that if she weren't to find some knight in shining armor she would always have her old boyfriend who she does love just not in a romantic way anymore though she takes the length of the movie to realize this to marry.The movie is extremely well directed. The blocking where the actors stand in relation to the camera and what is shownrevealed either to the audience or to other characters is top notch.The pacing is great with hardly a slowdown in the entire movie. Those times the movie does lessen the pace for a moment are to showcase a tender moment between Julia  Dermot. A particularly bittersweet scene is when Julia  Dermot share an afternoon taking a cruise through Chicago's downtown river. They share a song a hug and look into each other's eyes and we as the audience wait to see if they profess their true love for each other but the moment passes as they pass under a bridge and into the shadows and we realize that moments are fleeting and love can be fickle.The music is awesome in the movie with so much of it throughout the movie that the movie almost plays like a mini musical with various songs being sung in parts by characters throughout the movie.Rupert Everett is hysterical as the gay male friend and Dermot Mulroney is totally underrated in his thankless role as the putupon groom.Cameron Diaz gives one of her best performances as the cute as a button bride.This is an outstanding example of what a mainstream big Hollywood studio movie can be.Buy this movie. You'll enjoy it over and over for many years to come.".

And while the general consensus was that she was 'evil' and 'selfish' Jules struck me as more lovesilly and desperate than evil and conniving if any staunch negativity from Roberts part was intended then it wasn't wellacted at all. Roberts' character and the opposing guy both showed flaws and imperfections but such is often the case with troubled people trying to sort out their real feelings in order to make the best relationship decisions. Also up until the end her friend acted as if he was secretly in love with her as well so the ending aside from utterly depressing didn't really make sense unless that was also poor acting.

However the rest of this movie's humor ends up being ridiculous and somehow annoying. Besides this movie isn't sweet or truly romantic for a love story.Also the character played by Julia Roberts Julianne or simply Jules is pure evil rude jealous selfish and greedy. Her intentions are dark. What she does is really mean she tries to steal her best friend's bride to get him back but she Jules never let him love her when he loved her.Some catchy songs can be listened in this movie especially I Say a Little Prayer. The marriage at the end is beautifully made and the final scene is comical. Rupert Everett is hilarious in this movie and I like very much Cameron Diaz's character Kimmy Wallace in this movie. She's enchanting adorable sweet and beautiful the opposite of Jules.Overall this is a bitter and crude movie. Not a keeper or a movie to watch over and over.".

I can see why it wouldn't appeal to some people  Julia Roberts in a romantic comedy could be pretty slushy stuff but then again if you watch it wanting that sort of thing you're likely to be disappointed.  Yes so it is romantic and even a bit slushy at times but has a sharp script and fast pace which keep you amused 95 of the time.One of the things which appealed to me was the way moments of melodrama were defused into comedy  check out the two girls' confrontation with an audience of women gathered by the call Catfight! whose oohs and aahs forestall any emotional reaction we ourselves may have to the scene.Some of the camerawork is also more interesting than one might expect with particularly powerful closeups where one or two faces fill the screen. Julia Roberts' beauty comes through in a long shot which starts to look like a shampoo commercial long curly hair spills around her head as she lies in despair on the floor the public safety message being don't ever sit with your back against a door which an irate exlover might wrench open at any minute nevertheless the proximity gives us an intimacy with her character we might otherwise miss.Another effective shot of this kind two heads on a pillow fill the screen drives home the theme touched on here of the devastatingly attractive gay man who is made doubly so by his inaccessibility as more fully explored in Object of my Affection.  George Rupert Everett is a fantastic character whose sense of fun wisdom sensitivity and English accent make him every girls' ideal object for unrequited love or maybe it's just me .The disappointing aspect for me was the film's final affirmation of sexist values and a rather superficial and onesided view of real love  but you 'll have to watch it to see if you agree with me on that.  Basically in my opinion some of the ending lacked the selfawareness and sharpness of the rest of the film.  However overall I would recommend it for an amusing and sometimes clever 90 minutes of celluloid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Julia Roberts' considerable on screen charisma anchors MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING a romantic comedy with a twist that may or may not have you cheering for our girl to come out on top. Roberts plays a food critic named Julianne who learns that her exboyfriend Michael Dermot Mulroney is getting married and he asks her to come to the wedding and be his Best Man. Upon her arrival for the wedding festivities and meeting the bridetobe Kim Cameron Diaz Julianne decides that she wants Michael back and pulls out every dirty trick she can think of to break them up. This mission gets complicated when the fiance asks Julianne to be her maid of honor. There are a lot of comic situations that arise from this premise but it is a little unsettling as well because deep down we know that what Julianne is doing is wrong but part of us wants her to win whether we want to admit or not because Roberts still manages to evoke our sympathies as Julianne especially when we learn that it is Julianne who broke off the relationship with Michael and that his new fiance gives him everything that Julianne couldn't't...like the ability to be affectionate in public but seeing Michael so happy ignites the Mr. Hyde in Julianne. She even asks her gay best friend George Rupert Everett to pretend to be her fiance to make Michael jealous. The scene where George tells Kim's family how he and Julianne met is hysterical. Whether or not Julianne succeeds in her mission should not be revealed here for those who haven't seen the filmbut know that the film works for the most part thanks to some smart writing a winning performance by Roberts and a scenestealing turn by Everett as George. It's not PRETTY WOMAN but if you accept that going in  it's a pleasant ride.".

	schema:headline " The best Hellraiser since Hellbound...";
	schema:reviewBody "Hellraiser Hellseeker has come under fire from viewers mostly for the economic manner in which iconic character Pinhead is used. The most refreshing thing about episode six here is that Pinhead goes back to what Clive Barker intended him to be. Sort of the equivalent of the zombies in Romero's Dead films if you get the drift. For those who don't the whole point is that what Pinhead does to the principal characters is not nearly as important as what the principal characters do to each other. He is the final hammer when the characters have finished dragging each other down and that is the way of all the best horror films. The real problem with Hellseeker is its lack of atmosphere. In the original Barker takes his time to introduce each element in particular the modest British family whose lives appear as regular as our own. Barker understood that relating to the victims and even the victimisers to some degree is a lot more important to an audience than a string of gruesome deaths. Rick Bota tries to provide similar setup but fails.It has been a bit of a while since I saw Ashley Laurence in a film and she is in fine form here. She could probably play this role in her sleep at times it almost seems like she is. One problem we have in Hellseeker is that some of the most important moments in her story are missing. In the original when we saw her open the box we grit our teeth in suspense as the very fabric of the reality around her dissolved and her conversation with Pinhead ensued. In the original these shots showing the cosmetic details of hell served a very important function. They created a sense of foreboding that gave the entire rest of the film foundation. Rick Bota unfortunately is not able to pace himself nor does he have an instinct for when too much really is too much. Characters in Hellseeker behave in ways that telegraph to the audience that some kind of twist is in the offing and while it is a good twist it is just an example of the fact that up to a point hell works best when it is subtle.Doug Bradley is back for the sixth time as everyone's favourite nailheaded character. Contrary to what some have suggested I do not believe he is so much cashing a paycheque in this film. I think he is just on autopilot because he can literally play this devious character in his sleep. The sayings mannerisms and motions are as natural to him as eating and sleeping are to us. Nobody knows whether it was his idea or Doug's to portray the Satan character as he were once a dapper English gent but Doug carries it off so well that he deserves an award. As seen in the third and particularly fourth films everything can be going to ruin around him and yet he will still effortlessly play this mannered gent who just happens to torture people as a job. The other cenobites do not get nearly as much screen time as was previously the case however and that also lets the side down somewhat. The sights of Chatterer and whatever that woman called herself really helped sell Pinhead as much as Pinhead himself at times. The other cenobites in Hellseeker are truly token appearances.They say your heroine is only as good as your villain and that is certainly the case here. Dean Winters is a great villain partly because he portrays the character so well but also because it takes a while for his status as the true villain of the piece to become apparent. One of Clive Barker's great touches in the original is that to an extent every victim deserves what happens to them. Most of the film is taken up with establishing why Winters' character deserves what he gets which makes the final twist of the film especially satisfying. It reestablishes Pinhead as a just if somewhat peculiar referee of hell. Seriously watch parts three then four then this one and try to reconcile each one with the statement made in the second it is not hands that call us it is desire. The whole conceit of The Hellbound Heart was that bored lowlifes seeking what they thought of as the ultimate in pleasure sought this box and opened it only to find that its inhabitants' definition of pleasure varied drastically from theirs.Unfortunately not every aspect of the film is well done. The special effects that closed the original Hellraiser were as fake as hell but the audience bought them because by that time the film had drawn the audience in. The problem in Hellseeker is that it takes its sweet time to hook the audience and thus the headsplit routine that looks like something I could have done with an old Amiga 500 goes down as one of the funniest effects in horror. It comes at exactly the wrong time producing laughs when what we needed was to be immersed in the Hellraiser atmosphere a little deeper. Normally a laugh can be a good thing especially when it comes at a time when the script or story could use it but if ever there were a bad time this is it. With the exception of Laurence Winters and especially Bradley the acting is also high school drama level at best. The loose women the work colleagues the doctors the general passersby in the street they all act as blank and vacant as Paris Hilton trying to feign having something relevant to say.When all is said and done Hellseeker is a seven out of ten. It is not nearly in the league of the first two films but it is a massive improvement over three and four. Give it a chance stop expecting Pinhead On Elm Street and you might be pleasantly surprised.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that although I am a huge fan of the first two films I had pretty much given up on this franchise.  Part 3 was just silly.  The intriguing potential of part 4 was chopped up into an incoherent mess.  Part 5 decided that it was just going to do its own thing and not really be a Hellraiser film.  What I'm trying to say here is that my expectations were low.Although Hellseeker isn't as good as Hellbound it's very satisfying because it's the first sequel since that has actually catered to fans of the original two films.  Kirsty's resurfacing is a huge factor in this the Hellraiser saga was never better than when it was her story.  Granted the focus isn't on her for most of the film.  However we are treated to a peek at her post Hellbound existence as well as some very startling revelations about her character.  Without giving anything away let's just say that what we learn about Kirsty is both incredibly disturbing and undeniably consistent with her previous behavior.  Her actions also shift the focus of the franchise away from the moralistic overtones of parts 3 4 and 5 back into the darker territory of the original Cenobites and their function.The filmmaking itself is adequate though it leaves much to be desired.  In his commentary director Rick Bota says that Kirsty and the other elements from the previous films have been minimized so as not to alienate people not in the Hellraiser fan base.  While this is understandable I would advise Mr. Bota to remember that the fan base is what is keeping the franchise alive.  Don't ignore us.  That said the alternate scenes on the disc need to be in the main film as they make it more enjoyable for those of us who have been following this thing since 1987.I would have liked to see more of the husbandwife scenes and less creepy Jacob's Ladder stuff.  Again the director's fault.  Make a note for next time.It would be interesting to see the next film build off of this one. Definitely a film horror fans will enjoy.".

What I'm trying to say here is that my expectations were low.Although Hellseeker isn't as good as Hellbound it's very satisfying because it's the first sequel since that has actually catered to fans of the original two films.  Kirsty's resurfacing is a huge factor in this the Hellraiser saga was never better than when it was her story.  Granted the focus isn't on her for most of the film.  However we are treated to a peek at her post Hellbound existence as well as some very startling revelations about her character.  Without giving anything away let's just say that what we learn about Kirsty is both incredibly disturbing and undeniably consistent with her previous behavior.  Her actions also shift the focus of the franchise away from the moralistic overtones of parts 3 4 and 5 back into the darker territory of the original Cenobites and their function.The filmmaking itself is adequate though it leaves much to be desired.  In his commentary director Rick Bota says that Kirsty and the other elements from the previous films have been minimized so as not to alienate people not in the Hellraiser fan base.  While this is understandable I would advise Mr. Bota to remember that the fan base is what is keeping the franchise alive.  Don't ignore us.  That said the alternate scenes on the disc need to be in the main film as they make it more enjoyable for those of us who have been following this thing since 1987.I would have liked to see more of the husbandwife scenes and less creepy Jacob's Ladder stuff.  Again the director's fault.  Make a note for next time.It would be interesting to see the next film build off of this one. Definitely a film horror fans will enjoy.";

	schema:reviewBody "The beginning of the fifth Hellraiser sequel raises something of a moral dilemma which is extremely rare for a horror movie. After the car crash Trevor our hero escapes from the car after it sinks to the bottom of the river and he rushes to the surface to get air then returns to attempt to save his wife. At that point my immediate reaction was that he deserves any suffering that comes to him since he left his wife on the bottom of the river to go and try to save himself. On the other hand it probably wouldn't have done much good had he remained down there and lost consciousness right there with her. I guess that's why they tell you on the airlines to secure your own oxygen mask and THEN help your kid.But while this early scene inspired in me an unusually complex combination of thoughts and emotions it unfortunately is unable to escape from the destructive presence of reality on the possibility of it happening the way it did. I am willing to suspend disbelief on the premise that the guy was screaming at his wife underwater through the window watching her drown right in front of his blurred eyes and therefore not necessarily able to think all that clearly but on the other hand riverbeds have an overwhelming tendency to be covered with big round hard windowbreaking rocks.When the investigation begins things start to get a little strange and we begin to realize that there is something weird about what happened in that crash. Evidently the car was found with the doors open which puts some serious holes in the story about not being able to get the doors open to save his wife. It turns out that he has come back with a spotted memory and that the crash that we saw at the beginning of the movie may not have been exactly how the event unfolded. Things seem to have happened that he doesn't remember.I found it highly amusing that the detective that always gave him a hard time because he didn't believe his story was named Detective Gibbons just because I recently took an Anthropology class in which I learned what a gibbon' is. I would NOT have been able to keep my cool with this guy though who was hugely overacting and throwing harsh accusations which were not necessarily unfounded but definitely a little too confident and if accusations can be this a little too accusatory.The best thing about this installment in the Hellraiser series is that it works on a psychological level with the main character. Granted this is nothing new in the horror genre but it is done very well here. We never know when he is seeing reality when he's dreaming when he's having delusions inaccurate flashbacks and there is plenty of opportunity for lots of twists and turns and thankfully these opportunities are not ignored. I hate it when movies do that see Hollow Man. Because of this we never expect things like the startlingly effecting scare in the vending machine one of my favorite scares in the movie.Pinhead has thankfully been given a much more prevalent role than he had in the rather disappointing Hellraiser Inferno the least Hellraiser movie of all of them and it's morbidly pleasing to see some of the familiar Cenobites return like Chatterer. The movie closes with the old leave him and take me' clich but as a whole it is a quality entry in the Hellraiser saga. It is wellwritten wellthought out almost unheard of for a horror movie these days and entertaining and most importantly it is more than just another cash in on a successful series. There are a lot of horror series' that are well past their time to pass away but as long as they keep putting this much thought and creativity into the Hellraiser films I say there is infinite opportunity for sequels.".

There's the same two tier story running consecutively and along different mysterious timelines both of which fail utterly to fuse into a single coherent timeline at the end of the film. There's the same solipsist nightmare how can one truly discern between reality and dreams when the dream state feels as 'real' as reality itself? The second movie from which Hellseeker shamelessly borrows is Angel Heart a masterpiece of cinematic horror featuring Mickey Rourke before his face went to hell as a result of high living screwed up plastic surgery and boxing not Pinhead and Robert DeNiro. Where Angel Heart is innovative Hellseeker is simply repetitive and boring. Where Mickey Rourke excels as the confused protagonist in Angel Heart Dean Winters sleepwalks his way through the role in Hellseeker and where DeNiro gets all the best lines poor Pinhead gets some of the most forgettable I've ever heard him utter.Granted compared with the other Hellraiser sequels all bar Hell on Earth which I have to say I enjoyed more than I or II this tries something different and maybe with a better lead role there'd be something there worthy of a couple more stars. But ultimately the confused mess of a plot destroys itself irrespective of Winters' deadpan portrayal.I give this rubbish one star for effort and one for the inclusion of Ashley Laurence who lets face it should really be above all this by now. Another star for Doug Bradley as Pinhead who never fails to send chills down my spine with his black 8ball eyes and his tendency to drag nine inch nails out of his own skull.Ultimately though Doug needs to share that last star with Clive Barker without whom the world would be a much duller place.".

I remembered I enjoyed the first one and we couldn't agree on a fourth movie so this was it. I didn't even know what number this one was but we watched it anyhow.I have to say I loved it as did my girlfriend. And she is very particular as to what she likes. She doesn't like most movies actually. She enjoyed it so much in fact she wants to see all the rest of them. We rented the first one last week she's never seen it and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well. But this one is still her favorite. I like 'em about the same.This one is very interesting all the way through and will keep you guessing until the end. Someone else said the last 20 minutes are the best and I agree.  But the whole movie was just awesome. I can't very well compare it to the rest of the series but it sounds like the third and fourth are widely regarded as the worst. I'll decide that for myself when I see them.I do know that Hellseeker fits very well as a sequel and would have been more than worthy to be a bigscreen feature.  There is no overuse of Pinhead and there is just enough gore but not too much.I give it 9 out of 10 stars. A few more cenobites would earn it a perfect 10. If you're holding off on this one because you think the series is going downhill SEE IT TODAY.  I can't wait until the seventh one comes out. With all the negative surrounding this one I had to throw in my two cents.".

As a matter of fact this movie is MUCH better than Soul Survivors and is sufficiently creepy and confusing that it should keep your interest.I for one don't mind the fact that Pinhead and the Cenobites rarely make an appearance. Keep in mind that the Cenobites were not the centerpiece of Barker's The Hellbound Heart the novella on which the original hellraiser was based. In fact the DVD commentaries for Hellraiser II Hellbound emphasize that Barker envisioned Julia as the main character in future entries in the series. I think that the roles played by the Cenobites in the most recent movies are much truer to the original intent than the overthetop Cenobites of Hellraiser III.The special effects are above average and put some much more expensive films to shame. We also get one of the most realistic corpses I believe I have ever seen. Unfortunately CSI has taken the edge off of this and Hollywood has become much more proficient at showing death in a realistic manner. I actually have only one major problem with this movie...SPOILER!! Towards the end of the movie a detective grows a second head to demonstrate his split personality. The effect is cheap and very silly. It is more appropriate to Men in Black II.END OF SPOILER So if you have an afternoon free try it out. It's not the Seventh Seal but it's the best Hellraiser in a long time.".

It's a plot device writers use when they've written themselves into a corner and need an easy way out. Now imagine a movie where this device is used after just about every scene. Sometimes repeatedly. As in it was all just a dream. Within a dream. Within another dream.. Well thankfully you never have to imagine such a movie as it already exists in the form of Hellraiser Hellseeker. Watching this movie is excruciatingly frustrating as the main character wakes from a dream to find himself in the hospital only to wake from a dream and find himself at the office then wake from a dream to find himself at home just to wake from a dream to find himself at the police station where he goes over the exact same story he has already told them before. Then repeat. Moving at a narrative speed of moss we just jump from one of four locations to another over and over and over and over with seemingly little in the way of plot or point. Further more you'd think the star of the movie also wrote it as every woman his character comes across throws themselves at him despite him being a very ordinary looking dull office worker. Guess that anonymity really turns the women on eh? Ashley Laurence is listed second in the credits but she is hardly in the movie making very little connection to the originals. But hey Pinhead is hardly in this one either with probably even less screen time than part 5 and like Inferno it all turns out to be more psycho babble Twilight Zone wannabe garbage. Just far more annoying worse written and without any good ideas at all. An utter atrocity that even the appearance of Doug Bradley can't save.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a GIANT fan of the original story by Clive Barker and I think the first two Hellraisers were the greatest horror films ever to be produced. But ever since Hellraiser 3 untalented directors wear out the name and use the villainicon Pinhead as a marketing instrument to tell lame and inferior horror stories. Hellseeker ranks as the sixth episode in the series and it is  along with Inferno  the weakest effort so far. The original charm has faded away completely and the tone and atmosphere doesn't come near the morbid and raw originals. The story of Hellseeker has got nothing to do anymore with the original characters Clive Barker created and they might as well could have given this movie a completely new surrounding. Heroine Ashley Laurence is dragged into this film for no particular reason. She doesn't show any resemblance with her original character and even Pinhead himself has gone through a complete metamorphosis. He once was a true symbol of all that represents evil but after 6 episodes he merely looks like a lame philosopher who prefers to plea instead of to kill. HellraiserHellseeker is an extremely boring experience with only a few remarkable scenes. And those particular scenes are in fact just a shadow of the ones in the original Hellraisers. It's nothing more than a mediocre attempt to build up a mystery tale. The first hour of this film is a series of hallucinations and illogical dreamsequences. Director Rick Bota constantly tries to fool the audience with plottwists but actually the audience doesn't give a damn! The last 15 minutes of Hellseeker are the only ones worth seeing. Both Kirsty's and Pinhead's screen time are entirely in those minutes and it's the only time the script actually makes a bit sense. If you manage yourself to struggle through the first hour you'll see a more or less satisfying ending. If the rumors are true there will be two more sequels coming out in 2004 . Knowing myself a bit I'll most likely see them...but my expectations have never before been so low!".

Alarm bells start ringing in your head by the halfway point and you're constantly saying to yourself  Trevor can't be dead and in hell because they did that in the previous movie  . Alas however as much as you don't want that to happen the producers have plagiarized the exact same plot from INFERNO What makes this worse is that this sequel apart from being unoriginal is a much dumber film . INFERNO did have the decency to remain enigmatic and it was left to the audience to join up the dots as to how and why Craig Sheffer's cop finds himself in hell . Unfortunately here everything is explained which throws up more of its own problems . The Cenobites catch up with Kirsty so she makes a deal to give Pinhead and his cohorts five souls in return for her life . Why would he agree when he wasn't so negotiable in the first movie ?

	schema:headline " Finaly a decent sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah franchises. By a rule horror movies usually have hacked sequels only intended to squeeze a few bucks out of cash udders.  This chapter in the Hellraiser series. well it's defiantly a squeeze of the Franchise Teat. It suffers from who cares it's directtovideoitis' it needs rewrites it is lowbudget and has too many cheap thrills.  Sometimes I felt like I was watching video linking clips from a computer game.Having said that Hellseeker breathes a long fresh breath into the series. While 1  2 were fascinating explorations of horror and imagination 3  4 were Pinhead comes to lifekillsis destroyedwill be back' slasher clichs.  Thankfully Hellseeker takes a quite different messwithyourmind' path. A man Trevor who lost his wife in a car accident Kirsty Cotton from 1  2 is assaulted by conflicting memories perverse nightmares and amnesia.  To top it all Kirsty's body was never found and when it's revealed that she was due a large inheritance the police suspect foul play.  Slowly Trevor pieces his shattered memories together.  But his mistresses are dying horribly around him and though all fingers point to Trevor he can't quite remember killing them.  And who are those pale mutilated leather clad people who pop in and out of his memories especially the tall eloquent one with the pins in his head?Speaking of Pinhead the movie uses him judiciously as the fine spice he is rather than trying to saturate the screen with him as 3  4 did. Or just for franchise cameo value as in 5.  My only complaint is his makeup.  I had the honor of meeting Doug Bradley recently and he is quite slim.  So why does he look so terribly bloated in this?  Also  Hellraiser 2 Hellbound had the perfect exit for his character and as much as he is my favorite monster he never should have been brought back.  But a franchise needs a monster I suppose.  Too bad Hollywood never figured out that the monster of the original film was Desire.As much as I like this film it's sad because it has so much potential. What's going on' stories are fun but they lose their edge if they leave you hanging clueless for too long.  Perhaps if there were only three murders instead of five more coherent plot could have been written between the onslaughts of realitynightmare twists. and is Trevor really such a catch that all these hot sluts keep throwing themselves at him?  Since Kirsty is essential to the plot there should have been more flashbacks with her in them especially to explain just who the hell she is to Hellraiser firsttimers.  The ending is a very pleasant surprise I never saw it coming and I usually do but it is in dire need of editing.  What Trevor's says and does after the truth is revealed to him is quite unnecessary  deadens the impact.The directing is competent but artless. While the story is good there's no sense of tone.  There are glimpses of a central theme the contrast between who we want to be as opposed to who we think we are but it is sadly underdeveloped.  As Pinhead says at the end Welcome to the worst nightmare of all reality.' If you think I'm pretentious for speaking of directing a horror movie as an art film go rent 1  2 the unrated version to see why so many fell in love with the series before it turned into a Cheap Horror Franchise and why we keep hoping that another movie like them could be made.  But sadly Franchisewood thinks we're few and far between amongst those who just want boobs  blood.All in all I was pleasantly surprised.  Hellseeker has flaws but it is much much better than a directtovideo 6th episode of an exploited franchise should be.  I rate it 7 out of 10.".

Sometimes I felt like I was watching video linking clips from a computer game.Having said that Hellseeker breathes a long fresh breath into the series. While 1  2 were fascinating explorations of horror and imagination 3  4 were Pinhead comes to lifekillsis destroyedwill be back' slasher clichs.  Thankfully Hellseeker takes a quite different messwithyourmind' path. A man Trevor who lost his wife in a car accident Kirsty Cotton from 1  2 is assaulted by conflicting memories perverse nightmares and amnesia.  To top it all Kirsty's body was never found and when it's revealed that she was due a large inheritance the police suspect foul play.  Slowly Trevor pieces his shattered memories together.  But his mistresses are dying horribly around him and though all fingers point to Trevor he can't quite remember killing them.  And who are those pale mutilated leather clad people who pop in and out of his memories especially the tall eloquent one with the pins in his head?Speaking of Pinhead the movie uses him judiciously as the fine spice he is rather than trying to saturate the screen with him as 3  4 did. Or just for franchise cameo value as in 5.  My only complaint is his makeup.  I had the honor of meeting Doug Bradley recently and he is quite slim.  So why does he look so terribly bloated in this?  Also  Hellraiser 2 Hellbound had the perfect exit for his character and as much as he is my favorite monster he never should have been brought back.  But a franchise needs a monster I suppose.  Too bad Hollywood never figured out that the monster of the original film was Desire.As much as I like this film it's sad because it has so much potential. What's going on' stories are fun but they lose their edge if they leave you hanging clueless for too long.  Perhaps if there were only three murders instead of five more coherent plot could have been written between the onslaughts of realitynightmare twists. and is Trevor really such a catch that all these hot sluts keep throwing themselves at him?  Since Kirsty is essential to the plot there should have been more flashbacks with her in them especially to explain just who the hell she is to Hellraiser firsttimers.  The ending is a very pleasant surprise I never saw it coming and I usually do but it is in dire need of editing.  What Trevor's says and does after the truth is revealed to him is quite unnecessary  deadens the impact.The directing is competent but artless. While the story is good there's no sense of tone.  There are glimpses of a central theme the contrast between who we want to be as opposed to who we think we are but it is sadly underdeveloped.  As Pinhead says at the end Welcome to the worst nightmare of all reality.' If you think I'm pretentious for speaking of directing a horror movie as an art film go rent 1  2 the unrated version to see why so many fell in love with the series before it turned into a Cheap Horror Franchise and why we keep hoping that another movie like them could be made.  But sadly Franchisewood thinks we're few and far between amongst those who just want boobs  blood.All in all I was pleasantly surprised.  Hellseeker has flaws but it is much much better than a directtovideo 6th episode of an exploited franchise should be.  I rate it 7 out of 10.";

Kirsty's back and so I'm thinking Hey cool another backandforth between her and Pinhead. Only by the time that actually sorta happens I could not give a crap IMDB won't let me swear about anything in this movie. And her acting it's terrible compared to the first 2. She seems bored not scared etc.The main character is a joke. Same blank expression on his face for the entire film. And his actions make no damn sense. If you kept waking up in strange places every 5 minutes would you just go on about your day and pretend it never happened? Well he does over and over again. Must take a pretty relaxed guy to not mind something like that especially when dead bodies start showing up.I think what really makes me hate this movie so much is that there was NO reason for it to be labeled as a Hellraiser. Pinhead shows up once in a while but it might as well be anyone speaking his lines. I didn't see anyone unlock the box until near the end in one of the hundreds of flashbacks and it's KIRSTY! I don't care what kind of argument you're in with your husband you would never call demons upon yourself just to shut him up. And another thing when she offers Pinhead a bargain of 5 souls in exchange for hers he TAKES THE OFFER! Is my memory all messed up or did he not agree to any bartering in the first OR second film?Oh god I wish I'd run out of steam on this but there's so much more.The film was badly thought out badly written badly shot badly acted and even the special effects were below average. Even at the cheapest looking moments in this franchise I've seen better or at least more interesting visuals. Terrible CGI effects throughout don't' expect ANY fun violence. They seem to try to make up for the loss of blood with the injection of way to much sex. This guy seems to be getting laid by every woman in town while he's crazy no less.There is NOTHING good to take away from this and I'm very lenient on horror films especially in the Hellraiser series. This piece of garbage is devoid of everything the original stood for and Clive Barker is I'm sure very ashamed at this bit of nonsense.OK I'm done. What a wasted night.By the way it makes me sick to see the glowing reviews on this film obviously from those involved with it's promotional team. Please IMDb carefully look at when these people created their accounts in relation to the date the movie was released. There is no doubt in my mind that these are forgeries. For God's sake they all have the same headline The best since Hellbound. No it is not it is the worst in the series. I hope 7 and 8 are even remotely better.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a pretty good sequel in this series my favorites in order 1 2 6 4 5 3. Bringing back the Kirsty Cotton character was the best thing for this series. Maybe I'm a sucker for female heroes. Let's face it sequels seem better with more familiar faces Halloween and Jamie Lee Curtis being prime examples although I thought 'H20' and 'Resurrection' weren't very good she definitely brought them up a few levels.This franchise is so strange it keeps continuity the building in part 3 returns in part 4 part 4 occurs way in the future making all other sequels after it flashbacks but the series never screws the viewer over by trying to pretend the events of the previous films never happened take that Halloween Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street!. But Hellraiser does suffer from taking itself too seriously making 3  4 almost laughable. 5 suffered from and unsympathetic character and 6 borders on that same edge. Kirsty ties this movie together so nicely because she brings the past back to the present and we feel for her because we know her already.Actingwise I think this is the best of the series followed by the first two. Plotwise it follows the first twothis is a sequel where you need not watch parts 35 before seeing it. The series' advantage over other horror franchises is that it's linear and nonlinear at the same time. Watch the first two in order and the others in any other order you choosethe continuity doesn't suffer. Or you can forget 35 and watch 1 2 and 6 and have your own little KirstyPinheadtrilogy.But I won't completely sugarcoat this film. Kirsty's not in it much and Pinhead and the Lament Configuration are in it even less. The main character is quasiunsympathetic but based on the plot you're really not supposed to know what to feel for him. I found myself confused a few times but everything wrapped up at the end. The specialeffects are on par with part 5so it's pretty much the best in the series on that level too. I think the editing could have been a bit better as it cut from some scenes too quickly or left the viewer lost for a minute or two before catching up but overall it wasn't that bad and there were some very nice transitions. One or two things are never completely resolved or are intentionally left to the viewer's imagination and I haven't figured them out yet.My favorite thing about this film is it's length it knows when to quit it's not too long and not too short. If only the series would know when to quit. Coming soon 'Hellraiser Deader' and 'Hellraiser Hellworld'and possibly a 'VS.' film against another franchise villainthat truly will be 'hell on earth.' And not in a good way".

The point is Hellraiser is NOT about Cenobites it is about SUFFERING.  The complaint not enough Pinhead is the exact same complaint movie execs at Miramax had of the legendary unreleased version of Bloodline causing the original director to quit a great movie and have someone else sloppily film a lot more Pinhead scenes and throw it all together.The This movie was FAR better than Inferno which reduces Pinhead to basically a mafia boss Pinhead would NEVER refer to himself as The Engineer because as any true Hellraiser fan knows they are two completely different entities within Hell.  It is better than Hell On Earth which did give good insight into Pinhead's human past but basically was a slasher flick in the vein of Friday the Thirteenth.  While lacking perhaps in the imagination of the original two the story at least holds up better than Bloodline so I would have to say that it is about par with that movie as it has its faults also.Excellent acting by Dean Winters throughout the movie even though I had figured out a majority of the mystery revolving around Trevor's amnesia I was actually surprised by the twist at the end.  The soundtrack was a little uninspired as are most these days and there was a few corny bits within the movie particularly the good cop bad cop routines with the detectives investigating Trevor's past.Watch Hellraiser and Hellbound again to get back into the mood of the original concept and never NEVER forget  Hell is NOT about who you'll meet or by what means you get there it is forever ONLY about the sweet suffering!".

Yep it seems like he might have done it to inherit her secret fortune. If this sounds like a cheap 'Lifetime' movie it should because it looks and feels like one. Hellseeker is in no way a horror film but rather a very poorly done cop thriller with violent erotic overtones. The central character is about as interesting as ear wax and we basically get to watch this guy wake up to find out it was all a dream about one hundred times. Outrageously insulting to the intelligence it was a chore to sit through this crap. If you think the presence of Ashley Laurence as Kirsty somehow legitimizes this film think again she is barely in the film and was obviously included in this shameful production to attract fans of the originals. Hellseeker does have an effectively dark look to it but nothing special in that department either. It is amazing how the same idea can work or fail depending on the filmmakers. This similar approach worked beautifully in Hellraiser Inferno a truly fine lowbudget film noir piece. This one is sunk by boring camera work a stupid unsuspenseful tale involving people that we care nothing about and drenched with really bad erotic scenes. In fact there is so much of that I found myself waiting for Pinhead's nude scene.. Luckily it never happened but that could have only added something to this total waste of film. For fans of intense and psychological horror i do recommend Hellraiser Deader which might be saddled with an unimaginative title but is actually quite a disturbing and gritty mind bender filmed in the dark and mysterious city of Bucharest. And for those who like some artistic quality to accompany the story i can recommend Inferno. Those are two worthy titles in this hitormiss series..".

Hellraiser is such an interesting idea and I think there is so much room for excellent stories in the universe. So far I've seen the first the second the fifth and this one. The first was a good introduction but the story was a tad... shall we say 'dull'. The second really wasn't all that goodsorry fan community I know many people love it but it just seemed poorly directed to me and the fifth while having a quite good idea was poorly executed. This is my second favorite of the bunch after the original film. By far the greatest story. Certainly the most impressive visuals apart from arguably the first. The somewhat Lukewarm direction and lessthanstellar acting brings my final rating down a few notches sadly but don't let that fool you... it's a film that should be seen by any fan big or small of Hellraiser. The plot is very very good and the way it's told the way it evolves is great. The twists and pieces of the puzzle will keep you guessing to the final outcome and I doubt anyone will be able to figure it out prematurely. The effects are some of the best of the franchisewell what I've seen of it so far at least. This contains some of the most disturbing visuals and ideas of the films I've seen in the franchise. I recommend this to any fan of Hellraiser or Douglas Bradley. A great film one to make sure to watch for even the least elitist of Hellraiser fans. 710".

David agrees on the condition that she go on a world tour with him if they win the 150000 prize as an experiment. She reluctantly agrees over the initial objections of her oafish fianc Fred who agrees to hold the ticket. When it turns out that they have drawn a horse in the race Fred urges them to sell the ticket for the 12000 asking price but they turn him down. Although their horse loses Jean is furious to learn that Fred had sold her half of the ticket. Even though David doesn't know about it she feels obligated to share the 6000 with him. After he buys her a car with her half she agrees to a scaleddown version of their tour to Niagara Falls where they register as brother and sister.

I mean here you have the beautiful Ginger Rogers who by the way reminds me of Esther Williams in this movie and a complete stranger who manages to enchant her out of the blue. It's every man's dream to find that beautiful girl and for me I spent the whole movie wishing Colman luck in getting Rogers. So for those of you who say the plot is improbable it is but thats the point. I think the movie is supposed to reflect every man's wishful fantasy not reality.The chemistry between Ginger and Colman was all right not the best I agree but still it wasn't awful. If you are going to be watching this movie I suggest you watch it with an open mind don't consider the improbability or anything else just follow the plot and don't think too hard. Do that at least the first time cause thats the way it was supposed to be viewed in my opinion.The only thing I didn't like was the ending of the movie. The court room scene seemed a little bit rushed and not the kind of ending one would like. The beginning was OK it set up the movie. The middle was very good witty romantic and comical. And you would expect it to finish comically but I agree with the previous posts that the producers seem to have run out of ideas. Nevertheless it is worth watching for the middle part alone. Enjoy.".

Well here Lewis Milestone has directed just such a formula tale. But he more famous for such films as ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT has handled the genre with such a light touch that the result is delightful. Mind you I don't say the film is top 100 quality but what's not to like about a Sacha Guitry romantic comedy featuring Ronald Colman and Ginger Rogers and ending with a courtroom scene common to this type of film in the 1930's and 1940's presided over by Henry Davenport as Judge?We start out with Colman as some sort of mystery artist accosted by Rogers with a harebrained scheme to win the Irish sweepstakes if only he will go halvers with her.  He wished her Good Luck one morning you see and immediately she was given a lovely dress by a complete stranger. So naturally she knew he was a sure token of good luck. She wants the money for her honeymoon but Ronald has an idea of his ownhe wants her to go with him on the honeymoon strictly Platonic of course. To make a long story a bit shorter Ginger doesn't like the idea but Ronnie persuades her fiance Jack Carson that it's O.K. Don't ask how! so she finally agrees. They draw a horse on their ticket if you don't know how the Irish Sweepstakes worked there isn't room here to explain it all but the horse doesn't win. However Jack has sold onehalf of the ticket for 6000 on the strength of the horse. He gives this to Ginger who gives it to Ronnie who arranges the trip and buys a car in Ginger's name. After considerable pussyfooting around it becomes clearer by the minute that Plato is going to lose this one. Ronnie gets cold feet and beats it in the car bought in Gingers's name. Naturally he is arrested for car theft Ginger is arrested for possessing a stolen painting I told you Ronnie as a mystery artist Jack is arrested for breaking down Ginger's hotel room door he got jealous after all and they all end up in Henry Davenport's courtroom.Now don't read another word if you don't already know the outcome but if you are of the female persuasion and had the choice of Ronald Colman or Jack Carson whom would you choose. This courtroom scene is not the best of this sort which I mentioned was common to the period but it does serve to sort things out. It may be corn but it is lovely sweet corn and not from Iowa. Light sparkling comedy was Sacha Guitry's stock in trade.".

Having said that this is far from Colman's best film but it is pleasant enough. Due to the era  1940  one might expect this to be a screwball comedy. Rather it is a sophisticated comedy so don't expect to laugh out loud...it's just not that kind of film. Ginger Rogers is also very pleasant here and Jack Carson plays his role of jilted fianc perfectly he really was quite a versatile actor. Some people believe that the obvious difference in the age of Colman and Rogers makes this film improbable yet I can imagine Hepburn and Tracy in the star roles and that age difference wouldn't have bothered us. Spring Byington is pleasant but in terms of the character actors who fill out the playbill it is  as is often the case  Harry Davenport as the judge that really shines here.As a Colman fan I enjoyed this film.

	schema:headline " A Lesser Known Film That's Engagingly Funny";
	schema:reviewBody "Lucky Partners released in 1940 paired Ginger Rogers with Ronald Colman. The movie starts with Colman Dave Grant wishing a stranger Good Luck! as he passes her Rogers playing Jean Newton on the sidewalk catching her off guard. After a brief exchange they continue on their ways. Right away the director is letting us know that this is a whimsical story so criticisms about its implausibility should be few.It turns out that Jean who is engaged to Freddy played by Jack Carson crosses paths with Dave again sending the story of this romantic comedy on its way. I was pleased to find this film uses both broad humor and comedic subtlety with elements of farce. Director Lewis Milestone uses a deft touch to keep us guessing at the next plot twist and to keep the chuckles coming. I'm afraid I was not cognizant of Milestone's accomplishments before seeing Lucky Partners. He won the Academy Award for All Quiet on the Western Front and directed the excellent Front Page and the quirky Hallelujah I'm a Bum. Milestone was known for his innovative filming techniques and his quirky sense of humor. Ronald is his usual smooth self does anyone else think Hugo Weaving was copying his voice in V for Vendetta? Ginger who I am partial to plays her vivacious funnyface persona. She would win the Academy Award for her role in Kitty Foyle also released in 1940.There are some humorous supporting cast portrayals particularly the hotel maid who is the victim of Ginger's curious behavior.Before it ends the story morphs into a mystery that resolves in a courtroom setting.Watch how the director creates viewer interest by allowing action to occur offscreen he is very good at that. When the two men go into the back alley to fight offscreen watch Ginger's face. And you can see the moment crossing the bridgewhen Ginger realizes how much she cares for Ronald accomplished without wordsevidence of Milestone's silent film experience.I really enjoyed this film.".

With Ronald Colman and Ginger Rogers as its stars this is hardly a surprise. Though some disagree it seems to me that the main conceit is completely plausible. Out of the blue a stranger Colman wishes a bookseller Rogers Good luck as he passes her on the street. As it happens she immediately has a stroke of good fortune. Mild superstition being as realistic a trait as you're likely to find in any character she decides to try her new luck with an Irish Sweepstakes ticket going in on it with Colman for good measure. We see that he's an artist with some sort of personal secret who has been living in selfimposed isolation for some years. He seems about ready for some interpersonal contact again and Rogers is an undeniably pleasant subject for interpersonal contact. Thus his experiment.These circumstances are then played out in the expected screwball fashion with a heavy accent on the romantic. The RogersColman pairing isn't exactly lightning caught in a bottle but it's pleasant the supporting characters Spring Byington Jack Carson others are more than competent. Playing Ginger's aunt Byington even gets the best line in the movie. About the French novel she's been caught reading I know it's not exactly moral but the French make everything seem so logical. So things are going along okay until as someone said they appear to run out of ideas and resort to a final courtroom scene. Not an uncommon way to end a movie in those days this one is uniquely lifeless and uninspired. We mostly lose the thread of our stars' love storyhi jinks and replace these with...what? I'm not sure. I'm not even enamored of Henry Davenport's performance as the judge too cute by half IMHO which admittedly may make me unique. In any event that ending might cause you to forget that what had preceded it hadn't been half bad 610 stars.".

That's because no matter how good the middle of the movie was and it was SIGNIFICANTLY better the main plot idea was so fatally flawed and dumb that the film was majorly handicapped at the onset. Then to top it off the film managed to have an even worse endingmaking it a truly terrible film overall.As far as the plot goes Ginger and Ronald don't know each other but when they pass on the street Ronald wishes her good luck. And surprisingly good luck seems to come her way immediately afterwords. So using movie logic Ginger reasons that Ronald is so lucky that they should both buy a lottery ticket together. While this is farfetched this COULD have worked. However then when Ronald agrees BUT only on the stipulation that if they win she should accompany him on a vacation the script just makes no sense at allespecially since she is already engaged to Jack Carson. So as you can see from the onset the film is hindered by impossibly stupid and contrived events.Now as I said above despite these problems this COULD have still been a delightful filmespecially since when they DO go on the trip together the film is very romantic and likable. HOWEVER the last 15 minutes or so are absolutely dreadful!!! It was obvious that the writers had no idea what to do with the story so they contrived the arrest of Ronald Colman and a subsequent trialeven though there isn't any real evidence any crime has been committed. They could have just checked the registration to figure out the car was not stolen but instead it becomes a HUGE trial and all normal court procedure as we know it is out the window!!! Ronald is his own lawyer and asks a lot of annoying questions. This is odd but COULD have happened in a real court case. However when the judge later lets Ginger take over as the prosecutor and ask Ronald such questions as do you love me? the film hits an absolute low as far as common sense goes.Aside from films like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and TOMMY this is one of the worst films I have seen in some time. Giving it a 3 was VERY charitable and only occurred because the middle of the film DID work well. Avoid this like the plague as I doubt either Ginger or Ronald made anything worseand this DOES include THE STORY OF MANKIND! YUCK!!!".

Shame it was something of a letdown.It starts nicely enough with a fortuitous meeting between Colman and Rogers after the latter has started her mundane work day by receiving a gift of an expensive coat and benefits again from a lottery tipoff from Colman's David Grant character. I hoped it would continue the theme of fortuitous events happening throughout the film but unfortunately the film goes downhill from there with Colman's somewhat mysterious beachcomber character propositioning Rogers to accompany him on a trip to Niagara coming between her and her boorish fianc played by Jack Carson in the process.So the mismatched couple booked in as brother and sister naturally end up in adjoining rooms in a posh hotel before the fianc turns up to make trouble for them which eventually sees them all end up on trial in a lengthy concluding courtroom scene for various minor misdemeanours only for true love to conquer all as Colman is revealed to be a reclusive famous artist in hiding after an apparently infamous trial about the morality of some of his earlier work.I know screwball comedies are meant to throw together unlikely individuals be based on threadbare plots and large coincidence and be fastpaced and full of wisecracks but the most important of these the last just isn't delivered here. Poor Ginger only recently on leave from years as old Fred's girl has to canoodle with another much older man and goodlooking and suave on the face of it as he is you can't describe Colman's character as anything other than weird and one that a single woman most probably shouldn't let be her chaperone. That said her boyfriend Carson hardly seems like a catch either being the brusque moneygrabbing controlling type.There are some eccentrics dotted about in the background too like the two stereotypical Italian restaurateurs in whose eaterie they first meet an odd selection of hotel employees a strange elderly couple who Rogers christens Peter Possum and Jenny Wren who in truth can't be that much older than Colman even as they rhapsodise about the younger duo personifying love's young dream and finally a longwinded judge at the trial but Preston Sturges this definitely isn't. All the explanations for Colman's oddball behaviour are held back until the last reel and then delivered in an unconvincing hurry at the same time as we're expected to believe in the even more unlikely romance of the two leads.What more to say well Rogers looks lovely especially in her evening gown although unfortunately she stops short of actually dancing even a few steps Colman is certainly smooth if lacking warmth and director Milestone has some nice touches like a scene showing both sides of the dividing doors as the couple argue and the courtroom scene where he shows successive witnesses sat in the same seat giving their testimony but it has to be said it's all rather dull with no real laughs curiously uninvolving characters and on the whole adds up to a lot less than the sum of its parts.".

Miles of film is expended detailing the boys at Mission Control and Kennedy trying to implement the unless I mentioned a bold rescue mission that will arrive in the last moments of their O2 lifting off into the teeth of a hurricane no less.What makes the movie work are the very things that were lampooned so accurately by the boys at Mystery Science Theatre 3000 the terse acronymfilled jargon the performances by Peck Janssen Crenna Hackman and Franciscus and the glaringly nonCGI special effects that looked great in 1970.For a spacehappy 11 year old this was the ne plus ultra of moviesand the fact that the boys on the Apollo 13 had recently gotten back alive made Marooned more than a leetle beet unnerving in its topicality.There's a moment that the movie transcends a clinical yawner and takes on the mantle of heartbreakingly human drama. When the astronauts' wives are brought in to talk to them on small TV monitors one after the other and Nancy Kovack coldly tells the NASA suit I know why we're herewe're here to say goodbye to them you feel suckerpunched. It didn't seem real until right then.Then the wives are warned that their husbands are degraded meaning they're tired cold and scared beyond description.

You can see him expending every bit of energy to convince her and himself that he's not a dead man orbiting.Finally Mariette Hartley tries to comfort Gene Hackman who is bordering on hysteria and panic. She watches in a gutwrenching horror as he reacts to her reading a letter the wives have written to the President. He cries and rages something like I broke the lawnmower and I can't fix it and everyone is blaming me for it! Hartley is hustled away but she stops in dumb horror as she sees her husband on the big monitor in flight control screaming Don't kill me! as Crenna and Franciscus hold him down to shoot him full of sedatives.It's the most painful and human moment of the movie. Sturges has kept you on the edge of boredom then wham it's somehow all real. The movie goes from intellect to emotion in a matter of a few moments. I didn't appreciate this as an a tweenager but God how my mouth went dry watching it a few days ago. These poor bastards are already in their titaniumshielded coffin! The rest of the movie is predictable but brutal in its denouement. You know that if the men are to be saved there's going to be some dues paid. I remember seeing Marooned at the Garland Theatre in Spokane in May 1970. When those dues were paid my mom was tearing up. I thought typical for a woman.I was clearing my throat a lot and having trouble focusing on the screen when my family and I watched it over the weekend.Adulthood has its upside I guess.".

If you're inclined to consider when it was made or you're old enough to remember when the idea of manned space exploration was actually exciting you might even think it's great. The worst thing I can say is that it's certainly not fastpaced if you're looking for a scifi action spectacular this probably isn't going to be your cup of tea. The specifics are covered very well in previous users' comments and in Roger Ebert's  review so I won't repeat them here.There is one thing I'd like to clarify though if I mayAnyone looking at the user ratings and user comments should take into consideration that a very abbreviated version of this movie was shown on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 as Space Travelers. I'm a pretty hardcore MST fan myself and I agree that it was a funny episode. However there's a certain type of MSTie that finds it entertaining to visit the IMDb and vote negatively of course for the movies featured in their favourite episodes with a view to knocking them down into the IMDb's Bottom 100 list. Sometimes this is reasonably welldeserved honestly some of the worst best movies featured on MST3K would be indefensible in any form. Other times particularly when the original is cut to pieces this one lost approximately 115 of its 215 running time while gaining some lousy incidental music and a shabby new title sequence I don't think it's right at all.If you want to watch an interesting thoughtprovoking scifi drama Marooned is a good bet. If you want to watch a funny episode of MST3K Space Travelers 0401 is an equally good bet. You can even watch and enjoy both as I have. Don't let the strange mix of votes and comments here dissuade you from watching it entirely though because that would be a mistake. A minor mistake admittedly but still  a mistake. Credit where it's due most of this hack job was courtesy of redistributor Film Ventures International and not the folks at MST3K. If you come across a nonMST'd version of this movie that runs about 130 don't waste your time I guarantee it'll be neither interesting or funny.".

Once you get past that it's a subtlyacted character study.After watching it several times however the characters' traits become more apparent as the story develops. We see Gene Hackman's character astronaut Buzz Lloyd on a slippery slope right from the start. He daydreams on the job tries pathetically to win favour from Mission Control I uh fixed the razor and then slides into blatant panic as the emergency unfolds.When we first see her Celia Pruett presents an exterior persona toughened by fifteen years' experience of being an astronaut's wife. When Celia in Mission Control realizes she may be talking to her husband for the last time her facade slips from forced banal confidence to seeing her husband anew after fifteen years of marriage. Actress Lee Grant brings out Celia's desperate emotion with simple innocent gestures a suggestive laugh tracing her fingers on the TV image of her husband and a whispered forlorn promise to him.Even the rescue launch director actor uncredited is all business during the countdown quietly reading off checklists and acknowledging reports from his colleagues. Yet at the very last secondand still businesslikehe looks at Manned Space Director Keith Gregory Peck with sorrow and frustration as both realize their rescue attempt is going to fail.But againit's all subtlety. In reality people often are so the viewer has to LOOK for it. Even IMDb reviewers who favour this film seem to want flashier character traits claiming the film to be excessively dry.There's a common complaint from IMDb reviewers about a lot of films boringentertain ME! Sorry that kind of complaint doesn't cut it. Gratuitous gun violence sexuality constant profanity and gutsbloodgutsTHAT gets boring. A film like Marooned or its nearest contemporary 2001 is paced deliberately for a reason. You must watch the characters closely listen to the dialogue and place both in the context of the story and setting. To dismiss Marooned as 'boring' means you won't or can't see the point and more's the pity.I will say the film deserved MUCH better treatment particularly the inexcusably shoddy ending some robotic performances from bit players and clumsy use of props. Yet Marooned is TRUE science fiction not that Star Wars fantasy stuff. Did Luke Skywalker ever show any character development over the course of one film?".

	schema:headline " Slow moving space drama with a decent cast";
	schema:reviewBody "This creepingly slow space drama was mainly conceived I'd posit as a showcase for the acting talents of the four leads we're treated to Hackman Crenna and Franciscus playing the astronaut trio trapped in space and Peck as the nononsense controller back on the ground whose attempts to return them to Earth make up the bulk of the running time.Sadly 'bulk' is right when it comes to this movie it's way overlong with much of the length consisting of repetitive dialogue sequences or scenes which add little to the narrative. In some cases it actually feels quite stodgy especially during the lengthy mid section. I was often looking at the clock and wondering how much more of this I could sit through.Invariably the special effects are quite dated and often look laughable in this day and age. Yet despite these detractions the film does have a special kind of timeliness to it considering the year it was made which adds significance to the production. And I'll admit that things do get quite thrilling in the last half hour when we're treated to the kind of suspense that should have been present all the way through.The actors are the main reason to tune in these days it's hard to fault any of them but I think Crenna gives the best performance of the lot as a compassionate family man. Hackman is almost unrecognisable in comparison to the later tough mannered character actor he became and as always Franciscus seems to me to be underrated. Peck is very good too but then that's a given.".

Authors like Philip K Dick and Jonathan Lethem excel in this genre and I like Marooned fits in it very nicely.Released in 1969 it obviously takes place at a notmuchlater date  the inclusion of SKYLAB launched in 1973 proves this. The rescue vehicle used also looks like a very crude version of the space shuttle  a futuristic test vehicle that looks grounded in reality enough to escape being campy. A few lines of dialogue also hint that a Mars expedition is something that is considered to be right around the corner.Most complaints in the comments section refer to the pacing. All i can say is go read a book. If 90minute action fests are your barometer for the worth of a film go elsewhere. There are no exploding fireballs or meteors ripping through space stations with stereotypical crazy Russians here. Instead you get a fully realized and believable view into what might happen if some of our astronauts became stranded in space.Personally I was invested fully into the film and felt sad when the movie ended the same way I feel when I finish a good book. The pacing here if you are interested in the subject matter is fine. For fans of science fiction this movie is a mustsee. For those of us who actually can sit through a book and enjoy it and I don't mean pageturners this movie is a great way to spend an afternoon. For everyone else please avoid.

The original opening was the coolest thing I've EVER seen on screen a near silent ultraslow zoomout and slow pan to the horizon through a fully extended BakerNunn camera that was looking out into nothing but black outer space. Damn amazing. Total utter deep space  pure blackness until it got to the horizon. Outstanding. There's about 10 seconds on the DVD it was more like 10 minutes in the theater.

I'll never forget it. Thank you old time American cinema. These days you'd get commercials for your 9 dollars.".

	schema:reviewBody "45 STARS   Three astronauts find themselves trapped high above the earth when the  space capsule Ironman One becomes disabled. The NASA ground team races  to bring them back alive while each crewmember wrestles with his  impending asphyxiation in the tiny spacecraft. A rescue mission brings  hope to the crew but it may not arrive in time to save all three men.  Marooned is not an actionadventure movie but rather a skillful  character study. Most modern viewers of Marooned are likely to become  bored by its pace and the movie could have been trimmed by about  twenty minutes to keep the plot moving. But there's a method to this  madness and everything about Maroonedfrom its deliberate pacing to  its haunting singlechord soundtrackis designed to evoke the vastness  of space and its unrelenting hostility. Such an auspicious intent  demands topnotch dialogue and performances and Marooned successfully  delivers some of the highest quality drama ever shown in a disaster  movie.  On the ground we watch the chief of the manned space program Keith  Peck slowly transform from a bythebook director to a passionate  leader determined to save his men. Peck's performance is understated  but complete and peaks during the dicey launch of the rescue ship  which is jeopardized by a hurricane. Keith quietly paces and stews as  the audience sweats through the countdown and watches the wind speed on  the launch creep toward the redline.  Meanwhile the astronauts aboard Ironman One slowly deteriorate as  their time and oxygen both run out. Each astronaut copes with death in  different ways. The elder experienced Commander Pruett Crenna  quietly resigns himself to his fate. Pilot Lloyd Hackman is the  opposite and quickly becomes anxious and paranoid. Scientist Stone  Franciscus is the most interesting character as he combines the  philosophical qualities of the Commander with the vocal tendencies of  the Pilot.  Stone becomes a metaphor for the movie itself as he becomes fascinated  with the concept of his own death by suffocation and studies himself in  the same way that the movie studies the group. First from a  philosophical standpoint and then later from an almost spiritual  perspective Stone analytically explores the process of dying. He is  intellectual and in control of his senses until only a few minutes of  oxygen remain.  Marooned is even more disturbing because the special effects are so  good that the suspension of disbelief is never broken. Marooned won an  academy award in 1969 for Special Visual Effects in part because the  movie exercised such tremendous restraint. The effects like the movie  are paced very slowly and intended to establish the mood of actual  movement and activity in a zeroG environment.  It's hard to imagine the reception that greeted Marooned when it was  first released. The concept that our own technology might fail and  precipitate a situation whereby one astronaut's suicide must be  considered as a method of saving the remaining crew members is very  disturbing. Marooned forces the viewer to confront this morally  unthinkable dilemma. Spoiler alert the scene where all three  astronauts are forced to decide which of them will as Lloyd put it  'have to go' is desperately calm and all the more terrifying for it.  Marooned is high drama set in space. For those with a longer attention  span Marooned is a very disturbing but incredibly satisfying piece of  work. If you haven't become interested in the premise within the first  thirty minutes of the movie just switch it off and save yourself the  time. For just like the unchanging qualities of the movie's hostile  environment Marooned retains a similar tone throughout.".

The movie opens with genuine footage of a Saturn V rocket launch which is a good reason in itself to watch. And it was made before the reallife crisis of Apollo 13 and threw a strong light on the possibility of an inflight problem for which no contingencies were planned. It is food for thought that this piece of art was in the public arena some months before Apollo 13 and that even 25 years later NASA still has difficulty  apparently  in covering all the bases for space flight problems.If you have already voted on this then take another look and you will see that there is way more good than bad moviemaking here and that 510 is not justified.".

Based in great performances by Gregory Peck Richard Creena Gene Hackman David Jansen and all the great crew this Apolloera film is a good movie for entertaining and a short view of the Space Program in the early 70's. When I was reading some of the history of the production the idea of PhilcoFord to lend a replica of the Mission Control Room for the movie they actually were the creators of the original room in Cape Kennedy according to the publication was an exceptional element of accuracy and realism. The space scenes are part of the movie not the movie itself and well was 1970 the chroma effects were still very simple. Still the acting quality is the best value of Marroned. Please take a look and make your own opinion. I love it!".

As a film it doesn't get too much into character development except during a sequence when the astronaut wives Lee Grant Nancy Kovack and Mariette Hartley are brought in to boost morale all around. It does concentrate on the rescue mission and the special effects for which Marooned got an Academy Award in 1969. I'm not a science buff by any means but Marooned was projected several years into the future the long missions that Crenna Hackman and Franciscus were on were years away.

The acting is in a few places over the top especially Gene Hackman's portrayal of Buzz Lloyd. But on the other hand the plotting is tight and to the point. The directing was superb  one of my fondest memories is when the rescue mission is launched through the eye of a hurricane the entire theater stood up and cheered. Then the old bat who ran the place came in and announced that if that happened again she'd stop the movie and send us home without refunds. Like we listened. By the way if your local library is old enough they may have all THREE versions of the book  Martin Caidin actually wrote the book three times first for the Mercury program and then for Gemini and Apollo. And the character of Jim Pruett survived the first two and wasn't killed off until the third version. Each edition of the book is highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps this movie is slowmoving like some have pointed out though I didn't mind its deliberate pacing. In fact I think it's a heck of a lot better than its current IMDb score would indicate.The film is a nearfuture scifi film in which a group of three astronauts are on a lengthy mission on a space station. On their return to Earth there is an equipment malfunction and they are stranded in space. Unfortunately there just doesn't appear to be a way to save them in time so the folks at NASA and on board the ship realize it's just a matter of time before they run out of oxygen.As far as the acting goes this was not one of Gregory Peck's finest moments. His character is very very subdued and sterntoo stern. As a result he comes off as a grouch and a nonemotive one to boot. Fortunately the astronauts Richard Crenna Gene Hackman and James Franciscus all do an exceptional job and tend to give the film a lot more feeling. In particular Franciscus is very good and manages to overshadow his more famous costars.Other than Peck the only other negative are some of the special effects. Most look very good for 1969 but the ones in 2001 seem to be a bit better. The film did get the Oscar for Best Special Effects however despite a few less than stellar scenesthough most the film's special effects were very effectively done.As for the ending it was very tense and worth seeing. So for people who like this sort of film it is excellent and gives insight into the fears people had during the days of the Apollo program.".

It will be up to an experimental craft piloted by David Janssen who is vocally outspoken and assertive in his desire to save the astronauts which earns the ire of his superior played by Gregory Peck and a Russian cosmonaut in a capsule if the astronauts will have any chance of surviving. Peck as the NASA man in charge of the space mission encounters a number of ensuing crises he will need to avert in order to be successful in rescuing the three men trying to remain calm and docile so they conserve what little oxygen still available to them.I think Apollo 13 1995 will come to mind when viewers watch Marooned 1969 as the plots are similar in ways. Astronauts trapped in space while NASA scientists and the think tank try and come up with a plan of action to save them is a readymade plot which should be you'd think an easy sell for an audience. I have to say that I'm one of the majority critical of the laborious pace and clinical approach to the rescue mission this film as directed by Sturges never quite finds that gear which engages and capitalizes completely on the suspense plot that might have in different hands been a home run. Still the special effects and NASA assistance bringing an authenticity to the material and presentation are incentives to see the film. I think there's a good 100 minute movie dying to break out of the 130 minute running time. I think the cast is uniformly goodno breakouts but I think the actors properly convey the frustrations fear and anxiety that come with the difficult situation that presents itself. Crenna's fate as he leaves the shuttle to make a repair to the engine a share of dialogue between him and Peck imply more to this than what is presented on its face Hackman's mental breakdown while talking to his wife Franciscus' laidback allsmiles psychologically sound astronaut who seems to take matters a bit more sufficiently despite the peril that remains an antagonist the three wives Lee Grant Nancy Kovack and Mariette Hartley trying to keep their composure during what is a horrific ordeal Peck and Jannsen butting heads over what to do to save the astronauts the 42 hour rushjob to scrape together a ship capable of leaving the earth and meeting the shuttle in space a developing hurricane which might cause the rescue mission to be halted and the astronauts in the shuttle trying to hold it together although they have every reason to be distraught provide plenty of melodrama that help to bring a respectability to the film keeping it from being a total disappointment. This being made during the height of the space program during the 60s gives it some gravitas and I think the dialogue and inner workings of those involved in sending men into orbit and trying to get them back safely is handled efficiently by the direction and screenplay. I think the film's main hurtle for newcomers is the running time and paceit just shouldn't be such a chore and bore considering the plot.".

First I have to ask... why do people who rate movies like this a perfect 10 think anybody reads their reviews? You are stating this is the most superb piece of filmmaking art you have ever seen. Seriously? All you have proved is that whatever you have to say is totally worthless. This movie is from 1969 so it's important to look at it in context. They threw together a few big stars  capitalized on the two biggest fads of the era space  The Cold War. This could have been a classic if it were a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode. It's over 2 hour runtime borders on painful. It represents Hollywood appealing to the nation's lowest common denominator by combining a fad with star power and little else. Obviously they are masters of exploiting public stupidity since there are still people tasteless enough to keep raving about this flick 40 years later.Considered historically it provides indisputable proof that the moon landing was 100 real because not even Hollywood could fake it. It's award winning special effects make you wonder how the actors were able to keep a straight face while doing their zero G acrobatics. Winning the Oscar has to be the Academy's version of dark humor considering the winner in its category the previous year was 2001 A Space Odyssey. The only reason this movie should be mentioned in the same breath as Kubrick's masterpiece is to point out how it's the opposite of everything that makes 2001 a work of art. I respect the fact that many reviewers have a soft spot for this movie because they still look at it with child's eyes. I'm a little younger so my child nerd affection goes to movies like Space Camp. Yet even though I thought Space Camp was wicked awesome as a kid I won't waste your time telling you it was a cinematic masterpiece. In fact Marooned can't even stand up to other Scifi disappointments with big potentials and poor execution such as The Black Hole or Star Trek The Motion Picture. Those two stinkers don't exactly set the bar very high either. Just like Marooned is no perfect 10 it's not the very worst movie in the world either. It's got big stars and its about the space race  that can go along way. Just not a 2 hours and 14 minutes long of a way. It's a bit sub par of average in the history of Hollywood. Watch it if you wish to relive a piece of your childhood or get a slice of what America was crazy about at the time. Just do NOT expect a grand story or an amazing cinematic experience  you won't be disappointed.".

Greg Peck was enough of a box office draw but Marooned has him Gene Hackman James Franciscus Richard Crenna David Jannsenand they all deliver high caliber performances. Even those actors who have less screen timesuch as the actor who played Wheeler the flight controller at Houstondoes a remarkable job with the few lines he's given. John Sturges was a venerated director at the time and in this movie he continued to make epic use of his camera.An earlier review compared the Mission Control scenes in Marooned to those in Apollo 13 and observed that the ones in Marooned are better more realistic. I love both movies but I wholeheartedly agree with him.In the current age of space travel one could only wonder what a remake of Marooned would be like if they incorporated the shuttle orbiters and the International Space Station into the story.One more thing and this is important. If you're a special effects nut if you can't get enough of Lucasfilm and any sciencefiction film ever done by Steven Spielberg then you're going to despise this movie...Marooned is more on the tragic introspective narrative side of the fence. Time has not been kind to the visuals. In a perfect world some ambitious corporation would see the potential in a Marooned special edition with updated special effects but let's face it this probably won't happen.

	schema:reviewBody "You have to remember several things when you watch this film. First this was before Star Wars which came out 8 years later. Second this film came out a year after 2001 A Space Odeessey. The Kubrick film is so vastly superior in every possible way and most especially in the completely unique special effects he created for the film. Sturgess was not cut out of the same creative cloth in my view. Even more bizarre is that Marooned won the Academy Award that year for Special Effects. I know it's hilarious to think of that now.Given all it's shortcomings which were many the film has lots going for it. You have great actors who give a believable performance of men under extreme stress and pressure and fear. The wives unfortunately are reduced to eyecandy ciphers who are minuscule emotional dots on the large scale rescue effort. Gregory Peck gives a chilling performance of a director of operations who handles everything with a calculating and emotionally controlled manner. Once in a while he lets loose and seems less wooden and succumbs to outbursts of emotion. I say chilling because this is a spoiler he has to bring himself to the terrible place of suggesting a horrible idea to the three astronauts on board one of them has to leave in order for the other two to have even a sliver of a chance of surviving on reduced oxygen. He handles this situation by suppressing all his own emotion and by just hinting at the idea without saying it out loud. It is a very uncomfortable moment and it plays out as effective high drama.There is plenty silly with this film. The handling of weightlessness is very poor by our CGIGeorge LucasILM standards. The space station looks way too big and almost empty which is not how they build space stations. The Apollo command module did NOT make the return trip back to earth just a small pod that sat at the top end of the module which had the heat shield. The fact that the hurricane sort of just crept up on them was a bit of a stretch. The fact that NASA had NO properly trained reserve astronaut to attempt the rescue was unbelievable. The fact that Peck's character overruled many critical and standard safety checks before launching a military rocket was unbelievable. Although the team apparently had a huge rescue and recovery manual they all act as if it did not exist. That they let the marooned astronauts circle the earth without a clear and early awareness that their oxygen was going to run out was hard to believe. That the Russians were able to maneuver their space craft to intercept the astronauts was hard to believe given that it had entered a totally different orbit on the other side of the world. That the astronauts figured that it was possible to do an EVA and try and fix the stalled engine is laughable it is not like getting out of your car and tapping on the carburetor. But heh that's Hollywood and it was just silly.Other than an even longer list of hard to believe points if you totally suspend your critical mind and enjoy the twist of tension as it mounts this is a fun movie. Grim faces pounded table tops predictable emotional outbursts all aside they did what they could with a small budget and made it worth the few dollars movies used to cost to watch.Of course what is curious is when you actually do the comparison to what Kubrick pulled off in 2001. His technical insights were so far in advance that it took Star Wars to outdo and then even at times Lucas appeared very heavy fisted with his pyrotechnics nowhere in the first 3 Star Wars films do you get the elegance and simplicity of the Kubrick camera innovations that were the hallmarks of the special effects. I know I'm probably in the minority here but of the three films I've mentioned here Kubrick's for me is the champion. Comparisons to the much later Apollo 13 are not fair it's a much better film used REAL weightlessness and a much bigger budget. Still Marooned is fun for a rainy night when there is just garbage to watch on the television.".

	schema:reviewBody "Solas spends its 100 minute run digging deep into the character of Maria Fernndez an attractive 35 year old brittle pessimist who bears the scars of childhood abuse at the hands of her father drinks too much and works as a janitor.

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately rather overlooked as this film came out the same year as Almodvar's 'Todo Sobre mi Madre' which went on to reach fame and glory. However if you liked Almodvar's excellent drama you will also like 'Solas'. The two films have certain similarities inasmuch that also in 'Solas' the accent is very much on strong characterisation profound human feelings though perhaps a little less intense here than in Almodvar's film. Ana Fernndez is magnificent playing just right the rather confused unlucky thirtyfive year old young woman a bit given to alcohol not overplaying her part Mara Galiana as her mother shows even at her age that she has come from good theatre as no less does Carlos lvarezNovoa as the lonely neighbour. Benito Zembrano  as Almodvar   not only directs his film but is also responsible for the script which is truly magnificent especially taking into account certain Andalucian styles of speech. The Andalucian accent may at times cause a bit of a problem if you know Spanish a fair amount and watch this film without any subtitles. Try it anyway it is well worth the effort. An excellent piece of drama which certainly deserves more recognition than it has got. Curiously both films end with a remarkably similar dedication at the end 'A mi madre a todas las madres'  To my mother To all mothers.".

Maria Galiana as an elderly Spanish woman caught in the trap of a very bad marriage but able to maintain her generosity and ability to love is superb and inspiring.  Her grown daughter played with passion by Ana Fernandez is more sophisticated and bitter.  She has allowed herself to be used by a man not unlike her unfeeling father and her protrayal makes us sympathize with her particularly when she finds she's pregnant and the man refuses to help her. And then there is the daughter's neighbor played by Carlos AlvarezNovia...a lonely old man with only his amazing dog for companionship.  How he and the mother establish a tender but proper relationship is a piece of rare and subtle filmmaking.  I see no similarity between Zambrano's movie and the work of Mike Leigh who apparently inspired him. Real people yes but the values demonstrated by Zambrano far surpass in my estimation those of Mike Leigh.  My highest recommendation to anyone interested in a film that has soul without sentimentality or grossness.".

Benito Zambrano gives an opportunity to recover all those sentiments that are well hidden in your subconscious.Carmona is a small town too close to Seville to have a real identity and is the frame for a difficult and impossible relationship between a daughter mother and father. Zambrano shows how difficult is to grow up in this outcast and bit farmer town with the leitmotiv of these three characters that join back together due to the father's illness. The father is marked rude and impolite used to hit the wife or the daughter to show his total dominance and authority. The wife was totally subjected to this situation and the opportunity to find some understanding and heat with their neighbour is accepted with detachment by her. This side relationship with a lonely man brings back love to this sad and destroyed family. The daughter is even worse alcoholic and in love with a truck driver who does not care of her pregnancy.The loneliness of the void with a breach of optimism is well expressed in this simple but very effective and straight film.Rating 710".

Given over to LaLaLand this would have been yet another throwaway melodrama drenched in its own soapiness. In Zambrano's hands this lowbudget gem eschews sentimentality and hightech wizardry digs deeply into characterization and shows us a view of the world we wouldn't know existed if we depended on Hollywood to show us. Zabrano's dialogue is just deadly accurate and very 'real'. The acting is uniformly superb but Maria Galiana as the longsuffering illiterate sturdy Earth Mother is astonishing. She ambles on and off the screen with a weary brilliant light. She has sacrificed her entire life in the service of a husband who doesn't deserve to lick her shoes. She does it because well that's the way it is for women of her generation.Carlos AlvarezNovoa is equally brilliant as the the old neighbour who offers his considerable heart to the mother and to her pregnantandconfused daughter Maria beautifully played with passion and rage by Ana Fernandez.Both Galiana and AlvarezNovoa give us faces and gestures of old and tired people who know too well the unfairness of life for the poor. There is a wonderful scene between the two when AlvarezNovoa has an attack of diarrhea and Galiana insists on helping him. He resists telling her he reeks of excrement. Galiana handles the situation as casually as she would the copious body wastes of the pigs she keeps back home in her native village. This tiny touch of humanity is the kind of scene one sees frequently in European films and rarely if ever in flicks from Hollywood. Benito Zambrano has done a masterful job here. Like other politically conscious writers and directors working in Europe he takes the reality of proletarian existence and makes it into something very real all without sappiness. This is one terrific film.".

What some people need other people need to give.

One an older man in the hospital remains bitter even as his health declines and he reveals in a key passage that what he cares about is whether he was the kind of man society and tradition had expected him to be. Nothing else. It's sad but not as tormenting as the younger selfish man who almost glories in his selfishness.What makes the movie strike deep though is how the women put up with this. We aren't sure if it is because they too are caught up in society's traditions or if they have some emotional need to be abused however that gets started. But what we are sure of is how familiar this soundsif not in our own relationships at least in those around us somewhere.As powerful as this movie is it is never overpowering and never sentimentally driven until alas the very end which is a disappointing but understandable wrap up.

The mother's eyes exuded such a deep sadness and yet so much love and patience. The old man was instantaneously lovable. Even the dog did a wonderful job. The woman's fiery personality was completely believable and her lover was realistically a jerk.

	schema:headline " A pleasant surprise";
	schema:reviewBody "Warning this review contains spoilers.My experience with foreign films has generally not been very good.  What happens is that all the professional movie critics will absolutely rave about a certain foreign movie and my more intellectual friends will convince me to go see it with them.  Then when I'm actually watching the film it will turn out to be about physically unattractive middleaged people smoking cigarettes and discussing abstractions.  After about twenty minutes of reading subtitles that could have been taken from a philosophy textbook I fall asleep for the rest of the film.  This is not because I am an ugly American.  I spent my childhood in Canada and I have the same reaction to Canadian films.  I just happen to think most foreign movies that make it to America like most American movies that make it to America are dull.  The reason I keep going to these films however is that occasionally there will be a pleasant surprise.  Life is Beautiful is a good example. So is this film.This movie is about an old woman's first experience in the big city.  Her abusive husband has fallen ill and has had to go to the big city hospital for treatment.  The only other person in the city she knows is her daughter Maria.Maria is an overlycynical alcoholic who hates her father.  She resents having to work as a cleaning lady and blames all her woes on being poor. She lashes out in hostility to anyone who is kind to her and she thinks her mother's ideas about doing unto others is woefully naive.  Things get worse when she gets pregnant and her selfcentered bully of a boyfriend refuses to take responsibility.The real center of the movie however is not Maria but her mother and her relationship with the kindly old man who lives in Maria's building.  The old man lives alone with only a German shepherd named Achilles to keep him company.  The mother and the old man strike up a friendship and the old man falls in love with her.  And when she visits her husband in the hospital her husband sniffs her and tells her she stinks of other men.I found this movie extremely engaging and engrossing.  What I particularly liked was that although it didn't give in to Maria's cynicism neither did it pull any punches as to the way the world really works.  I rooted for the mother to leave her husband for the old man but I knew it would never happen despite the fact that she admits that the old man is a better human being than her husband.  I wanted Maria's boyfriend who isn't all bad to be a good boyfriend and a good father but I knew it wouldn't happen either.This film is touching without being schlocky.  It's heartwarming without being syrupy.  The film's only real flaws were at the very start and the very end.  At the start I felt like I was just coming in at the middle since so much had apparently already happened that wasn't shown.  And I thought the film's last twenty minutes could have been cut to ten without losing their impact.My original stance on foreign films stays as is  they tend to be overrated by critics simply because they weren't made in a Hollywood movie factory. But occasionally one comes along like Solas where the praise is justified. 9 out of 10.".

That's as good a definition of 'serendipity' as any. Although there are perhaps a dozen players it's essentially a threehander four if we stretch a point and include Paco De Osca's husbandfather from hell who indirectly generates most of what happens with the other three the other three being Maria Ana Fernandez a 35 yearold country girl long fled to the city as soon as she was old enough to escape her abusive drunken father and with little or no formal education is obliged to take a succession of menial cleaning jobs and provide a sexobject for macho Spanish males. As the story begins De Osca has just been admitted to hospital in the city and his downtrodden wife Maria Galiana has accompanied him and is reluctantly put up by Maria for the duration. The third member of this morose little group is widower Vecino Carlos AlvarezNovoa who lives in the same apartment building as Maria and quickly attaches himself to her mother. For the mother it is a revelation to meet a man who is not only not an animal but also has finer feelings but she has become habituated to her role as doormat and when her husband is released from hospital she returns with him to their village leaving us with the impression that should her husband die she will return and take up with Vecino who in the wake of the mother's departure persuades Maria not to abort the child she is carrying the father has no interest in a permanent relationship and offers to underwrite an abortion and promises to act as a grandfather. This is a study of three lost souls and despite the downbeat theme it is actually uplifting. The acting throughout is more than competent that of the three principals brilliant. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Benito Zambrano's Solas offers us a collection of stereotypes which are of little credibility and make of this film a hard and boring view. It is basically the account of a few weeks in the lives of some personages in the particular circumstance that the father of a family is in hospital and his wife has to move to the city to stay with him. No hint of sensitivity or even humanity is to be found in the ogre like personage of the father of whom we know through patches of conversation that is alcoholic a vice inherited by his daughter violent family abuser and wasteful. To this father's attitude the wife and the daughter adopt completely opposite attitudes totally submissive the wife whom might well have been depicted with an aura of holiness around her head rebel and contemptuous towards her father the daughter who hates him undisguisedly. Social groups are portrayed under fixed stereotypes too all affluent people are egoist thoughtless towards others and bad all poor people have a good heart but life circumstances may make them behave not so honestly all men are thoughtless brute women chasers football lovers and sexobsessed but for one of the characters of the film a neighbor which seems to share with the wife the gift of holiness and all women are... well they are a bit more fleshed out in the film and considered as individuals rather than as a bulk indistinguishable from one another.I cannot recommend watching this film to anybody but maybe for those whom may feel reassured in their convictions about human stereotypes in case they are coincident with those depicted in the film. Only one scene seemed to me of cinematographic value when the daughter is watching through a passing train a bag lady carrying her trolley as the different carriages pass by we can see in very short flashes the increasing expression of sorrow desperation and realization of the bag lady desperate condition. Ana Fernndez is fine in her role as the daughter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Benito Zambrano's sincere subtle and sublime 'Solas' tells a story of human dilemma and fragile relationships. The centre of the film are its key characters Rosa Mara Galiana her daughter Mara Ana Fernndez and her neighbour Carlos lvarezNvoa and their struggle with loneliness. All three are broken people. Rosa and Mara's lives have been fractured by their abusive father. The neighbour's life is fractured by his very loneliness. As their interactions build no matter how they try to avoid not being alone a bond develops. Themes of motherhood abuse abortion and oldage are presented but never exaggerated or preached.The description sounds familiar but Zambrano gives it a unique treatment especially through his characters. Mara may not be much of a talker at work. She finds distraction in alcohol and sex and otherwise she lashes out. Rosa in contrast is quiet and mostly keeps to herself but she's a gentle person who is kind enough to offers help. The neighbour obviously enjoys Rosa's company in his otherwise lonesome life and he looks forward to their meetings.The sets and locations are simplistic but efficient. The cinematography and score are also used efficiently contributing to the flow rather than intruding. The dialogues too are simple but very well layered especially in the way the actors deliver them. Mara Galiana is excellently restrained. Her silence has a strong voice and her minimal expressions convey plenty. Ana Fernndez plays her part with equal conviction. She wonderfully highlights the differences between Rosa and Mara. Equally outstanding is Carlos lvarezNvoa as the lonely neighbour the kind of man people often see as 'just an old man' and then forget about as he goes back to his lonely apartment.Lastly Zambrano ends 'Solas' beautifully. I will not reveal this because the whole story leads up to it in a subtle and lyrical manner that the effect of it will be lost if I said a word more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Solas is a story that mirrors the lives a mother and her daughter Mara have as both have abusive relationships. When Mara's father is in hospital her mother stays with her daughter in Seville and meets a man Vecino of her own age in the apartment block. Mara's friend is only interested in the sexual part of their relation and immediately insists on having an abortion when he finds out she's pregnant. Mother and daughter now have to make important decisions about their future.The movie has a bleak and depressing atmosphere Mara has an alcohol addiction she becomes jobless after working as a cleaning lady hospital scenes with Mara's not too friendly father Seville has never looked worse. Also most color schemes are rather dark except for the halls in the apartment block and Vecino's apartment as it is there that consolation is found by both women. The theme of abusive relationships is nowadays hot in Spanish cinema with the recent and more centered Te doy mis ojos. The Andalusian dialect is well done here as many people learning to speak Spanish will have trouble understanding parts of the movie.Some symbolism is used in this movie Vecino's dog loyalty but also guardian is used to remind us of the disloyalty towards the father the mother experiences when she meets Vecino. Mara and her father sniffing on people also demanding doglike loyalty. Vecino's fish is fresh at first but is later in the freezer as is the possibility of a relationship between Vecino and the mother. And mind the name of our main protagonist Mara in relation to her story her mother and father have no name in the movie the mother played by Mara Galiana. The main message seems to be that nobody can be happy alone although the irony is of course that all are alone or lonely because of one abusive relationship.Solas tells its story in a very slow pace maybe to let us experience how slowly time flows for these unfortunate people. Its style is rather distant so expect no cheap sentiment here. In the end the movie makes a time leap but it feels as if that ending was rushed to leave the theater in a more uplifted mood. Also the ending feels contrived in a way. The same often happens with Mike Leigh's movies take All or Nothing for instance a movie and director where Solas has more in common with than meets the eye.The director Benito Zambrano has good storytelling skills but lacks visual imagination when it comes to the medium of film. As he is also unable to structure the story in an interesting way he is certainly no match for Pedro Almodvar who has better visual skills and has learned how to structure a story. I guess Zambrano would be a far better writer than director. Solas is an interesting failure and one of the first Spanish movies in a long row I disliked somewhat. But that's also a little reassuring from the country that by now makes the most interesting movies in Europe.".

One wonders how Yash Chopra put it all together as it includes a stellar cast wonderful music and engaging plot. Not only did he direct he was responsible for other crewwork like choreography. even though the screenplay isn't original today it was pathbreaking at its time and it finely balances comedy drama romance hardship music and suspense through coincidences. It is 'Waqt' that becomes a reference source for all of Chopra's future films e.g. Rani Mukherjee's rookie lawyer in 'Veer Zaara' parallel's Sunil Dutt's Rekha Silsila Sridevi Chandni Preity Veer Zaara and pretty much every heroine in Chopra's films parallel Sadhana's grace and Juhi's Darr and Sridevi's Lamhe chirpiness parallel Sharmila's Renu.Chopra does lightly tackle some issues such as coincidences living in the present etc but 'Waqt' is an entertaining film not one that will make you pick your brain. Though it is predictable it remains enjoyable. Chopra had the three Kapoors Raj Shammi and Shashi in mind to play the 3 brothers but thankfully he opted for Raaj Kumar and Sunil Dutt to play the elder brothers. The three brothers are different from one another. The eldest one is a charming and elegant thief the younger one is an energetic hyperactive lawyer and the youngest one is a calm introvert. Raaj Kumar Sunil Dutt and Shashi Kapoor fit their parts brilliantly. This is one of Raaj Kumar's best performances. Dutt and Kapoor are already known as fine actors. Sadhana brings grace and the actress has a delightful screen presence. A cute and chirpy Sharmila Tagore brings a smile and the voluptuous Shashikala makes a brief appearance too. Achala Sachdev is a complete natural and she shows the transition in her character with ease. Mr. Chinoy was made for Rehman and lastly what would 'Waqt' be without Balraj Sahni? The actor just makes the cast complete.'O Meri Zohra Jabeen' might be the most memorable track but the other songs are just as beautiful thanks to the magical voices of Asha Bhosle and Mahinder Kapoor. All have been wonderfully shot. I particularly liked the way Asha Bhosle's cabaret number 'Aage Bhi Jaane' was shot.This is one evergreen classic that I've already watched numerous times.

'Jin Ke Khud Ke Ghar Sheese Ke Hon Woh Doosron par Patthar Nahin Phekte Chinoy Seth' etc. The court scenes are very engaging and have high drama but not much melodrama. The acting is great all around but the top folks are Balraj Sahni Sunil Dutt Gule Gulzaar Bulbule Yaar! Raj Kumar Sadhna. Oh  the film scores high on the looks quotient too! Sunil and Shashi are absolutely yummy Sadhana is beautiful and Sharmila the sweet naive one.Music is melodious  O Meri Zohra Zabeen Hothon Pe Khushi Kaun Aaya  and my personal favorite Aage Bhi Jaane Naa Tu. This one is a keeper and worth revisiting.".

	schema:headline " The best Hindi movie on the Lost 'n' Found formula";
	schema:reviewBody "The lost and found formula has been a very popular formula for the masala flicks made in India which contains separation of beloveds friends or siblings or parents and children or lovers in childhood and their reunion in adulthood. Certain movies made on this formula were immensely successful on the box office viz. Yaadon Ki Baarat 1973 DharmVeer 1977 Amar Akbar Anthony 1977 Muqaddar Ka Sikander 1978 etc. Crime has always been part of the scripts based on this formula. I consider Waqt 1965 as the best Bollywood movie ever made on this formula. It is a classic movie made by none other than B.R. Films and directed by none other than Yash Chopra. Waqt time starts with the inauguration of the new shop of a businessman  Lala Kedarnath Balraaj Saahni who believes that humanbeing can do anything with his efforts and ability and accordingly preplans the future of his three sons. However on the night of the inauguration itself an earthquake shatters his house his shop and his dreams as well. The father  Kedarnath the mother  Laxmi Achala Sachdev and the two elder sons get separated in the wake of the natural calamity. Only the youngest son fortunately remains with the mother. The eldest son Raju reaches an orphanage but due to the oppression of its warden Jeevan runs away from there. The warden later on gets killed in the hands of Kedarnath when he enquires about his son and comes to know that he had illtreated his son. Kedarnath gets long sentence. The second son Babloo is found by a rich but childless couple which fosters him like its own child.Years pass and the children are grownup now. The eldest son Raju has now become Raja Raaj Kumar a criminal working for a bigger whitecollared criminal Chinoy Rehman. The second one Babloo has now become Ravi Sunil Dutt who is a lawyer now. Fate make these two brothers rivals for the love of a common girl  Meena Saadhna who is the daughter of the police commissioner Manmohan Krishna. The youngest brother Munna has now become Vijay Shashi Kapoor who is in love with Renu Sharmila Tagore the sister of Ravi born to his fostering parents later. Vijay has been fostered by his poor and ailing mother with a lot of difficulty. He gets the job of a chauffeur at Chinoy's house. Now the old father  Kedarnath has also completed his jail sentence and is searching for his lost family.Though Raja initially hates Ravi due to his being his rival for Meena's love but once he accidentally comes to know that Ravi is in fact his lost younger brother his hatred is evaporated like anything. All of a sudden Ravi comes to know that he is not the son of the parents who have fostered him. He leaves the house to search his true identity and his real parents. Raja supports him and throws a party to announce the engagement of Ravi and Meena. However in that party a spat takes place between Raja and Balbir Madan Puri who is Chinoy's man. Later on Balbir himself gets killed in the hands of Chinoy whose eyewitness is none other than Vijay Raja's younger brother and Chinoy's chauffeur. Raja is arrested under the charge of Balbir's murder and he appoints his younger brother  Ravi as his defense counsel. In the climax not only Raja is acquitted but also the whole family is reunited. Kedarnath restarts his business but now he has learnt a lesson that humanbeing is not the biggest power on Earth. The biggest power is TIME or DESTINY.The movie is studded with coincidences romance songs thrill and witty dialogues. The hypnotizing courtroom drama in the climax is the icing on the cake. There are too many characters but justice has been done to all of them though some of them are highprofile whereas the others are lowprofile in the story.The hero of this movie is actually its mesmerizing script and the scriptwriters deserve a big hand. The dialoguewriters are at par with them as far as the quality of the work is concerned. Raaj Kumar's famous dialogues in the movie  'Jinke Apne Ghar Sheeshe Ke Hon Woh Doosron Par Patthar Nahin Phenka Karte' and regarding the knife 'Yeh Bachchon Ke Khelne Ki Cheez Nahin Haath Kat Jaaye To Khoon Nikal Aata Hai' are still remembered by the people and they played a major role taking his career to unprecedented heights.Ravi has composed great music with the help of Saahir's beautiful lyrics. All the songs are real gems. Hum Jab Simat Ke Aapki Baahon Mein Aa Gaye Din Hain Bahaar Ke Tere Mere Iqraar Ke Chehre Pe Khushi Chha Jaati Hai Kaun Aaya Ki Nigaahon Mein Chamak Jaag Uthi Aye Meri Johra Jabeen Maine Ek Khwaab Sa Dekha Hai Waqt Se Din Aur Raat and Aage Bhi Jaane Na Tu which can be considered any less than the others ? The song  Maine Ek Khwaab Sa Dekha Hai which Sunil Dutt and Saadhna sing over phone to each other just like a romantic conversation evidences the height of romance in the movie.All the actors have delivered great performances and every principal character has been able to preserve his  her uniqueness among others. However the memorable performances have come from Sunil Dutt and Raaj Kumar. Besides the performance of Balraaj Saahni and Achala Sachdev blushing like a teenager girl while listening to the romantic song of her husband in the song  Aye Meri Johra Jabeen is also something unforgettable.Waqt was a blockbuster and I bet it will again prove to be a blockbuster if rereleased.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one movie that whenever I have watched has always brought tears in my eyes and that is probably because not only does it remind me of my childhood days and going to the cinema in this case the Drive  In in Kenya with my parents but also because of the music the songs the acting and the story.Waqt means time and this is what the Director has really shown in this movie  time. From the moment a man is informed that one never knows what is going to happen next and he laughs it off it sets the tone of the story. Moments later the family experience an earthquake and the whole family gets separated.Starring Balraj Sahni Achala Sachdev Raj Kumar Sadhana Shashi Kapoor Sharmila Tagore Sunil Dutt Motilal Jeevan Madan Puri Leela Chitnis and Rehman the movie is directed by Yash Chopra and is produced by BR Chopra. The superb music is by Ravi.This movie set the tone for the future hits such as Yaadon Ki Baraat and Amar Akbar Anthony where the brothers get separated and not only this but this also involved romance as well.The late Balraj Sahini I would say is at his very best here as are Sunil Dutt Raj Kumar and Shashi Kapoor and all the other cast as well. Raj Kumar is just perfect in his role as a thief as is Sunil Dutt as a lawyer and Shashi Kapoor as a driver and the direction by Yash Chopra is just superb. The songs and especially the one sung by Balraj Sahni and the playback by Manna Dey Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen are most memorable  all of them as is the one Aage Bhi Jaane Na Tu by Asha Bhonsle as well.Waqt was commercially a very successful film when released and the settings of this just shows how much the late BR Chopra elder brother of Yash Chopra was fond of the Hollywood style golden age by use of pink and blue walls fountains circular beds and mirrored ceilings and with his he also manages to capture the opulent lifestyle of many in what is now Mumbai.This is one film that is worth watching whenever one can even if it is on a DVD or television.".

From the moment a man is informed that one never knows what is going to happen next and he laughs it off it sets the tone of the story. Moments later the family experience an earthquake and the whole family gets separated.Starring Balraj Sahni Achala Sachdev Raj Kumar Sadhana Shashi Kapoor Sharmila Tagore Sunil Dutt Motilal Jeevan Madan Puri Leela Chitnis and Rehman the movie is directed by Yash Chopra and is produced by BR Chopra. The superb music is by Ravi.This movie set the tone for the future hits such as Yaadon Ki Baraat and Amar Akbar Anthony where the brothers get separated and not only this but this also involved romance as well.The late Balraj Sahini I would say is at his very best here as are Sunil Dutt Raj Kumar and Shashi Kapoor and all the other cast as well. Raj Kumar is just perfect in his role as a thief as is Sunil Dutt as a lawyer and Shashi Kapoor as a driver and the direction by Yash Chopra is just superb. The songs and especially the one sung by Balraj Sahni and the playback by Manna Dey Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen are most memorable  all of them as is the one Aage Bhi Jaane Na Tu by Asha Bhonsle as well.Waqt was commercially a very successful film when released and the settings of this just shows how much the late BR Chopra elder brother of Yash Chopra was fond of the Hollywood style golden age by use of pink and blue walls fountains circular beds and mirrored ceilings and with his he also manages to capture the opulent lifestyle of many in what is now Mumbai.This is one film that is worth watching whenever one can even if it is on a DVD or television.";

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say!An extremely poor Shashi Kapoor struggling to raise money for his eternally sick mom flaunts fashionable designer clothes. Impeccable hair cut cleanshaven look amazing branded sweaters and trousers...one can hardly imagine the plight of the young driver when he has such fancy clothes to wear.To top it off he appears in a suit in the party leading to the climax when all other drivers appear in their uniforms. Wow!Why do all family members have to get separated like that just defines my sense of logic. Let's say that you have a big family living in a big house and earthquake strikes. Either you all get killed Godforbid or some of you survive. Now would the survivors be separated lightyears away from each other? You were in the same place why would you wander off to a God forsaken place rather than sticking by for the authorities and make sure that your family is safe? I have to clap for the incredible stupidity of Bollywood filmmakers. The way Raj Kumar is all over Sadhana making no secret of his love would make any sane girl know his true intentions. Sadhana is not shown as a flirtatious type yet she is the last person to know of his motives?!?! Can you say Bollywood knows its subtlety. Let us imagine for the moment that Sadhana is indeed the statue of infinite innocence and has no idea that Raj Kumar pines for her. But then in a complete contradiction she is scared when Raj Kumar asks her his gift for winning the race...clearly showing that she expects him to ask her hand. Can you say Bollywood has got it straight.The lesser said about the Court case the better. For a Perry Mason enthusiast like me Bollywood courts could not be farther from reality. Why did this movie become a hit? 1. They added color stupid. 2. They put 3 heroes in the same picture. 3. The always successful lost and found formula in those days.Sunit Datt is unarguably the saving grace of this movie. Now here is an actor who is good looking natural and quite talented. Now we got Shashi kapoor who got the looks but could indeed struggle to be a driver in the real life was he not one of the Kapoor Klan. I haven't seen an actor who is as close to being a stone as possible. Raj Kumar does try to get funny but fails. Now he got no looks either...it's a mystery how he ever became a star and whatever people found in his many nowfamous dialogues.I like to watch most Bollywood movies for fun...this was fun indeed.".

From emotions to suspense to music to coincidences to a happy ending this one has it all and like most of Yash Chopra's films it is fun to watch. The film flows brilliantly with all the characters the situations and the memorable songs and its multistarred cast performs well. Balraj Sahni and Achala Sachdev make for a very believable couple. Raaj Kumar gives a great performance and portrays the suave highclass professional thief with elegance and conviction. Sunil Dutt is very good as the humorous and lighthearted Ravi Sadhana is grace personified as the lovely and beautiful Meena Sharmila Tagore is likable as the peppy Renu and Shashi Kapoor is fine as the simple Vijay.

	schema:reviewBody "Films with two heroes and one heroine or one hero and two heroines were not uncommon in the 60s. But B R Chopra was always a trendsetter he dared to make two songsless films Kanoon and Ittefaq in the 60s and he decided to embellish his Waqt with as many as five top stars Sunil Dutt Raaj Kumar Sadhana Sharmila Tagore Balraj Sahni.A huge blockbuster in its day Waqt had an abundance of all the Chopra staples a unique theme dulcet Ravicomposed numbers top level performances a courtroom climax but this time there was more! Yash Chopra who directed the film for his elder brother B R Chopra limned each frame with the color of money. He dazzled the viewers by presenting a lifestyle that most of them had either read or dreamed about walltowall carpeted bungalows overlooking lakes and dales dashinglyattired heroes racing red and yellow sports cars pastelsclad sartoriallysplendid heroines listening to long playing records swimming in 5star hotels or enjoying a game of badminton on their neatly manicured lawns.This was the film that established the quintessential Yash Chopra style.Yet the story never lost its bearings. F.A Mirza's story spanned a wide canvas and was peopled with an interesting array of characters. The frame opened with a prosperous dry fruit seller Lala Kedarnath Balraj Sahni celebrating the opening of his new shop. The gritty Kedarnath is convinced that a man can make his own destiny a sentiment not shared by the film's writer whose credo is exactly the opposite. After presenting a rare paean to middleage love refreshing because love in this emotionallyfertile age is so neglected in our films in a song where Kedarnath praises the blushing mother of his three sons Achala Sachdev the film shows an earthquake striking. The selfassured Kedarnath's happy family is suddenly scattered.Kedarnath's youngest son Vijay remains with his penniless mother who has to do odd jobs to make him an educated youth Shashi Kapoor. Middle son Kuku is adopted by a benevolent rich couple and is rechristened Ravi Sunil Dutt. The eldest Raja unable to bear the beatings of a malicious orphanage manager Jeevan flees to become a thief Raaj Kumar. Kedarnath too goes to prison for murdering the orphanage manager.Yash Chopra stylishly pushes the time frame to several years ahead by focusing on Raja's metamorphosis from petty pickpocket to a suave thief. Raja steals Meena's Sadhana's necklace. However when he sees her he is smitten and returns the precious piece of jewels to her. Meena is charmed by the smoothtalking Raja but her heart is committed to the boisterous funloving lawyer Ravi.A songstudded love triangle involving Raja Ravi and Meena ensues. Interestingly Raja and Ravi are unaware that they are brothers. Meena loves Ravi but there is a distinct suggestion that she enjoys Raja's attention too.Meanwhile Ravi's sister Renu Sharmila is ardently interested in Vijay. At this junction Yash Chopra realizes that he has been a shade too indulgent with the footage dedicated to the languid love affairs and decides to get ahead with his story.The script's neatly worked out domino effect is well worth examining. Renu is convinced that her broadminded brother Ravi will accept her boyfriend Vijay even if he is Chenoy Seth's Rehman's driver. But to her dismay Ravi humiliates Vijay. Enraged Renu retaliates by reminding Ravi that he is only an adopted son whose background is unknown. Hurt Ravi leaves their home.Meena's snooty mother calls off her engagement to Ravi. Meanwhile an emotional Raja who has learned that Ravi is his brother decides to announce Ravi's family background to Meena's parents to bring the lovers together again. But Raja's boss Chenoy Seth agrees to conceal the fact that Raja himself is a dishonorable thief only if he pull off a heist for him one last time.A grand party scene follows. However before Raja can steal a princess' diamond necklace Chenoy Seth's hireling Balbir Madan Puri gets embroiled in a brawl with Raja. Hours later Balbir is murdered.The suspect eldest brother Raja. The witness youngest brother Vijay. The defending lawyer middle brother Ravi.The film culminates with an absorbing courtroom drama enlivened by Motilal's presence as the prosecution lawyer and a grand reunion of Lala Kedarnath with his wife and three sons an emotional high point.Waqt tantalizes the audience by showing the brothers repeatedly crisscrossing each other or their parent's paths and thrives on there's many a slip between the cup and the lip feel reel after reel.The screenplay credited to BR Films story department marvelously integrates strands of the individual stories of three brothers into a cohesive unit.Sadhana dressed in gorgeous chiffon and embroidered churidar kurtas justifies her fashion icon reputation and embellishes the film's lush look especially in her swimsuit change scene. A young Sharmila draws notice in her confrontation scene with Sunil Dutt. Sunil Dutt gives a relaxed performance while Shashi Kapoor is earnest.In this battle of acting honors the choice narrows down to Balraj Sahni and Raaj Kumar. But aided by some clapevoking lines the theatrical Raaj steals the show.The raspyvoiced Raaj's unique rendition of Akhtar Iman's lines This knife is not for children. If you cut your hand you will bleed is repeated with great enthusiasm by dialog buffs even today.".

The lush cinematography lends a documentary feel to the proceedings a much needed dose of gritty reality which helps immeasurably when dealing with the afterlife.  Cosby's bravura performance is both ferocious and demure in equal measure but always REAL.

An often overlooked masterpiece in the Cosby canon Ghost Dad is without a doubt a labour of love from one of the cinemas greatest pioneers.";

That's always been my favorite part in the movie just because it had freaked me out as a little kid. Well over 10 years passed and I finally saw the movie again. Needless to say that part looked a lot different than I remember it. The part where he goes 'through' the bus and when he falls though the floor are other parts that I remember pretty well too.

Bill will always be Bill.So unsurprisingly Ghost Dad breaks no new grounds for Bill Cosby or that haven't been tread before in other similar entries. It's what it was meant to be  a harmless film for the whole family. It's been made to offend no one. If you didn't know by the title  well let me spill the paint bucket for you. Bill Cosby is the caring husband and father trying to keep his daughters content and maintain the family's happy existence. So what a cramp it put's in his style when  oops he's dead. Hence Ghost Dad.So being the good father he is  his protective side takes over as he tries to protect his daughters from the woes of life  all the while trying to 'stay alive'. He can be seen with minimal light you see. Which leads to a bunch of silly scenes some reminiscent of The Invisible Man. Cosby is fun and though the movie is predictable it shouldn't hurt you to take in a viewing. It might not be the best offering of home family entertainment but in a field so large you could do worse.".

I am sorry Cosby fans but the man CAN'T ACT. The reason he could play Dr. Huxtable on the Cosby show is because that role was based on him. With Ghost Dad it's completely different. Also does it surprise you that it took 5 WRITERS to make this film. I mean GODDAMN! 5 WRITERS! Even with 5 writers the writing is sloppy. I would also like to point out the horrendous CinematographyDirecting it is almost as bad as Jingle All the Way. What about the humor?

Having already starred in a string of flops at the cinema Cosby NEEDED this as a last throw of the dice to be a hit. Needless to say... He came up snake eyes and he never did have the popularity on the big screen he enjoyed on the far smaller one. Not a great loss in my view.To start with his character in the movie is HORRIBLE. He spends all his time at work to the extent where he reads bedtime stories for his youngest on cassette forgets all their birthdays and can't even remember each child's name... so we instantly hate him off the bat. When he DOES join the regions of the undead the director seems to make up the rules for if he can be seen in daylight whether he can touch solid objects or not and what kind of powers he has as a spook as he goes along. There is NO consistency here... Aside from the dreadful attempts at comedy and the nonperformances from all involved.And just when you think things couldn't get ANY worse... It pulls out the most pathetic deus ex machina of an ending you'll EVER likely see. How the screenwriter scribbled this crap down with a straight face I'll never know.

I found this genuinely interesting because a lowlight situation is one of the best conditions for seeing the human aura. What I liked maybe most about Ghost Dad was the pacing which was flawless not a single wasted or empty moment in the movie. Always there was good dialogue. Regardless of what some reviewers have to say I did not find the movie corny at all. It was a perfect combination of sober and hopeful.The ending was beautiful as Elliot's daughter Diane played by Kimberly Russel has her own near death experience and he has to convince her to go back to her body. The ending is a very happy one but I will not spoil it for you.Note Historically I have been very critical of movies that force us to suspend our disbelief through plots that just don't work particularly with invisible people. Ghost Dad is very believable and Cosby and the movie never lose focus or waste time on goofy gags or cheap dialogue. Very well done indeed.".

Does he have big beautiful eyes... sure. Don't knock the kid because he looks good. He was spot on with his acting! This story has you feeling all sorts of emotions and by the end of the movie we had all shed a lot of tears. And the tears were caused by what the child was doing to handle his grief and understand why his dad was taken away from him and NOT because it had anything to do with 911. My son had lost his mom and the movie brought back all sorts of emotions because he could relate to the child perfectly. This movie has replaced Billy Elliot on my list of most moving story. Not everyone can enjoy this kind of loving and sophisticated story so it might not be for everyone but if you have a heart and have ever lost a parent I am sure that you will love this movie! Another moving story brought to us by Stephen Daldry!".

By the end of this movie I and the few others simply sat with our metaphorical mouths agape at the impact of what we had just seen. A slow meandering and with hindsight entirely necessary beginning gives way to a riveting and gripping story. A story which you would expect to bring you to tears and it will for some but is ultimately about triumph. It may appear to be a story about 911 and such was the enormity of that event that it would be easy to suggest that this is just an excellently acted and wellcrafted story about that day. That would be to undersell this movie. 911 is just the vehicle which carries the message of how our everyday minor irritations with other people and our general lives are simply unimportant in comparison to the reality that most people are just trying to do their best in our jobs our marriages and in our relationships. We are imperfect and the enormity of 911 hammered that home. These couple of hours repeats the exercise. But this movie does more than use the day's story in such a simplistic way. Rather it weaves the tragedy into the story of lives that are already living with sadness and it allows those participants to view their personal tragedies in the context of the much bigger one. To use the device of a compulsive child what a performance!forces us voyeurs to focus more clearly on the everyday minutiae which both he and we come to see as insignificant. A wonderful experience...this movie will stay with me for the rest of my days.".

	schema:headline " One of the best 911 dramas you'll see this poignant and uplifting story is ultimately a reaffirming tale of resilience and reconciliation";
	schema:reviewBody "A fair warning before you step into this 911 drama based on the acclaimed novel by Johnathan Safran Foer the protagonist a nineyear old boy living in New York City isn't someone you'll embrace easily even though the fact that he had lost his father in the Twin Towers should win much sympathy. Indeed while we may accept a certain degree of immaturity from the kid due to his age it's appalling to hear him say that his dad whose body like the thousands who perished was never found might just be 'dog faeces' in Central Park or that he wished it was his mother who had lost her life instead.Oskar Schell played by newcomer Thomas Horn is rather the abrasive kid who is both precocious and socially awkward though test results on Asperger's syndrome turned out inconclusive. One year after that fateful day Oskar steps inside his father's closet and finds a key inside an envelope with the name 'Black' scrawled on the front. Thinking that it might be one of his father Thomas' Tom Hanks elaborate puzzles he used to concoct in order to force his son to interact with people Oskar sets off on a personal quest to track down the source of the key.Equipped with a backpack of essentials including an Israeli gas mask 'A Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawkings and a tambourine that he uses to calm himself amid the din and bustle of the city Oskar traverses by foot through the five boroughs of New York knocking on the doors of everyone with the last name 'Black' he can locate in the phone book. Some of the people he meets include a married couple Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright on the verge of divorce a religious woman who offers up Oskar's mission to God and a transsexual with a lifestyle too wild for Oskar's comfort it takes all sorts to make the world and if each of these attempts turn out futile it at least fulfils his father's hope that Oskar will learn to be more sociable.Each encounter is also an affirmation of the collective tragedy that was 911 as Oskar's story moves those he meets to concern and compassion be they survivors or mourners. The unanimous display of empathy is poignant reaffirming humanity's ability to unite behind grief and loss. But screenwriter Eric Roth makes this journey as much about the mutual heroism of New Yorkers trying to make sense and come to terms with the senselessness and devastation as it is about an individual family's struggle to recover from the very disaster.Just as affecting therefore is the examination of the effect that Thomas' death has on the dynamics of the family the mother Linda Sandra Bullock coping with her husband's passing while trying her best to win the understanding and love of her son and the grandmother Zoe Caldwell thrust into an uneasy position as Oskar's confidant even as he rebuffs his mother. Oskar also forms a connection with a certain mysterious Renter Max von Sydow living in his grandmother's apartment whose willingness to accompany Oskar on his trips belies a painful secret and a deeper personal motivation.No stranger to heavyhanded dramas director Stephen Daldry his fourth feature after the critically acclaimed 'Billy Elliot' 'The Hours' and 'The Reader' handles the potentially histrionic proceedings with surprising deftness. Especially heartrending is Linda's predicament a scene where she breaks down from hearing Oskar say the words 'I love you' just outside the main door after he leaves in a huff is particularly touching while a plot twist late into the movie that shows the extent of a mother's love for her son will leave only the hardest of hearts unmoved. Bullock is uncharacteristically lowkey but very effective in the role her heartbreak keenly felt through her grimaces and tears.Daldry also gets an excellent performance from von Sydow with wordless shrugs and sighs he effortlessly conveys his character's troubled past one so traumatising that he has chosen to remain silent and relate to others with a simple 'yes' on one palm and 'no' on the other. And at the heart of it all is Thomas Horn's mesmerising turn the 'Kids Jeopardy' winner utterly captivating as the bright but socially inept kid trying desperately to cling onto the one thing that he thinks will help him remain connected to his deceased father.Appropriately then the film has been nominated for Best Picture honours though amongst the nine nominees this year this is probably the lowest rated overall by critics. Many have criticised Daldry's mawkish sentimentality for undermining the material but in truth we thought there was much restraint and nuance in his method. In fact Daldry deserves praise for preserving both the poignancy and pathos of his source novel delicately portraying both the effect of 911 on a sensitive boy and his family as well as that of the larger community around him. True it takes some time to get to understand Oskar on his level but the very fact that Daldry has retained the inherent eccentrics of his key character is the surest sign that this is not your typical maudlin 911 drama. It is stimulating to say the least extremely tender and incredibly uplifting.www.moviexclusive.com".

	onyx:emotionText "A fair warning before you step into this 911 drama based on the acclaimed novel by Johnathan Safran Foer the protagonist a nineyear old boy living in New York City isn't someone you'll embrace easily even though the fact that he had lost his father in the Twin Towers should win much sympathy. Indeed while we may accept a certain degree of immaturity from the kid due to his age it's appalling to hear him say that his dad whose body like the thousands who perished was never found might just be 'dog faeces' in Central Park or that he wished it was his mother who had lost her life instead.Oskar Schell played by newcomer Thomas Horn is rather the abrasive kid who is both precocious and socially awkward though test results on Asperger's syndrome turned out inconclusive. One year after that fateful day Oskar steps inside his father's closet and finds a key inside an envelope with the name 'Black' scrawled on the front. Thinking that it might be one of his father Thomas' Tom Hanks elaborate puzzles he used to concoct in order to force his son to interact with people Oskar sets off on a personal quest to track down the source of the key.Equipped with a backpack of essentials including an Israeli gas mask 'A Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawkings and a tambourine that he uses to calm himself amid the din and bustle of the city Oskar traverses by foot through the five boroughs of New York knocking on the doors of everyone with the last name 'Black' he can locate in the phone book. Some of the people he meets include a married couple Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright on the verge of divorce a religious woman who offers up Oskar's mission to God and a transsexual with a lifestyle too wild for Oskar's comfort it takes all sorts to make the world and if each of these attempts turn out futile it at least fulfils his father's hope that Oskar will learn to be more sociable.Each encounter is also an affirmation of the collective tragedy that was 911 as Oskar's story moves those he meets to concern and compassion be they survivors or mourners.

He helped another individual that was connected to his father in even a small way! That's a sort of Paying It Forward. But its not the story I want to review its the actor Thomas Horn who played Oskar Schell. Having experience in the industry myself and someone who studies actors for a living I have to say Thomas has talent beyond his years. How he was able to sell to us on not only his character but everything he did from his walk from his physical acting with props and how he was able achieve all this as a 'rookie' is incredible! How he was able to keep it together through that extremely long monologue is beyond me. The movie was pretty much his playground and he just shined all the way through! If this was his first major role I wonder how he auditioned in the first place? Most advanced or veteran actors couldn't pull it off let alone sell it and he SOLD IT! I hope this kid continues to share his talent and gets a lot of work in the near future. It wouldn't shock me if his mailbox is FULL of scripts daily! Amazing! If I can be even 25 as good as that kid I will consider myself VERY lucky and talented. ".

	schema:reviewBody "This seems to be really one of those cases of you'll either love this movie or completely totally hate it. I personally really wasn't expecting much from this movie and knew very little about it as well but I was completely surprised and wowed by it. It's a really warm heartfelt movie filled with both adventure and drama.Things could had so easily turned cheap and sappy in this movie but it really didn't. Instead the movie at all times felt like a real warm and honest one with some great storytelling in it and no I'm normally absolutely not a fan of Stephen Daldry's movies and directing approach. What I absolutely loved about this movie is that it's being told almost entirely from the eyes of a child who has lost his father and is trying to cope with it by going on what he thinks is the one last adventure through the city of New York that his father had planned for him.Really over the years we have had many adventure movies of course but how many of them successfully combined it with some true heartfelt drama in it as well. On that level this movie is already really an unique and original one that works on so many different levels.It seems that the only reason why some people have some major problems with this movie and are even offended by it is because its drama involves 911 and uses its events to emote its audience. And of course while they have a point about this I didn't feel at all as if it was using it in a cheap or gimmicky way to easily get emotions from its audience. The only one thing I will complain about was that it kept referencing a bit too much at it at times. Really one mention of it could had sufficed but the movie instead kept using some flashbacks at times which were still powerful but it got done 2 or 3 times too many in my opinion. Besides there were times I even got confused by it and didn't always intermediately noticed that it was a flashback I was watching.I was absolutely loving all of the characters in this movie and also really liked it that the movie had the guts to portray a little kid as a little kid for a change and not one with some fake emotions feelings and thoughts. Everybody was a kid once some much longer ago than others but I do believe everybody should be able to identify in one way or another with its main character played by the young Thomas Horn who made his acting debut with this movie. But the same more or less goes for all of the other characters as well who got very well written and got played by some well known and great actors. This movie probably features both Tom Hanks' and Sandra Bullock's best performance of the past years and Max von Sydow who never says a word in this movie even got nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie.Really this is one of the best 2011 movies I have seen and it also definitely ranks among my favorite ones as well.810 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It was interesting that of the four of us who went together to see this picture all had different parts that affected us the most. For many of us bringing ourselves to watch anything that had to do with 911 is still too painful to really be excited about. It's still too freshly seared into our minds. Maybe always will be.

Many attempts of those around him to comfort are utterly lost on him and his inability to detect the emotional states in others along with his monomaniacal focus on attempting to process his father's death can make him profoundly unlikable for those not familiar with autism or who don't care.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow just wow. I saw this movie yesterday and it still haunts me. I can still get goosebumps when I try to remember it  it's very few movies that can make me do that. The movie is about a boy and his family  mostly his father  who put up adventures for the boy to complete. The father seems in general caring and loving and pretty darn awesome. The dad dies in 911 and the son completes his last adventure with his dad. On his adventure he meets people that are interesting and loving and generally beautiful portrayed. They salute the indifference's in the human mind. The boy has gotten chaosthinking after his dad died so it's a adventure that will test his strength and go off the limit.In general kidactors doesn't do that well of a job. Sure they can smile and be pretty cute but that's about it. This young actor though has so much more though. There are only few scenes where he has the mind of his age in general he seem far beyond his agerange and seems like he somehow has lifeexperience of a 50 year old. He is a better actor than some adult actors I would believe. When that is said there is some scene where it's obvious that he is just a kid. BUT he steals the show completely and WILL enter you heart so watch this with caution  Max Von Sydow performance is without words and it just shows how great of an actor he truly is. He had captured my heart and I cried with him throughout the film even when he didn't even speak a word! Other stars to mention is Sandra Bullock  she has a breakdown scene with the young Oscar Schell and they fire up on each other. They make each other look great. However when that said I do not believe this is Sandra Bullocks best acting. Her role is simply not energetic enough for her to shine which is a shame. It's only few scenes that allows her to show how great of an actor she really is. All in all this is a great movie to see if you want your heart to pour out. It is sad outstanding and a stunning piece of art. The only thing that I didn't like that much is that the 911 fills too much. While 911 is both a positive thing to the film it's also negative because they talk so much about it. It could be spared in some of the scenes. Yet it still somehow is a great element in the movie.".

The overall effect was to cut the characters off from each other and cut the audience off from the film. Bullock was on camera maybe five minutes max. Hanks ten. It was as if she had booked this film to do in three days shooting not a moment more. The best scenes in the film were all Von Sydow's  and his character doesn't speak. They sell the films as if it is some sort of award winning effort. There isn't enough marketing savvy in the Hollywood to sell that puppy. Or maybe there is.

	schema:reviewBody "Grief is a process. Psychology books and personal experience will tell you that. Perhaps not all of us experience someone being ripped from our lives in an instant but the process is always the same. Why then is it so challenging to watch 9yearold Oskar Thomas Horn whose father Tom Hanks dies in the 911 terrorist attacks endure this alltoofamiliar pain? It should be moving to see a young albeit peculiar child come to terms with this in his own way.Extremely Loud  Incredibly Close attempts to play powerful cinematic music with extremely sensitive strings. The story is steeped in trauma and mourning so the obvious danger would likely be creating a film that's too heavy or suffocating but this story has moments of quirk sincerity and even adventure. The trouble is that not until the end does the film ever let go of what Oskar calls the Worst Dayhis code for 911. It haunts the entire movie and while that can certainly be justified it throws us out of sync with the characters who all seem to experience the fiercest of emotions when we aren't ready for them.The biggest problem is Oskar. It has nothing to do with the young Horn's performance but everything to do with how Oscar winner Eric Roth was forced to adapt him for the screen. I have not read Jonathan Safran Foer's novel but my guess is given the abundant use of narration in the movie Oskar tells the story in the first person. Considering we are forced to follow and identify with a 9yearold with Asperger's and probably some form of autism understanding and relating to this character is crucial yet maddeningly difficult.Understandably through no fault of his own Oskar treats his mother Sandra Bullock poorly swears at his apartment building doorman John Goodman throws temper tantrums lies and despite his curiosity and adventurous spirit uses deduction in place of logic. He's a nightmare of a main character and his constant relapses as the film flashes back to 911 butt in every time you start to warm up to him.Director Stephen Daldry has experience working with troubled boys Billy Elliot but he doesn't appear to do enough to help us sympathize which could be the result of roadblocks in the script. Given that Oskar holds secrets even from the audience until close to the end most of which deal with revisiting 911 it's hard to feel bad for him. He's just a strange kid afraid to move on which isn't exactly revelatory.Oskar's pursuit of finding what a mysterious key found in his father's closet belongs to is supposed to be the start of an adventure but one that never really blossoms. The closest it ever gets is the 30 minutes in which Oskar befriends The Renter Max von Sydow an old man choosing to be mute that lives with Oskar's grandmother in a nearby building. He accompanies Oskar on his journey and challenges him to overcome his fears and makes for an interesting compliment to the evergabbing child. If you had to nominate Extremely Loud  Incredibly Close for an Academy Award it would be for von Sydow so in that sense perhaps he deserves recognition.All the colorful characters you would expect Oskar to meet as he tries to find every single person with the last name Black living in New York City exist in voiceover snippets. From a quick outside glance the story would likely be about a child going on an adventure expecting to find a meaningful answer and learning that the journey was the entire point but it somehow ends up way more convoluted.Extremely Loud's Best Picture nomination is extremely unwarranted. Despite the talent on and behind the camera the product as a whole is messy and most importantly unable to connect emotionally with its audience. Certainly some people will connect with a moment or two and really appreciate the film's emotional fearlessness but anyone versed in Oscar caliber drama knows this doesn't fit the bill despite all the venerated talent that put this movie on Oscar radars everywhere when it first came together.Maybe it's that abundant talent that makes the film's shortcomings all the more difficult to bear but the more you think about it the more you realize this kind of a perspective on September 11  from the eyes of such a challenging protagonist  probably doomed it from the start. The craftsmanship the acting and some of the raw moments in the story make the film nothing to scoff at but the impact of it all which is the heart of this kind of drama doesn't come across as it should.Steven CThanks for reading!

However over time this movie had enough touching moments that felt real and were gagn that in the end it was reasonably enjoyable.The best parts were the emotionally intense scenes of which there were several. The subject matter automatically lead in that direction. What was important was that they were handled well and weren't too obvious or sappy or preachy IMO. I don't normally cry during movies and I didn't but I can see how someone could and there's something healing in that. There doesn't need to be any explanation for a situation for us to learn from it. Simply seeing other people deeply affected by disturbing things can make you feel less alone and give you faith in humanity.People can argue and say nasty words and yet somehow communicate love at the same time through their body language. That brutal honesty that hurts the most usually comes from a very kind sensitive place. It's interesting the kind of guilt we're capable of putting upon ourselves. The desperate fear that you're not a good person that you failed somehow. You can relate to these characters and the way they feel. Death is one of those things that can be scary but which we often completely forget about. It's nice to have a primal emotion or fear brought alive by a movie in the right way.Now some major weaknesses. The plot is stupidly ridiculous. Much of it is technically possible but doesn't hold up well to inspection. It's too cute and clever. I hate when characters go out on misguided missions without thinking them through. It's been done. It's far more interesting to have intelligent characters who run into legitimate or unexpected barriers than simply allowing them to forget all logic at the outset. The plot involves arbitrary devices for creating interesting situations rather than letting logical actions by the characters naturally take them somewhere interesting. It's like bad magic where you can see it all a mile away and there are no surprises.The boy's obnoxious and rude comportement were extreme and distracting at times. He was unlikable for long stretches. I can understand it in the context of him being deeply affected or lost or trying to cope with things but it was still too much and the movie implied he was like that anyway because there was no contrast with his comportement before the events. Sounds like the book is much better in this regard. But it did affect me. Brought a little something out of me. Which can be rare considering how predictable I find the majority of new movies.".

It is his journey to reconnect with his father's memory by going on a quest to find the lock that fits the key left mysteriously in a vase in his father's closet. Along the way this shy and sensitive boy Oskar is forced to meet and interact with a range of citizens and to hear their stories too.More importantly it is about connectedness. It is about realizing that you aren't alone in your pain and learning how to reach out to others for help and comfort. It is about realizing that your aloneness is an illusion.I loved loved loved the chemistry of the father and son in the flashback scenes loved the delightful and unconventional expeditions they embarked upon and enjoyed coming along with Oskar and The Renter to solve the final mystery of the key. I thought that the child actor playing Oskar was wonderful in this breakout role he carried the movie quite well almost singlehandedly except for those scenes with Max Von Sydow's silent character The Renter. Of course Von Sydow stole the show and totally deserved his Academy nomination. In all the actors were brilliant and compelling to match the heartfelt script.Yes there was a certain amount of emotional manipulation involved in this tearjerker what else could you expect from a Sandra Bullock production nowadays?. I can overlook that and wholeheartedly recommend ELIC to anybody as possibly the best 911 film to date.".

There was definitely a Q  A after. Which I believe is the writers intent. Definitely rare qualities in this one.The acting excellent. I made the mistake of watching Larry Crowne because I'm a Tom Hanks fan and I have to say he redeemed himself on this one. Thomas Horn has body language and ticks and emotional skills way beyond his age. Sandra Bullock as the haggard single mom... whoa. They roughed her up for this. Max Von Sydow delivered without saying a word. This movie is very moving  I was choked up for most of it. Better to watch with a loved one and not worry about holding back. It's a ride and a great reminder of the travesty that hit America on 911.".

And thus the adventure begins...as he goes tracking down clues and randomly being let into people's homes...in New York City...and then managing to take their photograph with a camera that is practically an antique and developing the photos one by one all while his mother stands aside clueless.Yeah...right. That all seems plausible. And thus yet another film with high expectation fails to deliver.Horn is the focal point of the film and is supposed to be the emotional driving force yet all this kid does is overact terribly and make the character of Oskar seem almost maniacal. He is irritating on every level and spurred absolutely no emotion in me at all except annoyance. As the film continues on with the sole intent of rousing emotion through memory the film just gets more and more blatantly insulting as the scenes which are supposed to make you well up just peel back the many layers of emotional manipulation.Even the strong performances of Davis and Bullock do not hold this film together. And then there is Max von Sydow who just garnered an Oscar nod in the Best Supporting Actor category. Why? I am really and truly not sure. While there was a sweetness to his limited performance it is hardly anything to write home about. So I'll credit this nomination to we better do it now or it may be too late. Tom Hanks? I almost forgot he was even in the film.If you like to sit back and be emotionally assaulted by a ridiculous story this film is for you. For the rest I suggest you keep it extremely muted and incredibly far away.".

From telling his mother she should have died in the attacks to slapping her awake at night on the face to swearing insults at random people to talking to himself to badgering to referring to 911 as the Worst Day we simply have an entire recipe of what we were brought up not to be like from our own parents.Quit possibly the worst arch in the dull plotless and entirely expected storyline you can tell where the storyline is going minutes ahead of time is the boys cruel and decisive way of holding back 6 integral phone messages from his father to his mother and telling her no one called and keeping them to himself. The messages taken within the Trade Center by his father during the attacks were clearly of incredible significance both in the film and to the emotional backdrop of the story. Instead they're used to hurt and to show the boys complete selfishness and arrogance as well as ignorance towards others. Words cannot express how much I wanted to get up and leave the theater as I watched this with my girlfriend who somehow got the movie and cried her way through it.Looking at the movie through NONmystified eyes the movie has absolutely no closing value and no joie de vivre. It's story arch is bland and quite frankly infuriating. In the end you are disappointed yet again when the boy finds out nothing from his father was left for him in his hunt to find something.... anything. And instead of discovering what the key was for his main clue as to his father leaving something for him you find out it belonged to another man and you don't even find out it's use or value. You then find out that his grandfather never talks and never truly admits to being his grandfather. You find out that the boy needs a damn tambourine in order to go anywhere without being nervous and that when he is nervous he screams and belittles all around him.I could go on and on and on and on about how absolutely terrible this movie is in the eyes of someone who watches a movie for a deeper storyline but instead all I can tell you is that for someone without the ability to dive functionally into a backstory of a movie within their mind this movie is great.Unfortunately for the rest of us it's a horrible and sickening tale of complete scuzz.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sorry for this long digression but Sommersby reminds me of Berthold Brecht's play The Good Woman of Szechuan based on a biblical parable. In the original parable two women each claim that a baby is hers. King Solomon says he'll settle the matter by cutting the baby in half one woman stops him saying that the other can have the baby. Solomon gives the baby to the woman who has offered to relinquish it on the basis that she loves the baby more than the other so she must be the real mother. But in Brecht's version it is the false mother who relinquishes and is therefore given the baby. Brecht draws the Marxist moral from the story that things belong to those who love and use them best regardless of legal ownership.Jon Amiel's beautiful and touching film adapted from a French movie makes much the same point  that the pretended Jack Sommersby Richard Gere deserves to be regarded as the true husband of Laurel Jody Foster because he loves her more than the legal one deserves to be regarded as the owner of the Sommersby land because he works it better and deserves Sommersby's name  whatever that brings  because he honours it more. At a realistic level there are a few difficulties in translating the original Martin Guerre story from the Middle Ages to the post Civil War era and parts of the courtroom sequence could have been more incisive but these flaws are of little account compared with the overall sweep of the film both plotwise but especially visually. It achieves epic proportions at some points and there are wide vistas of people working in the fields reminiscent of Terrence Mallick's Days of Heaven which also starred Gere. It seems to be the done thing on these postings to sneer at Gere's acting I've no idea why. Time after time in a wide range of parts and films  from Yanks and An Officer and a Gentleman to Internal Affairs and Pretty Woman  he delivers professional and sensitive performances. Here again his performance is impeccable as is that of Jodie Foster whose part calls for her to be restrained especially when Sommersby first appears. Incidentally I couldn't care less whether there was any socalled chemistry between Gere and Foster some filmgoers should get it into their heads that couples on the screen are acting at making love not engaging in the real activity.".

The judge strives mightily to be impartial even with those townspeople who would not be so with him.

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1993 and directed by Jon Amiel Sommersby stars Richard Gere as a Confederate soldier returning to his rundown estate in Tennessee and his wife Laurel Jodie Foster after a long six years absence. Curiously Laurel discovers that the war has changed Jack for the better. Bill Pullman plays his rival for Laurel's affections while James Earl Jones appears as a judge in the final act.This is such a welldone Civil War drama taking place just after the war in 18661867. The story is contrived but executed believably with convincing performances. Contrived or not something like this COULD happen if you reflect on it. I can't say more because it's best that you go into the movie without knowing the revelations of the final act. The first half is lowkey but it's just a foundation for the realistic thrills of the midpoint and the suspenseful drama of the closing act.The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in Virginia with the opening winter scene filmed at Snowshoe Mountain Ski Resort West Virginia.GRADE B ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY SPOILER ALERT A clueless reviewer criticized the film on the grounds that this story fell a bit flat for me when Jack for some reason doesn't tell the same true story that clarifies the identity confusion to the court that he does to his wife in the final jail scene. This is incredible because the movie plainly reveals several reasons why Jack didn't want to tell the truth that he wasn't really Jack Sommersby 1. The freed blacks and others who bought  farmed parts of his land would lose it 2. his wife  daughter would be condemned as an adulteress and a bastard child respectively 3. he buried Horace Townsend forever when he buried the real Jack Sommersby he wasn't willing to resurrect that wicked loser even at the cost of his life.And 4. If jack was proved to be Horace and was released another court would have arrested him on the grounds that he was a liar an impostor and a thief. That court would NOT have released him on the grounds that he had found love and done charitable things while impersonating a dead man. He would have gone to prison and possibly even died for his actual crimes.So dying for a cause he believed in for people who respected him made more sense than dying without any honor or legacy whatsoever.".

	schema:reviewBody "A soldier comes home from the Civil War to his village and his wife and son.  The South during the Reconstruction period is an austere impoverished place.  The returning man Jack Sommersby quickly establishes himself as the leader of the community and sets about rebuilding the people's prosperity.  But is he who he claims to be?Hollywood's version of the Martin Guerre legend Sommersby boasts a good performance by Richard Gere and a wonderful one by Jodie Foster as Laurel Sommersby's wife.  Until it allows itself to be deflected by an unconvincing and unnecessary murder trial the film is a likeable and sensitive study of love and identity.The story moves through the seasons from the harshness of winter in the aftermath of war to the solemnity of autumn as Jack Summersby is led away to Nashville.  As the opening credits roll Summersby is literally in the 'dead' of winter surrounded by images of mortality.  He buries a body the real Jack? under a pile of rocks then walks through a cemetery. Children prod the swinging corpse of a hanged man.  Hope returns in the spring as Jack distributes land to the villagers and launches the tobaccogrowing project.  High summer brings the successful maturing of the crop and with it the pinnacle of Summersby's fortunes.The murder trial weakens the film irretrievably.  It does not sit comfortably with what has preceded it and just does not work as a courtroom drama.  The ground has not been prepared for it and so the film is obliged to lurch in an unexpected direction.  Laurel is called as a surprise witness for the Defence and Jack is startled as she approaches the stand.  Is it really conceivable that Jack's attorney would adopt this strategy without having discussed it with his client?Is this a court of law? asks the prosecutor and the viewer is inclined to wonder the same thing.  No attorney would say I believe the prosecution has proved beyond a doubt ...   The lawyer's personal belief has no relevance at all and it is for the jury to decide if the case has been proved not the prosecutor.  Taking a straw poll of opinions in the public gallery is utter nonsense as is the presence of a black judge in a Southern court in the 1860's.  And judges do not pronounce on guilt or innocence.  Juries do that.  The word 'sassy' is hardly likely to have been in currency with its modern meaning in Tennessee 130 years ago.  That a defendant in a murder trial should fire his attorney then immediately crossexamine his own wife who is HIS witness is incredible.The early part of the film lays emphasis on the human cost of war. Many of the menfolk of Tennessee are maimed or mentally scarred.  Sommersby explains the changes that have come over him by hinting that he has undergone some psychological trauma and personality shift.Laurel works in the field trying to hoe the dirt while encumbered by her long skirts.  This is a metaphor of her life as a Southern woman of the period.  She married a man who neither loved nor respected her then 'lost' him in the war.  Now she has the burden of learning to love this man all over again.  Just as her skirts hamper her as a woman she is restricted socially and emotionally.Tiny Jodie Foster turns in a mighty performance.  Her character is by turns grave coquettish withdrawn and affectionate  and at all times bestowed with intelligence and dignity.  This is a woman who yearns to be loved but whose painful experiences have taught her to be wary.Bill Pullman is good as Orin the capable trustworthy local man who was courting the 'widow' Laurel and had expectations of marriage until Jack showed up.  His feud with Jack is thoughtfully handled.  Orin helps cure the tobacco bug problem when a lesser man would have enjoyed Jack's discomfiture.Ultimately the story just does not ring true.  Would a whole village take a stranger for the man who grew up in its midst?  And Jack's final choice which cannot be revealed here negates everything for which he has striven.  It defies logic.".

That a defendant in a murder trial should fire his attorney then immediately crossexamine his own wife who is HIS witness is incredible.The early part of the film lays emphasis on the human cost of war. Many of the menfolk of Tennessee are maimed or mentally scarred.  Sommersby explains the changes that have come over him by hinting that he has undergone some psychological trauma and personality shift.Laurel works in the field trying to hoe the dirt while encumbered by her long skirts.  This is a metaphor of her life as a Southern woman of the period.  She married a man who neither loved nor respected her then 'lost' him in the war.  Now she has the burden of learning to love this man all over again.  Just as her skirts hamper her as a woman she is restricted socially and emotionally.Tiny Jodie Foster turns in a mighty performance.  Her character is by turns grave coquettish withdrawn and affectionate  and at all times bestowed with intelligence and dignity.  This is a woman who yearns to be loved but whose painful experiences have taught her to be wary.Bill Pullman is good as Orin the capable trustworthy local man who was courting the 'widow' Laurel and had expectations of marriage until Jack showed up.  His feud with Jack is thoughtfully handled.  Orin helps cure the tobacco bug problem when a lesser man would have enjoyed Jack's discomfiture.Ultimately the story just does not ring true.  Would a whole village take a stranger for the man who grew up in its midst?  And Jack's final choice which cannot be revealed here negates everything for which he has striven.  It defies logic.";

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Jon Amiel Sommersby is adapted from the historical account of 16th Century French peasant Martin Guerre. It was previously filmed as The Return of Martin Guerre in 1982. It stars Richard Gere Jodie Foster and Bill Pullman. Music is by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot. In simple terms the film is about a man Jack Sommersby who went off to war and was presumed dead by his wife Laurel and the village folk of the village where he lived. Some 9 years later he returns a changed man back in the marital bed and a hero to the village. But then questions start to crop up and it becomes a possibility that this man may not after all be who he claims to be. Sounds bizarre for sure yet it's a true story and a fascinating one at that.For this American version we get top line production values across the board with the film propelled with grace and skill by Gere and Foster in the lead roles of Jack and Laurel Sommersby. Director Amiel rightly uses the slow burn approach a consideration to the art of story telling. This draws the viewer firmly into the post Civil War period and lets us get to know the principal players and their surroundings.The core narrative thrust is a moving romance one consistently under pressure of a mystery to be proved or disproved. But there's also economic issues to hand very much so and the vile stench of racism still hangs in the air. There's a lot going on in Sommersby and it never sags because of it. Also refreshing that in spite of some critical grumblings in some quarters the ending is potent and not very Hollywood at all. It's not flawless and although it's based on a true story some suspension of disbelief is needed as regards physical appearance of Jack and his means and motives. Yet this is a lovely film simple in story telling structure beautifully photographed and performed it very much feels and plays like a classic era period piece. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Part of why this movie resonated so much with me was that I saw it right before I got married and I thought now THAT'S the kind of commitment a marriage needs. This is a rather sweet tale of love and sacrifice. Admittedly it's a bit far fetched at times but if you buy into it it is a rewarding movie.John Robert Jack Sommersby Richard Gere went off to fight the Civil War as did many plantation owners in the South leaving his wife Laurel Jody Fosterand son Brett Kelley behind. Laurel is a resourceful woman and she manages the farm on her own. When Jack is presumed dead Laurel starts a relationship with her neighbor Orin Bill Pullman. Consequently neither of them is particularly happy when Jack turns up at the plantation after the war Laurel because Jack didn't treat her very well and Orin because he wants Laurel. Still Laurel feels she must honor her marriage vows and breaks things off with Orin who being a rather poor sport remains a continual thorn in Jack's side. However Laurel starts noticing that Jack is much different than when he left for the war. He is kinder more loving treats her and their son much better. She actually starts to fall in love with him. The farm prospers and Laurel gives birth to a baby girl that they name Rachel. And then one day Jack is accused of murdering someone during the war. Suddenly the question of his identity becomes all important because Jack Sommersby is guilty of murder of that there is no question. But if this man is someone else pretending to be Jack Sommersby then he is innocent. Of course if he isn't Jack Sommersby then Laurel's reputation is shot as is Rachel's. Who is this man that has been living with Laurel? Who will he choose to be?It's a rather intriguing premise as by the end of the movie Jack is in a no win situation and his choice may not be what the viewer would expect. Still the story is presented in such a way that you understand both Jack's choice in spite of what he must sacrifice and Laurel's willingness to stand by him in spite of what she must sacrifice. This makes for a most satisfying ending.The acting was excellent. Gere gives a moving portrait of a man who discovers love and discovers that love requires a nobility that he hadn't realized he was capable of. Foster's performance shows Laurel's quiet determination to get through whatever she has to and survive as best she can. Pullman's Orin comes off as increasingly whiny and spoiled which works well for the character he creates. James Earl Jones' judge is an excellent rendering. Of the smaller roles the most notable is William Windom as the Reverend Powell showing us that once again no matter how small the part he will give it his all.Admittedly this is a tear jerker. I choke up just thinking of the ending. But it is ultimately a tale of nobility and sacrifice showing that sometimes we must sacrifice all to safeguard those we love.".

It's a movie I watch alone so I can sob all I want to. I find myself wondering what I would do if I were in Mrs. Sommersby's place.Great acting great editing very gripping.

It's an idealistic movie with a strong psychological base.Seema threshold  boundary  limit is the story of Gauri Nutan who is an orphan and lives with her greedy and exploitative uncle and aunt. She only earns for them by working as a maidservant in a household but they treat her very poorly. A criminalminded malebabysitter Baanke C.S. Dubey also works in the same household and keeps on trying to make advances to Gauri. When discarded he traps Gauri under the false charge of theft. She is released by the police on the personal guarantee of her guardians the greedy uncle and aunt but now they refuse to keep her with them. Being labelled as a thief now this innocent and truthful girl does not get any job elsewhere too. Lustful people cast their eyes on her physic only. Homeless jobless starved and bearing the stigma of the theft that she had not done she gets filled with anger for Baanke she approaches him but again gets cheated by him through his sweet talks and the police catches her again. Now seeing almost the whole world against her she loses her temper and starts behaving like an insane person. Since her guardians have refused to take her to their home the police sends her to a charitable institution known as Aashram meant for the care and rehabilitation of homeless females only which is run by a benevolent person Ashok Balraaj Saahni with the help of a lady called Didi Pratima Devi who is the superintendent of the females living in the Aashram and a male assistant  Muralidhar Sunder.Gauri is not ready to live there or listen to anybody in this regard. Her insane behaviour continues resulting in the breakage of furniture window glasses etc. and she refuses to consume any food though she has not eaten anything for quite a period. The inmates of the Aashram as well as the people associated with the management of that are not able to understand her anguish and the cause of her stubborn and rebellious behaviour. However the incharge of the Aashram i.e. Ashok refuses to be judgmental towards Gauri and asserts something similar to the assertion given in the beginning of this review  'Being unaware of the background  experiences of some person you can't understand why he  she behaves the way he  she behaves you may not be knowing the bitterness of life that he  she might have gone through'. And when Gauri accepts food from the hand of a little girl and showers her affection on her he immediately realizes that she is noble at heart and needs sympathy as well as empathy to recover from some trauma that she might have undergone.Now Gauri gets normal with the passage of time and by the effect of the positive environment in the Aashram but still the fire within her heart against Baanke has not been mitigated and she wants to take her revenge from him. She gets empathy and help from her inmate Putli Shubha Khote who has been a criminal in her past. She moves out of the Aashram one night and reaches Baanke. She beats him black and blue and thus vent her anger stuffiness and frustration out returning to the Aashram thereafter feeling light and relieved. However for breaking the rule of the Aashram going out without permission and without any escort she gets punishment to live in seclusion for a night. Considering it an injustice as she feels that by punishing Baanke she has done nothing wrong she starts behaving rebelliously again which immediately renders a message to Ashok that perhaps the theftcharge levied on her was not genuine. He traps Baanke with the help of Muralidhar and by arranging his confession gets the stigma of being a thief washed away from Gauri's forehead. Now Gauri not only becomes absolutely normal but she also refuses to leave the Aashram and with utmost gratitude towards Ashok keeps on working tirelessly and sincerely to meet the noble objectives of the Aashram. Ashok works very hard despite the fact that he is a heart patient. He is able to sense the tender feelings in Gauri's heart towards him but feeling that he may not live for long and getting concerned for Gauri perhaps because he also has started loving her within his heart he asks her to marry Muralidhar and settle down in life. Besides he decides to move out of the city for some time so that Gauri is able to drive her thoughts away from him and marry peacefully in his absence. However it does not happen and the true love of Gauri only triumphs in the end.Shankar Jaikishan have composed unforgettable gems with the help of the heartconquering lyrics of Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. It contains Manna Dey's classic devotional song  Tu Pyar Ka Saagar Hai Teri Ek Boond Ke Pyaase Hum on one hand and Lata's gems viz. Suno Chhoti Si Gudiya Ki Lambi Kahaani Mann Mohana Bade Jhoothe and Baat Baat Mein Rootho Na on the other. It also contains Mohammad Rafi's impressive song  Hamen Bhi De Do Sahaara Ki Besahaare Hain. However the song which I am never able to forget even for a moment is Rafi's classic philosophical song  Kahaan Ja Raha Hai Tu Aye Jaane Waale Andhera Hai Mann Ka Diya To Jala Le where are you heading for O traveller there's dark before you hence first light up the lamp of your heart before proceeding.Seema is undoubtedly an excellent movie. A masterpiece for sure.".

When Gauri is accused by her employer of stealing a necklace for no fault of her own she almost finds herself jailed. But when she is released she is thrown out of her home and for several days wanders in the streets without food and without any chance to find a new job as she is stigmatised. Soon she is forcibly taken to an orphanage but she is no longer the innocent girl she was as circumstances have already turned her into a wicked rebel. She is unstoppable and the people there cannot deal with her constantly hot temper. But time will change everything. This is the basic story of this highly enjoyable picture and it is also one of its main strengths. I'm always interested to watch Hindi movies from this era and the film was quite an interesting watch. The first half actually surprised me because at many points it was a sort of a minithriller and had some successfully gripping moments. The second half brings a lighter mood to the film as the main protagonist finds friendship and everything is more positive. Towards the end the film does get a bit annoyingly preachy and melodramatic but I liked the ending itself which was a good conclusion to the story. The film stars Nutan in an authorbacked role and this natural actress gives a convincing performance as the viewer clearly feels she is involved in the proceedings even if sometimes the script lets her down. Also one of my favourite actors Balraj Sahni is as fine and restrained as ever in the role of the kind manager. Shubha Khote looked very pretty in her young days and she is very good here in a significant supporting role. ShankarJaikishen compose a nice soundtrack although the songs were too frequent and for some reason I often used the FF button when they started something I don't usually do. Anyway Seema is a very nice film which is a good watch for lovers of Hindi cinema and its golden days.".

The second half brings a lighter mood to the film as the main protagonist finds friendship and everything is more positive. Towards the end the film does get a bit annoyingly preachy and melodramatic but I liked the ending itself which was a good conclusion to the story. The film stars Nutan in an authorbacked role and this natural actress gives a convincing performance as the viewer clearly feels she is involved in the proceedings even if sometimes the script lets her down. Also one of my favourite actors Balraj Sahni is as fine and restrained as ever in the role of the kind manager. Shubha Khote looked very pretty in her young days and she is very good here in a significant supporting role. ShankarJaikishen compose a nice soundtrack although the songs were too frequent and for some reason I often used the FF button when they started something I don't usually do. Anyway Seema is a very nice film which is a good watch for lovers of Hindi cinema and its golden days.";

	schema:reviewBody "I hate wrestling but when I saw The Rundown last year I had to admit The Rock is one cool guy and a perfect action star. He's big and tough but most importantly he's charismatic and has a sense of humor and a certain softness that actually makes him seem somewhat vulnerable. This is what sets him apart from someone like Vin Diesel who was all set to be the next big action star but never was because he has no personality or sense of humor.Walking Tall is a remake of a 1973 basedonfact film about a man who fights back against corruption in his town by becoming sheriff and waging war on the bad guys. I haven't seen the original but I'm willing to bet it's closer to the truth than the 2004 Walking Tall which is packed with more machine guns axes exploding trucks and gunfighting strippers than anything that's based on fact could possibly be. Here Vaughn returns home after years of being away to find his hometown in shambles and dependent on a corrupt casino run by drugdealing knifewielding thugs. After he receives a brutal beating and his nephew Khleo Thomas from Holes nearly overdoses on crystal meth bought there the war is on. My inner 12 yearold says Woohoo!. Yes this film is ridiculously over the top. It's also completely predictable. But it's FUN. A lot of fun in fact. It's extremely fast paced wellacted the action scenes are excellent and at just under 80 minutes it's exceptionally lean too. Not one unnecessary or drawnout scene.Walking Tall doesn't aim to be anything except oldfashioned popcorn entertainment and it succeeds yet it has been made with surprising artistry as well. The cinematography is very good and there are some interesting things done with sound and unexpected fadeouts. Also Vaughn is an interestingly complex hero complex as far as these movie go anyway. At one point when he clearly wants to bring a loaded shotgun into a fight with him he hesitates and brings a lessdeadly 2x4 instead. It's a neat moment.So it's not going to be winning any awards any time soon. But I had a really good time plain and simple and the audience I saw it with did too.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Rock is the next great action hero. He has all the requisites. He is handsome an amazing athlete with an awesome physique charismatic intelligent and funny. His star power carries Kevin Bray's Walking Tall.The Rock is great in an entertaining movie. Walking Tall though great fun to watch and capably produced and directed also punctuates that The Rock needs to work on more edgy and quality projects. He is definitely a movie star who can become a solid actor. Walking Tall has to overcome a very convoluted writing credit. This is not a retelling of the Bufford Pussor story although its original screen writer Mort Bristein is acknowledged. This Walking Tall by David Klass Channing Gibson David Levien and Brian Koppelman tells the story of returning Special Forces war hero Chris Vaughn The Rock who comes home to a small town outside Seattle. The town mill has been closed down and his old high school bud Jay Hamilton Neal McDonough owns the new town casino and pretty much owns the local police too. Jay is not the man he remembered from his youth. Chris is forced to raise his hand reluctantly against Hamilton's men. They leave him for dead and fortunately Chris survives. So Chris is out to right an injustice and exact revenge with extreme prejudice. This Walking Tall resembles First Blood particularly in it's local and plot setting. Props to Director Kevin Bray for delivering on the story line as Chris exacts his revenge. Bray has a clean and lean style. The action sequences are crisp and dramatic. The Rock truly excels in the fight sequences. For one thing he is an big strong guy and when he is laying the smack down on the villains it is believable and thoroughly enjoyable. The bad guys truly get what they deserve. The supporting cast is solid. Ashley Scott almost unrecognizable from the shortlived Birds of Prey is good as the stripper with a big heart who is Chris's love interest. Johnny Knoxville of Jackass is funny and charming as Chris's bud and deputy Ray. I completely enjoyed Walking Tall. It is a brisk 75 minutes of cool action and has the star power of The Rock. I look forward to seeing more movies starring The Rock.".

He quickly learns things in his hometown are not as he had left them and not for the better. Soon things come to a head and he has to make a choice as to whether he is going to put up with it or Walk Tall.As The Rock himself mentioned the original Sheriff Buford was a white man in his 40's so remember this is an adaptation of a 1970's movie script that was originally based on a true story so we are a pretty long ways out from accurately representing the original events this is only representing the SPIRIT of the original true story.Fabulous fight scenes a tense script and some funny moments all are reminiscent of the numerous Chuck Norris movies that portrayed a quiet guy that doesn't take any bullcrap from nobody man!While the script made perfect sense in an earlier time  the Viet Nam era it doesn't quite fly 100 in this day and age. So suspend a little belief.You may findyourself scratching your head as to how that could happen in this day and age.. well.. it could back then  even though it didn't really haha. However no mention is made of the actual time period they are trying to represent yet they mention current items like home depot and cops TV show. The moonshine whiskey sheriff buford fought is updated in this script to be crystal methice.The acting is surprisingly good for the Rock and he is looking manly in this movie instead of the sculpted eyebrow weirdo looks he has achieved in the past. Instead of looking like a dancer in a gay club like he did in Scorpion King he looks the rough and tumble part for this role.His attachment to his family is acted in a clumsy and weak manner but that isn't really important to the script even if he only sort of likes his family he would still protect them with his life so it still works for the momentum of the movie.Johnny Knoxville is mainly weak but has some great shining moments where they allow him to be Johnny Knoxville instead of the stupid 1d concept of his character that seems to be forced on him through the other parts of the flick. At times he is reminiscent of Barney Fife to Rock's Andy.

	schema:headline " An enjoyable action film but it felt a bit thin";
	schema:reviewBody "Walking Tall is The Rock's fourth foray into major motion pictures and different turn then his previous three trips to the box office.  What separates 'Walking Tall' from his other films to date is The Rock is left alone as the sole 'draw' of this film without a major franchise The Mummy Returns Scorpion King or other star power The Rundown with Sean William Scott and Christopher Walken to draw an audience.  Is it a success?Yes and no.Overall it's an enjoyable action film with good a plot decent characters and acting and some hardhitting action sequences.  It centres on Chris Vaughn The Rock returning home from the Army after many years of service only to realize it isn't the place he left all those years ago.  A former friend and casino owner Jay Hamilton Neal McDonough controls much of the town through gambling prostitution and drugs.  After Vaughn is attacked in the Casino and his nephew overdoses on drugs he teams with his best friend Ray Johnny Knoxville becomes the town's Sheriff and goes about trying to set things right.It is The Rock's movie first and foremost and his natural charisma and personality are what carries the movie at its core.  The Rock plays Chris Vaughn and delivers as well as can be expected after four films he is definitely looking more in his element.  The Rock is supported wonderfully by the surprising Johnny Knoxville of Jackass fame who turns in a wonderfully solid and funny performance as Ray Vaughn's best friend and later deputy.  Neal McDonough plays the main villain of the picture and although he doesn't have much to work with outside of being just the bad guy he handles it well and is matched well against The Rock.This movie is decidedly 'heavier' then Rock's previous outings dealing with more significant topics like prostitution and drugs which gives it a more serious edge.  It certainly doesn't feel like a 'fun' film like all of The Rock's other movies to date.The action scenes are solid and are a firm connection to the plot. Unlike Rock's previous films the fight scenes are more traditional 'realistic' looking fights.  That being said for action junkies there's definitely something here for you with The Rock getting into it with his hands and guns there's definitely something for everyone.That said I felt Walking Tall was a little bit thin.  First and foremost it ran at a meagre 85 minutes which was simply not enough time for a movie like this.  Although all the necessary plot points were properly established I felt the movie needed another 20 minutes or so to breath'. Everything progresses logically just much too quickly to build the level of suspense and anticipation I think the movie was capable of.  As a result leading up to the climax of the movie it almost feels like a race to the finish.  More character development and background was definitely warranted as well as greater explanation on certain plot points.I felt that this was a movie that a studio may have cut for time reasons or ratings it also felt like it was being squeezed into PG13 and if that were the case I'd love to see the full version.  I feel it would be a much more complete film with a better build up therefore making the payoff mean all that much more.Overall I enjoyed Walking Tall and would recommend it to anyone despite its faults.  The Rock is being championed as the next big action star and I have to agree he has the charisma looks and moves to make it far with Walking Tall being a major 'step' in getting him there.".

	schema:headline " Walking Tall  The Cliff Notes Version";
	schema:reviewBody "After having found Dwayne The Rock Johnson's last film The Rundown a very enjoyable action outing I was hoping for big things from The Rock. When I discovered his next film was this remake of the 1973 version of Walking Tall I was hoping for great things.  The week before the premiere my enthusiasm was tempered by three huge things the film had working against it.The first disappointment was in discovering it was to be an MGM release. From the studio that once boasted more stars than there are in heaven it can now be referred to the studio that makes it as cheap as possible then throws it on the big screen for a few weeks and finishes it off by rushing the DVD out to market.  As a profitability concept I can't argue whether the strategy is working or not but having seen many of their recent films I can say it fails as far as any kind of cinematic achievements are concerned. Oh sure once in a while they get lucky with one and it's half way decent but it's not because of any real concern for quality.The second slap in the face was to discover the running time was a little over an hour and fifteen minutes.  Considering that the original Walking Tall with Joe Don Baker ran for over two hours this was definitely not a good sign.  Add to that the fact that I had once seen the running time of the remake listed as one hour and forty minutes one could only guess as to what footage was now cluttering the cutting room floor.Then the coup de grace was after reading some of the IMDB comments before leaving for the theater we find that Vince McMahon the guy who gave us Wrestling and even worst the XFL has his hand in this film some where. Things were not looking good this morning but my mind was made up and I was going to go.  So were my early hopes realized or did my worst nightmare come true?  The answer is somewhere in between.Whereas the first Walking Tall film was a fictionalized account of Sheriff Buford Pusser of McNairy County in Tennessee the writers producers and director of this remake decided it wasn't fictionalized enough.  Not only does it no longer take place in Tennessee it now takes place in Washington. Our hero is no longer Buford Pusser the exwrestler he is now Chris Vaughn ex U.S. Special Forces Sergeant.  I guess it wouldn't have looked good to have The Rock talking negatively about wrestling the way Joe Don Baker badmouthed it in the original.  Especially since Vince McMahon is a producer.  Chris unlike Buford who had a wife and two kids is single. But he does have an exgirlfriend lurking about somewhere.  The reason I relate this information to you is because a lot of the original film depended on Buford's home life. In this version it is only slightly needed which would partially explain the short running time.  It also makes this remake a film that lacks the ability to involve us in it's storyline like we should be.Walking Tall actually does start off well and is relatively faithful to the original.  Upon returning home Buford...err I mean Chris returns home to find that the Lumber Mill that supported his home town has closed placing his father Chris Sr. John Beasleyout of work.  Also living at home are his mother his paramedic sister and his nephew.  Unfortunately unlike the original film his family is here for the purpose of supplying a few plot devices that develop later in the film and nothing more.What is new in town is a corrupt casino built by the an old buddyNeal Mcdonough who closed the mill putting everybody out of work.  On a visit there with his friend Ray Johnny Knoxville Chris finds some crooked dice at a crap game.  After fighting with the casino's security force he is subdued viciously cut and left for dead.  Later when Chris's nephew overdoses on drugs ahh! the plot device I mentioned supplied by the same people who knifed him Chris decides to seek revenge.  It is at this moment that the film begins to loose it's grip by degenerating into a series of poorly staged fights and even worse shoot 'em ups.Portions of the film are entertaining in large part due to the on screen natural charisma that The Rock has.  Just as in The Rundown the role of action hero seems to come naturally to him and as far as acting ability is concerned after only three leading roles he is already ahead of Schwarzenegger's capabilities after the same number of films.  An even bigger surprise was Johnny Knoxville as his best friend Ray.  He has some of the best written lines in the film and seems to have just the right screen persona for his role.  The rest of the cast is basically generic.  Neal McDonough's villainous Jay talks more threatening than he appears and that's a major problem.  In the original film the threat of danger always seemed imminent and except for Chris's initial fight we never believe he or anyone else is in any real danger.  Even a tussle between Ray and some guys holding Rock's family hostage is played partially for laughs which also indicates how badly the film slips into being just another cardboard action film.Another gripe I have though is obviously there are chunks of this film that are missing.  I don't know whether it was a studio decision a McMahon decision or a decision by director Bray to cut the film but the decision was a bad one.  At times the film loses what little cohesiveness it has by leaving some scenes unfinished and jumping inexplicably to others.  Go figure.I suppose there's nothing totally bad about being a formulaic action film except there is no reason why this film couldn't have been and shouldn't have been so much more.  If it had been developed into the same kind of engrossing story that the original was it wouldn't matter how much they changed it.  It was a golden opportunity for The Rock to really shine and strut his stuff but it is an opportunity now lost.  If memory serves me correctly the original Walking Tall was blasted mercilessly and I think unfairly by some critics.  Audiences didn't care though and they flocked to it.  This remake has also been blasted by some critics and I won't disagree with them.  Unfortunately for The Rock I don't think the audiences are going to stand in line for this one.If you want to see more about the original Walking Tall film you must do two things.  First forget that you ever saw Joe Don Baker in Mitchell and second get the DVD that is readily available.  That's my recommendation and when I have to recommend another film to people I have no choice but to give the remake my grade which is a more than generous C".

Walking Tall however isn't that bad and it's one of the better remakes out there. Dwayne Johnson is solid as the lead and proves to be a talented actor while bringing some of his wresting experience to the movie during the actionfight sequences. Johnson turns in a good performance of a man who returns home to find it overrun by crime and corruption which drives him to become sheriff in order to put an end to it. The rest of the cast including Johnny Knoxville Neal McDonough and Ashley Scott are okay in their roles but except for maybe Knoxville they're not given much to do. The movie felt short and rushed with an 86 minute running time. Some of the fight sequences especially the one near the end between Johnson and McDonough go over the top. Johnson's performance however and the action sequences make this movie worth seeing at least once. Overall despite its flaws Walking Tall is decent remake one of the better ones with intense action fist fights some humor and good performances by the cast.".

Obviously in these type of movies the good guys always have to win so it's really important that the director make sure the good guys come out looking much better than the bad guys so that when the good guys win the audience is satisfied. This movie does that perfectly having The Rock have something extremely cowardly done to him near the beginning of the film. Johnny Knoxville adds a lot to this movie as well with some good humor.

	schema:headline " Surprisingly good movie with a strong performance from the Rock the new action hero and actor.";
	schema:reviewBody "First off I'm a huge Arnie fan. I love the action flick and my hero of action is Arnie with Willis coming a close second. So when I heard that Welcome to the Jungle represented Arnie handing the mantle to some WWF wrestler I was extremely disappointed how could anyone entertain me as Arnie had?Well I never did see Jungle but I have just watched Walking Tall and met this Rock fella and you know what? I'm impressed. If this is the guy to carry on what Arnie did I'm with him all the way.Movie In this movie Rock can act and act well. He's big and really grabs a hold of the action hero role but on top of that he's personable engaging and very believable. He has a great screen presence his lines aren't delivered flat there's not any overacting and he's very real in the role.What's more surprising is that Johnny Knocksville isn't that bad either. I've heard many negative things about this guys acting but in this movie he doesn't do too badly. Sure he does look a little awkward in some scenes but overall he's very competent.Neal McDonough who I last saw in the TV show called Boomtown is if it wasn't for Rocks surprising performance the star of the film. Essentially playing his character from Boomtown but without any of the good characters aspects he's mean and ruthless here a part he plays superbly well.The story does have an older more western or fifties feel to it and this stands it in good stead making it feel less like a modern action movie and more of a character based story. Something it carries off really well and helped by the large performances of the actors involved. It also does a good job of building tension and developing the story at a good pace.There's a good filming style in the movie simple and realistic helping the feel of the movie along leaps and bounds. That seems to come through on everything from the camera work to the dialogue and from the fight scenes to the sometimes excellent editing  most memorable as the Rock drives through town after his second Casino visit. The fight scenes benefit most from this style giving a wide view of very realistic hand to hand fighting which often turns out to be quite brutal. The characters pick up anything to fight with and there's no stylish moves here. They are tough vicious and the characters get seriously hurt.Picture Widescreen 2.351  Anamorphic In keeping with the realistic tone of the film the picture is filled with natural colours and lighting nothing is over saturated and it's clear and sharp throughout.Audio Dolby Digital 5.1 Dolby Digital 2.0  The audio is good and particularly strong during some of the fight sequences. It also features a soundtrack which matches the setting and tone of the film well.Extras Audio commentary from director Kevin Bray director of photography Glen MacPherson and editor Robert Ivision Audio commentary with star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Alternative ending Outtakes 'Stunts' featurette introduced by The Rock Photo gallery Theatrical trailerThe deleted scenes and outtakes are interesting but not that entertaining or overly informative apart from the Rock's accidental breast grab. The same applies to the alternative ending which is a little bit funny but nothing revealing about the editing decisions.The audio commentaries are the strong part of this DVD offering with one from the Director Director of Photography and Editor and the other from the man himself Dwayne The Rock Johnson. Although the filmmakers commentary is informative the commentary from the Rock is as much of a surprise as the movie itself. It's both amusing and insightful for the movie making process as well as the person himself. Surprisingly humble self depreciating and open the commentary lets you get to know the Rock as well as a ton of facts about the movie and the actors. This guy can talk!Overall I saw the first comment about this movie on IMDb and it slates it calling it a mindless action movie. Quite frankly that's rubbish. This movie has a lot more to it that most action flicks and has a fair chunk of characterisation over them too. It's quite a morale tale as well as one based on a true life story and apparently it's quite true to the real story. However it does have its fair share of action but something that stands out for the movie is the realism in which it is portrayed and shot. There are still some traditional action scenes but for the most part it keeps it grounded and tells a good tale that does give you a warm feeling. Entertainment with a good message I like it.Also for your consideration is the performance of the Rock. Not only does he prove himself to be a great action hero but he also surprises you in his acting ability. I was wholly taken in by him and really latched onto his performance. Don't forget we also have the delights of McDonough as his adversary.It's well shot well acted and a good entertaining story with more meat than you would expect. Don't write this off as a simple action movie look deeper give it a chance and check out the audio commentary by the Rock.".

	onyx:emotionText "First off I'm a huge Arnie fan. I love the action flick and my hero of action is Arnie with Willis coming a close second. So when I heard that Welcome to the Jungle represented Arnie handing the mantle to some WWF wrestler I was extremely disappointed how could anyone entertain me as Arnie had?Well I never did see Jungle but I have just watched Walking Tall and met this Rock fella and you know what? I'm impressed. If this is the guy to carry on what Arnie did I'm with him all the way.Movie In this movie Rock can act and act well. He's big and really grabs a hold of the action hero role but on top of that he's personable engaging and very believable. He has a great screen presence his lines aren't delivered flat there's not any overacting and he's very real in the role.What's more surprising is that Johnny Knocksville isn't that bad either. I've heard many negative things about this guys acting but in this movie he doesn't do too badly. Sure he does look a little awkward in some scenes but overall he's very competent.Neal McDonough who I last saw in the TV show called Boomtown is if it wasn't for Rocks surprising performance the star of the film. Essentially playing his character from Boomtown but without any of the good characters aspects he's mean and ruthless here a part he plays superbly well.The story does have an older more western or fifties feel to it and this stands it in good stead making it feel less like a modern action movie and more of a character based story. Something it carries off really well and helped by the large performances of the actors involved. It also does a good job of building tension and developing the story at a good pace.There's a good filming style in the movie simple and realistic helping the feel of the movie along leaps and bounds. That seems to come through on everything from the camera work to the dialogue and from the fight scenes to the sometimes excellent editing  most memorable as the Rock drives through town after his second Casino visit. The fight scenes benefit most from this style giving a wide view of very realistic hand to hand fighting which often turns out to be quite brutal. The characters pick up anything to fight with and there's no stylish moves here. They are tough vicious and the characters get seriously hurt.Picture Widescreen 2.351  Anamorphic In keeping with the realistic tone of the film the picture is filled with natural colours and lighting nothing is over saturated and it's clear and sharp throughout.Audio Dolby Digital 5.1 Dolby Digital 2.0  The audio is good and particularly strong during some of the fight sequences. It also features a soundtrack which matches the setting and tone of the film well.Extras Audio commentary from director Kevin Bray director of photography Glen MacPherson and editor Robert Ivision Audio commentary with star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Alternative ending Outtakes 'Stunts' featurette introduced by The Rock Photo gallery Theatrical trailerThe deleted scenes and outtakes are interesting but not that entertaining or overly informative apart from the Rock's accidental breast grab. The same applies to the alternative ending which is a little bit funny but nothing revealing about the editing decisions.The audio commentaries are the strong part of this DVD offering with one from the Director Director of Photography and Editor and the other from the man himself Dwayne The Rock Johnson. Although the filmmakers commentary is informative the commentary from the Rock is as much of a surprise as the movie itself. It's both amusing and insightful for the movie making process as well as the person himself. Surprisingly humble self depreciating and open the commentary lets you get to know the Rock as well as a ton of facts about the movie and the actors. This guy can talk!Overall I saw the first comment about this movie on IMDb and it slates it calling it a mindless action movie. Quite frankly that's rubbish. This movie has a lot more to it that most action flicks and has a fair chunk of characterisation over them too. It's quite a morale tale as well as one based on a true life story and apparently it's quite true to the real story. However it does have its fair share of action but something that stands out for the movie is the realism in which it is portrayed and shot. There are still some traditional action scenes but for the most part it keeps it grounded and tells a good tale that does give you a warm feeling. Entertainment with a good message I like it.Also for your consideration is the performance of the Rock. Not only does he prove himself to be a great action hero but he also surprises you in his acting ability. I was wholly taken in by him and really latched onto his performance.

	schema:headline " Definitely not what makes an American Action movie... Spoiler";
	schema:reviewBody "Like most people I enjoy the overthetop mindless drivel action movie every now and then. Who doesn't have those moments when they walk to their DVD collection grab a couple Van Damme movies or their worn out copy of Die Hard and know that for the next hour and a half they won't have to think. Instead they'll be able to kick back on the couch maybe have a couple beers and let their testosterone levels overflow with explosions fight scenes and the random chick who's only point in the movie is to get half naked and throw out her three lines about how manly the main character is.Walking Tall disappointed me on every level of what makes an American Action movie. It's not that we don't get those three elements everything is there. They're just horribly disappointing.Explosions  This may be all this movie has to offer. It's just disappointing it was done on such a small scale. Slot machines get smashed a truck blows up another one gets taken apart and a building gets shot up. While I did find it amusing when Johnny Knoxville took a chain saw to a huge truck and the 5 minute segment of them destroying this truck to look for drugs was finished all they did was take off the doors rollbar lights and the grill. The only explosion was The Rock's truck. Everything else that was demolished or destroyed looks like something from an old western saloon style brawl ie. tables glass random junk that makes impacts look bigger. One positive thing we do get to see big guns. It's only for 5  10 minutes though. Before and after that the gun play is virtually nonexistent. The Rock doesn't even carry a gun as the sheriff. Instead he widdled down a 2x4 and upholds the law with that.Fights Scenes  without say this is the key element. While explosions are important they're just there to glorify the fight sequences. With The Rock as the main character you expect a lot of fighting. They delivered but once again on a horribly small scale. The importance of them is well... Not important but that's expected in an action movie. The downfall is the dynamics of the fighting. To be honest I'm not a fan of professional wrestling but I put that aside and watched The Rock as a legit action superstar in other words the same as I'd watch a Vin Diesel or Jackie Chan film. The fighting itself is less then glamorous. I'll use the midwestern saloon metaphor again. It's nothing but bareknuckle no style fighting. And the worst thing about it is there is no foe that rivals The Rock's ability. Every good action movie has that one guy who is an awesome fighter and pushes the hero to the edge. Not in this movie. The final stand off is The Rock vs. The Lanky Albino. The only thing that keeps the fight balanced is the umpteenmillion falls they have in between the Rock beating him down to a pulp. Then to make matters worse the trip TO the final standoff is nothing more then a hopskip and a trip around the block to the scene. There's NO static on the way there's no henchmen keeping him from the final meeting there's nothing. I think they accidentally killed off 34 of the cast in 10 minutes and the director didn't realize it until it was too late. I guess that would explain the numerous falls inorder to compensate for the less than actionesque finale.Supporting role  This will be quick. There is one side action scene in the entire movie. Which is normal I'm not dogging that at all. No one expects The Rock to be good at romance or have some lady's man charisma that gets all the girls. It just happens out of no where which again totally fine by me. The part that bother me is that we have to spend more time looking at The Rock with his shirt off then the stripper turned sweetie. I mean the scene ENDS with the formerstripper taking off her shirt.This movie is definitely not The Rock at his best whatever 'his best' might be. If you're desperate for an action movie and nothing else is sounding even remotely good I'd still advise against it and rent an old 70's KungFu movie instead. If you're not into KungFu movies well... Go ahead and rent it. If you watch it with absolutely no expectations and don't try to compare it to any other classics you might actually get a miniscule amount of entertainment from it. If you can watch bad movies and laugh at them then you'll enjoy this.".

Just go with it okay.Now how can you ruin a deep plot like that you might ask if you haven't already realized it I'm trying to use as much sarcasm as I can here. Well we have a run time of 75 minutes. That gives our main actor Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson look for this guy to win academy awards in the future D when you consider the amount of low quality action and pointless oneliners almost no time to actually act.Let me give you a big spoiler to show how stupid this movie is. After being a victim of tainted justice Vaughn decides to run for sheriff. He slams his fist in a courtroom and rips open his shirt showing everyone his cut up chest after being tortured by the evil casino guys. Next scene. He's the sheriff! He's driving around in his police truck with his trusty two by four now with a carved handle hanging on a gun rack behind him! How do you fight criminals? Why with a corrupt policeman of course! He pulls over one of these casino guys and smashes out his tail lights. That's right Vaughn you clean up that town! This movie is awful. It is so so awful! Perhaps you should go see it just to see how awful it is. It is so awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Rock plays Chris Vaughan a special forces soldier who returns home to revive his family lumber business only to discover that the town has been corrupted by drugs and violence thanks to a crooked casino boss Neal McDonough. Swearing to clean up his hometown Vaughan takes matters in his own hand in a way that epitomizes the saying speak softly and carry a big stick.The story is pretty generic yet this could have been a good stylish slick action movie. The final result is only average and a bit of a disappointment. I only rated the movie above average because of The Rock. He's makes a good hero and he gives a pretty good performance. Just watching him kick ass is pretty fun and he's good at that. He's working with a weak script though. The story is kind of lame and it doesn't really develop well. Actually nothing really develops since the film is only about 75 minutes long. This may or may not be problem depending on if you want a brainless action film or something with a little more substance.Besides for The Rock the only other person that stands out is Neal McDonough. He does the best with his role and gives a good performance. Johnny Knoxville tried too hard to be funny and he ended up being annoying. He doesn't hurt the film but he doesn't help it either. Kevin Bray directs this remake and he does a decent job. He's pretty weak when it comes to telling a good story but he does a decent job with the action. The action itself isn't that impressive and the film gets boring from time to time. Walking Tall is also highly unrealistic so don't go in expecting a realistic movie. Example someone falls two stories and he is still able to fight without much trouble. Compared to The Rock's previous films Walking Tall is better than the Scorpion King but not as good as The Rundown. In the end this might make a decent rental for those who want a brainless action flick but there's very little substance to support the action. Rating 610".

	schema:headline " Walking Tall is more like The Rock is sitting down";
	schema:reviewBody "The Rock is one of the greatest performer in and outside of the ring but 'Walking Tall' isn't one of his best. Dwayne Johnson is missing the stuff that made him famous. His character of Chris Vaughn lacks his sense of humor his charisma and his ability to hook the audience's attention. Hooking the audience is the key and sadly this movie does not. The Rock's persona got cut back as Chris felt more like a bland Boy Scout. Chris Vaughn is supposedly based on famous sheriff Bufurd Pusser of the 1960's. This film ever cut the best parts of the original Walking Tall story by having the events place out in Washington rather than the Deep South. Nothing against Washington but the Deep South is where the real Buford Pusser's story begins. Pusser is known for his virtual oneman war on moonshining prostitution gambling and other vices on the MississippiTennessee stateline. As sheriff Pusser survived seven stabbings and eight shootings. At less the 1973 version kept him in the same area and same name. That movie had Joe Don Baker as Buford Pusser and it did kinda strays pretty far from the basic facts of the crusading sheriff's life. It's not a great film but there is some entertainment value associated with it despite the endless amounts of boom mikes in some of its shots. The film made Pusser a ex prowrestler who comes over to stop a casino and prostitution ring with a 2x4 Wooden Board that was later use as a gimmick for another wrestler Hacksaw Jim Duggan. Walking Tall was rated R having more violence than the 2004 version. For goodness sakes Pusser almost got his jaw almost blown off and his Tshirt so soaked with blood. The 2004 movie plays it safe with it being PG13. Having it PG13 somewhat hurts the film due to the reasons that I can't find the villains to be much of a threat the Rock can't be the badass he is and the movie felt like safe career move for Dwayne Johnson. Vaughn the homespun dogooder underdog type will only further cement Dwayne likable movie persona. That's why it seem like Chris Vaughn is carrying a 2x4 of boredom while cleaning his town. After return home from service U.S Army Special Forces Chris Vaughn looks for work at the mill to find it closed and a casino has taken it's place as the main source of income of the town. He soon find out that his old school mate Jay Hamilton Neal McDonough is the owner. Neal McDonough is just what you'd expect from a generic bad guy  he does a lot of sneering and nothing more. Not only does Jay own the place but his exgirlfriend Deni Ashley Scott works as a stripper there. Ashley Scott is just what you'd expect from a generic girlfriend  she has a nice body an acceptable face and almost no dialogue. After noticing the casino is fixed and selling drugs. He wrecked the place. So if you want to become Sheriff go berserk and wreck a casino. Then become your own lawyer at your trial and plead why you should be Sheriff to a town that hasn't saw you in years. Tell them that the casino is evil despite probably most of them income comes from working at the casino. Yessurely that would trust you. Chris Vaughn runs for sheriff wins somehow and fired all the polices due to original Sheriff abusing his power. Rock doesn't like that so Rock abusing his power to fight against the casino. Meh. Chris call upon his friend Ray Johnny Knoxville to try to stop the casino's drug running. Clearly Johnny is just there to be a comedy relief and it's just awfully clear. He plays himself most of the time. Sorry but I don't buy Chris Vaughn a crusader against drugs hanging out with a foreign alcoholic man like Ray. Their goal to ruin the casino and save the town by doing so. Wouldn't the town go under if the casino went away and how on earth will they rebuild the mill with no money? Does he have a million dollars somewhat to start it back up? Face it this movie is lackluster at best and is lead by a man who is only famous for beating up other men in questionable context. The action fighting scene looks faker than the prowrestling he came from. For somebody that came from the Special Forces his character really doesn't know how to do hand to hand combat. Lot of dull moments full of combination of very loosely based fact and Hollywood revisionism. Walking Tall had the potential of being something very good but end up playing it safe.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the outset I want to say that I have never been a fan of movie remakes. Hollywood remakes similar to sequels are just vain attempts by movie producers to replicate the success of previous movie blockbusters. However on the second time around the replication rarely works. And unfortunately the 2004 version of Walking Tall is no exception.In the 2004 remake famed wrestler Dwayne The Rock Johnson plays the Walking Tall lead character Chris Vaughn. However unlike Joe Don Baker who played Buford Pusser in the original '70s' movie Chris Vaughn is a biracial bachelor with a family consisting of his two parents black father and a white mother a sister and a kid nephew.With his brawn body definition and commanding presence The Rock effectively personifies the appearance of the movie's lead character as a oneman militia out to take on the mob. However and as many would expect Johnson's lack of professional acting experience and skills significantly hinders his capability in efficiently delivering the lead role in this movie making his performance at best somewhat mundane. And unfortunately Kevin Bray's quirky direction of the movie does very little to compensate.However the story line and theme of the second movie doesn't deviate significantly from the original '70s' cult classic telling the basedonreallife tale of a principled morally upstanding man returning to his hometown and waging a battle against the corruption and crime that currently plagues it. And the 2004 version also showcases all of the most notable elements of the originalthe violent nearfatal knife slashing the subsequent display of body scars in court knockdown dragout casino brawls gun battles and of course the signature trademark weapon of revenge and authority a wooden club.Yet what makes this remake so disappointing is that the emotional impact that made the original movie so popular during the 1970s is entirely absent from the 2004 movie. While the original movie effectively used disturbingly violent scenes and onscreen tragedy to incite the viewer to sympathize with the plight of Bufford Pussner the remakeeven with its own display of incessant violencedoesn't seem to generate the same effective emotional empathy with the Chris Vaughn character. And the remake particularly with its lame and somewhat abrupt ending also lacks the substance and the climatic grip that made the original version of Walking Tall so powerful and poignant.As with most Hollywood remakes you're probably better off to watch the original movie and simply pass on the imitation. The 2004 version of Walking Tall will most likely disappoint especially if you have previously viewed the original 1973 movie.".

Hollywood remakes similar to sequels are just vain attempts by movie producers to replicate the success of previous movie blockbusters. However on the second time around the replication rarely works. And unfortunately the 2004 version of Walking Tall is no exception.In the 2004 remake famed wrestler Dwayne The Rock Johnson plays the Walking Tall lead character Chris Vaughn. However unlike Joe Don Baker who played Buford Pusser in the original '70s' movie Chris Vaughn is a biracial bachelor with a family consisting of his two parents black father and a white mother a sister and a kid nephew.With his brawn body definition and commanding presence The Rock effectively personifies the appearance of the movie's lead character as a oneman militia out to take on the mob. However and as many would expect Johnson's lack of professional acting experience and skills significantly hinders his capability in efficiently delivering the lead role in this movie making his performance at best somewhat mundane. And unfortunately Kevin Bray's quirky direction of the movie does very little to compensate.However the story line and theme of the second movie doesn't deviate significantly from the original '70s' cult classic telling the basedonreallife tale of a principled morally upstanding man returning to his hometown and waging a battle against the corruption and crime that currently plagues it. And the 2004 version also showcases all of the most notable elements of the originalthe violent nearfatal knife slashing the subsequent display of body scars in court knockdown dragout casino brawls gun battles and of course the signature trademark weapon of revenge and authority a wooden club.Yet what makes this remake so disappointing is that the emotional impact that made the original movie so popular during the 1970s is entirely absent from the 2004 movie. While the original movie effectively used disturbingly violent scenes and onscreen tragedy to incite the viewer to sympathize with the plight of Bufford Pussner the remakeeven with its own display of incessant violencedoesn't seem to generate the same effective emotional empathy with the Chris Vaughn character. And the remake particularly with its lame and somewhat abrupt ending also lacks the substance and the climatic grip that made the original version of Walking Tall so powerful and poignant.As with most Hollywood remakes you're probably better off to watch the original movie and simply pass on the imitation. The 2004 version of Walking Tall will most likely disappoint especially if you have previously viewed the original 1973 movie.";

From there the plot spirals out as Carter gets put on the trail of a gang of thieves out to get their hands on a new secret weapon.

If you've seen any of the Lemmy Caution films or any of Constantine's similar films you'll know what to expect. This is not a slap at the film it's just the easiest way to describe the film which has Constantine as Carter wandering through the criminal landscape with a witty retort and fists or gun ready for any bit of action. To be certain it's a bit straighter and less tongue in cheek then some of the Caution films but its cut from a similar cloth. I liked it but at the same time I found I wish I hadn't watched it close to several other Constantine films since they all blended together.

Clement's allows the amorality of his characters to run loose. Minghella casts Matt Damon as Tom Ripley a rather invisible actor in every way and although he's pretty good here he's not good enough to overshadow his rival Jude Law. Clement casts Alain Delon as Ripley and you will be with him all the way you'll go where he goes you will turn out to be as amoral as he is  at least I did I just wanted him to get away with it and why? Because he was Alain Delon the Tom Ripley that clearly Patricia Highsmith intended. His rival is Maurice Ronet good as he is I didn't miss him when he left. You know why? Because I was left with the dangerous magnetic amoral riveting Alain Delon. Clement allows us to see the difficulty and danger of the murders we see them we are there. Minghella plays it rather hurriedly. There is no real tension or horror. The most suspenseful moment is at an Opera house. The pluses on The Talented Mr Ripley  besides the aforementioned Jude Law  are Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett in two beautifully written and performed parts. In Purple Noon Marie Laforet is left rather to her own devices. Once all said and done you can watch both films as if they weren't even related. I prefer Purple Noon but that's just me.".

He is deadly because anyone would have fallen into his trap. His beauty is inviting and reassuring. We witness his brutal side but don't get to the point of judging him. That is more unique than rare in a movie. Delon's Ripley acts as if there was nothing objectionable about his behavior. A poster boy for amorality. Marie Laforet's Marge is stunningly beautiful but don't get to know her as well as we do Gyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version.

He is deadly because anyone would have fallen into his trap. His beauty is inviting and reassuring. We witness his brutal side but don't get to the point of judging him. That is more unique than rare in a movie. Delon's Ripley acts as if there was nothing objectionable about his behavior. A poster boy for amorality. Marie Laforet's Marge is stunningly beautiful but don't get to know her as well as we do Gyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version. If you liked The Talented Mr Ripley you're going to love Purple Noon and viceversa.";

Delon is perfectly cast with his calculating cool. The cinematography is gorgeous especially the scenes on the yachtnothing gimmicky but shot with an expertise that gives true drama to the action. You can feel the waves the wind and the sun. The colors are vibrant on the DVD. Though a scene like this in a typical movie today would include a heavy ominous score the director simply lets the sound of the wind create the tension. The score by Nina Rota in fact is understated unlike anything today. Even the opening credits have style.".

	schema:headline " The First Tom Ripley Is Amazing";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll bet that many fans of Anthony Minghella's excellent The Talented Mr. Ripley never watched Ren Clment's Purple Noon the first cinematic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel. That's a pity because even though this French movie hasn't stolen one iota of the love I have lavished upon Minghella's version over the years it is a remarkable exercise in growing suspense and tension.The film opens in Italy and Tom and Philippe not Dickie have been having fun together for some time now squandering the money of Philippe's father who hired Tom to take him back to the USA. The story opens clumsily and thrusts the viewer into the middle of the action without any preambles unlike Minghella's version. Philippe is getting tired of Tom who's dressing up in his clothes and imitating him in front of mirrors and Tom is realising he won't persuade Philippe to return to the USA and collect his father's reward. He's also falling in love with Philippe's girlfriend Marge. So Tom decides to kill him.The murder one of the highlights of the movie happens in one of my favourite settings in a yacht in open sea away from civilisation and witnesses. It's a setting that several directors have exploited from Roman Polanski to Claude Chabrol to Phillip Noyce. Few situations invoke tension and fear like the illusive peacefulness of the sea because as Clmnt shows nature doesn't choose sides and can quickly become an obstacle to a wellplanned murder.Alain Delon younger than I've ever seen him in a movie plays Tom Ripley. He plays the famous sociopath with ruthlessness and premeditation hiding his emotions if he has any under an icecold look that is Delon's trademark. He delivers a fine performance but his Ripley is not perfect. In the novel the villain seek to erase his identity and become someone else someone of a better social class. The movie eschews the study of identity and class differences and makes Ripley a more traditional murderer who kills a man for money and for a girl.The character of Marge Marie Lafort gives to the movie little other than her beauty and a reason to pit between Tom against Philippe. I however prefer Tom in love with himself a narcissist who doesn't need others. And Lafort doesn't come close to Gwyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version who shows intuition and backbone.Maurice Ronet however is perfect in the role of Philippe he's also a dead ringer of Jude Law. Half school bully half bon vivant the playboy side of the character is captured by Ronet with ease although Philippe is so insensitive it's difficult at times to have sympathy for him.Purple Noon is beautiful to look at and not just because Clment is filming in picturesque Italian cities by the sea. The cinematography is in the hands of Henri Deca who's lent his talent to filmmakers like JeanPierre Melville Louis Malle and Franois Truffaut. Although the screenplay doesn't seem too interested in the question of identity the camera through its countless games with mirrors and reflections tries to force the novel's main theme back into the movie.The movie is very suspenseful even for those who think they know the story. Clment takes enough liberties with the novel to make the story fresh. Tom's main problem continues to be juggling the privileges his new identity gives him with remaining anonymous a difficult task when he's impersonating the son of a rich man.I've always loved films that show the perspective of killers and social outcasts. Between seeing a detective investigating and seeing a killer using his wits to remain free I prefer the latter. There's nothing more thrilling and fascinating than being privy to a killer's mind for a couple of hours. What can we ask of fiction other than what we can't get from daily life? That's what Purple Noon is a little outing from normal life into the life of a sociopath told without regrets and empathy like Tom Ripley.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched The Purple Noon with the Turkish title Kizgin Gnes which means The Scorching Sun at cinema Elhamra in Izmir when I was 12 or so. My birth date is 1950. It was the first time when I saw the name and the image of Alain Delon on a movie poster. On the poster Delon was seen naked on the upper part of his body directing a yacht's steering wheel. Years later I would read Highsmith's Talented Mr. Ripley and realize that the screenplay of the movie had some fortunate differences from the book. One of these differences was the interesting dialog between Delon and Ronet on the latter's yacht just before the murder. This dialog which is written by the director Rene Clement or his cowriter Paul Gogeoff is in my opinion one of the finest in all film history. Delon tells Ronet as a joke about his plan to kill him and adopt his identity. Ronet enjoys the joke and criticizes the plan on its weak points. Delon logically answers all the criticisms Ronet has made. Ronet gradually realizes that the plan is too thoughtfully conceived and too minutely prepared. He begins to suspect that it may not be a joke. He gets nervous and then frightened but only too late. Delon suddenly initiating to materialize the plan gets up and stabs Ronet with a knife. Ronet dies with a shock in his eyes. Delon throws away Ronet's body off the yacht into the sea. But he is unaware that he has failed to get rid of Ronet's body. At the final episode of the movie when the yacht is laid on the stocks policemendifferently again from the book find Ronet's moss covered body entangled with the propellers. In the film Delon is caught by law whereas in the book Ripley is not. After 40 years all I remember of the film are the things which are absent maybe missed in the book. I also like the Highsmith's book and don't like the idea of changing books text just for the fancies of directors of cinema or stage. But Clement's and Gogeoff's script I think was full of creativity. I like Minghella's recent version of Talented Mr. Ripley much less than the Highsmith's book and Clement's film version of it. Minghella seems to me among many other things especially missed Delon and the Fifties and the subtleties of Clement's script. After seeing the film and the fascinating personality of Delon as an actor I had resolved that I would see any Delon film I would come across thereafter and did so.COSKUN BUKTEL".

So I cannot make an intertextual analysis. I do think this 1960 film is superior for various reasons to the more recent remake. Adroitly directed by Rene Clement with a buoyant musical score by Nino Rota Plein Soleil is a character study of an amoral pleasure seeker whose charming personality masks the evil within. The juxtaposition of inwardly criminal intent with outwardly idyllic scenes of Italy and the Mediterranean results is an art house film that is both picturesque and suspenseful.

It is nice to note that both films hold their own well with the Mingella providing more character and background information than the Clement version.Delon who was to become a favorite actor of Visconti and other fine French and Italian directors renders a skillful performance along with Maurice Ronet as Phillipe Greenleaf known as Dickie in the later Mingella opus.Clement keeps the camera focused on the handsome M. Delon as did Visconti with stark closeups to show detailed emotional reactions.  Delon manages to rise to the challenge in subtle ways and to project a fully realized character. While Clement fails to provide much background as to why this character acts the way he does Delon's photogenic countenance somewhat overcomes this void by masking it with personality and charm.

Alain Delon is too goodlooking to be dismissed as the geeky wannabee Matt Damon plays. His insanity in a pretty package is as unsettling as Gene Tierney's in Leave Her to Heaven. Delon looks like Maurice Ronet's brother and you can see him wonder why if he's just as handsome as the other guy why doesn't he have as much money? Ronet is more unpredictable than Jude Law as the whimsical rich boy and his death is every bit as shocking.I can't imagine that Anthony Minghella hadn't seen this version before making his own. He probably regrets Scorsese's reconstruction of Rene Clement's film so we can all make the comparison. Some scenes play like a shotforshot remake. Billy Kearns's brutal Freddy Miles is an obvious template for Philip Seymour Hoffman's more calculated and less powerful performance and Gwyneth Paltrow's final breakdown is VERY close to that of Marie Laforet's.All through the 1999 film I kept wondering why everybody couldn't see what was wrong with the toadlike Damon. In this one Delon's plausible even glamorous exterior made the success of his deceptions more understandable and more frightening.".

	schema:reviewBody "Admit it. At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's singleminded swallowing without benefit of a knife and fork don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm good nature easy manners and handsome looks he has a complete lack of conscience which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have. Patricia Highsmith's intelligent thriller The Talented Mr. Ripley first introduced us to Tom. He was poor then but willing to be rich. He was the ordertaking moneyholding envious hangeron to an overbearing arrogant rich young man about his own age. The death of this man plus a spot of impersonation and forgery some quick thinking and resourcefulness put Tom on his path to riches. Of course it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil Purple Noon with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend Ripley's Game in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley 1999 with Matt Damon as Tom then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith and Dennis Hopper as Tom is in my opinion a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young poor envious and callow Tom Ripley he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf his first Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment on a small yacht in the middle of a sundrenched Mediterranean when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon and Clement entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a goodsized portion of Greenleaf's money deals with Greenleaf's lover disposes of loose ends some alive but one soon to be dead and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act his instincts his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matteroffact murderous he's clever. But be prepared and this is not a spoiler The last two minutes are a complete copout. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities but just as we watch that snake in the zoo we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.".

Although other one was also good and more faithful to the novel it dragged on a bit too much towards the end and Damon was just not a good choice for the leading role. Here we get to see Alain Delon in his best days as actor and matine idol.There are notable differences between this Ripley and the other one. He is not a homosexual here so his murder of Phillippe Greenleaf is provoked solely by envy of his wealth and luxurious lifestyle as well as the fact that he does what he wants and still gets away with it because he is the son of a bigshot. So this murder is cooler and more calculated than the one in the other film and the novel I presume.I think that due to the time this film was made at Ripley was turned into a heterosexual and thus his motif and personality differs somewhat from the original one. He also partly desires Greenleaf's sweet and forgiving girlfriend Marge. The most interesting fact is that although Tom Ripley is a murderer and a crook we still feel sympathy for him or I do. The man he murdered was quite despicable and treated him like second class an expendable thing as he treated his women and in some way his own girlfriend. I believe Tom has a dislike for morally corrupt people and a sense of righteousness. His crime is therefore forgivable. He was a poor guy who wanted to get himself a piece of the cake and he did it.Delon is truly outstanding here. Other actors are solid but he really shines. The last scene is the best and in some way both touching and sad as we see Tom lying on the deckchair and drinking blissfully unaware of what lurks around the corner. It is a magnificent touch by Rene Clement a man whose work I have just started to get acquainted with and respect. Nino Rota's score enhances it all and makes this a true delight. Plein Soleil is really one of the best filmnoirs I have seen.".

There is another filming of the same book in 1999 starring Matt Damon Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow which I didn't care for.Patricia Highsmith was happy with all of this film except for the ending which differs from her book the first of a series. She really liked Delon as Ripley and it's clear why. He does an excellent job as the suave charming Tom who hides all of his amorality beneath the veil of a chiseled face and beautiful smile. Delon is one of the great matine idols really at the height of his fabulous looks here.Unlike the Minghella version which I found preposterous this story makes more sense and becomes absolutely riveting once Ripley gets rid of his rival Philippe Greenleaf Maurice Ronet and steals his identity. Rene Clement is a wonderful director and the scene in the restaurant where Tom makes sure he is overheard talking to Marge Marie Laforet is especially good. The camera work is excellent throughout and a little unusual.I too did not care for the ending which was not Highsmith's.One thing i've never bought about this story is the fact that Ripley hung around the same area as Marge and Philippe's friends after becoming him. That to me was a big problem in the Minghella film which was made worse by some dumb scenes. Though I still don't understand it it was easier to take in this film.Like the Minghella version Purple Noon is glorious to look at with a more European flavor than The Talented Mr. Ripley. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Purple Noon 1960It might be hard to see Purple Noon with the eyes of someone in 1960 when it was released especially if you have seen the other famous movie based on the same book the 1999 The Talented Mr. Ripley. But in fact they are rather different films even though a few scenes are quite similar. The more loosely filmed less elegant and rather clumsier Purple Noon is admired for exactly those qualities. It is not the 1999 highly highly! polished superbly acted Anthony Minghella movie by any stretch and yet in most views it is the better movie.But not to me. It's worth avoiding too much of that which is better comparison by remembering that the early film is distinctive as it spends much of its time as a kind of elevated mind game between to very good looking young men. They spar they taunt they find a kind of liberty and discovery in the ways they push each other to be something unexpected even dangerous. This is developed in quick snippets as we go but you get the sense of it more fully in a couple of longer scenes and then eventually on the beautiful yacht where the crisis from their derring do comes to a head. Once Tom Ripley takes full control of his destiny and Mr. Greenleaf's we see that he is not actually the brilliantly deceptive and disarming Mr. Ripley in Minghella's film. That is he isn't the talented Mr. Ripley at all but a young man who barely avoids catastrophe time after time in his plot to take over Greenleaf's identity. He does succeed to a point but the constant dodges and role playing of Matt Damon's character are less the point here. This is more the picture of someone in slightly over his head.Alain Delon is certainly a pretty boy actor a kind of cleaner and more French James Dean who was already 5 years dead by this point. I can see how people prefer his version of Tom Ripley because it's more likable the way any pretty rebellious and slightly dangerous boy is likable. In a way I admire Damon simply because he wasn't such a paradigm. His flaws showed. It's Jude Law in the later film who is the pretty boy playing Mr. Greenleaf and in the earlier French version we have Maurice Ronet who at least has the advantage of looking a lot like Delon.There are some weird flaws in Purple Noon. One I couldn't accept at all was when Ripley calls Greenleaf's girlfriend Marge pretending to be Greenleaf and Marge can't tell the difference. There are also touches in the later film that add to the complexity of it allthe addition of another woman the greater presence of Freddy Miles played in both movies by rather similar men and the inner struggles of Ripley. Further there is an authenticity to the American later film for the unavoidable reason that the characters are Americans in Europe which they are though Jude Law is British a small point. In Purple Noon the characters are still American with American names and histories and passports but of course the look act and sound like they are French. Understandable but odd in some larger view. There is also a wonderful sexual undercurrent in the later film missing in the firstthe idea that Ripley is homosexual and doesn't know how to access those feelings or how to come out to Greenleaf about it.Both films are beautifully filmed this one far more simply lacking the huge resources of Minghella's enterprise. That makes Purple Noon more gritty at times and if it sometimes seems to cut corners the market scene as the same woman in a blue dress in the background too many times it is also more direct and less lofty which is good in its own way. Jazz makes a brief appearance here but nothing like in Minghella's version where you might say the music takes over too much at times from the plot. Purple Noon does not except for one short stretch on the yacht dwell on atmospherics for their own sake.Rene Clement is certainly a celebrated French director a generation before their amazing New Wave era. This is one of his lesser known features but it has been getting closer attention in recent years and you might really enjoy it. If you've seen the DamonLaw version of the two main characters here in action you should enjoy the contrast of DelonRonet in the same roles. Very impressive and different.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know where to start. When I'm asked of my favorite movie ever this is ALWAYS the first to come to mind. This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen and I've seen too many to count. Once Were Warriors is at its most stripped about a woman named Beth and her struggle to just do what's best for her family. She is of Maori heritage New Zealand's sort of Native Americans. Culture is a proud and powerful aspect of the movie as Beth's strengths lie in her devotion to her family and her heritage. But that is little comfort as her daughter is struggling to accept adulthood her youngest son is heading towards juvenile detention and her oldest son is fast on his way to joining a brutal gang. Worst of all her husband Jake is a heavy drinker.The film excels at painting everybody in full 3 dimensions. Each of her kids are troubled but they all have fierce love and respect for their mother. The gang is cruel to the oldest son but at the same time embraces him. The juvenile detention center separates the youngest son from his only home but instills in him a pride in his ancestry. And Jake himself is a beast a man built like a tank who will destroy you with anything available should you spill his beer...but somehow he also comes across as loving Beth. Sometimes.The film follows Beth as she does her best to hold the family together even while the various problems tear them apart. At the center is Jake's drinking and further carelessness of his family's dissipation. While Beth's answer is to nurture and aid her children Jake insists it's best to drink away the problems and quit being so soft on the kids. And we watch through it all as the family spirals further apart. Near the end after seeing both happy and horrible things happen to each of the characters we are jarred by a terrible tragedy. Beth and Jake both deal with it uniquely as she draws once again on the tremendous power of family and human spirit while Jake deals with it his own way. The last 15 minutes of the film keep us in suspense as we wonder whether a certain horrible injustice will be confronted and if so how. This scenario involves and encapsulates everyone in the family and who they are inside.The last few moments of the movie made me want to jump to my feet and applaud. I won't reveal what happens but in the last 5 minutes every person shows so much inner strength that I glow with admiration for their actions. Especially those of Beth and her oldest son whose interaction with Jake results in my favorite scene in the movie. But don't think you know what's going to happen based on this description it's a complicated scenario. I felt satisfied with the conclusion on all fronts and thought that each character showed exactly where their strength lies. Be forewarned that this movie is very heartbreaking. Its overall tone is one of futility of better lives not received of wanting the best but never quite getting it. It is very raw and intense in its portrayal of physical and domestic violence and the easily upset may have a hard time waiting to see if it ends happily enough for their tastes. But no matter what your opinion is it will definitely be a film that stays with you for a long long time. My highest recommendation.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't know where to start. When I'm asked of my favorite movie ever this is ALWAYS the first to come to mind. This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen and I've seen too many to count. Once Were Warriors is at its most stripped about a woman named Beth and her struggle to just do what's best for her family. She is of Maori heritage New Zealand's sort of Native Americans. Culture is a proud and powerful aspect of the movie as Beth's strengths lie in her devotion to her family and her heritage. But that is little comfort as her daughter is struggling to accept adulthood her youngest son is heading towards juvenile detention and her oldest son is fast on his way to joining a brutal gang. Worst of all her husband Jake is a heavy drinker.The film excels at painting everybody in full 3 dimensions. Each of her kids are troubled but they all have fierce love and respect for their mother. The gang is cruel to the oldest son but at the same time embraces him. The juvenile detention center separates the youngest son from his only home but instills in him a pride in his ancestry. And Jake himself is a beast a man built like a tank who will destroy you with anything available should you spill his beer...but somehow he also comes across as loving Beth.

This is a film where you see a man hit his wife and it hits you in the gut like you're being hit yourself.  An excellent depiction of the impact of anger and violence on the members of a poor family.  In this case they happen to be Maoris living in New Zealand. The father dominates the family because he is so powerless in the other facets of his life.  He's addicted to boozing and carousing and the only way he can really express himself is with his fists.  The wife fights back but can be beaten into submission. But she's also allowed herself to be seduced by the boozy lifestyle and fears responsibility.  The center of the family is the oldest daughter 13 who is really the only one who can communicate with all the other members. The boys are either lost in life or lost in their own rage.  The youngest daughter is simply too small and clings to her sister. It takes a tragedy to allow some of these individuals to reach out for each other and try to recreate a form of family life.  A very powerful film not for the faint of heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "Twenty minutes into this movie Jake Heke hits his wife in the face. It's not a slap but the full power of a clenched fist delivered into her jaw. She smashes backwards into a wall and collapses cursing at him. Jake then picks her up and beats her some more dragging her bloodied form all across the house and utterly mauling her destroying lots of the furniture trashing the living room and breaking glass over the poor woman's frail body. Their friends quickly scatter and retreat out the front while upstairs the children huddle together in tears 13 year old Grace Heke more than likely thinking of her earlier remark that people show their true feelings while drunk. In terms of grabbing the viewer's attention this entire sequence has more effect than being punched in the gut.Set in an unnamed New Zealand city Once Were Warriors tells the story of the Heke family. Jake Temeura Morrison is a handsome muscular powerhouse who exudes natural charisma while his wife Beth Rena Owen is descended from a Maori tribe. And while on the surface Jake seems like a loving father and husband he is a man racked with paranoia and insecurity who is prone to terrifying outbursts of violence to which he rarely shows any regret. And his behaviour is having an adverse effect on the rest of the family to say the least.With one son taken away and sent to a Maori reform school and another joining a violent street gang Beth struggles to keep her family together and the end result is very grim but nothing less than satisfying. In fact you'll be hard pressed to turn away from the screen as you get sucked into the characters lives despite the rather depressing nature of the subject matter.For while Jake is an absolute monster of a human being he is still very clearly human. Temeura Morrison's performance is nothing short of exemplary as he manages to turn Jake into a highly complex character. One moment he seems like the perfect friend singing a duet alongside Beth at a party with smiles plastered across their faces the next he is pounding his fist into her face with such ferocity it is almost like he has been replaced with somebody else. It is testament to Morrison's acting skills that while everyone is urging Beth to leave with the children we can see why she doesn't.This is a dark film and not especially pleasant viewing. However it is also a riveting experience and far from a portrait of one man's selfdestruction as the rest of the family also have their own characters fleshed out and fully realised. One brief review like this cannot adequately portray what a terrific film this is highly recommended.".

Although I'm not Maori I have somewhat of an understanding of and a very deep appreciation for Maori culture. It is after all a major contributor to the uniqueness of New Zealand and it's what a lot of the tourists come here to seeexperience.Some people have commented that the character of Beth is descended from Maori royalty and that the character of Jake is descended from slaves. That's not quite correct. Although there is a Maori monarch Dame Te Atairangikaahu the current Maori queen lives at the Turangawaewae Marae in Ngaruawahia her official residence. the Maori monarchy only goes back to the 19th century and its not really representative of all Maori as it only really affects Waikato iwihapu tribesub tribe It is more likely that Beth would be descended from chiefly linage and hence she and her whanau extended family would be very much aware of and in tune with their whakapapa or ancestry. Beth's line near the end of the movie that her people once were warriors is an indicator of this.The facial and body tattoos or Moko that one sometimes sees Maori wearing are in fact representative of their whakapapa. Also the carvings that feature on Marae and other carved Maori buildingsgates etc are representative of tribal ancestors much like Indian Totem poles.Jake on the other hand is obviously urbanized. He would most probably know little or nothing about his whakapapa and in addition he probably would not even be able to identify with an iwi or hapu. This would explain why he makes several references to Maori bulls. He is disenfranchised from his culture and probably doesn't even speak Maori that well. Although Temurera Morrison himself speaks fluent Maori. His family have obviously been living in Auckland for so long and there has been such tribal intermingling that he doesn't know whether he's Arthur or Martha. And what's more he doesn't care either.For those of you who are interested the motorway shown at the start of the movie is the Southern Motorway which runs right through South Auckland which is where a lot of Maoris and Pacific Islanders live.As other people have said this kind of thing is sadly not unique to Maori as AmericanCanadian Indians and Australian Aborigines can testify. Likewise domestic violence itself is not only limited to minority ethnic groups.This is easily one of the best movies that I have ever seen. So if you haven't had the privilege of seeing it yet then I highly recommend that you do so. George Henare's stirring Taiaha scene alone is well worth the cost of getting the movie out.A Taiaha is a Maori spear. To use one of these one must have immense mana or importance. As Henare's character said the British feared the highly skilled Taiaha warriors.".

I was surprised to read the commentary by Glamwog when she said all of her Maori friends hate it.

	schema:reviewBody "For a movie watched in Year Twelve English Once Were Warriors directed by Lee Tamahori was surprisingly moving. With a top notch cast including Temuera Morrison and Cliff Curtis the acting is fantastic and goes hand in hand with the tightly scripted pace which led to an thoughtprovoking one hundred and two minutes of film.Once Were Warriors tells a story familiar to many New Zealand families. Set in 1994 against the backdrop of Otara Auckland it tells the story of Beth and Jake Heke. Jake is an all round under achiever with a nasty temper and a fondness of beer. He likes to be the king of his statehouse castle and his local pub The Royal. Beth is the strong willed runaway who married Jake against her tribe's wishes. She loves Jake enough to forget the price he is having on her family  Nig Boogie Grace Polly and Huata. Nig is the oldest boy and hates his father for abusing Beth his hate leads him to join the TOA gang. Boogie is also getting into trouble and Grace has turned to writing as an escape from her lout of a father. This story forces Beth to confront her husband's violence and decide which is more important his needs or her family.The performances in this movie were superb. Temuera Morrison is excellent as Jake Heke. He is convincing as both the lovable chap when he and Beth sing 'The Nature of Love' and a frightening monster when he beats Beth. In the final scene he is incredible! Despite his violent words he uses one expletive 17 times in less than 30 seconds Morrison manages to display a kind of brokenness that made me feel pity for him despite his previous actions which most viewers would agree were appalling. Rena Owens was also extraordinary as the vibrant and resilient Beth Heke. She is totally believable. She is Beth. Her acting is incredibly varied. Owens shows Beth's vulnerability. After Jake's beating she is weak and injured which is a total contrast to the last scene where she is strong even the face of Jake's fury coming back with Our people once were warriors. But unlike you Jake they were people with mana pride people with spirit. If my spirit can survive living with you for eighteen years then I can survive anything. The performances of Mamaengaroa KerrBell Grace Shannon Williams Toot and Sonny Arahanga Nig were also exceptionally moving. Basically there were very few performances in this movie unworthy of a standing ovation.Another really positive aspect of Once Were Warriors was the setting. Tamahori's aim was to produce a tough gritty urbanbased drama which showed the destructiveness of urban lifestyle. You don't get much more urban in New Zealand than Otara. The film has amazing contrasts in it with setting. As a New Zealand movie you expect beautiful mountains hills lakes the clean and the green and the beautiful first shot sets the scene for such things. When you see it's just a billboard and that the closest the Hekes have to that ideal is the deadlooking tree in their backyard it reinforces that idea of the country as a nurturing place. Even the lighting and colors of the places help with this. Otara is dark shabby and gray. There's no color in their home or in their lives. The Marae set in the country by a beautiful lake is bathed in golden light symbolic of the joy and color within them at this time.There was a lot of good stuff about this movie but it also had its down points. There was a lot of violence which is important to the story but was a little too graphic and hard to watch for some of the people in my class. It also tends to present the view that all Maori people are constantly drunk and swearing that none have jobs or cars and that all they do is drink have parties and beat and rape people. The only ones that don't live on Maraes. This movie deals with the huge international issue of domestic violence and although the Heke family is Maori these are issues which affect all races and societies. It also shows the power and beauty of the Maori culture and makes you understand that Jake is not the ideal role model for any society.This movie IS good but don't be under the impression it's a feel good favorite that you'd like to gather your family around for a light evening of entertainment. This movie is basically a tellall on domestic violence. It shows violence as the ugly thing it is. Once Were Warriors is not for fun this is a drama that really makes you think discuss confront and actually do something about problems in your society. It is a worthwhile watch if you can approach the film with an open mind.".

Jake Heke is an abusive husband who regularly gets drunk and hits his wife Beth whistle at the same time it is still apparent that he does need his wife and children. Beth is the long suffering abused wife who tries to see the good in Jake even though she knows what he does is wrong. Nig is about to join a violent gang whistle boogie is always getting in trouble with the police and is close to being sent to a children's home. Finally Grace is the one person who has not been affected by Jakes violence however Grace suffers an excruciatingly painful ordeal that will change her and her family forever.Lee Tamahori directed Once Were Warriors in 1994 a time in which women were beginning to disperse the maledominated society. The issue of domestic abuse is candidly approached without portraying Beth as a stereotypically abused wife. Lee Tamahori also expertly manages to ensure that Jake is not viewed as another stereotypical immoral abusive husband.The film also deals with social and economical circumstances within a working class Maori culture in New Zealand. Although they are both of Maori descent Jake and Beth had very different backgrounds. Jake was a working class man with no real expectations and Beth was a Maori tribal princess. The viewer is reminded of their differences at many points during the film so we can see how different they are.Once Were Warriors is crammed full of effective cinematic devices that allow the viewer to really enjoy the film. The audience is treated to an abundance of different camera angles to reflect the different attitudes and values presented in the film. Lee Tamahori also uses different kinds of music to reflect the emotions of the characters E.G when Jake is getting angry we hear a low humming sound and when the whole family is together and happy a happy and uplifting song is played.Lee Tamahori has created a groundbreaking masterpiece that has the power to amaze and shock audiences time and time again. However the real credit must go to the two main actors Rena Owen and Temeura Morrison. Rena Owen plays Beth with such a convincing performance that the audience actually believes her as Beth and not just a patronising nave actor. Temeura Morrison portrays Jake as a complex character that has many other issues and problems besides the drinking and getting angry. Unlike many other actors Temeura Morrison does not play Jake as a stereotypical abusive husband which is part of the reason why Once Were Warriors is so powerful and effective. The chemistry between Rena Owen And Temeura Morrison is so compelling that together with the amazing screenplay by Alan Duff and direction of Lee Tamahori successfully render Once Were Warriors one of the most potent and shocking films of the 1990's".

As a warrior people Islander life is hard and it comes with the damage that was introduced to our people from European intervention back when Island people first had contact with the expeditious Europeans.The Pacific Island people of Maori Tonga Hawaii Fiji Tokelau Easter Island Tahiti and Samoa to name a few have all felt the results of European and American intervention.  This film epitomizes the lifestyle of people who were once chiefs warriors and royalty and the results of the alcohol and western ways that produced characters like Jake and many Islanders like him.Our people were a race of proud warriors and this film is powerful in it's depiction of a family torn apart due to the effect of substance abuse on the warrior and his family.  It is sad but I can relate because I was that way with my first wife.  I drank and confided in the comfort of my Samoan brothers placing them first before my family.  I beat my wife constantly and with little or no provocation and was able to hold a reputation as a gang elder and fighter within my hood in Los Angeles CA.  This ripped my family apart as the Heke family in the story.  The guilt of my past life appeared before me when I saw the film and even now I cringe from the life I lead 12 years ago.The depiction of Maori lifestyle is on point as a large number of my people live in those conditions.  Among Samoans there are more of us on mainland USA than back home.  Many Samoans like the Maori's in the filmlive in urban areas infected with substance abuse and gangs.  Violence is an everyday thing and the movie depicted all of these points.  NOT FAR FROM FACT.".

It annoyed me because i knew that this movie wouldn't do anything to dispel the stereotype surrounding modern maori. especially the urban Maori... sure the movie portrayed a very small part of the Maori community accurately... but it is such a small part of that community. This is a stereotype that young maori men have been trying to shake for years and now it is being put in the spotlight in a movie that was sure to be seen worldwide.I was willing to forgive and forget with this movie and move and appreciate it for what it is... a great movie but after reading posts on this board and others... i'm not sure... i will put this movie high on a shell somewhere... i might look at it from time to time but i don't think i'll watch again for a while. i see people are still confused about the Maori people... and this film isn't helping.i would be happier if the emphasis on the Maori aspect of the movie wasn't so prevalent. as posted here... this could be anywhere anyone anytime... please don't think you know Maori issues because you have see a movie about a small minority... we fight a battle of racism stereotype and discrimination every day... and when maori life is highlighted like this in media or a brown face does something wrong on the news we lose a small amount of ground in that fight.this is a people problem... not a maori people problem maybe we Once Were Warriors... but we are still proud beautiful and full of mana... actually i'm still a warrior the battle has changed.i think of that night at the movies and am glad i never see those people... the discussing they had on way home still amazes me...  i know a maori and it's just like that... he comes to school bleeding all the time and he never has any lunchno... you don't know a Maori... and he's sitting right next to you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Costner in his early days managed to convey a rawness to his characters that was seldom seen after he made Dances with Wolves and became a successful producer. Films such as No Way Out 1987 Bull Durham 1988 and of course Revenge 1990 showed him when he was trying to establish his career and you could feel the actor at work rather than the movie maker.In Revenge Costner plays US Navy pilot Michael Jay Cochran who is retiring after 12 years in the service. He seems to have lost direction and wants to take some time out for himself. He plans first to go and see his old friend and Tennis partner Tiburon Tibby Mendez Anthony Quinn who is a powerful mob boss in Mexico. Exactly why they are friends is a little unclear but it seems that Tibby owes Jay a debt for saving his life at some point in the past. Once Jay arrives at the Mendez Hacienda he meets Miryea Madeleine Stowe Tibby's wife. Instantly attracted to one another and although initially fighting the chemistry between them they begin an affair which comes with massive consequences.This film has elements of The Wild Bunch 1969 to it and the location shooting in Mexico adds so much to the atmosphere and tensity of the story. There are seamy and claustrophobic qualities to many of the situations which are enhanced beautifully by the background. The acting is nicely understated Costner manages to display a barely restrained anger throughout the second part of the film and Anthony Quinn is convincing as the superficially charming but totally ruthless mobster. Madelaine Stowe is OK as the female lead but struggles with a Mexican accent and seems a bit uncomfortable with the innocence that her character is supposed to portray.Revenge was commercially unsuccessful but is one of those movies that deserves to be seen. Costner being an actor of limited range was always best at these type of roles. When he behaves rather than acts you get to see the best of him.If I have any complaints I believe the denouement of the story although certainly interesting doesn't quite fit. The build up to it promises something more of a violent showdown and the character of Jay would seem by this point to be poised to take his revenge. Perhaps the downbeat finish was done to avoid going Hollywood with a big finale and as i mentioned it is certainly effective but leaves a general feeling that there is business still to be done.An interesting and entertaining movie that is well worth viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tony Scott loves his socalled good guys to be amoral antiheroes. The more ruthless they are the better after they've taken a pounding from the bad guy first natch. And whenever possible he likes Mexico to be in the mix. With that setup I could be describing 'Man On Fire' 'True Romance' or 1990's 'Revenge'. Since he unofficially remade 'Revenge' as 'Man On Fire' earlier this year I should just call up that review and replace Denzel Washington's name with Kevin Costner's. Even though I'm seeing them out of order the 14yearold flick is better. Scott even shows more grownup sensibilities than he usually does and directs his actors through believable love scenes. I don't think he's been so unabashedly romantic since this period in the early '90s.Costner plays Jay Cochran a cocky Navy pilot shades of Maverick from 'Top Gun' who vacations in Mexico after retiring from the jetset life. Playing host to the flier is a ruthless tycoon Tibby Mendez Anthony Quinn. The two men are old friends despite the generation gap and the fact they have nothing in common. But just when you think Costner is going to have some fun he has to go and fall in lust with Tibby's wife Mireya the heavenly Madeleine Stowe. What beautiful kids those two actors would make. They don't vault into bed immediately but neither of them lets a little thing like loyalty to Tibby get in the way of their passion. When the husband finds out Jay is severely beaten and Mireya is scarred  banished to a whorehouse.You thought revenge would be Quinn's for his cuckolding? No vengeance is Costner's. He spends most of the second hour of this bloody picture busting up anybody who might know what happened to his lover. 'Revenge' equals serious violence no doubt about it. It's rare that the usually heroic Costner is given the chance to ride the gruesome line between good  evil. He's probably justified but he DID betray his friend by bedding the man's wife. You don't do that in Mexico without waking up in the afterlife so you might say Cochran got off easy. The tender climax is a bit of surprise from the the slick Scott giving his otherwise angry film a heart. The movie might not be much fun but the actors are pretty good and the story is always watchable. And violent.".

It started off like this Top Gun rip off then turned into this beautiful tale of love passion and betrayal. Never have a seen a love story with so much chemistry and have an ending which Hollywood would never dream of now compared to back then.Kevin Costner is an air pilot leaving the Navy to visit a very old friend Anthony Quinn. I can't remember why they were both such good friends to start off with I think it was something to do with them both being in a war together or something along those lines. In the time they have been apart Quinn has married a beautiful women played by Madeline Stowe and he takes no time in getting them both acquainted. And in no time Costner and Stowe become a little to friendly and start to fall for each other but fight their best to avoid this. What works perfectly is how Quinn knows how beautiful his wife is and how much he really knows without saying how much Costner wants her. This adds to the tension as he always makes Costner feel uncomfortable by asking him questions about how beautiful she is. It all erupts to you know what and I think most of the end is more like a western than anything. This is what turned the film around for me as they are some truly brutal scenes in this film and that's when the story really begins and the revenge from both sides of the story begin to take turn.By the end of the film I was just surprised at how rare a film like this was back in the day when films weren't completely apart of Hollywood and followed there own path into making a decent film which is what Revenge delivers. Anthony Quinn didn't make many more films after this so this was a rare gem as his Quinn goes and this is a movie which you wouldn't expect Costner to be taking the lead.Fantastic".

	schema:headline " Magnificent ending!";
	schema:reviewBody "Certainly the ending of this film is extremely moving and literally takes your breath away. It leaves you with a feeling that you have probably seen something better than what you actually have. Of course Tony Scott is one of the most stylish directors about ie. 'The Hunger'1983 which has to be one of the most stylish films about. He's also made his fair share of blockbusters ie.'Top Gun'1985'Beverly Hills Cop 2'1987'Days of Thunder'1989 and more recently 'Enemy of the State'1998 all of which took a lot of money the profits of the first one in particular bordering on the ridiculous. And don't forget he made the little seenin the cinema anyway but memorable 'True Romance'1992. So you get the feeling that here Mr.Scot was making a picture trapped inbetween both worlds that of the blockbuster and the more personal picture. The film did only average in the box office and did not really make any kind of impact on any of the performer's careers.It is beautifully filmed with lots of trademark Scott shots ie sun beams pouring through a drawn blind and mist covering the scenery. The violence is maybe a little too graphic. Costner goes through the motions somewhat in a character who is a mix of the roles he played in 'No Way Out'1987 and 'The Bodyguard'1992.He does his best acting in the final quarter of the picture where he shows well executed muted regret and sorrow.Stowe is very attractive and impressive as Miryea who for the second half of the picture is dying slowly through a drugged daze. Anthony Quinn delivers a solid display as the larger than life Mexican gangster who after delivering his vengeance on Jay and Miryea becomes a sad secluded old man who takes no pleasure in the measures he has taken but continues to justify them.Such a role is very undemanding for a legend like Quinn.Miguel Ferrer also has an undemanding role and John Leguziamo is impressive in an early career role as an eager but almost mute gunman who aids Costner.The plot is nothing special.The only interesting point is that Quinns character's vengeance though excessive is justifiable. Ultimately Jay and Miryea get their just deserts in the sense that both betrayed him through their secretive adultery which seems more born out of lust than love. The love between these two is not well enough developed to justify the beautiful ending to the film. If the couples relationship had been longer and not completely based around sex you could understand the emotion between them more.The piano track used for the two lovers is very touching and forms the perfect soundtrack for the memorable ending sequence. OVERALL I give this picture 710. It is raised above average by the ending. Ultimately it is worth sitting through the picturewhich is overlong and paying attention to it just for the ending which is beautifully shot romantic captivating and probably one of the most heartbreakingly sad moments in film historyyes its that good. Even the most stoneyhearted will be touched.".

Anthony Quinn delivers a solid display as the larger than life Mexican gangster who after delivering his vengeance on Jay and Miryea becomes a sad secluded old man who takes no pleasure in the measures he has taken but continues to justify them.Such a role is very undemanding for a legend like Quinn.Miguel Ferrer also has an undemanding role and John Leguziamo is impressive in an early career role as an eager but almost mute gunman who aids Costner.The plot is nothing special.The only interesting point is that Quinns character's vengeance though excessive is justifiable. Ultimately Jay and Miryea get their just deserts in the sense that both betrayed him through their secretive adultery which seems more born out of lust than love. The love between these two is not well enough developed to justify the beautiful ending to the film. If the couples relationship had been longer and not completely based around sex you could understand the emotion between them more.The piano track used for the two lovers is very touching and forms the perfect soundtrack for the memorable ending sequence. OVERALL I give this picture 710. It is raised above average by the ending. Ultimately it is worth sitting through the picturewhich is overlong and paying attention to it just for the ending which is beautifully shot romantic captivating and probably one of the most heartbreakingly sad moments in film historyyes its that good. Even the most stoneyhearted will be touched.";

Here we see the effect a betrayal can have on a man like Tiburon Mendez. Once the bridge is burned there is no way back to his grace. Despite the fact that Cochran saved his life he shows no mercy for him. When you break that old Mexican code nothing else matters.This film has a great photography with some visually stunning scenes specially sunsets and sunrises and Costner and Stowe never looked better.

Great powerful ending and truly romantic story of what love really means to a man. Great secondary characters. Anthony Quinn Madeiline Stowe best looking she has ever been Miguel Ferrar James Gammon. I saw this film when I was 21 and 15 years later it still has a strong presence with me. The scenes between Stowe and Costner are great. The cloakroom scene is sexy and romantic and powerful you may find yourself supplied with more inspiration next time you are with your significant other. Miguel Ferrar is strong here and gives a hint of the character work he will do in the future. James Gammon plays the usual down on his luck cowboy. John Leguizamo has a small but important part one of his first films and Tony Scott will use him again. Costner is best when he plays Costner. It was one of the first DVDs I ever bought. I can't say enough rent or buy this film. Its a romantic film but interesting enough for guys as well. Just be ready for your girlfriend to weep at the end.".

	schema:headline " Betrayal Retribution  Tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Revenge is based on a novella by Jim Harrison who together with Jeffrey Alan Fiskin also wrote the screenplay. The plot is extremely simple and straight forward and doesn't contain any real twists or surprises but does gain some traction by the nature and intensity of the circumstances that the characters confront.This story of friendship passion and betrayal leads inexorably to violent retribution and consequences that are tragic for everyone concerned. The circumstances that lead to such misery and loss are the result of extreme recklessness sexual obsession and a completely unrealistic grasp of the dangers involved by a couple whose infidelity triggers a truly horrific sequence of events.Jay Cochran Kevin Costner is a U.S. Navy pilot who retires after 12 years service and decides to take up an invitation from an old friend in Mexico to visit his impressive hacienda. Jay and Tibey Mendez Anthony Quinn had become firm friends some years earlier after Jay had saved Tibey's life on a hunting trip. Tibey is now a very wealthy and powerful crime boss who's well connected politically and constantly surrounded by heavily armed henchmen.When Jay meets Tibey's much younger wife Miryea Madeleine Stowe there's an instant attraction between them and it isn't long before they embark on a passionate affair. Tibey quickly realises what's going on and he and his men break into a cabin where the lovers are together and viciously beat up Jay and kill his dog. Tibey then slashes his wife's face with a knife and after burning down the cabin Jay is left for dead in the desert and Miryea is taken to work in a whorehouse and regularly injected with heroin.A compassionate Mexican finds Jay lying unconscious and gradually nurses him back to health. After making a full recovery Jay sets off on a mission to find Miryea and hunt down Tibey.Anthony Quinn's age physique and general appearance make him perfect for his role but the way in which he also skilfully displays the various facets of Tibey's personality is very impressive. His character is interesting because despite being friendly generous and good humoured on most occasions he's also an extremely violent man who's cruel vicious and utterly ruthless.Jay shows a lack of respect for his host by turning up late and also seems oblivious to some of the tensions surrounding him at the hacienda. Presumably as a pilot he was used to pushing the envelope at times and maybe this explains his overconfidence and insensitivity. Whether this is the case or not his judgement is seriously flawed by any standards and the misfortunes that he suffers are of his own making.Kevin Costner is more convincing in portraying Jay's selfcentred and impulsive behaviour than in showing the level of passion that drove Jay into getting involved in such a dangerous affair. Madeleine Stowe's performance by contrast is consistently strong as the reserved and tragic Miryea whose only consolation is that she ultimately gets to chose her own means of escape.The simplicity and predictability of the plot are the movie's greatest deficiencies but the locations used and the cinematography are together very successful in creating the atmosphere in which all the action romance and violence take place.".

	schema:headline " The only revenge taken is on the viewer";
	schema:reviewBody "From the latter 1980s into the early 1990s actor Kevin Costner seemed to lead a relatively charmed professional life appearing in such popular films as Silverado The Untouchables No Way Out Bull Durham Field of Dreams Robin Hood Prince of Thieves JFK and his Oscarwinning spectacle Dances With Wolves before tanking and never really quite recovering from Waterworld. In the midst of this success stands a littleseen action film called Revenge which came and went very quickly and won over neither critics nor viewers before being forgotten in light of DWW's success later that same year.The film centers on former Navy pilot Costner who for some reason thinks it is a great idea to take a vacation at the palatial estate of an organized crimelord Anthony Quinn who he once transported on a hunting trip or some such rubbish. It does not take long to see where the predictable film is going when we are introduced to Quinn's muchyounger wife Madeleine Stowe. Before you know it Costner and Stowe are having quickies in the closet while Quinn is doing solo lambadas on the dance floor at his estate. It does not take long for Quinn's minions to be dispatched to beat up Costner to near death and kidnapbrutalize Stowe and then...well quite frankly most discerning viewers won't care.To say that the film's pace is stillborn would be complimentary. It has little in the way of surprises and trudges very slowly from point A to point B. Pretty much every character is unlikable and unsavory in some capacity. For a torrid liaison that cannot be denied as the posters heralded the chemistry between Costner and Stowe is nearly nonexistent and not helped at all by director Tony Scott's glossy Calvin Kleininspired love scenes. Worse the film is entirely too long and convoluted for such a simplistic core story. It goes without saying before the lights dim that Costner and Stowe will fall into lust and Quinn will vent his wrath but this takes a huge amount of film time to happen.The latter portion of the picture is downright laughable and ultimately pointless. After Costner is beaten and left to die one presumes he recovers hooks up with an entirely new set of characters in the latter third of the film and sets about to ostensibly get revenge on Quinn. The introduction of a gaggle of new people out of the blue is a bit jarring especially since they are more interesting and wellplayed by character actors like Miguel Ferrer and Sally Kirkland than were any of their predecessors. Once Costner crashes Quinn's estate instead of a mano a mano they basically stare intently at each other before Costner apologizes for shtupping his wife and the satisfied Quinn sends him off to find her dying in a mountain nunnery still clutching a keepsake of his.The entire endeavor is filmed with precious little in the way of action and conveyed with the solemnity one usually saves for eulogies. Aside from Ferrer and Kirkland who manage to make much of little in the very latter portion of the film this is no ones finest acting hour. Stowe is particularly dreadful. Shoehorned into costumes so tight that one fears bodily harm was done to the actress she spends the majority of the film either semiconscious or demonstrating the emotive abilities of a mannequin. I honestly did not think that the woman could act until seeing some of her subsequent work. And truthfully if her character was so compelled to have a child that she would face death and dally with the next agreeable man to cross her sight why on earth did she marry someone as old as Quinn who has no interest to father a child to begin with? Quinn trots out the old nutshell of the macho Latin crime boss with almost no deviations. Quinn has played similar roles numerous times and this time is particularly nothing special. Hopefully he was well paid. By contrast Costner cannot be accused of not throwing himself into the part. He had become synonymous at the time with upstanding American heroes so it must have seemed a coup to play someone a bit shady and unethical. He gets to wear the kind of beatenup makeup that looks like your eyes are fried eggs and briefly flashes his welltoned derriere the only high point of the film. Unfortunately there is nary a breath of humor to his acting here and he takes things so seriously that one would think he was appearing in a Shakespearean tragedy rather than a lurid lowrent potboiler.Revenge is the kind of film that is impossible to recommend to anyone unless you especially despise that person. By the time one has slogged through the whole mess to its ludicrous downbeat climax Stowe's fate seems rather tame by comparison.".

	schema:reviewBody "As spotty as Tony Scott's filmography was it's easy to forget how good he could be. This is my first time seeing REVENGE and I must say that I was surprised by how emotionally involving and artfully directed it was despite relying on a number of genre clichs. Kevin Costner plays Michael Jay Cochran a 12year Navy veteran who has just left the service and goes to see his friend Tiburon Mendez Anthony Quinn in Mexico. While there he ends up falling in love with Tibey's as his friends call him beautiful young wife Miryea Madeleine Stowe. When Tibey finds out about this leaves Jay for dead and throws Miryea away in a whorehouse. The remainder of the film is Jay going back to rescue Miryea. Hopefully I haven't given too much away but the film is 25 years old and there has to be a statute of limitations on spoilers even if they're small. Since I liked more than I disliked I'll just get the negative stuff out of the way first. I mentioned earlier that this film relies on genre clichs. One such example and very key to establishing the central character relationship is the history shared by Tibey and Jay. Apparently they were hunting buddies and Jay saved Tibey's life one time so now Tibey is in debt to Jay. That's something that's been done to death in countless films before and since but it wouldn't be such an issue if that wasn't the extent of it. It was just hard for me to buy that a Navy pilot would have it in so good with a Mexican power brokerkingpin. I also thought the romance that develops between Jay and Miryea was rather clich even if it was wellperformed. And to be fair this movie has some great performances in it. Kevin Costner was his usual likable self and veteran actor Anthony Quinn was great as his worldweary foil. Madeleine Stowe did fine but isn't given much to do besides be the damsel in distress once confined to the whorehouse. Now on to the positives the rest. This is probably one of Tony Scott's bestdirected films and came a decade or so before he started using his much rippedoff MTV shooting style. There were some really artful shots e.g. a fire being reflected in sunglasses or beautiful shots of the Mexican terrain. Even the sex scenes were shot well. I also really liked the score which struck a fine balance between melancholy and tension. But most of all and despite the clichd elements the characters were well written and developed and the performances really elevated the rather pulpy source material. Overall REVENGE is an artful occasionally thoughtful action thriller that probably deserves more attention than it gotcurrently gets. It might have a shaky dramatic foundation but it's definitely worth seeing for what's built around and on top of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning Major Spoilers Ahead!!After years of looking for this movie it never came out on DVD over here in Germany I finally watched it on payTV last night. It was the theatrical version and thank God it was even uncut. The picture quality was very good ... almost looked like a restored version.I haven't seen the DC yet just checked out an illustrated comparison of the two versions on the web. BUT I can definitely see why Scott wanted to recut the film after all these years. For a movie titled Revenge it sure drags quite a bit  not just in the beginning but in the second and third acts as well. Worrying news for an actionrevengeflick. Sadly no matter how much you'll cut out of this film or cut back in it still lacks good characters a believable plot or compelling actionscenes.Cochran Costner has got to be the worst character in the entire movie A selfish cocky and immature well ahole who somehow has a powerful Mexican mafiadon Quinn as his best friend. And despite said Don's obvious power and ruthlessness Cochran thinks that starting an affair with his hot young and neglected wife Stowe would be a good idea. Some scenes involving Costner are paininducingly awful. Like the one where he gets showered with gifts by his fellow navy pilots. It's probably meant to show us what a cool dude he is. What it actually does is make him look like an arrogant prick. Or later when Quinn comes to his house and all but tells him that he knows something is going on between Costner and Stowe  and even leaves him a way out by asking Cochran to fly him down to Caracas instead of taking off to the country with his new lover. After Costner refused Quinn for the third time in this scene his character lost all credibility along with my sympathy.And that's bad news in a story like Revenge If the audience can't identify with the hero why should they care about his fate? I for one didn't feel sorry for Cochrane or the wife during their ordeal at the hand's of Quinn's thugs. The way they acted they were practically asking for Quinn's revenge.Which brings me neatly to the movie's title. It's not quite clear who is exacting revenge in the story The cheated husband Quinn or the beatenand leftfordead lover Costner. If it's the former it seems pretty exaggerated since brutally beating his friend and slicing his wife's face and then selling her into prostitution feels rather harsh for a weekend of sex. If it's the latter the titular revenge seems rather halfassed. Cochrane does kill a couple of thugs but when he finally gets to Quinn instead of killing him in a cruel and creative way he apologizes for his wrongdoings and lets him go.The sad thing about this movie is that behind all the awkward characterization you can see glimpses of how this could've been a good dark gritty revengepic. Sadly however it never really delivers.410".

	onyx:emotionText "Warning Major Spoilers Ahead!!After years of looking for this movie it never came out on DVD over here in Germany I finally watched it on payTV last night. It was the theatrical version and thank God it was even uncut. The picture quality was very good ... almost looked like a restored version.I haven't seen the DC yet just checked out an illustrated comparison of the two versions on the web. BUT I can definitely see why Scott wanted to recut the film after all these years. For a movie titled Revenge it sure drags quite a bit  not just in the beginning but in the second and third acts as well. Worrying news for an actionrevengeflick.

	schema:reviewBody "Revenge is actually a much better movie than I thought it would be. It was a littleknown movie but with a good cast I thought it would be worth the pickup. It is a very bloody violent film with themes of redemption in more ways than one. The movie began slow with the introduction of Costner's character but once when his elderly Mexican politician friend enters the picture things begin to pick up steam. In all this is a vastly underrated action revenge flick. This film is about a Navy pilot who retires and he decides to travel to Mexico to visit his old friend whom life he saved in a hunting accident. He meets his friend's wife who is very unhappy and seduces him. When Tibey his friend finds out all hell breaks loose. I thought the acting was really good. Kevin Costner shows again and again what an excellent actor he is. He shows great chemistry with Madeleine Stowe. She has never looked better as she does in this film. Anthony Quinn does a good job as the angry political Tibey!Overall Revenge is a good action flick and one that people give it less credit for. It's not the greatest revenge flick but still a good one. The film has a sad ending which adds drama to the flick and I think the film was written pretty well. Those looking for a good action flick this is the film for you. My Grade A".

Recently I watched it again and remembered much of it the same though not as fondly as time had caused maturity in watching. But it still was worth the time.To begin apart from Kevin Costner and Anthony Quinn the rest of the cast was quite impressive. This was during Costner's run of quality movies in the last 1980s and early 1990s. His performance certainly doesn't measure up to The Untouchables No Way Out or Dances With Wolves but surpasses The Bodyguard and Robin Hood. Quinn is rather dynamic and plays his part as an understated drug lord and makes every scene he is in interesting. To those established actors Madeleine Stowe matches quiet well. This was early in her career and probably the performance that gave her a name. She was sensual sexy and sophisticated and the love scene really are steamy in no part to the chemistry.But what makes this movie really interesting is Tony Scott. I've always thought his style was similar to Michael Mann yet in many aspects better. This movie was done after Top Gun but was still early in his career. The visuals and framing were superb and despite some of the critiques of his numerous closeups to me it felt consistent in the intimacy he was trying to portray. He seemed to be similar in The Last Boy Scout though not as effective. Apart from Costner and Quinn and a small appearance by Sally Kirkland wonderful little scene and James Gammon this was fairly early in the careers of many of the important supporting actors. Thus there is an inevitable weakness that appears on occasion yet should not detract from the time taken to watch this movie. Recommend to watch in a darker room nolow lights due to the dark hues Tony Scott uses on his cameras.".

	schema:reviewBody "This has to be some of the worst direction I've seen. The closeup can be a very powerful shot but when every scene consists of nothing but closeups it loses all its impact. Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with the backdrops of Mexico the cantinas the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives and the dusty towns Costner rolls through on his journey for revenge. Unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big giant head. Even the transition scenes where Costner is driving alone across Mexico quickly cut to a closeup. The score is overdramatic and intrusive dictating every emotion we should feel. The story itself should have been handled much better. Among other things too many people pop up out of nowhere to help Costner along  it's just bad writing. It's a typical thriller storyline but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a somewhat similar storyline but it was a much better movie. The ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film. This movie was never going to be great but if we saw more of Mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Violence seems to be the theme in this film.  Not that I'm very fond of violent films.  I found this one a bit too long.  Produced by it's star Kevin Costner not one of my favorite actors it follows his quest if you want to call it that for his true love played well by Madeleine Stowe who along with himself became victims of revenge for their tryst by none other than Anthony Quinn a masterful actor in all that he does.  And that's the plot.  Director Tony Scott did some fine work with this movie along with the excellent photography by Jeffrey Kimball.  Many of the scenes had that smoky soft sepia tones.  The morning scene in the mountains was awesome with the fog crawling up the side of the mountain.  Quinn was my favorite in this.  He was the villain and who could blame him.  A man stole his wife and had an affair.  However in his revenge upon the lovers you never doubted his pain and remorse in what he had to do.  Bravo Anthony!  Stowe played it very well with just the right amount of sadness and never over the top.  You really felt her agony in the latter part of the movie as she was dying.  Costner however just didn't grab me.  I was always aware of his acting.  He always has one look on his face.  Like he doesn't know what's happening around him.  More a role for the likes of Harrison Ford or Brendan Fraser.  It was a surprise to see John Legiuzamo in a small but effective role.  John as we all know has come far even to appearing solo on Broadway.  If you have nothing else to do watch this movie if only for Quinn and Stowe's performances.".

Set in the Latino culture where men of wealth are expected to have female friends but their women are to remain faithful the real drama her lies in the danger of violating this taboo. Kevin Costner's portrayal of the Navy pilot and Vietnam veteran who has spent the last twelve years of his life piloting fighter jets is remarkable. He is the man without a vision of his future a man seeking meaning in the world and hoping to find the reality of his life. But with no purpose in his life he quickly becomes enamored of the beautiful Madeline Stowe the bored and unhappy wife of his best friend played by Anthony Quinn.Quinn is the wealthy and dangerous maker of politicians and an associate of many people in power but he is also both hated and feared by the common people. Around these three principles are Miguel Ferrer John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland an impressive trio of character actors who lend a hand to Costner in his search for Stowe. This is not a film with a happy ending and the question you must ask yourself at the end is who is responsible? Rated R for violence nudity language and sexual situations this is definitely not for the teens or the children and while I have a copy I will leave it to you to decide to include it in your collection.".

But when the armistice is signed Conan and his men find themselves in limbo while Norbert working for the Court Martials finds himself accusing the very men he admired for robbery and murder. This film does take a while to get going but it is worth it giving time for the characters to develop and also establishing the monotony the soldiers find going from combat to walking the streets of Bucharest. The film also deals with the beginnings of the Russian Civil War and the problem of soldiers fighting with no motivation. Tavernier's direction is superb and visually the film equals a number of classic war films while the performances help to give it an edge as it goes into territory that Hollywood war film's in particular have tended not to go into.".

With Capitaine Conan he accomplished what all the NewWave directors dreamed about but never quite got the chance to do except maybe for Bertolucci on The Last Emperor if you want to consider him part of the original newwave to make a highbudget film with thousands of extras and elaborate detailed sets which completely conforms to their vision and stays uncompromised an auteurist epic. Well how's this for uncompromised Most of the shots in this film are made using only available light or the light that would be available given the circumstances of the scene! As a result the film looks uniquely dark and authentic as if it was shot in 1918 when the events took place. This takes some getting used to and of course people conditioned to being spoon fed every scene lit up like a christmas tree will be disoriented but the shadowy effects achieved far outweigh the negatives. Some of the shots are kept in total darkness as they would be in real life with barely a face showing to indicate who's talking to who! Then the people gradually come out of the darkness into different shades of light each more nuanced than the other. The cinematography and art direction are breathtaking there isn't a single shot in the entire film that couldn't be called a masterpiece of its own perfectly framed perfectly composed and perfectly moved. Tavernier rarely uses a shotreverseshot preferring complex camera movement or long uninterrupted takes capturing the scenes from different angles without a cut. The scenes themselves however don't drag on forever they are compact and to the point making a Tavernier film usually one where a lot of things happen very fast and in order to pick up all the details and nuances many viewings are essential. The acting from the awesome leads of Thoreton a richly deserved Cesar award for best actor Le Bihan and Le Coque down to the smallest bit player is uniformly brilliant. No American film I've ever seen has acting on this high a naturalistic level.The film is mainly about the thin and precariously balanced area called 'amorality' that some people have a knack for staying within racking up only enough whites good deeds and blacks bad deedsto stay mostly in the perfectly shaded middle gray. In a wartime situation the people who have this knack tend to do very well for themselves. Conan a tough special forces officer whose group makes sneak attacks on the enemy and kills at knifepoint is that perfect 'amoral' character or for lack of a better term people have come to call an 'antihero' i.e. that guy who sometimes does 'bad' or 'evil' things but integrates this within a higher integrity that's essentialy 'good' and admirable. His friend Lt. Norbert is the more traditionally 'moral' man who comes to admire the guts it takes for Conan to operate rather openly in that precarious zone against all the hypocrisies of his superiors which keep them protected.  When Conan comes to defend a few of his men who have clearly gone over the line and committed atrocities which must be punished Norbert given the job of prosecuting the men makes his position clear and breaks with him. All through the film he tries to become more like Conan and yet stays wary of the line that Conan could easily cross into madness and fanaticism. What draws Conan and Norbert together is their common integrity against the hypocrisies of society as opposed to Lt. DeSceve the other main character who's an honorable soldier and strong man but who kissesup to the top brass and has a fascist attitude.This film never got the distribution it should have in the U.S. simply because it was a subtitled foreign film and Americans have practically stopped watching foreign films! What a damn shame! They missed the greatest film of the '90s! I would conjecture that not 1 out of a 100 people who've seen Spielberg's melodramatic Saving Private Ryan have even heard of Capitaine Conan. Catch it on the Sundance channel on cable or rent it on video and experience a true masterpiece. Then watch it again and again and experience dejavu.".

	schema:headline " Capitaine Conan' is a very good movie one of the best of 1996";
	schema:reviewBody "Captain Conan Capitaine Conan' 12.  1996 France Not Rated 129 min Directed Bertrand Tavernier with Philippe Torreton Samuel Lebihan Bernard Le Coq. History on the cusp of any war is most often overlooked.  How many of us have or take the opportunity to study or learn about the United States during the 1760s or 1870s?  When did you last read about Europe in 1900 1920 1932 or 1946?  Capitaine Conan' is a movie about men on the cusp at the end of World War I.  For this alone Capitaine Conan' is a movie worth seeing.  For more than a year after the Armistice over 100000 French troops fought in Eastern Europe.Capitaine Conan' opens on the battlefront in Bulgaria.  Conan Torreton is the leader of a guerrilla troop that fights behind enemy lines.  They live off the land fighting where the rules of engagement are brutally one on one.  Conan tells his friend Norbett Lebihan 3000 men like me won the war.  Anyone can kill at a distance but only a few learn to kill with the knife eye to eye. It took all the millions of soldiers like you to fight the war but it took the few like myself to win it.'  But when the Armistice is announced Conan's men are thrust back into the civilized world a world of army regulations boredom and restrictions.  Conan's guerrillas aren't easily tamed.  There's a robbery and murder at the nightclub.  Conan's men are the primary suspects.  But before there is any resolution in the military court the French troops are called to fight the Bolsheviks on the border of the newly formed Soviet Union.  The Bolsheviks attack the French and Conan leads his men into the battle.  As the scene fades they are running into the reeds and rushes of a huge river delta.The movie ends with Conan and Norbett meeting some years later.  Conan is dying.  Their discussion is unsettling and doesn't resolve any of the unanswered questions about how the war ended.  I've watched the movie twice and the ending still seems out of place.  But then maybe wars and history don't end.  Maybe history is a continuum and life on the cusp between events is more difficult to define and understand than the events themselves. Maybe this is why most history is about events and less so about the life and lives around the events.If you're put of by the thought that Capitaine Conan' is nothing more than a history lesson be not afraid.  The acting direction and photography are very well done.  One of the most interesting features of this production is the hand held camera work during the battle scenes.  The camera moves through the battle like another pair of eyes often distracted by an explosion an obstruction or a scream.  The camera flinches as it makes its way though the mud and the muck of the battle.  The staging of a battle in the hills of Bulgaria is up to the standards of the battle scenes in Patton.'Capitaine Conan' is a very good movie one of the best of 1996.  It's out on video I recommend you see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Historically speaking this is a very interesting film as very few films have dealt with what occurred between the Armistace in November 1918 and when the troops were ultimately brought homesome as late as 1920 or 1921. During this period an undeclared and practically forgotten war raged off and on between soldiers from several nations and the Red Army along the Russian borders. Apparently France the United States Germany and several other nations were worried that the Russian Revolution might spill into other nations and so troops were sent to eastern Europe. Not a whole lot was gained from this though it did help to keep some of the problems from spreading somewhat. The problem is that while I am familiar about this period I wonder just how many nonhistory teachers know about this. While the film does give us some information about this it's a shame it wasn't more clear and exactly why the troops were sent into Bulgaria and Romania and who they were fighting wasn't really discussed. Perhaps the writers and director wanted this confusion in the film in order to mirror the confusion of the troops as they seemed to have no idea why they were there eitherbut still more information would have been nice.Despite the setting for the film being this undeclared war the theme running through the film was the extreme difficulty some soldiers had adjusting to peace. Captain Conan and his group of irregulars were savage guerrilla fighters and could not adapt to a postWWI world. This all came to a head when some of Conan's men were accused of committing crimes against the Romanians as well as when Conan was drug into resulting trials for these accused soldiers as well as a deserter. This is where the film became more interesting and I started to enjoy the film after a very slow start. Once again the film was important because rarely is this transition to normalcy addressed in war films.So do I recommend the film? Well it really depends on your tolerance for a slow film in the beginning as well as your ability to follow the scriptafter all if you don't have at least a basic knowledge of this period you might feel a bit lost.".

Most war films particularly those intended to be viewed as a deep form of art tend to be much more shallow Perhaps it has something to do with a lack of first hand military experience among film makers in the US. Often the writers and directors are simply trying to support an anti war thesis by illustrating suffering injustice and cruelty. But anyone can illustrate suffering injustice and cruelty in a generic way and then squeeze it into an ill fitting war context. What impressed me about Bertrand's work is that he didn't do this. There were no shallow caricatures and he did not spoon feed the audience with anti war propaganda. Bertrand instead tried to paint an accurate picture of some very complicated events and circumstances and the equally complicated people who are trying to deal with them. The suffering injustice and cruelty are there but the audience must find these elements for themselves.".

	schema:headline " A big disappointment.";
	schema:reviewBody "A couple of years ago when I heard Peter Jackson would direct two more Middleearth movies I started crying out of excitement. Those two movies soon got changed into three and I was angry because I was convinced the story was too short for three threehourslong movies. Despite the book being approximately 300 pages long Peter Jackson  co. proved me wrong and managed to not include big parts of the books in these movies even though there's more than 85 hours of total screen time. Disappointed is an understatement.I don't think this movie was supposed to make me laugh at the serious scenes and sigh at the 'comic relief' scenes basically everything Alfrid was in but sadly it did. At least the 'funny' scenes in the Lord of the Rings trilogy were subtle and less in number BOTFA was supposed to be serious and dark and those silly ridiculous scenes pretty much ruined that.I have nothing negative to say about the acting though. The amazing cast of this trilogy did the best they could with the awful script they were given and I'm thankful for that. It's not their fault that their character development was rushed because the movie was full of pointless Legolas Vs. Gravity scenes dull Tauriel scenes who fell in love with Kili after having a conversation with him once or twice  same goes for Kili who fell in love with her and even gave her the token his mother Ds gave him.The worst part of this movie isn't even that it's full of badly done CGI or the big lack of proper character development. It's the fact that Tauriel a badly written impossible character made up by Peter Jackson  co. had more screen time than characters who were in the actual book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Beorn basically got fifteen seconds if not less screen time in the last installment of this trilogy. Most of the dwarfs from the Company barely got a line and a LOT of things are left unexplained.SPOILERS AFTER THIS LINEFor instance what happened with Thranduil and the white gems? Did he ever get them back? What happened to the gold? As a fan of the books I already know the answer but the movie didn't really care to explain this important part of the story. Come on the entire battle was about the gold. At least take a minute to explain how it got divided. Where did those goats suddenly come from?Why were the dwarfs wearing helmets when they were still inside the mountain but had no helmets on when they actually went to war? What happened to the people of LakeTown? Why didn't the movie explain that Bard became King of Dale? If I had not read the book I'd get really annoyed after watching this movie and not knowing what had happened to them.What was the point of those ridiculously large worms and why did no one else ever mention them before? And why were they gone after ten seconds? Did they ever get killed?Why mention Legolas' mother and never explain anything about her at all?Besides all these unanswered questions there are certain things which bothered me more than all of those questions combined. 1. The Durins Thorin Kili Fili didn't get a funeral. In my opinion it's ridiculous to cut something like that out because they were basically the main characters. Which brings me to my second point. 2. I think Peter Jackson forgot that this story is called The Hobbit because Bilbo is supposed to be the main character not Thorin. 3. Kili basically sacrificed himself for Tauriel which is unforgivable. In the actual story Fili and Kili died defending Thorin in battle. Now the poor boy is dead because he had a crush on a badly written elf which also completely degrades the importance of Legolas and Gimli's friendship. Let's not forget about the scene wherein Legolas grabs a flying bat or when Bard uses his son Bain to shoot an arrow which should make him fall but somehow it doesn't or when Dain and Thorin decide to hug in the middle of a battle or when Azog somehow manages to float and dramatically opens his eyes. I absolutely loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy. They are my favorite movies of all time and the reason I became a fan of Tolkien's works in the first place. It's sad that Peter Jackson desperately tried to link the Hobbit movies to the LOTR trilogy because it's partly the reason why the Hobbit movies are so awful. If the unnecessary Dol Guldur scenes and the Tauriel storyline were skipped every good part from the book which is now cut out would have easily fit in. I'm still giving this movie a 4 out of 10 though because I absolutely love the cast and I think they did a brilliant job especially Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman. Also the very last scene was exactly like I imagined it would be with Ian Holm's Bilbo and Gandalf knocking on the door. Loved that part. And The Last Goodbye by Billy Boyd was a beautiful way to end this movie and trilogy and made me tear up.You might enjoy this movie if you really liked the first two I didn't if you're into bad CGI or movies that look like video games or if you don't really care about Tolkien's Middleearth and are content with a movie that doesn't do Tolkien and his characters justice at all. Otherwise you're probably someone like me and you'll leave the theater disappointed and grieving over the characters you love so much.".

	schema:reviewBody "I should begin by saying that I am a big fan of Tolkiens work and have read LOTR and The Hobbit and his other books many times. I did enjoy the first trilogy and thought that the changes Jackson did to the story were sometimes understandable sometimes acceptable. However I have no idea what happened with this movie and the whole second trilogy. I am terribly disappointed and I have no idea whether the changes were necessary simply to milk as much money as possible out of the whole project spreading out the story to get 3 long movies even if that meant adding many new things or whether Jackson actually thinks he knows better than Tolkien... knows better how to explain things how to connect the Hobbit to LOTR or how to make a compelling story. And yes an adaption doesn't HAVE to be close to the book. However if you mess with the story if you include things that contradict the whole story and if you essentially kill off the charm and warmth and concept of the book the movie is based on things get dangerous.The Hobbit was a book written for children and while there are scenes in the trilogy that will definitely be fun for children the dwarfs offering a lot of those kinda scenes the violence and amount of killing and cut off heads make me wonder how suitable the movie really is. However watching this movie and having seen the previous ones these questions came up in my mindIs it really FORBIDDEN to make a movie that Doesn't have a lovestory involved? Isn't the Hobbit legendary enough hasn't the book proved often enough it is a great story without a lovestory included? Why did Jackson have to create Tauriel the female ninjaelf and her lovestory with a DWARF? Why did this have to be added? Would the film would have so much more terrible hard to imagine without a clich and badlywritten lovestory that was added by Jackson and Walsh?  I sincerely think that if the elvish race is capable of doing the things Tauriel and Legolas do in battle not only could the small group of elven warriors Jackson added to the battle of Helms Deep in Two Towers have totally defeated the orcish army in less than 2 minutes... the history of MiddleEarth would be very difficult if they all could fight even remotely as well. Also the fighting skills of Legolas in this movie are totally inconsistent to what he was able to do later on in LOTR. Considering that elves live incredibly long the amount of time that passed between the Hobbit and Lotr is no explanation of why Legolas is a walking ninjagod in the Hobbit and much less supermanlike in LOTR.  The incredible length of the scenes... it sincerely feels like the movie team was paid by the minutes of film they produced  The worms... I reckon they are based on a small comment by Bilbo mentioning wereworms a comment that has often riddled Tolkienfans. Is this an attempt to somehow win over the fans of Tolkienlore that feel insulted by Tauriel the changes to the story the goats rabbits and deermounts the fact that the WONDERFUL scene of Beorn appearing at the battle in the book and turning the tide bringing relief and a change to the battle was kinda removed because the ninjaelves prove that MiddleEarth is located in the Matrix?  I really would feel bad for JRR Tolkien if he was able to watch these movies. He felt so much love for the world and characters he created and put so much time effort and feelings into his work. All this now was steamrolled over by the production team of this movie. After the rather respectful handling of LOTR Jackson changed so much about the Hobbit that it feels totally disrespectful to the lifetime of work Tolkien put into his stories. What went wrong? Did Jackson think that in order to attract and convince all those that haven't read the books he would need to turn a wonderful book written for children with a lot of warmth and charm into a medieval Transformers regarding amount of CGI length of fights lack of realism character depth and taste? Did he really think this was in any way a respectful adaption of the work of a man who invested DECADES into writing refining and perfecting his stories? Who instead of focusing on just hours of battle managed to create a world full of lore charm and wonderful characters?I have no idea what went wrong behind the scenes. Have no idea whether the movie studio said Jackson forget about what people love about the Hobbit. Turn it into three overlong movies for more profit get us as many battles and skirmishes as you possibly can milk out of this and just to make sure add a lovestory we don't care how you do it add a popular character from the previous trilogy so people will dig that. Oh yeah the book was written for children so make sure there is a song or two bird poo on the nutty wizard who escaped from Hogwarts Radagast a dwarf with a pickax stuck in his skull and funny bits that children love. But don't forget we want adults to watch it too so please add tons of action and cutoff heads too... gotta hit all those demographics. I know a lot of Tolkienfans apparently love this movie and the trilogy. One review even said ...from a true fan. Please don't think this is the case in general. I have grown up reading Tolkiens work and I am simply stunned by how bad how tasteless and disrespectful this trilogy is.".

Battle of the 25 Armies plus a couple of random giant mountain goats and a pig thrown in for good measure.The CGI was as bad as something you would see in a B movieeven worse than the previous two Hobbit films. But even more noticeably the script took a dive to rock bottom. Within the first half hour such utterly laughable clichs as You make me feel alive were spoken in a cheesy love scene that seemed like something straight out of Saturday Night Live except that the audience was apparently supposed to take it seriously.Shortly before the battle started there were a few muchneeded moments of comic relief and I thought the film might possibly turn around. But all my illusions were soon shattered during the tenminute scene where Thorin walks on top of the ice that Azog is floating under with his eyes open following the orc and apparently waiting for him to break through it whensurprise!he does and spoiler for those who have not yet watched the tenminute scene that made this obvious kills Thorin. Alas. It might have been sad if I hadn't been waiting around for ten minutes knowing that he would get killed.Things were looking grim for the dwarfs when who should appear? Our heroes the eagles of course who have managed to bail out the protagonists in every single movie of the trilogy.Although I couldn't stop laughing during the scene where three dwarfs find completely random giant mountain goats with no riders in the middle of the battle and proceed to ride them up a mountain the worst part of the movie was easily the ending. As if the movie isn't long enough the audience is not only forced to watch Bilbo go all the way BACK to the Shire they have to rewatch footage from Fellowship of the Ring! I knew it was a bad sign that Peter Jackson actually made a movie shorter than three hours although it felt like sixapparently he had so little material for this movie that he had to reuse material from his original trilogy.When Tauriel discusses love with the abominably clichd line Why does it hurt so much? I think she described the feelings of most of the audience enduring the latest Hobbit movie.".

He will always live in the shadow of The Lord of the Rings which is a sumptuous beautiful heartrending thrilling masterpiece.I don't know what happened. But Jackson sacrificed tone realism characterization and story when he adapted The Hobbit. It is unrecognizable as work by the same director.There are so many problems with this trilogy and this movie that is nigh impossible to list them. Nearly every scene is a real travesty and the whole operation is an affront to the source material and fans of LOTR. The movies make hyperviolent beheadings and mass slaughter into orgies of staged action sequences and dumb gags. The orcs which are now entirely computergenerated are no longer compelling or realistic and they are seemingly significantly more fearsome than in LOTR... It takes what the audience understands about Middle Earth and makes it BIGGER in a completely childish overextension of the original story to make things even more epic! Wereworms and enormous bats  these don't exist in the larger and more climactic battle in LOTR but sure they existed back then right? Sure! Jackson also turns characters into absolutely ridiculous flat caricatures. Thranduil the bourgeois blueblood riding an elk Dain Thorin's cousin who rests his enormous high pitched Scottish girth on a wild boar the she elf who falls in love with a dwarf... It's stomach churning how Peter Jackson has combined a love for extreme violence and an eye for juvenile gags and unbelievable characters and in a beloved classic setting.This movie once again extends Legolas past human bounds past elven bounds past the bounds of Newtonian physics as he sprints newly cyan eyes shining on falling bricks and hangs from bats. We get to watch dwarfs behead seiging armies of orcs who are impotent to the blows of the tiny Olympians. Again oh no! Middle Earth is doomed the age of men is over cue slowmotion shots of Gandalf looking stricken Thorin killing orcs with Sparta kicks... The feel the script the look is all taken from LOTR and rehashed with this cast of cardboard characters in a badly rendered world of excess and fancy.I expected mature filmmaking for thoughtful audiences expecting real characters living in a real world with a compelling story but obviously that was too much to expect.If one of the important themes of The Hobbit is the rejection of greed as we can see personified by Thorin then is it hypocritical that Hollywood has churned out three abominably shallow and violent films out of The Hobbit for the public's consumption? I think so. I hate what these films represent and what they could have done.".

The feel the script the look is all taken from LOTR and rehashed with this cast of cardboard characters in a badly rendered world of excess and fancy.I expected mature filmmaking for thoughtful audiences expecting real characters living in a real world with a compelling story but obviously that was too much to expect.If one of the important themes of The Hobbit is the rejection of greed as we can see personified by Thorin then is it hypocritical that Hollywood has churned out three abominably shallow and violent films out of The Hobbit for the public's consumption? I think so. I hate what these films represent and what they could have done.";

	schema:reviewBody "What a difference an Extended Edition makes. For the first part we got some jolly embellishment. For The Desolation of Smaug we got bags more depth and character. For The Battle of the Five Armies it may  I hope  be transformative. Because right now this feels like An Unfinished Journey.It's as if after all the complaints about splitting a pamphlet of a novel into three parts Peter Jackson is playing a joke on us This is what you get when you ask for Middleearthlite. Characters we've come to love or loathe arc into nothing others e.g. Beorn and Radagast are given literally seconds of screen time and for the first time in this prequel trilogy a whole chapter The Return Journey is pretty much elided entirely.I'd like to be clear on my admiration for what Peter Jackson has done with The Hobbit so far. For all The Lord of the Rings' mythic grandeur and complex worldbuilding there's a warm geniality and brisk impetus to these lovingly crafted films. And those qualities are married to a thematic depth missing from its bedtime story source. Home and borders are themes that have run through this trilogy from Bilbo's Martin Freeman heartfelt declaration of solidarity at the end of An Unexpected Journey to Kili's Aidan Turner fevered speech to Tauriel Evangeline Lilly as she heals his wounds in Desolation when they realise reconciliation is possible. Heck I even like the addition of Tauriel  though her unsatisfying conclusion is perhaps typical of a final chapter that too often fails to tie up its loose ends.The movie kicks off from precisely where the second ended with the dread dragon Smaug Benedict Cumberbatch descending upon Laketown. The citizens flee but nothing can stop the cataclysm  until a certain someone finds an ingenious way to pierce the beast. Then there's nemesis 2 Sauron also Cumberbatch. We get to see some familiar faces faceoff with this faceless monstrosity.The story then enters its most intriguing phase a kind of psychodrama involving Thorin Richard Armitage and his sickening relationship with gold and power. It's the one time we really glimpse that signature Jackson oddness in a wonderful hallucinatory sequence where Thorin imagines he's sinking in a lake of gold.The narrative follows the book fairly closely. This was after all the stage of the story where Professor Tolkien finally foregrounded politics and ethics and the machinations of characters ahead of adventure. The film is at its most successful in the quieter moments as Thranduil a subtle Lee Pace ponders the duty of the elves as Bard a brooding Luke Evans comes to the gate of the mountain to plead for peace and as Thorin struggles with his dragonsickness i.e. greed while Bilbo wrestles with the dilemma of what to do with a certain stolen gemstone.Thorin was presented at first as this trilogy's Aragorn. But over time we've learned of the dangerous pride that ruined his grandfather. Thorin's hubris and arrogance is in stark contrast to Bilbo's very relatable and achievable traits of decency and humility. The gulf between them is intriguing and wisely plundered for drama. Armitage and Bilbo provide the best performances of the film  mostly internal mostly in the eyes  and their farewell is one of the more moving moments in a trilogy that has largely prioritised humour over pathos.The battle itself is undoubtedly impressive  great roaring hordes punctuated with spectacular giants  but in a sense it compounds the problem of the relatively truncated runtime. What was already the shortest Middleearth film is rendered artificially even shorter by the fact that there's 45 minutes of virtually wordless fighting. By now we should all be braced for Super Legolas and his physicsdefying fighting style. That reaches new heights here as he sprints up a crumbling bridge like he's on the wrong escalator it's like some sort of visual satire on the weightlessness of CGI.With its last bastion and swarming armies the titular battle resembles The Return of the King's Pelennor finale  yet that movie took breath between its showdowns. Galadriel vs. Sauron Legolas vs. Bolg Thorin vs. Azog... it's like we're watching someone finish off a video game but we're powerless to stop them skipping the tension or characterbuilding cutscenes. Moreover the dubious editing decisions create some strange and jolting juxtapositions and tonal lurches and negate the sense of time passing or of great distances being crossed.The result is a film that really earns its status of theatrical cut insofar as it resembles many a boisterous blockbuster. This is fairly damning criticism for a Middleearth movie usually so luxurious and layered in its sense of a unique world. There's plenty of meat here  but where are the bones that hold it all together? 11 months away perhaps.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Jackson's defense the project was ambitious to begin with. Turn 310 pages of children's literature into an epic Hollywood trilogy. Many debates go on about which movie was the best the fairy tale the one inbetween or the die hardalike final. The sad truth is that to a pure fan they are one by one in their own unique ways an abomination. What can one expect from a battle that starts in the thirdtolast chapter in the book but that goes on for 144 minutes in the film adaption? Granted some of the battle scenes were innovative. In fact the beginning the cooperation between the elves and dwarfs who had been ridiculing each other like Tom and Jerry at first was most entertaining. For a few minutes at most. But not for two hours. Of course the writers realized this. Therefore these bombastic large scale battles were altered with individual scenes. And this is where all touch with Tolkien faded. Not only were the action scenes needlessly absurd I think of Legolas jumping from one falling stone to another of Azog opening his eyes in an osomelodramatic fashion we've seen way too many times and of Brad's ridiculous carriage scene but the individual stories weren't nearly as grasping as they should have been. And this can be forgiven for Thranduil and his son in an unsuccessful ending scene that was empty of any convincing emotions in an attempt to make a bridge to the Lord of The Rings series. This can even be forgiven for Thorin the classic antihero who goes mad after barely a few days of being around his treasure but realizes his true destiny just in time only to die an honorable death in order to obtain forgiveness for his 20minuteearlier sins. But this can't be forgiven for the Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins is a supernumerary in his own movie. And that is inexcusable.All fans of Tolkien will probably watch this. The feeling I'm left with is gratefulness for the untouchable Lord of the Rings series. They can never be taken away. The Hobbit falls short right there where the Lord of the Rings is most powerful loyalty to Tolkien. The trilogy did not fail because it grasped for Hollywoodgreatness it failed because Tolkien would watch it and say What a fine movie! Where'd you get the idea?".

	schema:headline " A Lazy Cynical Retread of LOTR";
	schema:reviewBody "I first experienced The Hobbit at the age of 4 when my mother read it to me and I have been a Tolkien fan ever since. And I have been generally disappointed with Peter Jackson's take on The Hobbit since the beginning. Jackson abused the mythos struck out trying to turn a lighthearted children's book into a trio of Serious Epics and created bloated endless action scenes that did nothing to legitimately advance the plot before this film the barrelbattle and the golden dragondip were the most egregious. I honestly could not think of a single scene which was not addressed more effectively in the cheap 1970s cartoon. And I found it painfully obvious that Jackson was trying to cheat his way to success by hitting all of the same notes as he did in the Lord of the Rings films whether or not they made sense in this context the character Tauriel exists solely to be Arwen the character Alfrid exists solely to be Wormtongue.That last point is far and away my greatest complaint about the final effort. I almost didn't believe what I was seeing the ridiculous eternal Battle of Five Armies wasn't just reminiscent of Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith it WAS those battles shot for shot. Jackson literally plopped the same choreography from his good trilogy into this film and called it done. It's bad filmmaking it's lazy and it's just an inexcusable cynical cashgrab. For instanceIn the leadup to Helm's Deep a scared desperate people streamed left to right over barren countryside into the fortress. In BOFA a scared desperate people streamed left to right over barren countryside into the ruins of Dale. Characters hidden on a rocky outcropping witness the gates of a great enemy fortress open. A massive army streams out while its general urges them onward from above. Is that Frodo and Sam at Minas Morgul or Legolas and Tauriel at Gundabad? We had a sweeping shot of ranks of spearbearing Uruk Hai before the walls who part to allow a mounted leader to advance menacingly through their ranks. Now we have a sweeping shot of spearbaring ELVES before the walls who part to allow a mounted elfking to advance menacingly through their ranks. In both cases we have shots up at the outnumbered defenders peering down from their hastily rebuilt fortress. In both cases a prematurely fired arrow opens the hostilities. A berserker carrying a bomb ran urgently towards the culvert leaping headfirst to bring down the wall. Now we have a troll with a ram on his head who runs urgently and leaps headfirst to bring down a wall. The Uruk Haiorcs following stream together through the narrow hole then fan out.Gandalf rides right to left up the steep winding streets of both Minas Tirith and Dale to warn and rally the citizens.Characters say Send forth the legions Kill them all The Age of the Orc has begun. In both trilogies.Before Legolas slid on a shield left to right down a staircase to save Gimli using the shield to impale an Uruk. Now Bard rides a wagon left to right down a hill to save his children using the cart to bowl over a troll. When All is Lost at Helm's Deep a heroic younger character confronts the aging king urging him to fight rather than hiding. The king agrees and the small band charges out in one final desperate effort while a dwarf blows an impractically large horn. The burly character shouts To the King! The attacking Uruks are taken aback by the blinding sun and bowled aside. When All is Lost at Erebor a heroic younger character confronts the aging king urging him to fight rather than hiding. The king agrees and the small band charges out in one final desperate effort while a dwarf blows an impractically large horn. The burly character shouts To the King! The attacking trolls are taken aback by... well nothing apparently... and bowled aside. Yeah this one is EXACTLY the same without even an effort to hide it. In ROTK Legolas makes his way to the head of a Mumak and brings it down by piercing its brain from above causing it to crash into another Mumak resulting in an earthshaking collapse. In BOFA Legolas makes his way to the head of a troll which seems to have morningstars for feet and brings it down by piercing its brain from above causing it to crash into a town resulting in an earthshaking collapse. In a oneonone showdown outside Minas Tirith Eowyn faces the WitchKing who is armed with a sword and an improbable mace. In a oneonone showdown above Dale Thorin faces Azog who is armed with a swordarm and an improbable mace.I could cite more examples but I'm bumping up against the word limit. The acting in The Hobbit is generally solid  Martin Freeman in particular is excellent. But Peter Jackson either ran out of ideas or didn't bother trying. This film is a bloated selfplagiarizing mess and the only worthwhile moments are those pulled unaltered from the book.".

The attacking Uruks are taken aback by the blinding sun and bowled aside. When All is Lost at Erebor a heroic younger character confronts the aging king urging him to fight rather than hiding. The king agrees and the small band charges out in one final desperate effort while a dwarf blows an impractically large horn. The burly character shouts To the King! The attacking trolls are taken aback by... well nothing apparently... and bowled aside. Yeah this one is EXACTLY the same without even an effort to hide it. In ROTK Legolas makes his way to the head of a Mumak and brings it down by piercing its brain from above causing it to crash into another Mumak resulting in an earthshaking collapse. In BOFA Legolas makes his way to the head of a troll which seems to have morningstars for feet and brings it down by piercing its brain from above causing it to crash into a town resulting in an earthshaking collapse. In a oneonone showdown outside Minas Tirith Eowyn faces the WitchKing who is armed with a sword and an improbable mace. In a oneonone showdown above Dale Thorin faces Azog who is armed with a swordarm and an improbable mace.I could cite more examples but I'm bumping up against the word limit. The acting in The Hobbit is generally solid  Martin Freeman in particular is excellent. But Peter Jackson either ran out of ideas or didn't bother trying. This film is a bloated selfplagiarizing mess and the only worthwhile moments are those pulled unaltered from the book.";

This man turns out to be just like all the other Hollywood directors a money wolf. This trilogy was made for nothing more than money why 3 parts why?! And half of the book isn't even concluded in the movies.A 260 page book spread in 9 hours in movie could be something awesome but it didn't. it became horrible.

Where is there brutality of the LOTR? Where in the most epic battles of movie history everything took place  grief death epicness sadness moments of smiling while having a hard time trying not to let go of some tears and above all the fact that you don't know how many of the good people will survive. Well in TBOFA nobody died expect orcs CGI monsters. And than some other things that made no sense and are left out. What happens with the Arkenstone who becomes king under the mountain where does Tauriel go what happens to the dwarve what happens to the lake people and what about the gems of the Elves?! Isn't that what this movie was all about?? How hard was it to include 15 minutes more and tell this. And why did Peter Jackson change the story about the death of Fili and Kili? Where was the love of brother ship? that's what I liked about the book it was about love for your brothers not about the love of a stupid made up elve girl. Oh and above all Middle Earth looked life an awful ugly world while it's supposed to be an amazing wonderful world. Peter Jackson messed up big timeI think this is enough for you guys to get why this movie was horrible compared to what it could've became a story rank worthy to the LOTR movies.210 1 star because it was MiddleEarth and 1 star because Bilbo played an amazing role oh yeah speaking of Bilbo he looked like a side character isn't he the main character?".

	schema:reviewBody "I despise Desolation of Smaug so I can assure you I went in with minuscule expectations. Even those were shattered. I have disregarded the book in this review because the book was ruined back in Desolation of Smaug. I watched this as a movie ignoring everything I knew about how it was meant to go. Picking up exactly where Desolation left off Smaug comes to his fiery end within ten minutes of the film's beginning which only serves to highlight the terrible decision to split the film into three and to make the cuts where they did. We then spend roughly forty minutes waiting for the infamous 45 minute battle scene to begin and then plead for it to end. Unlike the gripping tense and endlessly entertaining battle sequences in LOTR these CGIheavy storms contained no sense of danger or drama. The laws of physics are suspended to the point where most people in the audience were laughing and the hideous and unexplained fan service gives the impression that the film was directed by a 11 year old boy with some magic markers. Once again the screenwriters run out of Tolkein to fill 2 and a half hours so invent their own and the result is cringeworthy dialogue about love. At the film's conclusion barely any character is given any resolution save for Legolas who doesn't appear in the book at all and to a degree Bilbo himself. Martin Freeman performs well as Bilbo nailing nearly every scene he is in. However nearly every big name actor in the film collects around 2 minutes of screen time everyone from Blanchett to Connelly and most of them feel as if they are going through the motions. Blanchett in particular is given a particularly cringeworthy part and I hope she was paid well. An unrecognisable and CGIheavy Billy Connelly gives probably the least inspired performance in the film as Dain whose role is so heavily reduced that it probably doesn't matter. Ryan Gage's Alfrid is so painfully unnecessary and uninspired that he brings down the movie in every scene he appears. Each of the film's deaths is anticlimactic and changed for the worse. The Lord of the Rings trilogy features some of the best cinematic deaths ever  Boromir Theoden The WitchKing the Cave Troll the BalrogGandalf. None of these fare even close.Most unforgivingly the film pathetically pretends to be Lord of the Rings. We first see hints of it when Saruman Galadriel and Elrond storm into Dol Goldur and Galadriel reprises her role as Green Witch from Fellowship but it becomes far more blatant later on. BOFA blatantly steals the LOTR Oscarwinning score it recreates key scenes from Two Towers but replaces the terrifying Urukhai with generic CGI white orcs it sends Legolas off to find Aragorn which makes no sense and the final scene is literally taken word for word from the Fellowship of the Ring.In Conclusion please AVOID this film if you have an appreciation for film Tolkein books the laws of physics or practical effects. Watch only if you want a demonstration of CGI excess a Martin Freeman performance which you can find elsewhere or are a prisoner whose only escape is by watching this film. Otherwise please just watch the Lord of the Rings instead.".

I'm the biggest Hobbit fan I knowI adore the movies the book and collect all the trinkets and art books I can. and since the Desolation of Smaug had been a quite good movie and I had heard Peter Jackson claim this film was going to be even more serious and thrillery I naturally assumed it was going to be a dark thrilling movie that had me on the edge of my seat.This was not the case.The movie started with an extremely anticlimactic scene that killed suspension of disbelief and continued on the same track. Smaug while a masterpiece of animation was disappointing as was most of the movie. The film continued and I was more and more confused this is not the movie I had expected. It lacked a good plot was confusing even to mewho has read the book and the production books five times over and COULD NOT DECIDE WHAT IT WANTED TO BE.One second it was comedy and while some scenes were amusing enough some were just cringeworthyPeter Jackson's horrendous comic timing making itself known but these scenes completely ruined the atmosphere of the film making it dull and bland instead of tense and exciting. The only saving grace this piece of badly directed trash had were the scenes with the King of the Dwarfs Thorin succumbing to madness and his relationship dynamic with Bilbowho had very little screen time for a film about him These scenes were brilliant mostly because of the heartfelt and excellent acting of Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman.Sadly even though one feels these scenes should be in center the movie chooses to focus on dull battle sequences. The scenes that are truly good are hastily skipped over and we move to classic bad PJ comedy and awful battle scenes. While in Lord of The Rings there were some goofy battle scenes this movie almost seems like it's trying to make a parody of itself. I did not find many problems with Legolas's gravity defying skills in Desolation of Smaug but here it makes you wonder if Middle Earth is actually the moon in regards to the gravityfree atmosphere.Other than the terrible battle scenes we have the focus on a romance plot so bad it almost makes me blush of secondhand embarrassment. It's like the movie is trying to emulate elements from Titanic but fails miserably. The romance was so forced it might as well be a spoof and was a complete waste of a female character. I am in favor of female characters being added to the story. In fact I love it. But here? It is so blatantly clear Tauriel was only added to be Kili's love interest and it hurts my heart to see female character's butchered in this way.And that's not even mentioning the atrocity that was making Galadriel who is the strongest person in middleearth laying on the floor sobbing and waiting for her strong male wizard companions to help her. The death scenes of some of the characters were underwhelming except for one which was emotional enough to make me give this movie my almostapproval but it is just as many of us feared This movie gives no screen time or attention to dwarfs who are not Thorin Oakenshield and Kiliwe don't even see them fight in this movie. They just stand in the background.So to sum it up if you expect a thrilling experience you're out of luck. The movie was generally poorly paced poorly directed with really awful CGI conflicts that were created solved and sometimes forgotten in the blink of an eye and an excess of Legolas.WHO IS LITERALLY JUST THERE TO LOOK PRETTY AND DO STUNTS.. It is a worth watch if you're a fan but only for a couple of scenes that the director seemed to have deemed unimportant despite them being the only reason this movie was even worth the name. Tasteless jokes awful fight scenes terrible cheesy romance that puts the notebook to shame and more questions than answers in the end. Peter Jackson truly did not deliver even though it's clear he tried. He simply tried too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "So... That was The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies. The final film in Peter Jackson's sixfilm MiddleEarth saga.This may just be Jackson's most ambitious film yet. It has to work as a standalone film it has to be the final part of a trilogy and it has to be the bridge between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings films. Ambitious?Let me state for the record that I'm an enormous fan of the Lord of the Rings films. I consider them to be the best trilogy of all time. However I didn't really have that same vibe with the Hobbit films. I admit when I heard they would begin making more MiddleEarth films I was excited. The thought of returning to MiddleEarth was exhilarating.Then in December 2012 the first Hobbit film has its release. I was disappointed. It may have been because I didn't know what to expect but it certainly wasn't what I had hoped it would be. There was too much goofy humor and it was close to putting me to sleep at times.Come December 2013 The Desolation of Smaug is released. Looking back I think that this film was intended to split audiences. This film deviated so much from its source material that at times I forgot what I was watching. Suddenly there was a DwarfElf love story suddenly Thorin's company of Dwarfs split up suddenly they're fighting Smaug and then the film ends.Now here we are in 2014 with the conclusion to the Hobbit films The Battle of the Five Armies. This film literally starts off where Desolation left off with Smaug destroying Lake Town. A breathtaking sequence. Beautiful visuals remind us that Thorin's actions will bring some devastating consequences. However the sequence loses me a bit by cutting away to the Master of LakeTown and Alfrid who I guess were meant to be comic relief but I ended up wishing they'd die. Not because I didn't like their characters but because I thought they were so annoying and distracting from the overall experience.After a very Lord of the Ringsesque recovery scene we meet Bilbo and Thorin's half company of Dwarfs at Erebor and you can tell Thorin has changed. He's become sick with the aptly named Dragon Sickness and Bilbo can tell that something isn't quite right about him. Little do they know that Azog Who is like the evilest thing ever. is marching towards Erebor as well as the Elvenking 'Mr. Fabulous' Thranduil is also moving towards Erebor resulting in a literal clash of the titans.What we end up with is an enormous battle so large in fact that it shares title with the film. And now is also when Peter Jackson displays his qualities and faults as a film director. He manages to makes his battles very intimate despite the chaos that you see on the screen. However he has shown a particular love for goofy stuff and after three films he finally almost got it. There still is goofiness for people who crave that but for the rest of us it comes off as dumb excuses for cheap laughs.But damn this film has a lot of CGI. And some of it doesn't even look finished! Some sequences looked like video game cutscenes at best and at points I had to take off my 3D glasses because I had no idea what was happening. Note to self Never see a 3D film again.However all things must come to an end and in this film there are so many cases that are left unsolved almost to the point where it baffled me. We're introduced to Thorin's cousin Dan Ironfoot who I'm pretty sure is a CGI version of Billy Connolly. Suddenly he's gone and we're left wondering where he went and we never see what happens to them again. Same thing happens to Beorn Tauriel Bard and sigh Alfrid just to mention a few.That's this film's main problem It opened too many doors without shutting them. Does that analogy make sense? There's almost no resolution to any of the characters except for Bilbo masterfully portrayed by Martin Freeman by the way. For a film series called The Hobbit he doesn't appear nearly enough. I'm looking at you Tauriel! Get out of the frame!In conclusion this is a worthy final installment in The Hobbit Trilogy and a film I consider to be the best of the three.Pros Great acting welldirected battle sequences Howard Shore Need I say more? good visuals.Cons Lack of resolutions obnoxious characters too much CGI some cheesy moments.All in all a fine holiday film. If you enjoyed the previous Hobbits you'll like this one.".

But my passion for middle earth doesn't stop there I am obsessed with this world and in love with the vastness and complexity of its characters and stories. So did I like the movie? Yes a lot. Was the movie actually good? That would be more debatable. Before I go into the thick of this review I just want to remind that I really like the movie but if it seems that I am highlighting only the negative points it is because they are so frustrating.Everything that is wrong with this and the other two Hobbit movies are basic filmaking decisions that are wrongly taken. This is to say that Peter Jackson's brilliance remains he gave proof in all of these movies that he knows how to direct his films. There is nobody in the world that knows how to stage a battle like him. He takes us through amazing visual choices and complex staging flawlessly. The fluency of everything is magnificent thanks to an amazing pace. Despite me thinking about the wrongs of it I could not help but be flattered by the sheer epicness of this. I was genuinely on the edge of my seat I felt amazing tension at times I really loved the experience and was attached to the very end to the characters. Every one of them. The duels were fantastic it was all riveting. But there were simply decisions that were made early on that took away from it.Why are these movies shot digitally! Other than looking very bad it does not make sense. The whole 48fps 3D digital shooting was a mistake to being with. These films shot have been shot on film just like the Lord of the Rings it would have given them a thousand points more. The whole CGI is just too much. There isn't any of the practicality from the first movies and it shows so bad. Digital masses of everything that have no weight and look way too bad for a 500million production. I am convinced that by shooting on film and loosing half of the CGi in favour of practicality would make these three movies ten times better. To this point by removing half of the CGI we could also remove all the extravagant madness that comes from it. There are scenes or monsters in this film that would have never even passed first draft back in the Lord of the Rings because they are so weird and out of the moment talking for example about that Legolas moment in this one those of you who have seen the movie understand me. Other than this you do not waste time on characters we dont give the FK about! I am really OK with making three movies out of the Hobbit you know if it's the last time we visit Middle Earth we might as well throw in everything that Tolkien wrote that could fit in. But lets not waste time on Alfrid or the Governor! You know three twohour movies could have really made it! Anyways I don't want to indulge in my frustration too much because it would be a waste of time. Go see the movie if youre a fan like me you wont be disappointed more than you were with the other movies. They are really good but they could have so easily been fg great!".

Tauriel and Fili subplot is so out of place that people in cinema exchanged stares. 2. Whole script is written by a five year old. It just doesn't make any sense many things needed for plot appeared out of nowhere  bell chamois Orc command post and so on. How armies from around 100 miles got to the mountain in one day... 3. fight sequences are like from matrix combined with really bad computer game. choreography and lucky accidents are extremely unrealistic. Ninja Legolas made some people in cinema burst into laughter and me to tears of desperation 4. The movie isn't based on book. It isn't even loosely based on it.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is definitely worthy of being thrown into the fire! My inlaws gave us the tickets to be fair  we would have been so stupid and payed for it ourselves... so... there you go We FINANCED further abominations like this! Whatever happened to good decent filmmaking? This was a terrible overthetop soulless WAR MOVIE!!! It feels as numb and unemotional as a general anesthetic. There were maincharacters dying? Oh true... well who cares? Remember anyone the death scene of Sean Bean in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING yes he always dies  but he died really well in that one Oh or who the F cares about some CGIMegaOrc fighting a dwarf on ice Flash Gordon Style? And also Did he touch the ground of that frozen lake before he jumped back to ruin some more or less decent CGIDeathScene?  or did he do the Legolas I don't care about gravity thing? Questions above questions  yet now answers! I'd like to ask Peter Jackson what the hell happened! Was he forced with a gun to his head to make this? Or did he just direct it from a smartphone while sitting on his couch at home and counting his money? Yes I'm aware that the TRUE EVIL the true Morgoths are the Studios and the endlessly greedy film industry! If young people like Playstation graphics and action shakycam and beep 3D  let them have it! Who cares about nice cinematography when the highest grossing movie are made in absurdlooking 3D and with completely overthetop everything! In the last 14 years since the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING came out I was telling my nerdy friends and everybody else how amazing the Lord of the Rings movies are how muche love and effort went into them.I was amazed about the fact that Peter Jackson said NO to too much CGI that he used real sets models amazingly detailed costumes and beautiful cinematography.ALL of that went down the drain with this one... this boring crappy looking CGIdisaster this Mexican Standoff in Middle Earth.What was the story again? Some greedy dwarf does not want to come out of his cave  and suddenly all kinds of armies show up... to fight each other in a ridiculous way...The last 10 minutes then felt like some different move... somehow like the original Trilogy... BECAUSE THERE WERE REAL LANDSCAPES.It felt like something really beautuful standing next to something really ugly. But this short moment of how to make a nice decent GOOD movie did not save and also not redeem this perversion of cinematic history! This could as well be titled WORLD OF WARCRAFT  THE MOVIE.Other titles Legolas Dwarfes CGIORCS and other stupid stuff in TO HELL WITH GRAVITY! Watching THE FELLOSHIP OF THE RING makes you believe in the good things in this world Friendsip beauty decency good filmmaking... everything that is right and just and good. Everything a guy like Aragorn would put into an epic speech before a battle that mattered.The battlescenes of the CGICreatures did not matter. And having too many trolls with too many artificial limbs  or an Orcs with a Klingon BathlethProsthesis and I usually like STAR TREK references... maybe just not in a Middle Earth Movie I am not just disappinted. I am shocked by this mess. How can the SAME director that made the BEST TRILOGY EVER do this? Well the same question has been asked countless times about George Lucas.Good Job Peter  you killed filmmaking. I am also not sure if you are honest about promoting this disgusting gimmick called 3D or you just have to do it because the industry wants you to do so! Damn it  this is the time of bad movies gone too far the age of darkness... J.R.R. Tolkien could write some words of truth about this  but he's dead lucky him... so he does not have to bear what they did to his beautiful vision! This is the age of darkness indeed. The age of greed! I tend to believe that it is not completely Peter Jackson's fault  it is the perverted greedy filmindustry. They do not think in art or beauty or decency  they think and care only about profit! They exploit everything.The sad part is the people defending all that because the wrongly connect it to something that is good and beautiful. But the connection is wrong! Just because it has partly the same actors the same director and is supposed to play in the same universe as the good trilogy does not make it the same.George Lucas tried and failed in doing the same. Overkilling something with CGI and bad writing is not filmmaking  it's a shame! Personally I do the same here that I do with this terrible STAR WARS PREQUEL TRILOGY I never watch it again. I imagine the events of Bilbo's adventure with the dwarfes from the visual and artistic perspective of Ian Holm in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS  there could still be something great being made  but please by another director.Somebody young and hungry and talented. Some person like the Peter Jackson of the 1990s. Somebody who LOVES the sourcematerial and has a vision of it  but not a financial one! What also works  and it's totally for free Imagination. Having a good actor talking about something rather than showing it invokes a million times more beautiful images than cramming it down your throat with a CGI funnel! Anyway  whatever. This needed to be said! And somebody like RED LETTER MEDIA should really make a review similar to the STAR WARS PREQUEL reviews! May the Force be with you  Gandalf".

The director Jean Renoir is the son of the French Impressionist Painter Pierre Auguste Renoir  the cinematographer Claude Renoir is Jean's nephew  and the family talent shines throughout this film which is beautifully shot. Whether showing the amazing landscape of India and the river itself the colours and intricacies of the many Indian festivals or even a close up of Valerie's face as she gazes at Captain John every frame displays grace beauty and style that film rarely captures.The plot itself how a troubled outsider affects three teenaged girls is a simple tale and all the more powerful for it. We've all had a crush and know the river of emotions that are awakened by one. Each of the three girls the irrepressible and dramatic Valerie the talented but awkward Harriet and the stoic Melanie  who despite schooling in the West is somehow more Indian in nature than her friends who've been brought up in India  vie for Captain John's affections in their own way.However the real love of this film is India itself  it's fascinating people beliefs festivals and the constant River that runs through them all. It's a slow paced film not in a hurry to get to any kind of conclusion and you are immersed in the country and what it's like to live there. Like relaxing on one of the many river boats as its floats gently downstream the film meanders along showing us different scenes along the way from the local postman's route to the house gates to the son's fascination with Cobras with the story always moving on though always interwoven with more day to day life. This brings a familiar reality to the film it doesn't just skip moments that might not immediately concern the main characters  like life other events happen and they have their place in this film too.Actually getting to watch this film will be hard it's not well known  and not even considered one of Renoir's best  but if you ever come home one night flick on the TV and see this starting then get comfortable and enjoy a lovingly made film about a country and the people both native and foreigners who live there.".

You will learn nothing of Indian politics the exoticism will drive you mad and you'd do better to go back and reread Said's Orientalism as Gabridl suggests.Renoir went to India and made a film from the perspective of an entranced outsider looking in creating his own personalized world  not India but Renoir's world where everything is transitory including beauty and death and where every sight and sound becomes that much more precious.I am glad that we have come so far since I've been a kid when so many ideas and prejudices carried over from the colonial era were still floating through the air and it's true that no one except that most naive among us would make a film like THE RIVER today. But Renoir was alive in 1950 not now and he made his film for his time and that time attaches itself to the film just like it does to every artwork. I doubt that even Gabridl would suggest that it was the work of a craven exploiter of the masses and that its faults are not the faults of a corrupt man but of a generous and compassionate one. It's one of the most generous films I know of.Finally I would add that while this is a film made by a westerner for other westerners it was certainly inspirational to Satyajit Ray who worked as Renoir's assistant.".

	schema:headline " A great film";
	schema:reviewBody "After a family tragedy an adolescent girl blurts out angrily at the dinner table We just go on as if nothing has happened. No her mother responds we just go on. The River Jean Renoir's first color film is about going on  the ebb and flow of life that mirrors the path of the sacred river Ganges that flows nearby. Filmed on location in India The River is a sumptuously beautiful film that was called by Martin Scorsese one of the two most beautiful color films ever made and one of his most formative movie experiences. The film has been brought to life magnificently in a new Criterion DVD that contains an introduction by Jean Renoir an interview with Scorsese and a biography of author Rumer Godden who grew up in India and whose work formed the basis for Powell and Pressburger's Black Narcissus 1947.Set in India at the time of independence its themes are universal the feeling of being an outsider of running away from unpleasant situations and the hopelessly romantic stirring of adolescent love. While the film reflects the point of view of a British colonial family it is respectful of the surrounding culture and pays homage to Hindu and Buddhist traditions through stories documentary footage and dance sequences. Harriet Patricia Walters is the adult narrator who looks back on her days as an adolescent. About thirteen in the film she lives with her four sisters and brother Bogey in a colonial house in India that looks out upon the Ganges. Renoir's camera captures the energy and rhythm of life on the river its peddlers ships markets people coming and going the crowds everything in constant motion juxtaposed with the timeless tranquility of the river.Harriet's father Esmond Knight who lost an eye during the war runs a jute manufacturing plant while his pregnant wife Nora Swinburne takes care of the house assisted by governess Nan Suprova Mukerjee. When a young American named Captain John Thomas E. Breen comes to visit his cousin Mr. John Arthur Shields after losing his leg in the war his dreams of being left alone are short lived. Harriet becomes infatuated with Captain John but has to contend with two other female admirers her older friend Valerie Adrienne Corri a flaming redhead and Mr. John's daughter Melanie Radha Shri Ram a young woman of mixed ethnicity who was born in India but reared in a British boarding school. The arrival of Captain John brings a clear signal that the girls must face the end of what has been an idyllic childhood.All feel like outsiders Melanie is caught between two cultures and questions whether she will ever fit into either Harriet expresses her adolescent longings in idealistic poetry Valerie is overwhelmed by her innocent desires and Captain John is a deeply troubled man who only wants to live a normal life. Although the acting can be a bit wooden especially during peak dramatic moments it does not detract from the film's authenticity. The River is definitely of its time and its attitudes towards women are dated yet it is a work that transcends time and place to capture universal emotions.

	onyx:emotionText "After a family tragedy an adolescent girl blurts out angrily at the dinner table We just go on as if nothing has happened. No her mother responds we just go on. The River Jean Renoir's first color film is about going on  the ebb and flow of life that mirrors the path of the sacred river Ganges that flows nearby. Filmed on location in India The River is a sumptuously beautiful film that was called by Martin Scorsese one of the two most beautiful color films ever made and one of his most formative movie experiences. The film has been brought to life magnificently in a new Criterion DVD that contains an introduction by Jean Renoir an interview with Scorsese and a biography of author Rumer Godden who grew up in India and whose work formed the basis for Powell and Pressburger's Black Narcissus 1947.Set in India at the time of independence its themes are universal the feeling of being an outsider of running away from unpleasant situations and the hopelessly romantic stirring of adolescent love. While the film reflects the point of view of a British colonial family it is respectful of the surrounding culture and pays homage to Hindu and Buddhist traditions through stories documentary footage and dance sequences. Harriet Patricia Walters is the adult narrator who looks back on her days as an adolescent. About thirteen in the film she lives with her four sisters and brother Bogey in a colonial house in India that looks out upon the Ganges. Renoir's camera captures the energy and rhythm of life on the river its peddlers ships markets people coming and going the crowds everything in constant motion juxtaposed with the timeless tranquility of the river.Harriet's father Esmond Knight who lost an eye during the war runs a jute manufacturing plant while his pregnant wife Nora Swinburne takes care of the house assisted by governess Nan Suprova Mukerjee. When a young American named Captain John Thomas E. Breen comes to visit his cousin Mr. John Arthur Shields after losing his leg in the war his dreams of being left alone are short lived. Harriet becomes infatuated with Captain John but has to contend with two other female admirers her older friend Valerie Adrienne Corri a flaming redhead and Mr. John's daughter Melanie Radha Shri Ram a young woman of mixed ethnicity who was born in India but reared in a British boarding school. The arrival of Captain John brings a clear signal that the girls must face the end of what has been an idyllic childhood.All feel like outsiders Melanie is caught between two cultures and questions whether she will ever fit into either Harriet expresses her adolescent longings in idealistic poetry Valerie is overwhelmed by her innocent desires and Captain John is a deeply troubled man who only wants to live a normal life. Although the acting can be a bit wooden especially during peak dramatic moments it does not detract from the film's authenticity. The River is definitely of its time and its attitudes towards women are dated yet it is a work that transcends time and place to capture universal emotions. It is a great film that can be relished over and over again with increasing appreciation.";

	schema:reviewBody "I believe that both Karina and Gabridl are slightly off when they say that the film is supposed to depict postindependence India. I don't believe this is true and therefore Renoir cannot be taken to task for not covering India's independence struggles. Although the film was made postindependence 1951 it does not cover the period of independence itself late 1930s to actual independence in 1947. Remember that the film is a memory film and is based on the autobiography of Rumer Godden who was born in 1907. The adult narrator is a grownup Harriet. A grownup Harriet in 1951 would be speaking of an earlier timeprobably sometime in the 1920sthat was a more peaceful time for the English colonial inhabitants. The clothing and hairstyles can't be used to indicate when the film takes place. Harriet's blue sack of a dress would have been worn by any 13 yearold girl from the 1920 through the 1940s. And Valerie's rather unkempt and flowing hair could be anytime too.As for Melanie having an Indian accent. I don't believe that it was ever said that Melanie was educated in England. I believe that the film says she was educated in a convent and there were certainly convent schools in India in the 1920s. I find it interesting that when it is said that Melanie will probably marry Anil an understanding that they have had since childhood she is still wearing her convent uniform. When she develops a crush on Captain John she starts to wear saris maybe hoping to attract him through the exotic.All in all a beautiful lyrical film that should not be missed.".

Thus this film has an unjustly high rating. I only rated it as high as I did because of the stunning visuals but the fact of the matter is even a master like Renoir can produce a dud. He's not the only one Hitchcock directed Under Capricorn Faulkner penned Mosquitoes and Gary Oldman allows himself to be used in countless terrible movies  as Vonnegut says So it goes.

Thus this film has an unjustly high rating. I only rated it as high as I did because of the stunning visuals but the fact of the matter is even a master like Renoir can produce a dud. He's not the only one Hitchcock directed Under Capricorn Faulkner penned Mosquitoes and Gary Oldman allows himself to be used in countless terrible movies  as Vonnegut says So it goes. The sad fact is that this film falls flat on glorious Technicolor face. The acting is wooden to the point of being nonexistent and the screenplay is horrible to the point of being cacophonous.

The theme of life destruction and rebirth is neatly illustrated in the Hindu rituals and mirrored in the tribulations of a rather theatrically played English colonial family whose teenagers lose innocence and in the case of one actual innocent a life. The film ends beautifully with a glorious Indian spring and a new birth in the colonial family. All well and good but for the Edwardian almost Victorian sentimentalising of childhood innocence.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw a promo for this film on TCM was intrigued looked it up here saw tons of glowing 9 and 10star reviews and set the DVR expecting that I'd soon be watching a masterpiece.Well the location is exotic the technicolor is gorgeous some of the cinematography is very nice although a bit static and the depiction of Indian holidays and customs is interesting but this is really just a very simple comingofage story. All the usual teenangsty stuff is here the infatuation of the 3 girls with the mysterious stranger Harriet's feeling like an uglyduckling next to her more attractive friends Melanie's struggle with her mixed ethnicity Valerie's desire to test the power of her sexuality and her apprehensiveness of the consequences. I don't think it's particularly deep despite all the riveraslife stuff and I suspect that it might not be as highlyregarded as it is if it had been directed by someone other than Jean Renoir. That said I do like the film I just don't think it's a masterpiece.There seems to be some confusion as to the setting of the film. I'm no expert on India but I don't think it's set during or after Independence as some have suggested. The movie is based on Rumer Godden's memoirs and she was born in 1907 stayed in India during WWI was sent to school in England in 1920 and didn't return until she was 18. The film is somewhat timeless due to the absence of popular music or trendy fashions that would tie it to a particular decade but there are some clues. Melanie returns from boarding school in a horsedrawn carriage Harriet's family plays records on a windup gramophone etc.As to the comments that the film is somehow offensive or lacking for not depicting the poverty of the natives or the politics of the time... Please! It's the story of a few months in the lives of three teenage girls not a documentary or a portrait of India. Is Grease offensive because it takes place in the U.S. during the 1950s and it doesn't address the civil rights movement?Reviews and message board comments suggest that this is a film that most people either love or hate. Obviously it will not appeal to those who only go to blockbuster films full of superheroes andor explosions or who have limited attention spans. I've read lots of negativity here about the performances and even appearances of some of the actors. The only performance that's problematic for me is that of Radha who plays Melanie. I get that the character is more enigmatic than the other girls and doesn't wear her angst on her sleeve but her monotone delivery and habit of staring straight ahead come across as expressionless. I think Patricia Walters gives a great performance for someone who never acted before. As far as looks go early on Harriet describes herself as an uglyduckling determined to be a swan. She's not supposed to be ravishing it wouldn't work if she were. Captain John is no model but he's not hideous either. NarratorHarriet explains that visitors from abroad were usually old and married so the arrival of any young single man would've been exciting. He had the added cachet of being a war hero and an American. Call me crazy but Harriet seems to undergo a sort of metamorphosis during the scene on the boat with Captain John. I don't know if it's the lighting and camera angles or the fact that she's smiling more than usual and looking happy and content but from the moment she tells him that Victoria had said something similar to his comment about being born until they leave the boat she suddenly looks quite pretty. It seems symbolic as if his saying that she wasn't the type of person to lay down and die that she could begin again and that one of her poems might still be alive 2070 years in the future gave her a new confidence that was manifested in her appearance. Not quite a masterpiece but enjoyable.".

The story takes place in Bengal India a teenage girl named Harriet Walters is the eldest child of a middleclass British family living near the riverbank of Ganges her father an oneeyed Knight runs a jute mill and her mother Swinburne is expecting a child no. 7. It is a carefree scenario growing up in the natural inculcation of an exotically profound Hindu culture while carrying on an genteel upbringing sometimes it conspires to be a false or at least parochial impression of the land and its people which doesn't take up too much space in the storyline the only native Indian who has a speaking part is Nan Mukerjee the family's convivial but gossipy nanny and the rest sustains as an ethnic curiosity to meet the Westerners' eyes although beguilingly and entrancingly so after all what we are allowed to watch is the smugly colonial tip of the Indian iceberg. The plot revolves around Harriet's budding affection towards the guest of their neighbor Mr. John Shields an onelegged American Captain John Breen who takes his time in lolling on a foreign land to find some peace with his battlefield past and physical disability look for a new resolution for life. As John is the only eligible white young man on the market to her chagrin a besotted but fairly plainlooking Harriet has a losing game against her rival the maturer and more zaftig Valerie Corri by the way a British girl too is also her best friend. And throughout this picturesque film it is Harriet's voiceover that guides viewers traversing her prepubescent triviality poems indeed to listen to her inner voice to sympathize her unrequited love to find empathy in this gardenvariety tale. Wielded as an emotional clincher a tragic incident materializes as one downside of having a brood of many caused by adult negligence but here also emanates a disquieting undertow to pinpoint the virulence of a foreign society with a local boy standing by as an unwary abetter. And a cheesy solution to get it over is taking the proprocreation flag babies are being borne all the time.The cast is mixed with adult professionals and amateur players but comes off barely adequate a major gripe is the narrative ellipsis in the story of Melanie Radha the mixedrace daughter of Mr. John who stands out there is not much competition though with a massively pleasurable Ganeshacourting dancing sequence but whose dislike of herself waffling identity never been considerably mapped out as a preeminent counterpoint of Harriet's more orthodox background.So all above sounds like a pejorative critique against a film who has earned a hallowed reputation since its genesis yet it is as plain as the nose on one's face the picture's eyecatching glamour and aural accompaniments are undeniably supreme technologically speaking. And it is smart enough for Mr. Renoir to treat it as a philosophical prose other than a heady narration of banal proceedings only a 60oddyear later its allure fades away slightly due to the original novel's awkward stance on a colonized land and Renoir's condoning deference.".

As such we see no images of poverty and exploitation. In fact we rarely get to know the Natives as individuals especially as the story line is centered around British and American characters. Yet still the film is worthwhile to see as it provides a fascinating glimpse into India of its people superstitions religion and way of life. The film has one major flaw hindering a 10 star review and that is lack of character development. Under Bergman this film could have been a masterpiece. Sadly the characters never seem to emerge into truly 3D individuals preventing us from understanding what they feel and feeling what they feel. Character development needs time and I have little doubt that Renoir was restricted by time constraints imposed by Hollywood. Nevertheless a film worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm at a loss frankly to understand why people rave about this film. I saw it this evening and was aching for it to end.The picture seems to alternate between being a Cooks Tour Indian travelogue and a tedious domestic drama in the worst of the British Raj tradition. The white people are all very serious and say things that I think are supposed to be profound but for the most part simply sound ludicrous. There's actually one motherdaughter scene where daughter is told that the pain of childbirth is nothing compared to the joy of making a child for the husband you love. I expect that the close your eyes and think of England line ended up on the cutting room floor. The tedious story is aggravated by some of the worst acting you're likely to have the chance to see in a single two hour sitting and an endless voiceover narration that seems to substitute for actual filmic storytelling. Plus there are a couple of unbelievable moments  like when the 1314? year old English girl is apparently free to wander about the town by herself. I'm not saying she wouldn't have been safe but I find it hard to believe she would be allowed to do that.But rest assured that all the Indians we see are seen only through the lens of how picturesque their impoverished lives are  especially when you're watching from the veranda of your big English house. Everyone seems to spend the day playing music or bathing in the river or preparing for a festival. How fun!!! I can only think that the supersaturated Technicolor was overwhelming to audiences in the 1950's and that people hadn't really seen anything about India before. To me today it comes across as a garbled mess  like a PowellPressburger film made on a 2.95 budget. Ugg.If you want to see some wonderful filmmaking about the real India of roughly the same period watch any or all of Satyajit Rey's amazing Apu trilogy Pather Panchali Aparajito Apur Sansar instead.".

Renoir a keen director with a keen political mind understood that the real juice of the struggle for Independence is in the everyday details observing the changes in that which seems unchanged. An original perspective would lead a good director away from the fires and the riots which we all know occurred and which are perhaps in their own way too horrible to be filmed. In other words if you want politically correct that is disrespectful representations of a tumultuous era watch Schindler's List. Watch Attenborough's Gandhi for that matter. The filmmakers of these films seem to believe you can capture the essence of horror by pretending to recreate it. I think it was Godard who said that a film about the camps would be impossible to make because you would have to starve the actors to the point of death. How can Spielberg's actors ever ever be able to act like they are suffering the physical and mental effects of institutionalized madness? To respect both the memory of those who perished and to respect those who have somehow survived we cannot be so arrogant to believe we have taken a glimpse into the experience because the guy who made a fake alien that fit our stereotypes did it.In similar vein for a director to behave so irresponsibly as to pretend he can capture the struggle for Independence by showing the riots is simply unwise and I would assume for someone who might have actually been a part of it a egregious misrepresentation.".

First many of the actors are obviously not professionals and occasionally their acting does seem a little amateurishthough it is be no means terrible. Second because the movie moves at such a slow and gentle pace some may also become bored very quickly. While I was not bored I was feeling a bit antsy and wish they had picked up the pace a bit.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of a few English families living on the banks of the Ganga in Bengal during the colonial era who are tasked by the British Raj to run the jute trade. This familiar setting invokes several clichs in our minds and Renoir sets about transcending each of them. To start with the narrator's father who supervises the jute trade is a gentle soul. He is not the typical penny pinching capitalist but someone who finds the never ending 'river' of human beings carrying jute from farm to factory fascinating. His interactions with locals both in and not in his employment show us how he believes in equality respect and coexistence. The family takes after him and his 'house full of women' has embraced a new culture with open arms without any fear of losing their own. The family celebrates Indian festivals mingles freely with the locals and experiences the great spiritual seduction that India is. The metaphor of the river as a symbol of the infiniteness of creation with its unending cycles of creation and destruction is exemplary. The family experiences the permanence of the river and contrasts the transitory nature of their existence with it. The pains and joys of life that are experienced uniquely by each one of the three women are so different and yet so similar! Some of us get a kiss on the lips others a kiss on the forehead and others remain with unrequited desires and confused emotions. And yet like the change of seasons we all bloom and flourish and we all perish in the end while the cycle of life goes on.So what should we do given this human condition that we've been subjected to? Like all great artists Renoir attempts to answer this most enigmatic and intriguing question. 'The River' proposes 'Consent'. It seems to whisper gently to our worried minds and torrid hearts to accept the ebb and tide of our existence to not quarrel to not revolt What we think of as revolts are really tiny quarrels when you look at our insignificance and the enormousness of creation. The message here is to accept to open our eyes and for the first time watch without resentment to observe and learn from nature. As we follow nature's course intently we might get bitten by a snake and die a swift death or a new insight will turn the course of our lives and push us in another unfamiliar direction.Sitting on the banks witnessing the course of the river and that of our existence Renoir tells us that all is not lost. That this journey however short or insignificant it might be contains the potential to experience limitless joy and beauty  the innocence of children the pleasure of creating new life the camaraderie of good friendship and above all love for another person no matter how flawed or imperfect they are.".

From there an odyssey begins for her with strongly impressive scenes of not only sexual passion.

Many stunning actors who appear to join Ellen without really helping her situation only dragging her deeper in confusion.

Well she came to Spain to look up an old boyfriend.... I don't want to give too much away. Claire's attempts to get to the airport run into obstacles...peculiar obstacles. In places the movie has the same frustrating feel to it as a dream in which one continually tries to do something but somehow nothing quite works out. There's a supporting cast with some big names in it but just keep your eyes on Ellen Barkin as those other characters come and go. There's an interesting use of mythology in the movie but I'm not entirely certain that it was deliberate. In places the pacing seems a bit slow but overall I think it's very watchable".

It looks as if the director trimmed out some of the original movie that might have helped fill in a gap or two here.Nonetheless it is an interesting film with good acting particularly with Ellen Barkin.

I highly recommend this movie despite the low rating of circa 5 out of ten that you see on the site here. Perhaps the key is to dispense with any expectations of what a movie should be fundamentally. If nothing else just revel in the music !! ...and the cute ladies...additional comments a year later I have to admit I must be somewhat obsessed with this project. Perhaps re MilesSpain.

If this is Lambert then she certainly must have some kind of special nose for creative intelligence.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of my favorites and I am often let down by other's opinions of it the most common criticisms I hear are pacing is too slow story is too hard to follow and not enough action.Check the cast list... it's not an action film. Claire Ellen Barkin is a highflying stunt celeb on the verge of her greatest stunt ever  a high dive from a plane into a volcano with a net that's on fire. The day before she gets word that her old teacherlover gabriel Byrne is about to get married. Appearantly there is unfinished business in that relationship and she goes to Mexico to see him one last time. Trouble starts from square one in this film although we the viewer are never given a clear idea of where exactly square one is. I have seen this film several times and it can be a very different story depending on your point of view.Without including a spoiler there is a never ending flow of symbols analogies and flashbacks or flash forwards that aren't very clearly labeled. So you can get lost very easily which is what seems to happen to our Heroine. The film seems to mediate on mortality passion spirituality and the afterlife.The title is siesta which as you know is a brief afternoon nap If you've ever had one you probably know that the dreams that come during those times can be quite vivid. This film tries to recreate that sensation and does so admirably capturing the wonder and the terror of dreams that can be too extreme with passion and selective reality. Perhaps the main problem with Siesta is that it is packaged as a thriller and the topic is indeed Psycosurreal thrilling at no real time is the plot explained and there is a deliberate nonlinear even circular time line to the film... kinda like I dunno a dream... like the kind you get in an afternoon siesta.The soundtrack is delivered masterfully by Miles Davis and is really worth hearing on it's own. Again the dreamlike theme is woven into the underscoring into several musical illusions and visions.If you want a good psychothriller with an arty touch I really recommend it.Some interesting production notes  I believe this may have been the film to spark the off camera relationship between Ellen Barkin and Gabriel Byrne. This cast is very similar to the cast for Gothic made just a little later and nowhere near as good but also very surreal. Alexi Sayle of the Young Ones makes an appearance in one of his few noncomic roles.Check it out!!".

It's not a fast moving film by any stretch but it does a commendable job of portraying the phantasmagoric experience of the protagonist played by Barkin. My strong suspicion is that people who have rated it poorly were wanting it to be a standard love story or follow a more traditional plot arc and that it certainly does not do. Just the cast of this film should indicate that it's not your run of the mill flick and every single member of the cast turns in a stunning performance even the visually stunning but actingchallenged Grace Jones. The production values are good and I really found the cinematography to be quite beautiful but it is Spain so that's not so surprising. Lastly the Miles Davis soundtrack is haunting poignant and beautiful. In my judgment you can tell a lot about a person's response to this film by how they responded to Lynch's Mulholland Drive. If you like one you'll like the other.".

Meanwhile the fighter Luke Wright has his life destroyed when he wins a fight against the will of the Russian Mafia and accidentally kills his opponent. The Russian mobsters kill his wife and the alcoholic Luke wanders on the streets and hostels with no objective in life. One day Han Jiao asks Mei to memorize a long number and soon the Russian Mafia abducts the girl from the Chinese mobs. She escapes from the mobsters and is chased by the Russians by the corrupt detectives from the NYPD and by the Triads. When Luke sees the girl fleeing from the Russian mobs in the subway he protects the girl and discovers that the number she had memorized is the combination of a safe where the Triads keep 30 million dollars.

There was something missing but how can I say no to Jason Statham in an action packed movie? I just can't. 'Safe' ended up being good. Not great just good. The beginning was a little slow but the way they told the story was a bit of bouncing back between Luke Wright Jason Statham and Mei Caroline Chan so it didn't really come out running but I guess I can't complain too much about it because it definitely picked up after. As I stated earlier how can I say no to Jason Statham in an action movie. The action was amazing. It's that kind of action where the audience is either clapping or yelling Ooooohhhh snap!!! followed by some laughing. The storyline was decent I mean it didn't really stand out and there are a few scenes where you can probably figure out what's going to happen but it got the job done. The acting was subpar once you take out Jason Statham and Catherine Chan Mei who I thought did a really good job for her first Hollywood movie. There were a few cheesy lines some epic quotes one of which I put in the subject title and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too when you hear it and some funny moments more than you usually expect from an action movie which wasn't so bad. 'Safe' is your typical Jason Statham action flick. I think it's fair to say we don't watch Jason Statham movies expecting Oscar nominations we watch his movies mainly because the action is phenomenal. If you want to watch a good action packed movie then 'Safe' is a safe bet this weekend. See what I did there?".

Yakin's previous directing efforts include 'REMEMBER THE TITANS' 'UPTOWN GIRLS' and 'FRESH' so a B action film starring Jason Statham is an interesting choice for the filmmaker. The story revolves around Statham playing an excagefighter who's made enemies with the Russian mob and corrupt NYC police department that comes to the aid of a young girl wanted by both. The movie is surprisingly unsentimental and a pretty hard hitting action film. Statham fans should be more than pleased.Statham plays Luke Wright a small time MMA fighter who fails to throw a fight and pisses off everyone who was betting against him including the Russian mob. The mobsters kill his wife and threaten him with the knowledge that he'll always be watched and anyone he befriends or even comes in to contact with will be killed. So he travels the streets of New York City alone depressed and ready to kill himself until he meets a young girl named Mei Catherine Chan in need of his help. Mei is an elevenyearold mathematical genius who was forced to work for the Triad and now holds the code to an important safe in her head. She's wanted by the Triad Russian Mafia and corrupt NYC cops. Luke takes it upon himself to help her and of course finds a new reason to live.The premise and adds could lead you to believe that this is another cheesy and sappy action star befriending kid film but Jason Statham fans can rejoice in the fact that he doesn't take that path. Statham is a much more respectable and high moraled movie tough guy than the likes of The Rock and Vin Diesel. At least thus far in his career he can't be labeled a sellout. This film is about as violent and brutal as any film Statham has done. Thanks in large part to Yakin's decent directing. The script could have used some work it's routine and lacking bite. The story of Statham befriending the little Chinease girl does still have some heart and emotion though but just the right amount. As far as Statham action films go this one is about average. Exactly what I expect from one no more and no less.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpyoutu.becqKPD4ZNLxM".

	schema:reviewBody "Mei Catherine Chan is a little genius when it comes to numbers. She can remember everything and calculate anything in her mind. That's why she's very valuable for the Chinese Triads who use her as a computer that can't be hacked or traced. One day she's asked to memorize a long number and drive to another place to learn a different one. But the Russian mob steps in and assaults her ride killing almost everyone. Mei can escape and this is when she meets Luke Wright Jason Statham. Former elite cop former small time MMA fighter on the run from the Russian mob who lost a bunch of money for betting against him in a match and killed his wife in revenge. The will to protect this little girl gives him a new will to live a drive to go on. And so they run away away from the Triads the mob and the corrupt NYPD trying to figure out why everyone wants either those numbers or her death.It's a bit of Mercury Puzzle and 16 Blocks. And despite my usual fears the story did not turn cheesy due to the kid. But the girl didn't turn into an unrealistic bad ass as well. Also they did not develop a forced deep relationship between Luke and Mei which would be unrealistic considering that the story doesn't go that long. The film is featuring fast paced action wrapped into a decent though not great story and is supported by good acting. Well at least good acting from the leading characters but the supporting ones weren't that bad as well so you don't have to suffer from it. So overall a quite enjoyable movie which I would recommend to fans of story driven action movies and especially to all Statham fans.Just for fun let's check the Statham clichs. Shirtless? Yep first time you see him in the movie. Carchase? Of course. And when Mei was a bit concerned about his driving style I was just waiting for a comeback from him that was like Don't worry kid I've been doing this for several movies now.".

	schema:headline " Safe Works";
	schema:reviewBody "Ironically the most frustrating aspect of Safe is reading the streaming subtitles for Russian and Chinese. Being that I speak neither I'm straining to absorb the detailed dialogue and narrative threads. Yes Director and Writer Boaz Yakin's story is far from complex but you forget that the words really don't matter here. Jason Statham is the badass with a big heart protecting a young Chinese girl prodigy played by Catherine Chan from the Russian mob and the Triad because she memorized a series of numbers that accesses dire information. Much of Safe is sheer brute force. Statham's signature strike to the bad guy's trachea punctuates this. Statham's fighting sequences are high impact and resonate with awesome speed and power.Curiously many critics slam Statham and Yakin for doing formulae and not stretching Statham's range. This is craftsmanlike formulae. Statham delivers the action we want to see on screen. The fight scenes in the Russian and Triad clubs are amazing. I particularly loved the scene where Statham's Luke meets Chan's Mei in the New York subway. Statham viciously disposes the Russian thugs after Mei with hooks kicks throws and joint shattering locks. He is the best martial arts action star right now. He always offsets his physical elegance and power with a gruff austere visage. I think he actually displays more of his humanity than in other movies. He tears as he surrenders himself to the men who murdered his wife and child. What makes Safe work is Statham and Chan's gentle bond.Chan is more than just the cute kid in peril. She makes Mei even smarter than she lets on. She is the math genius forced to memorize a series of numbers. In a quiet scene Mei tells Luke They are not random. Luke gets They're a code. Don't under estimate the enrollment of Statham as protector of Chan. Chan's Mei confesses to Luke I don't need another father. I need a friend. I loved when Luke tells Mei that she will be safe until my dying day.When we meet Luke Statham in the present and through a series of flashbacks he appears as a second rate cage fighter now homeless. He mistakenly floors a YouTube sensation nice touch by Yakin in a fight and puts him in the hospital. The Russian mob kills his wife and unborn child because he did not throw the match. A lot does not add up. Luke is a world class fighter. There is more to his pathology that the script should have shaded. It turns out Luke was one of the toughest cops in the city who had honor in a corrupt police force. More so his relationship with evil Chris Sarandon as Mayor Tremello hints at Luke's darker origins as Black Ops assassin. Luke's former partner now enemy Alex charismatic Anson Mount is the sellout who still works for the Mayor. Mei Chan is the innocent math prodigy brought over to the States to work for the Triads. Leader Han paternally evil James Hong has Mei memorize vital numbers not trusting computers and the like.At his lowest point Luke sees Mei in the subway and from his point of view Luke sees that she saves his life. He also realizes that Mei is being chased by members of the Russian mob that he knows all too well. Yakin is clumsy here in the narrative synchronicity. I buy it because I want to see Statham kick some ass. Really I was in with the touching chemistry of Statham and Chan. They have an understated love for each other. Mei who is beholding to Luke confesses We save each otherIn the great showdown of good and powerful evil I initially thought I was short changed. Then I realized heroes generate other heroes. There are many goofy things going on with Safe and they are forgiven. Safe gets that the hero always protects the one he or she loves. I really liked Safe.".

Now just because he is awesome  doesn't mean that the movies he is in are just like In The Name Of The King. Recently though his movies all seem to be the same kind of film and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Lots of action lots of cheese and some story that involves a rogue badass aka Statham. I say all that but anyone else in thisthose roles and the film wouldn't work. But anyway more on the film in a mo Statham plays against a little girl played by Catherine Chan who is awesome to say she is a child actress. Not much on the rest of the cast but mentions for James Hong's known for Kung Fu Panda Balls Of Glory mob boss and Robert John Burke's Captain Wolfe.Overview Like i mentioned earlier fans of movies like The Mechanic Blitz Crank or Transporter will probably keep on liking this. It's packed full of gun fights karatefist fights explosions car chases and Statham's signature grunting voice. The story itself is mixed. the whole thing with the girl i like. People do have photogenic memories and like James Hong says sending messages via computers is risky. So using the girl i get. The whole gangs fighting each other and corrupt cops is old news so all is right there. The one thing that troubled me was when the explained Statham's history. At one point he was just a cop then he's some kind of Bane like experiment didn't get that at all but other than that the film is very fast paced and wraps up nicely.The opening 10 minuets of this film i really liked. They managed to set the story up of the two leads by mirroring their plot's. The girl is in a car Statham is in a car they both go to sleepetc and i really enjoyed it. This movie doesn't really offer anything new to the action genre but neither does it fail.Recommend Statham fans yes everyone else meh.Overall 710 For more of my reviews head to httpwww.facebook.comnoelfilmreviews".

The situation of an old boss from the Chinese Triads that does not trust in computers but trusts in the ability of a young girl that has been abducted from her family is stupid. But the lead character Luke Wright is a complete mess the guy is a killer and elite agent that has his life completely destroyed when he feels sorrow for killing his opponent and irritates the Russian Mafia. Then he passively accepts the death of his wife by the Russian mobsters. But out of the blue he rekindles his personality to protect a stranger Chinese girl in the subway.

So it is when you walk into a Jason Statham movie. Before the film even begins you know there's going to be fighting and shooting car chases and slow motion action baddies being dispatched with cool oneliners and so on and so forth. It's pointless going in expecting anything else and just as pointless grumbling as you head for the exit about the plot being too derivative or the dialogue too cheesy or that it was all action and nothing else. Safe is a film which is pretty much described by its own title  it is indeed a totally safe action flick with every character situation and plot development as familiar as the back of your hand. Director Boaz Yakin makes no effort to disguise the clichs opting instead to concentrate on noisy spectacle in the Michael BayJerry Bruckheimer tradition. All good and well if that's the kind of thing that floats your boat.The story rather resembles movies like Man On Fire and Mercury Rising in the sense that it features a gifted child being hunted by villains with help coming from a lone protector who happens to be pretty impossible to kill. This time it's a young Chinese girl named Mei Catherine Chan a mathematical genius taken from her ill mother and sent to America to work as a counter for the Triads in New York. Mei is given a seemingly random list of numbers to memorise but suddenly becomes the target of the Russian Mafia and a team of corrupt cops. It transpires that the numbers contain a code which will unlock a safe containing 30 million and there are plenty willing to kill to get to the fortune. Mei goes on the run pursued by enemies from all sides who want the information she alone carries. Enter downandout bum Luke Wright Jason Staham formerly a cop more recently a cage fighter whose life has descended into suicidal depths of depression after the murder of his wife. On the verge of putting an end to his misery once and for all Luke is offered a chance of redemption when he saves Mei from her pursuers. Suddenly he's back in the game he knows best rampaging through the city with cops Russian mobsters and Chinese hit men hot on his trail.The opening twenty minutes or so are a real mess with some rushed nonchronological plot exposition and the briefest sketchingin of character. Things pick up once Mei and Luke team up to outwit the bad guys for it is here when Yakin gets to unleash his thunderous action. Noone will come away from the film thinking they've just witnessed something innovative and groundbreaking. Nor will anyone be writing letters of complaint to the Academy when they overlook these performances at the announcement of next year's Oscar nominations. Safe is what it is. a big dumb action movie for the boys with a killcount that Mei herself might have trouble keeping track of and sufficient mayhem to keep genre addicts happy. Efficient entertainment while it lasts but you'll have forgotten it by the next day.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the most fun I had at the theaters along with Haywire and The Hunger Games films that have thrilled me while at the same time giving me food for thought. Safe doesn't exactly fit the above criteria but what it does is deliver a wellwritten action thriller with twists and turns in the plot to get any interested viewer bang for their buck.Statham stars as Luke Wright a downonhisluck cage fighter who gets caught up in a dangerous situation that leaves him with no will to live any longer. At first he appears to want to give it all up but a chance encounter with girl with a secret gives him his second calling and he unwittingly becomes her guardian angel. But the two are entangled in a power struggle over the girl's gift. Thus the ride has begun.Boaz Yakim handles the action and script really well. it's only that some of the dialog that becomes contrived and forced but that doesn't slow down the film at all. The action scenes are however really impressive showing off Statham's mad skills as an action star and he's really good at being both formidable and vulnerable at the same time. With his steely stare and narrow eyes he's one mean man you don't want to mess with unless you value your very life. But it's newcomer Catherine Chan that really shines in her first ever featurefilm role. With a wide variety of emotions she is horribly confused and scared at what's unfolding before her very eyes. And Reggie Lee is simply good as the villainous lackey to an ever deliciously evil James Hong as crime boss Hang Jiao.But even with all that if the filmmakers stripped it of it's action film hijinks at it's core is a story of two complete strangers coming to each other's aid. Sadly the film never delivers more on the sentiment between the two characters's personal emotions. There are hints of a developing relationship but it's overshadowed by the action scenes which are impressive undermines the emotional aspect between Luke and Mei. The endingwhich I will not spoil leaves it open to the possibility of a sequel. I really wish to see a follow up to this film because the film has a really fascinating dynamic on which to build on.But despite all it's problems Safe is a good action thriller with twists that keep you guessing and action scenes that will marvel you.".

There are some nice supporting turns from the likes of DRAG ME TO HELL's Reggie Lee as the bad guys along with former leading man Robert John Burke DUST DEVIL nowadays unrecognisable thanks to the ageing progress.Of course SAFE will never win awards and those who don't get action films will give it the cold shoulder.

This Means War the action comedy starring Tom Hardy and Chris Pine will be there. Likely joining it will be Julia Roberts' misadventures in the dreadful Mirror Mirror. Both entries now have company via Jason Statham's new action flick Safe.Safe puts actor Jason Statham in familiar territory. He is protecting a young person while driving recklessly shooting punching and jumping his way through fast paced and carefully choreographed sequences intended on keeping the interest of 13yearold boys. Statham has protected young helpless persons before thanks to his Transporter franchise but here he scrapes the bottom of the barrel for the worst script and character he has ever played on the big screen.In Safe Statham plays Luke Wright a former cop who has been living on the streets since the Russian mob killed his wife after he failed to win a promotional UFCstyle fight. Wright's life is reaching its bottom point when he notices a young Asian girl being followed in a New York City subway station.We learned earlier that the young Asian named Mei Catherine Chan is a superwhiz with numbers that has been kidnapped by the Chinese mob and brought to America intent on having her memorize a sequence of numbers that lead to unknown treasures.When Luke Wright involves himself in her safety he becomes absorbed in a clich driven plot involving corrupt cops corrupt politicians the Chinese mob and the Russian mob. All have but one purpose to gain ownership of the young girl by any means possible and to use the numbers she has memorized to open two safes containing both money and information valuable beyond comprehension.While all four of the politicians police and two mobs collapse upon Wright and Wei's whereabouts our packed theatre of nine paying patrons watched as they shouted shot and ran amok through the city in a blended mess that comes courtesy of writerdirector Boaz Yakin Remember the Titans.There is so much wrong with Safe that it is hard to get ones head around the convoluted disaster in an attempt to explain in words how to warn other interested parties. Statham is usually consistent but even he cannot save such an atrocity as this. His action sequences are many but they are boring and uninspired and l felt the need to shut my eyes and grab a quick nap rather than watch him continue to take on 56 heavily armed men at one time and get away unscathed.Assisting Statham in this bad smelling piece of fromage is the supporting cast. None of the many characters thrust on screen are well developed and the only one that does have any relevance Mei is portrayed by a young girl who can't seem to act her way out of a wet fortune cookie. Usually we are relaxed when it comes to criticizing youth and their attempts in their big screen debuts. But Catherine Chan is terrible as a central character and her bad acting is the largest fly feasting on this pile of sht.To be fair  okay to be somewhat fair  some of the dialogue expected of Chan was beyond eyerolling. She has to take direction in how to express such painful lines as You're a crazy man yet not that stupid while Statham tries to catch a breath between bone breaking.Snores could be heard in our almost vacant theatre and they were loud enough to drown out my own. There isn't many films that I can truly advise to stay away from but it's safe to say that Safe is one of them.www.killerreviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Jason Statham goes all out in his latest action packed movie Safe. If you like Statham's other adrenaline pumping movie you will love this one. As for those who criticize him for his lack of acting may be surprised by this one.Last time I saw Statham on the big screen was for Killer Elite and I remember walking out incredibly disappointed. At this point I had come to terms not to expect anything but action fun from Statham's movies and I love them for that reason. But Killer Elite even bothered me as being nothing special. So I walked into Safe with moderate expectations and it blew me away. If you have read my previous reviews you know I like comparing films that are similar so I would have to say this combine elements of James Foley's The Corrupter rivaling gangs and corruption and Harold Becker's Mercury Rising lone cop protecting adolescent with secret information.Safe follows a former gun for hire Luke Wright Statham living as a lone homeless man following a runin with the Russian mafia and is on the verge of suicide until he rescues a 12 year old Chinese girl Mei Catherine Chan on the run from two feuding gangs because she holds the code they desperately need. However the code goes much deeper than just the rivaling Russian and Chinese gangs and into the corruption of New York City's finest.After the last couple Statham flicks I knew he was due for a good one. Not only does he kick some serious badguy butt in Safe but he actually acts a little bit! There is one scene of a flashback explaining Wright's past with the Russian mafia that showcased some very impressive acting on the behalf of Statham really cool to finally see it. Catherine Chan was excellent as Mei she played the perfect damsel in distress without being annoying or plain. I don't know where to begin with the villains. There were so many! James Hong as the Chinese gang leader was effective creepy and intimidating Reggie Lee added unpredictability to his desperate character as Mei's father and Robert John Burke was just awesome as the corrupt Captain Wolf.Safe definitely revived my faith that Jason Statham could still pick great action movies. The complex story line and series of events made this a very fun ride for action audiences. I give it a 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nothing wrong with some dumb action movies but this was one I just couldn't ever really get into or liked watching.It's being a very typical genre flick that perhaps is only good to watch late at night on a Saturday evening or something like that. It's not bad and it's indeed still entertaining enough but at the same time I just can't call it a very good movie.Perhaps it's true that I have seen too many movies like this one already but it was disappointing for me that this movie didn't ever played out as anything fresh or surprising. Besides I had a hard time getting into this movie or feel involved with any of its characters and actions. This is probably due to it that the movie is being a very simplistic one with its story. The good news about this is that it's also being a very straightforward genre movie with plenty of action to enjoy in it.This isn't really the case for the first half of the movie though which is needlessly slow and overlong. The movie definitely got better to watch in its second half when its action kicked in. No doubt that the first half was meant to get us more involved with its characters and get to known them as well but the movie so easily also could had done this as the movie progressed with plenty of action going on at the same time. There was no need for the movie really to take such a long time to establish and setup things.Another thing that I didn't really liked about this movie was how absurd its story could get at times. I mean the thing with the story is that almost literally everybody is a bad guy in it. The Russians the Chinese the cops. It's just a bit too much all and doesn't ever really work out as anything convincing or entertaining enough.It's also true that Jason Statham is simply being Jason Statham again in this movie. He too often plays the same sort of character now days which is really disappointing since I actually quite like him as an actor and believe he has plenty of charisma and range in him as well.The action still saves this movie from being a total disaster. It's being brought very lively to the screen by some great camerawork and nimble editing. It's watchable enough all but definitely nothing I can consider to be recommendable.510 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It's not bad and it's indeed still entertaining enough but at the same time I just can't call it a very good movie.Perhaps it's true that I have seen too many movies like this one already but it was disappointing for me that this movie didn't ever played out as anything fresh or surprising. Besides I had a hard time getting into this movie or feel involved with any of its characters and actions. This is probably due to it that the movie is being a very simplistic one with its story. The good news about this is that it's also being a very straightforward genre movie with plenty of action to enjoy in it.This isn't really the case for the first half of the movie though which is needlessly slow and overlong.

Also why does Statham look at the girl out of all the other people in the train station?

	schema:reviewBody "I decided to watch Safe after feeling a little bored with the big name classic action films and wanting something new.I was woefully underwhelmed by a lot of aspects to this movie.That said there are some good points that I'm going to start off making and eventually end on. Like a bad news sandwich. Statham was perfect in his role as Luke he brought the poorly written and developed character an edge that was borderline heroic in the surroundings of this poorly shot travesty.Which brings me to my first bad point the camerawork was nothing less than infuriating. I found myself genuinely angry in every single action sequence regardless of whether it were a hand to hand fight sequence a gun battle or a car chase. The shot flicks about more times than you can count and I found myself with absolutely no idea who was dead who was alive and who was punching who. I understand this is to attempt to create a heightened sense of involvement but it makes them nigh impossible to understand. This is perfectly displayed during the gun battle prior to Statham opening the safe. Every time I saw someone get hit I had no idea who it was. The point where there were breaks in the action I was consciously checking how many of the cops were remaining. I should know at any point in the sequence how many of them are left or there's no tension and I ultimately don't care about what's happening on screen.I could continue but I'll move on.There were various plot points that made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. I'll use the aforementioned gun battle as an example to keep spoilers down. The fight itself is moronic these top police names basically walk into a den of some kind I think it was a casino but at this late stage I was basically in a coma and shoot the place up then walk off with a fat bag of money. Not one of them stops and says hang on what if someone asks us what are in these large suspicious bags we're carrying what if they ask us why we conducted a raid unauthorized with no backup whatsoever as 5 of the top cops in the NYPD and 1 ex cop who should be jailed for firearms offenses. As I say this is just one of many examples I could make but once again I'll cut myself short for the sake of some last hope towards brevity.I didn't care about any of the characters. The girl isn't on screen enough to make me care about her and she mostly comes across as a rude arrogant and unintelligible know it all due to speaking mandarin half the time and generally just being a prick to people holding a gun in her face. Statham as much as he performed well was written as the rogue with the heart of gold by someone hemorrhaging from the brain apparently. The only time this comes across is his inexplicable and borderline paedophilic longing to save an 11 year old girl who he essentially uses for his own means throughout the film. He barely shows any emotion for the loss of his wife and he is almost endlessly killing men and women who shoot at him throughout the film without any show of remorse for the removal of human life he perpetually conducts.I am genuinely struggling to think of a second good point to end on. I was going to say that the film will most likely entertain the majority of the people who watch it. However that's not true because the action sequences the only thing that could save this film are far too vague and unwatchable to entertain the majority of action lovers I myself enjoy watching martial arts be it choreographed or not a great deal. Coupled with the acting essentially being none existent due to the large amount of screen time these tour de forces in bad cinematography eat away and you have a very very boring film.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Safe";
	schema:reviewBody "Safe lived up to its namesake for an action thriller playing it safe with Jason Statham in a lead role of a character that he can probably sleepwalk through. Written and directed by Boaz Yakin Safe has all the ingredients that will fit right into any Europa Corp mould and in some ways even as a hardcore Statham fan I found his character of Luke Wright being a little too generic and showcasing little of what we already know of what Statham can deliver.The opening of the film will disorientate even with the best of intentions to mirror and parallel its two primary characters of Wright and the little Chinese girl Mei Catherine Chan whose superb mathematical intellect and photographic memory got sought after by gangsters with operations both in China and USA. Blackmailed with her mom's safety Mei reluctantly lends her talent to the Chinese mob in New York becoming the quintessential bookkeeper without the books storing every fact and running figure in her brain. As a reward she is given the task of memorizing a series of boring numbers that points to a mystery of a combination which forms the crux of the film given everyone's after her from the cops the Chinese mob the Russian mafia to shady politicians. She runs.Wright on the other hand is that superhero that Jason Statham plays with aplomb from his days of The Transporter already having some experience in protecting Chinese lasses. His backstory's like a phone directory that Yakin slowly unravels that tells of more behind this one time cop with special skills tying it with guilt complex and desperation in seeking redemption through underground fight rings only for his one time fight back to kill off an opponent to whom he was supposed to throw a fight to. The Russian mob gets angry and carries out their vow to make him the loneliest man on Earth. He runs.But running can only bring you so far and the time comes when the narrative puts these two runners together. Wright senses something amiss when he chances upon Mei for the first time and becomes her defacto protector finding an opportunity to take some proactive action against all the stakeholders together in one fall swoop. In fact this scheming interspersed with rather rote action sequences from car chases gun play and fist fights makes Safe a little more interesting than your average action thriller. Yakin sets up the components where distinct interests of each faction becomes commodity that's traded with corrupt cops within NYPD and to see each of them taken down by Wright using his brains is more satisfying than those taken out by brawn.Credit though to the story for not lingering around monologues longer than it should with deliverance given without remorse and in very standard badguysgettheirjustdesserts fashion without too much fuss. Sometimes too efficiently that Statham for all his martial arts ability doesn't quite get anything to do to flex his muscles. There are only a handful of scenes where he does get to punch up some goons but the climax set up to expect some serious brawling turned out to be the most anticlimatic finale fights ever put on screen though it knocked some logic into its rather illogical set up. Still for Statham fans his charismatic presence alone will make you root for his down and out character as he becomes the Transporter sans flashy car one more time with human baggage in tow to protect.The highlight in Safe though belongs to James Hong as the primary Chinese villain Han Jiao the godfather of all rackets in Chinatown. Genre fans would recognize him instantly from his Lao Ban days in John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China and it's good to see that despite going without heavy makeup seen in the mentioned film he's still very much sprightly and has this villainous charisma going for him even with limited screen time split between him and his enforcer type played by Reggie Lee. I for one would have loved if James Hong had some shared screen time with Jason Statham and a mano a mano of sorts would probably elevate this film to cult status.".

Directorwriter Boaz Yakin knows how to deliver highoctane action and his lead has perfected high kick and punches in his sleep. Like many on location shot films it makes everything more palatable and the Safe certainly has a budget. It's violent and bloody despite being packed with clichs corrupt cops Russian Mafia and Yakuza it's fresh enough to remain entertaining. Concept wise it is reminiscent of Mercy Rising 1998 but where as Willis' outing failed to deliver the Safe surpasses expectations being a bar above the average action flick. There's a Yojimbo A Fistful of Dollars and Last Man Standing play off against each crime syndicate but it all adds to the entertainment. Notable is the ever reliable James Hong and Anson Mount gives a menacing memorable performance as Alex. Chris Sarandon as the Mayor deserves a mention along with bent cop Captain Wolf played by Robert John Burke redeeming himself after Robocop 3. Although the relationship between the young girl Mei played adequately by Catherine Chan and Statham's Luke Wright isn't fully explored no doubt to avoid comparisons with Leon 1994 there's enough emotion to make you care for the characters.Statham is on form and overall the Safe is an engaging entertaining action film worthy of mention.".

As a lover of the TV series 24 this movie almost made me feel like I was watching Jack Bauer again. I thought that the acting was decent but with characters from so many different backgrounds it was probably difficult to cast a superb group. Lots of new faces in this film and also a lot of familiar faces.One thing that takes away from this film is the beginning of the movie. For the first 1015 minutes it's very hard to follow exactly what is going on. I thought the writers tried to hard to have a opening scene that caught your attention and they ended up putting too much stuff in that scene. Overall this is a very enjoyable action movie.

As a lover of the TV series 24 this movie almost made me feel like I was watching Jack Bauer again. I thought that the acting was decent but with characters from so many different backgrounds it was probably difficult to cast a superb group. Lots of new faces in this film and also a lot of familiar faces.One thing that takes away from this film is the beginning of the movie. For the first 1015 minutes it's very hard to follow exactly what is going on. I thought the writers tried to hard to have a opening scene that caught your attention and they ended up putting too much stuff in that scene. Overall this is a very enjoyable action movie.

Great chemistry great villains great action and awesome plot. It also gets a 10 because it unlike all of the other action movies I've looked forward to only to be disappointed with actually delivered much more than the trailers and ads promised. So my 10 isn't the sign of a cinematic masterpiece but it's a sign of enjoyment met expectations and those who enjoy vegging out and watching action movies of Statham's brand will probably agree.

Who were and what were the thoughts of Severino de Giovanni and Simn Radowitzky? Who was Rosigna? The movie begins showing the Ushuaia Tierra del Fuego prison where Radowitzky lived a lot of years after killing Ramn Falcn chief of the Federal Police who had killed a lot of workers during a manifestation. Then it goes to the arrival to Buenos Aires of thousands of Italians Spanish and Jewish immigrants the origin of half the population of Argentina and Uruguay between them the first anarchists and socialists of the River Plate. Nowadays can be curious to see that such idealists could attack a bank sometimes killing people and steal a lot of money only for editing books or pamphlets as their lives went on in a pathetic material poverty. It is interesting to see how was planned the escape of anarchists from Punta Carretas prison of Montevideo. One anarquist settled a coal shop in front of the prison and a tunnel was dug from there to prison. Some decades before there was a flight of Tupamaros prisoners in the same way. The anarchists were defeated by militar dictatorships and because the appearing of peronism in 1946 the creol working class had less contact with European political ideas. Di Giovanni was executed in prison Radowitzky after being put free fought in the Spanish Civil War Rosigna was put free in Uruguay but disappeared killed indeed. Perhaps there are few emphasis in the origin of their ideals and the difference between the pacifists and violent ways they employ for fighting. The testimony of anarchist writer Osvaldo Bayer a niece of Rosigna a former Tupamaro and old anarchists contribute to have a wider viewpoint.".

Mel is welcomed by her older sister Crystal Kristin Cavallari that tells her about an accident between a school bus and a train in 1957 due to a problem in a railroad crossing gate where all the children died. In the present days there is an urban legend telling that if you put the car in neutral in the same place the children will push the car and their fingerprints will be printed in the car bumper.

When they leave the party with two friends of Crystal they drive to the spot where the accident happened and Melanie sees a little girl. Later Mel befriends her and finds that her name is Julie Sydnee Harlan. When Melanie has visions and daydreams with the children and the accident her mother believes she is on drugs while Melanie tries to discover the truth about the fatal accident.Fingerprints has a promising beginning with a plot with huge potential and scenes that startle. However the terrible and messy resolution of the mystery is frustrating with many holes. The heroine her sister and her boyfriend are nice and empathic characters however the rest are totally unpleasant or uninteresting. What has triggered the insane killer after many years? How the killer has selected the victims? The attitudes of Melanie's abusive mother are not normal and irritate. What has happened to Penn's car that was parked side by side with Melanie's car when they arrive in the train station? The last scene with the police cars arriving is absurdly ridiculous and senseless since nobody called the police. My vote is six.Title Brazil Almas Condenadas Condemned Souls".

In this movie which is called  Fingerprints  several key aspects are definitely present. The story is that in a small town a dramatic and mysterious event took place which centered around the deaths of a dozen children. It seems a bus load of school children were killed when their vehicle was hit by a passing train. Years later Melanie Leah Pipes a returning resident arrives to finish high school learns this may not be true. Her parents worry about her as she is also a recovering drug addict who suffers from residual delusions. From the moment she starts school she becomes aware of her tenuous situation with her strict parents her insincere counselor and the reoccurring apparition of one of the dead children. The movie has the surprising addition of two Hollywood veterans Lou Diamond Phillips who plays Doug and Geoffrey Lewis playing old man Keeler. Unfortunately the film also contains several repetitive themes borrowed from 'The Sixth Sense' 'Scream' and 'Holloween' and further does not resolve some very tense and dramatic moments. As a result the movie is deemed acceptable though it tries very hard to become the corner stone of an anticipated sequel. ".

Later that night in party Mel set of off with her best Friends and her asshole boyfriends who end up on train tracks were the kids were killed This scene just liked the one in Final Destination where carter doesn't move the car But in this movie he dose move the car in time as Mel scream no as she see a little girl in front of the train. She run out of the car looking for the girl and see her ruining into the building and everyone else run after year and are stopped by older man telling them to leave this place.The next day she goes to the same place and leaves the car neutral and then car moves then she see little girl again and drop her off to her house.

The film builds a genuine sense of suspense and has enough scares to lift it above the usual low budget horror. This is in no small part due to a hugely likable and confident performance by the lead actress Leah Pipes. The limitations in budget do show in the special effects but if you put this aside it is a very effective and creepy horror film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love cheesy horror flicks. I love horror flicks in general and I seek them out like crazy. Thank goodness for Netflix who brought a whole host of these horror flicks into my life. There is nothing in the horror genre harder than trying to create something unique and original but still keep all the necessary components to the genre. The film does all this so I have to give it props. Certainly they don't use a large genre and they even have a character played by reality TV Star Kristin Cavallari who will most certainly make people roll their eyes and laugh but you know what? She does a darn good job. The cast all take their roles seriously and I think that's important too! The film has ghosts mystery terror and even a great twist to the entire thriller that keeps you watching moment by moment. Fingerprints is absolutely worth seeing and it isn't even because of cheesiness or being campy because the film actually pulls off a level of seriousness. The story and the cast especially the lead actress will lead you through the film at a perfect pace and really keep you riveted from beginning to end. If you love ghost stories this one is aces!! Leah Pipes is heading in the right director for her career. In the last ten years she has been fighting her way up the ladder and had some good roles and perhaps this doesn't seem like something that will get her noticed but she does a terrific job in her role leading the film! Her character is disturbed flawed and emotional. She has a real charisma on screen and as unlikely as their relationship seems she has good chemistry with Kristin Cavallari. Cavallari plays her sister who is the stereotypical party girl but her character really works. Her performance doesn't hold a candle to Pipes but she doesn't bring the cast down as one might expect. She does a decent job and she certainly plays the eye candy role properly. Josh Henderson is good as Pipes' love interest. This film is heavily reliant on the female characters so he is definitely a back seat character but he does his role decently and their chemistry is solid. Andrew Lawrence as the resident film bully is in the same boat. Back seat character not a big focus of the film but does okay in his role. In the poorest performance of the film is straight to video BMovie King who was an Oscar winner at one point Lou Diamond Phillips. He is some sort of creepy teacherrole model but his role just makes the film feel campy when he is on screen and I wish they had found a different actor entirely.Director Harry Basil is about as eclectic or eccentric as you can get. He's been involved in enough main stream films as producer and actor but his directing history are mostly unknown straight to video productions like this but there is no doubt he has control over telling a story. Seeing this film makes me want to see his other films because he tells a great story and the small town setting with the hidden secrets is done very very well. Brother writers Jason and Brian Cleveland are new to Hollywood but hopefully this proves they can tell a story even if it is in a genre that is known for being clich and predictable. If anything the twist and mystery to this story is anything but predictable which makes this more watchable than your average cheesy horror. If you want a good mystery something not too heavy and a little gem at the video store or on Netflix absolutely check this out because it doesn't disappoint. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I get that the conductor likes to torture and kill children and taught his daughter to do the same. But the villain kills older teens and an adult. These are not little kids. Is the killer targeting anyone who sits at the train tracks? Targeting anyone who snoops at the train station? Or just targeting anyone in the main character's life? At the end we find out the conductor's daughter is killing people because the towns folks lynched her father and are now trying to get her father's train station torn down. Wouldn't she be targeting the people who lynched her father or city officials in charge of the demolition? Why not attack little children like she was taught? Or at least the main character for asking too many questions. If she just happens to be a serial killer then she would have a victim profile... like all teens who visit the train tracks. How does the counselor fit into the picture? She never even met the guidance counselor as far as we know. The killer has no motive for killing these people. If it's just killing people that the main character knows then why not her mother and father god knows I was hoping her mother would get it. Or do they have to have visited the tracks first? It's confusing and isn't really made clear.Also at the end after the main character defeats the villain an entire troop of police cars 'just happen' to show up with sirens blazing. Why were they racing to the train tracks? No one had time or a cell phone to call for help. There were no gun shots to alert them to trouble. Possibly they are looking for the main character who has just fled the police station...however the police seem very polite and helpful saying how can I help you two ladies? Not exactly like police sent to arrest someone. Also the dead boyfriend's truck mysteriously disappears at the end...it was parked in front of her car just 15 minutes before.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fingerprints is one of the best ghostslashers around and is immensely enjoyable.SPOILERSReturning home from rehab Melanie Leah Pipes finds her sister Crystal Kristin Cavallari is the only one on her side as their parents are upset over her situation. When she takes her to a party with friends Penn Josh Henderson and Mitch Andrew Lawrence they tell her about a local legend in town involving a bus of children at a railroad crossing years ago and immediately begins thinking that the stories are true. When a series of accidents in town has he convinced even more about the stories she soon learns the horrifying truth about the incident that was covered up years ago and sets out to prove it correct to the doubting family and unsuspecting townsmembers.The Good News This had a whole lot of stuff worthwhile to like about it. One of the best features is that there's an incredibly strong story to it one that feels unique and creative while also being able to deliver the framework for a great horror story. The backstory involving the haunted crossing is great just the sort of thing you would find in a small town like that and the way it's ingrained into the film is perfectly handled from the growth of the myth to the different scenes where it's put into practice are just a lot of fun and really welldone. When it's done to be a part of the film such as the first two hauntings it's just absolutely brilliant and creates an incredibly eerie atmosphere. The first one where the friends stop to test it while an oncoming train approaches with them all frantically yelling to move and the ghosts appear to move it at the last second is frankly one of the single best scenes in the film. The second one where the technique is tried by a skeptic and transformed into a believer is great due to the appearance of the ghostly hands appearing on the windshield due to the dew from the environment is a great tactic that makes it creepy and chilling than it would've otherwise. Later ghostly visions including the spectacular freakout in her bedroom when the ghost first appears in the mirror and then beckons for help then showcasing a series of gruesome images to her from the hardly distinguishable to scenes of a mouth being sewn shut and decomposing body parts crawling with bugs and maggots as well as other frightening images that are done in just a few seconds time allowing for a genuine freakout that propels the story along even more making for an absolute blast of a scene. That there's another one done somewhat later still within the realms of plausibility in the film but done so as to urge along for more investigation following a string of deadends through the exact same tactics as before with the sewnshut mouth and maggotcovered body parts are just as effective as now they're shown as to be allowed a clearer vision and just makes them all the freakier. Aside from the creepiness there's also a somewhat fun and enjoyable actionpacked finale that has a lot going for it. With the appearance of a spectacularlooking killer an incredibly decrepit and worndown looking basement that makes for a great setting for the action and plenty of backandforth stalking on both ends are all wrapped up into a fantastic setpiece that is just really awesome. Mixed well with the brutality in the wounds and the dirty disgusting look of the place there is really nothing wrong with this sequence. The last plus here is the incredibly high bloodandgore quotient which is nice to have. There's a multitude of impalings with a metal pole a razor blade slicing up an ankle one is visibly shown to have their mouth sewn shut one has impaled horizontally through the neck and another is run over by a train among others in here making this one quite messy at times when it wanted to. These here are the good parts to it.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot to this one that didn't work at all. In fact the main problem to be had with this one was the frankly unbelievable family life that's portrayed here. From the very start it's hard to believe that a family life would be in this light. Instead of being welcoming and trying to help their daughter get past it having them constantly bellow at her for slight transgressions isn't that believable in a family and nothing at all is given as to why they act like that. It gives off the feel of just being included to add more drama to the film but it doesn't work that way at all and instead becomes irritating at times. Some of the early scenes don't make any sense either such as the trip to the party despite being out of rehab less than a week and the scenes showing them at school don't really serve much purpose but still the family life is the big one here that holds it down.The Final Verdict With a lot to love about this one and a minor flaw to hold it down this is one of the best entries out there in the genre. Really give this one a shot if you're into the killer ghost films or more modernday slashers or just the plain interested while those who aren't fans of the style should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Nudity some Language an unsuccessful rape attempt and underage drinking".

	schema:reviewBody "I was immediately put off by the opening titles which looked like something done on a cheap home computer. Shortly thereafter the film starts with a flashback to 1957 and yet the train shown heading towards the school bus is clearly modern  it could have been filmed without showing the actual design of the locomotive. And then the acting begins. The main character Melanie Leah Pipes is reunited with her father who acts like ... an actor selling himself as a doting father. But through all the early putoffs I watched the whole film. If this had a 1M budget much of the money must have gone to the most wellknown actors cos it just seemed like the film needed more money for better production. When you lose viewers' ability to believe in what you're showing it can be an uphill struggle to win back the audience. And it didn't need so much special effects but perhaps better cinematography and lighting. The little girl that Melanie routinely encounters could have been filmed with some kind of eerie lighting based on the fact that she's been dead not spoilers part of the film plot. Yet we're left guessing whether Melanie actually knows she IS dead in the first third of the movie. The story is simply hurt by some lessthangood filmmaking. The plot itself kept me curious enough to keep watching the next scene even after the death of one character whose acting made me roll my eyes. Melanie and her sister are better than most... their mother made me want to strangle her myself so she is effective as a rude mother  until she simply goes overboard with her actions later in the film.Yet for the film's underachievement it still has some moments in which my neck hair stood up. The screenwriter hurt a promising story just enough to call it average yet still watchable and entertaining enough and even though I actually didn't mind the core reasons why things happened I groaned at the very end of the film which made me want to throw buttered popcorn at my HDTV. I'm just glad I didn't have any at the time.".

The bus crash in the beginning is indeed horrific and the fact that the leading actress is back from rehab after od'ing from hard drugs was new for me. I'm guessing the fact that she was dead for a while should have had more meaning on the story think of Flatliners but she didn't seem the only one who got clues from the dead.The acting is not bad it's actually quite good. Some of the characters are annoying but the performances are pretty good if you consider the rest of the movie. Surprisingly by far the worst performance comes from Lou Diamond Phillips. Scenes with him alone are downright cringe worthy.The movie is a mixture of a ghost story and a slasher and it doesn't seem to know which one it eventually is. The slasher part doesn't work at least to me the victims seemed pretty random but I may not have been too sharp while watching. Also people didn't seem to care that their fellow students have gone missing or if teachers were getting slaughtered in their office. As a ghost story it's better but still does not deliver. It just lacks the logic of a well unfolding story and the twist in the end is not very memorable.There are lots of small goofs or other details that distracted me. Would anyone have his exwife named exwife on his cellphone for any other reason than for the audience to know the ex wife is calling? Also the very ending I don't know if you could call it an epilogue is somewhat out of tune with the rest of the movie.It's worth mentioning that this is the first horror movie I've seen to use a type face similar to comic sans in the opening credits!".

The one sentence in the guide about violencegore mentioned some impalings and that was about it. After viewing quite a few parent guides for horror movies at this site it seems that many of the contributors are either lazy or afraid of including spoilers or both. Well by its very nature a parents guide should be composed entirely of spoilers. I just read IMDb's 13point agreement for peerediting the parent's guides and it does NOT prohibit spoilers. Now most horror movie fans will not rule out a movie if it has impalings. On the other hand some will nix a flick if they know there's graphic violence against preteens. My own sister watches horror moviesmaybe even those with graphic violence against preteensbut I know FINGERPRINTS has a specific violent act repeated twiceonce WITH a preteenwhich violates one of her nailsonachalkboardtype taboos. So if you are curious to find out exactly WHAT this act is read the appropriate section of the parent's guide for this movie which I clarified. And if YOU edit an IMDb parent guide yourself do us all a favor please be detailed AND comprehensive.

I especially enjoyed Paul Lukas Lucile Watson rightfully nominated for an Oscar Bette Davis wrongfully not nominated George Coulouris and oddly Eric Roberts who plays the middle child. I really enjoyed his character an oddlooking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher. He just cracks me up. Even the characters name Bodo is funny. The ending in which Lukas's character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons worked for me as well. I agreed with why he felt he had to what he did and I understood why he couldn't quite explain it. The message this movie makes is a good and noble one the scenery meaning the house is beautiful and the acting is the excellent. Watch this movie if you ever get a chance.910".

The left wing in America as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism not only in Europe but in Japan as well.Watch on the Rhine was a play produced on Broadway eight months before the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese. In it Ms. Hellman was heralding America's entrance in World War II. The adaptation is credited to Ms. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett her long time companion. As directed for the screen by Herman Shumlin the film was well received when it premiered in 1943.We are introduced to the Muller family when the film opens. They are crossing the border to the United States from Mexico. They are to continue toward Mrs. Muller's home in Washington D.C. where her mother Fanny Farrelly is a minor celebrity hostess. The Mullers we realize are fleeing Europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact we thought in a way the Mullers could have been better justified if they were Jewish fleeing from a sure extermination.We find out that Mr. Muller has had a terrible time in his native land as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing Fascim. Little does he know that he is coming to his motherinlaw's house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy.The film offers excellent acting all around. It is a curiosity piece because of Bette Davis' supporting role. Paul Lukas repeating his Broadway role is quite convincing as Kurt Muller the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does a great job portraying Kurt Muller repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on Broadway.The other best performance is by Lucile Watson who plays Fanny Farrelly the matriarch of this family. Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as Marthe de Brancovis a guest of the Farrellys married to the contemptible Teck de Brancovis a Nazi sympathizer played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi Donald Woods and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by Mr. Shumlin.The film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule no matter where.".

Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler Eric Roberts as the youngest son Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar a Golden Globe and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lukas's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It's the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner a much lighter play than this one.Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe Davis Lukas and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.The fly in this ointment are some other house guests a friend of Davis's from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas's antifascist background. His suspicions are quite correct it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman's significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell Kurt Katch Clyde Fillmore Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count. He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943 but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other antifascist classic Casablanca. Though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern antifascist message that bears repeating infinitely.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca. Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of The Mortal Storm and Watch On The Rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point brought out with Casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science because they chose Paul Lukas instead for the Best Actor Oscar. It does not strike me as totally wrong. Lukas had a good career in film both here and in England  he is the villain in The Lady Vanishes and this performance was his best one. Bogart had more great performances in him than Rick Blaine for instance he was ignored for Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Roy Earle in High Sierra two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an Oscar for his greatest performances as Fred C. Dobbs in The Treasure Of Sierra Madres the writermurder suspect in In A Lonely Place and Captain Philip Francis Queeg in The Caine Mutiny afterward  he got it for Charley in The African Queen. I think that Bogie should have got it for the role of Dobbs but it did not happen. But Lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career. Few can claim that.To me the film to look at with Watch On The Rhine is based on another playscript by Hellman The Searching Wind. They both look at America's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s. The Searching Wind is really looking at the whole interwar period while Watch On The Rhine set in the years just proceeding our entry into World War II deals with a few weeks of time. Therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for it's impact. The film has many good performances led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined antiNazi fightercourier Davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to Lukas being the center of the play's activities Coulouris as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Coulouris' wiser and sadder and fed up wife and Kurt Katch who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassy's Gestapo chief about Coulouris and others who would deal with the Nazis. It has dialog with bite in it. And what it says is quite true. It also has moments of near poetry. Witness the scene towards the end when Coulouris is left alone with Lukas and Davis and says The New World has left the scene to the Old World. Hellman could write very well at times.Given the strength of the film script and performances I would rate this film highly among World War II films.".

It is impossible not to feel for Paul Lukas' character just as it is impossible not to feel for Paul Heinried's character in Casablanca made the same year and dealing with similar issues. But whereas the script in Casablanca one of that movie's many wonders makes real people of its characters the script in this movie fails miserably in that respect as in others.If you have never seen this movie watch it. But it could have been so much better with a better script.I watched this movie again tonight 9 years after I wrote my review above. In rereading that I find the tone is perhaps too harsh but I do not regret my condemnation of the movie's script. The characters are very noble indeed but they remain ideological figures rather than human beings. Perhaps the best illustration of that is seen by a comparison of Paul Luckas' Kurt with Victor Lazlo in Casablanca. Lazlo too is selfsacrificing and noble but he is allowed to be more human and therefore more sympathetic than Luckas' resistance fighter. The latter's final speech is very moving but he still seems a cold fish. There are also problems of construction. Martha and David are never really woven into the main story. Again the movie is worth watching. It must have been very powerful in 1943 when it was released and resistance fighters were desperately trying to counter a successful Hitler in Europe. But the characters are too twodimensional to make this a truly moving film".

An antiFascist a worker in the underground movement many times injured and wanted by the Nazis Kurt Muller Lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy motherinlaw. But he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests Coulouris is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out.Great performances abound in this film written very much to put forth Lillian Hellman's liberal point of view. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe American homes. The movie's big controversy today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar over Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt. The monologue he has about the need to kill is gutwrenching just to mention one scene.Though this isn't what one thinks of as a Bette Davis movie she gives a masterful performance here as Kurt's loyal and loving wife Sara. Her acting tugs at the heart and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender.The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions. Lillian Hellman is not everyone's cup of tea but unlike The Little Foxes she has written some truly sympathetic wonderful characters and a fine story given A casting and production values by Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "It as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy. It is not only oppressively preachy but absurd stagebound dramatically straightjacketed and painfully overwrought. Watching it one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write I will not become a fascist on the blackboard 100 times.Now I understand that it was made during the height of WW2 and was intended to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about which anyone would wholeheartedly applaud and I'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day. But it is presented in such an immature overobvious sledgehammer way it fails abysmally as a work of art.The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic antifascist and Lucile Watson as the amusingly illmannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. Though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships the children are ridiculously shown as robotically wellbehaved little snips.

	onyx:emotionText "It as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy. It is not only oppressively preachy but absurd stagebound dramatically straightjacketed and painfully overwrought. Watching it one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write I will not become a fascist on the blackboard 100 times.Now I understand that it was made during the height of WW2 and was intended to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about which anyone would wholeheartedly applaud and I'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day. But it is presented in such an immature overobvious sledgehammer way it fails abysmally as a work of art.The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic antifascist and Lucile Watson as the amusingly illmannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. Though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships the children are ridiculously shown as robotically wellbehaved little snips. They do not even remotely resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis a great actress here is so one dimensionally noble I cringed every time she was on screen.

But it functions as a historic document in its astonishing limitation as well. Even as it extolls America's embrace of freedom on the world stage it portrays without irony or questioning America's own moral problem the inheritance of slavery and its inherent dehumanization of its own people. While the heroes fight fascism abroad the film implicitly countenances the fascism of racism in America. Dashiell Hammett wrote the screenplay based on his romantic and writing partner Lillian Hellman's Broadway success with her additional scenes and dialogue. Both were bright liberal minds sensitive writers committed to the ideals of American democracy and militant defenders of humanity against the Nazis. Yet despite those credentials they set the Bette Davis's family home on a plush plantation a drive away from Washington. The family has black servants whom the matriarch orders around imperiously. If there's any liberalism in the writers' view of these blacks it's restricted to a bit of eyerolling sass. Otherwise the blacks here are simply the plantation stereotype  especially the two wideeyed mutes brought from the garden to shuffle the sofa. The servants have no exchange with the Davis heroine or the Paul Lucas saintly hero. When this film was made America's liberal intelligentsia had apparently not yet recognized the injustice of its racism. That's this film's real statement to us now. Like Hellman and Hammett we may think we've achieved a state of moral awareness and courage   but what blinkers might we be wearing unawares today? For that we have to wake for future artists and critics to expose us. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.".

So last evening I was quite delighted to learn that the movie was completely different than I had expected and although it was about WWII and Nazis it takes place primarily in Virginia or is it Maryland.In 1940 before the U.S. had gotten into WWII although the film was produced in 1943 when the end of the war was approaching Germanborn engineer Paul Lukas his American wife Bette Davis and their 3 children Joshua cross from Mexico into the United States to visit or live with Davis' mother in suburban Washington. For 17 years the LukasDavis family has lived in Europe with Lukas participating in antiFascist activities.Will they live in peace in America? Or will Lukas continue his antiNazi activities through trips abroad? Of will a house guest who secretly favors the Nazi turn Lukas in for money from the Nazis. Well the house guest won't do that because ultimately Lukas shots him to death! At the close of the movie one of Davis' sons announces that is planning to return to wartime Europe to find his father Lukas. Davis though heartbroken agrees to be brave when that time comes.Davis is excellent here perhaps all the more so because she is playing against type. In fact this may be one of her better roles. Lukas an actor from AustriaHungary did win the Oscar for Best Actor and he turns in a decidedly different performance than would have been given by an American actor. Lucile Watson as the mother was excellent here...as she always was. Geraldine Fitzgerald turns in a good performance as does Donald Woods as the son. George Coulouris is appropriately loathsome as the evil house guest. The one performance that disappointed me was from a character actress that I have the highest respect for  the wonderful Beulah Bondi. Unfortunately here she plays a French great aunt and it just seems an unnatural role for her.I give this film high marks. It rises above typical wartime movie stories and is a superb drama. This may very well be one for your DVD shelf...a war story with a difference.".

Lukas an actor from AustriaHungary did win the Oscar for Best Actor and he turns in a decidedly different performance than would have been given by an American actor. Lucile Watson as the mother was excellent here...as she always was. Geraldine Fitzgerald turns in a good performance as does Donald Woods as the son. George Coulouris is appropriately loathsome as the evil house guest. The one performance that disappointed me was from a character actress that I have the highest respect for  the wonderful Beulah Bondi. Unfortunately here she plays a French great aunt and it just seems an unnatural role for her.I give this film high marks. It rises above typical wartime movie stories and is a superb drama. This may very well be one for your DVD shelf...a war story with a difference.";

This movie is no exception. I can see why Bette Davis took the role for its importance. It teaches so much to the American people of its time  and even now  how we don't really know what it means to be a European in an Old World so often used to the kinds of conflict that created World War II.The movie also strikingly doesn't feel like propaganda even though the message was clearly to move its audience into action aren't all worthwhile films aimed at personal change?. It presented a very enlightening moving perspective on both the German menace and the Underground protagonists. Muller Paul Lukas explains how we will one day feel pity for those Germans who just follow orders and are really just fools like De Brancovis George Coulouris. And the perspective that Muller and the Underground may indeed be like the evil they fight  to see Muller admit he was bad. Situations like this are not black and white.The acting in this are also marvelous. Paul Lukas is an inspiration to watch. The children are so very precious as is Lucile Watson's character.After seeing this my sister wanted to learn more about WWII the Underground and the Holocaust. Through it she's had the experience I've had so long ago.In that time I see character selflessness and purpose greater than self. I love it so and I am saddened by the blatant selfishness that defines today's society. Movies like this inspire me and make me see continually that ideals and convictions can be attained and are indeed beautiful.".

She is a much underrated actress and I have to admit I have had a crush on her since I first saw her probably in Wuthering Heights 40 or more years ago. The real star in this movie however is Paul Lukas and he deserved all the accolades he got. He makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifies the means. Naziism had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good. He gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when conversing with adults he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation. Lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do.Some people think his victim was a Nazi but I don't think so  I think he was only after the money. His Nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him.One interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that Muller Lucas is a German. While the anti German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in WWII there was considerable antiGerman sentiment and some Germans were interred similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestry. It was something of an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the NaziSoviet pact!. After all the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians. I think however that the Dresden bombing and firestorm happened later after Watch on the Rhine was released.The title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from Germany. In fact Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song  used in WWII but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well. But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own Wach am Rhein.All the other actors did an excellent job here although Bodo was too much there are children like him. I am surprised he did not give his father's secret away. In real life he may very well have done so.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thirty years later it is hard to imagine The Story of Adele H without the then twentyyear old Isabelle Adjani as the title character. But at the time Truffaut's decision to cast the young French theatre star was very risky. Not because there was any doubt about Adjani's acting but because casting someone who was arguably the most beautiful actress in the world as a character driven mad by unrequited love raised a potential credibility issue. Would viewers believe that the advances of a woman so beautiful passionate and intelligent were rejected? And could someone like that elicit sympathy from the average viewer.But Truffaut knew what he was doing because Adjani's Adele Hugo is 100 convincing. And rather than going for audience sympathy they go for audience frustration as the viewer is increasingly exasperated over Adele's selfdestructive behavior. Adjani's breathtaking beauty actually is an asset as Truffaut wants us convinced that the world holds open unlimited possibilities for Adele if only see can let go of her obsession. Adjani plays the character with such intensity that you are finally relieved when Adele's madness has reached the stage where she is no longer aware of her own suffering.Apparently Adele Hugo Victor Hugo's daughter had other issues going on well before her obsessive quest for Lt. Pinson's love began. Her sister had drowned and her parents had always strongly favored the sister over Adele. She has recurrent nightmares about drowning and sees marriage to Pinson as the only way to escape from her father. Visually Truffaut's stays with blacks browns and blues with much of each frame filled with shadows not exactly dreary but consistent with a character who has found little nonfantasy happiness during her life.The camera loves Adjani a good thing as she is on screen for over 90 of the film. She was the youngest nominee ever for best actress. It was the best performance of the 1970's probably no one but Adjani could have conveyed such inner emotional violence. It is that extremely rare visual performance that does not need subtitles or even sound.As Roger Ebert noted Truffaut finds a certain nobility in Adele. He quotes one of the passages in her diaries twice She writes that she will walk across the ocean to be with her lover.

	onyx:emotionText "Thirty years later it is hard to imagine The Story of Adele H without the then twentyyear old Isabelle Adjani as the title character. But at the time Truffaut's decision to cast the young French theatre star was very risky. Not because there was any doubt about Adjani's acting but because casting someone who was arguably the most beautiful actress in the world as a character driven mad by unrequited love raised a potential credibility issue. Would viewers believe that the advances of a woman so beautiful passionate and intelligent were rejected? And could someone like that elicit sympathy from the average viewer.But Truffaut knew what he was doing because Adjani's Adele Hugo is 100 convincing. And rather than going for audience sympathy they go for audience frustration as the viewer is increasingly exasperated over Adele's selfdestructive behavior. Adjani's breathtaking beauty actually is an asset as Truffaut wants us convinced that the world holds open unlimited possibilities for Adele if only see can let go of her obsession. Adjani plays the character with such intensity that you are finally relieved when Adele's madness has reached the stage where she is no longer aware of her own suffering.Apparently Adele Hugo Victor Hugo's daughter had other issues going on well before her obsessive quest for Lt. Pinson's love began. Her sister had drowned and her parents had always strongly favored the sister over Adele. She has recurrent nightmares about drowning and sees marriage to Pinson as the only way to escape from her father. Visually Truffaut's stays with blacks browns and blues with much of each frame filled with shadows not exactly dreary but consistent with a character who has found little nonfantasy happiness during her life.The camera loves Adjani a good thing as she is on screen for over 90 of the film. She was the youngest nominee ever for best actress. It was the best performance of the 1970's probably no one but Adjani could have conveyed such inner emotional violence. It is that extremely rare visual performance that does not need subtitles or even sound.As Roger Ebert noted Truffaut finds a certain nobility in Adele. He quotes one of the passages in her diaries twice She writes that she will walk across the ocean to be with her lover. He sees this not as a declaration of love but as a statement of a singlemindedness so total that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. Adele was mad yes probably  but she lived her life on such a vast and romantic scale that it's just as well Pinson never married her. He would have become a disappointment.";

	schema:reviewBody "Isabelle Adjani plays the title role that of Adele Hugo daughter of the great French writer a woman obsessively in love with an English army lieutenant who doesn't want her. The scene is Halifax Nova Scotia during the time of the American Civil War. She has followed Lt. Pinson Bruce Robinson from her home in exile on the island of Guernsey to be with him even though he has rejected her. Adjani's sensuous beauty and her intense and passionate nature command the screen and we are drawn to identify with her as she spirals toward madness as her abject pleas of love are unrequited. We watch as she debases herself in every way possible in a desperate attempt to gain Pinson's love even to the point of giving him to other women. She is psychologically pleased with this because she thinks it shows that her love for him transcends sexuality. Of course the nature of obsessive love is always entirely selfish. If you really love someone who doesn't want you you have to let them go. But of course she cannot.Francois Truffaut directed and did a fine job of getting the most out of his young star. The maddening nature of obsession is well depicted and the story is focused and unfolds at a deliberate pace. Noteworthy is the setting itself a cold and remote clime so that Adele is in isolation from her home family and friends with little to do or think about every day except her obsession. It is easy to see how something like this can lead to complete madness.Memorable is a little story within the larger tale that of the fraudulent hypnotist whom Adele thinks might be able to turn Pinson's indifference into love.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw this film twenty years ago the thing that impressed me the most was Isabelle Adjani's portrayal of Adele the natural way in which she conveyed her character's emotions. Seeing it again recently I was able to better appreciate the film's fine crafting. One can sense Truffaut's hand in the direction even if it seems a bit different and less complex than other films of his. However I found this one to be the most haunting of all the Truffaut films I saw. It skillfully depicts Adele's circumstances and her torment without turning into a sentimental melodrama. As her desperation grows so do her actions turn more and more irrational and outrageous. Yet there is something about Adele that makes one understand her and feel for her. I credit that to Adjani's talent and the director's vision.The final scene punched me emotionally and spoke volumes without any of the characters uttering a word to each other Adele her mind lost by now passing by Lt. Pinson without even recognizing him  so consumed with her obsession and grief for her lost love that she forgot who was the cause of her torment. In a way all she remembered was not Pinson himself but the idea of being with him.I think this film is an interesting psychological study. In spite of its character's tragism it doesn't try to be morally conclusive or emotionally manipulative. Adele seems to be a victim but is she a victim of another's insensitivity a victim of circumstances or a victim of her own emotional instability? Or is she a victim at all?Maybe that's why the film elicits such a lasting impression it leaves enough for the viewers to think about and digest afterwards and eventually to draw their own conclusions.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm still young and yet it sometimes seems to me that I've reached the autumn of my life. This tragic statement taken from the diaries of Adele Hugo daughter of Victor is both the doomed statement of a young girl driven mad by love and an ironic testament to the performance of a then 20 year old Isabelle Adjani. Francois Truffaut takes us back to 1863 with the American Civil War in full swing and France and Great Britain still undecided in participation. Young Adele Hugo arrives at a camp in Nova Scotia seeking out her great love Lieutenant Pinson Bruce Robinson who she had embarked on a love affair with and whose potential marriage had been frowned upon.What may have become a rather frustrating depiction of a desperate woman in love Truffaut takes special care to create an air of Greek tragedy as we witness the emotional deterioration of our protagonist and her desperate pursuit of the unwilling Lieutenant Pinson. Adjani simply unnervingly beautiful seriously how do the French keep doing it? gives everything to the role. Adele herself as depicted in the picture is a timebomb of emotions giving every ounce of her strength into the tidal wave of pure love she feels  possibly a result of her father's grand romantic poems and novels  so anything less from Adjani wouldn't haven't done Adele justice.This is a different kind of work to what I've previously seen from Truffaut  I'm more familiar with his New Wave productions. Adele H. is filmed in dark lighting acting almost like a character itself signifying the darkness clouding in Adele's emotional torment. Victor Hugo's presence can be felt throughout the film although he is never seen. Adele's story was taken from her diaries and the frequent letters she wrote to her parents both of whom were concerned for her well being. She attempts to keep her identity a secret but friends are shocked when they uncover her secret and the film works almost as a testament to Victor Hugo a bow to his sheer immensity. But whether this is an ode to tragic intellectualism or a human story that grabbed Truffaut's heart I'll never know but this is a gently haunting tale and one that will make you want to personally open the eyes of Adele to the possibilities that are all around her were she not so swept away by madness and love.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Very Good Film About A Talented Writer Who Falls In Love W a Leiutenant";
	schema:reviewBody "Summary A talented writer Adele Hugo becomes obsessed with her former lover  the indebted and womanizing Liutenant Pinson. Her love for him consumes her entire life and she eventually goes crazy because he doesn't love her back.Acting Except for Adjani's performance the acting is not very good but that doesn't matter too much because the only person with a large role is Adjani. The guy who plays Pinson is pretty one dimensional. Anyway though Adjani gives an Oscarworthy performance and balances her character's vigorously muscular and blunt aggression with her character's silkyfine desperation and entrapment. Another actress might have played Adele as being recklessly obsessed but Adjani doesn't do that. Adjani actually shows us the thoughts and rationality of her character we first see Adele as an intelligent innocent young woman who somehow some way becomes slimmed down to a stub of passion in Pinson's presence. Cinematography bland and bleak which works in a way because that's how Adele views the world in comparison to her own outofproportion sadness but also doesn't work because that's all it does show us how the world looks like to Adele. I would have preferred if the cinematography actually captured the different emotions Adele was going through in each scene it would have made the cinematography less onenote. This flaw in the cinematography unfortunately carries over to the overall tone of the film. Script Good. It definitely conveys how Adele is always trying with a passion so great it verges on the comical to form the confusion of her life into a solid piece of truth. Part of this passion seems to be part of her neuroses part of it seems to be the artist in her at work.The one flaw in the script was the voice over at the end it didn't really give you a good idea of the rest of Adele's life and I bet the writer put it in there because he thought  Whoa this script is pretty long. I'd better gloss over the later years of Adele's life. Costume design Adele's red dress seems appropriately colorcoded with the cinematography of the film which as I stated above isn't such a good thing. Nothing else besides that red dress stuck out at me and the rest of the costume design was pretty mediocre. Camerawork Very good. I particularly like the slow zoomin on the picture of Pinson it was very powerful. Another good camerawork choice was when Pinson realized that Adele had told her father that she and Pinson were getting married. The director filmed this scene with the door blocking half the screen which made the viewer feel like Adele very cut off from Pinson. I really liked the camerawork here actually. Music Powerful and fitting. I particularly liked the music when Pinson was walking towards Adele at the end. Overall Very good film mainly carried by Adjani's excellent performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "The real story of Adle Hugo Victor Hugo's youngest daughter played by a yettobe 20yearold Isabelle Adjani whose onesided infatuation to a British officer Lieutenant Albert Pinson Robinson drives her to leave her family and come to Halifax alone where he is stationed only to be subjected to more stern rejection from Pinson eventually she loses her sanity in Barbados and is sent back to her father she lives until 1915 at the age of 85.Truffaut strongwilledly mines into the absurdity and irrationality of unrequited love evinced from Adle's own diaries and beats about the bush about Adle's mental faculties at then as at first viewers may get a vague idea that she is a congenital liar and her obsession could be completely derived from her imagination. But soon Pinson's visit clears the suspicion he actually did be romantically linked with her but presently he doesn't want anything to do with her but he never gives an explanation another sly bulletdodging of revealing the speculative truth since understandably you can not find that in one's own diaries. So Adle's torment is simultaneously inflicted by Pinson's heartless rebuff and by her own deeprooted delusion it always takes two to tango that's where lies the frustrating perverseness of the little destructive thing called love.The film is Adjani's starmaking vehicle she harrowingly lays bare Adle's severely troubled soul on top of her ethereal beauty and marvelously characterizes her vulnerability and paranoia which are much beyond her age and experiences and she laudably earns an Oscar nomination for her prowess. Credits should also be given to Bruce Robinson's portrayal of the obnoxiously uppity narcissistic and selfserving Albert Pinson who can mercilessly spurn Adjani's Adle a nonpareil belle who only wants to be loved by him it is a rather surreal and idealistic role and Robinson indeed makes a dent of his own effort notwithstanding that the movie has never focused on him it is purely a showcase for the young Adjani.Adle's tragedy is a rich kid's blues living under the shadow of her worldknown father and sibling rivalry she pestered by the incubus of her late sister Lopoldine's drowning accident and quintessentially her relentless pursuit of love and marriage is a desperate attempt to imitate Lopoldine's short but fulfilled life in Adle's recount the husband of Lopoldine voluntarily dies with her that is something she needs to possess to prove her own worth after all it is not about Pinson at all which is emphatically captured by the final encounter between them.Like the illusionist Gitlis in the picture our world is populated with deceptions and playactings and THE STORY OF ADELE H it must be where Noah Baumbach's FRANCES HA 2012 gets its titular inspiration further vouches for Truffaut's will power to debunk the ugly truth in his works only this time let it get brutally emotional under a often sombre palette from the oneandonly Nstor Almendros and incited by a compelling tourdeforce from Ms. Adjani.".

It concerns an unrequited love between Adele H. the daughter of Victor Hugo and a member of the English military stationed there.  It is directed by Francois Truffaut.  At the film's beginning there is some narration about the involvement of the French and British in the American Civil War but the Civil War plays no part in the movie.I enjoyed the feel of this film.  French actress Isabelle Adjani superbly plays a woman whose love is rejected and who inches down a slippery slope to madness.  The costumes and scenery ring true and the movie conveys the feel of the Canadian Atlantic province.  It was also interesting to learn this sidelight about Victor Hugo.Most of all I enjoyed this film because it raises the question of whether its main character is crazy to begin with or whether being possessed of such a strong love it was a natural progression to madness when it was rejected.  It raises but of course does not answer what causes such a potent love to arise and what is the consequence of its extinguishment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Guilt or Passion? 8 Is guilt or passion the driving force behind Adele's obsession for Lt Pinson? I think the former. Maybe it's her recurrent dreams of her older sister's tragic death by drowning maybe it's her conscious guilt over that accidentshe wished it because this sister was her father's dear favoritebut for me it's her ENIGMATIC SMILE while viewing her beloved's sexual encounter and her subsequent gift of a prostitute which argue even more deeply for guilt.For how can deep passion cut itself off from the body without abstracting itself? If her love was real concrete it was embodied. At that SMILE'S precise moment passionlove must become guiltpenitence.

Maybe it's her recurrent dreams of her older sister's tragic death by drowning maybe it's her conscious guilt over that accidentshe wished it because this sister was her father's dear favoritebut for me it's her ENIGMATIC SMILE while viewing her beloved's sexual encounter and her subsequent gift of a prostitute which argue even more deeply for guilt.For how can deep passion cut itself off from the body without abstracting itself? If her love was real concrete it was embodied. At that SMILE'S precise moment passionlove must become guiltpenitence. Or if this love started with guiltpenitence and Pinson is simply a standin for her dead sister than all that can be left now is suffering.

	schema:reviewBody "The Story of Adele H. is true. Franois Truffaut probably afraid of what would be a reaction of disbelief from the audience insists about it right before the movie starts. Later to those who wouldn't know the name for which the H stood for is revealed Adele H. is the daughter of the great poet and writer Victor Hugo. And considering the author's prestige in France any attempt of fictionalization for pure cinematic purposes wouldn't have served the film. In other words to tell such a harrowing story it 'd better be true.And 'harrowing' is an understatement the film features the daughter of the iconic author in the town of Hallifax Canada looking for the Lieutenant Pinson. Pinson declared his love to her during a mission in Guernesey the town that welcomed Hugo in exile during the reign of Napoleon III. But what Adele ignored is that the handsome Pinson was a seducer and she was the love of his life as long as he lived in Guernesey. But you can't conquer the heart of the most romantic French author's daughter without consequences. The story of Adele H. Is the disturbing but true chronicles of these consequences  disguised as stalking simply one of the most romantically driven descents into madness that ever graced the screen.Still for a period film that could have inspired a more epic direction the atmosphere strikes by its simplicity. All in dark brown or gray no music or pieces of action and everything contributes to quite an austere mood. If I wanted to be more critical I would have compared the film to some TV movies that try to overcome their limited budgets I could even mention some savorless acting based on a monotonic tone or onedimensional characterization but I guess this doesn't really matter and for two essential reasons. First the movie is short enough to let the script go straightforward to its point while it could have lasted two hours and half if it dared to imitate the work of Bergman  to probably fail. On that level the film is short but efficient. The second and not the least one is the extraordinary performance of the precociously talented Isabelle Adjani proving again that she's the most gifted and talented actress of her generation and maybe more.The movie's quality and merit rely in their entirety on Adjani's hypnotic performance rightfully nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. Adjani as Adele H perfectly conveys the alienation of a mind affected by such a desperate love that it undermines any rational consideration of her actions' incidences. She gave her heart and the hell she will take it back. An impartial script intelligently handles the treatment of her personality during the first part allowing us to adopt a very critical attitude toward Adele. She's a stalker she's a mythomaniac and displays a very despicable selfish attitude when it comes to the name her actions inevitably tarnish. But while the script is impartial the direction cleverly creates this intimacy between Adele and the viewer so there's no need to care for the peripheral characters and so we can sympathize or at least understand the reasons of this torment and the apparently malicious motives it inspires it's a remarkable merit on the field of intelligence. The Story of Adele H. is an engaging character study of envy and jealousy which hesitates between two diagnoses is it a pathological or a romantic case or both? I think the answer relies on the presence of the third most important character present through his undeniable aura Victor Hugo. Hugo was one the most influential romantic French authors and I think the common mistake is to associate romanticism with sentimentalism while they are two philosophically separate things. Romantic describes this incapacity to be understood this burning passion devouring the heart and while the others can only see what belongs to the real the romantic poet sees through the future like a guiding light or feels it like a sixth sense. As opposite to realism romanticism evokes the figure of the eternal adolescent with a poignant virginity that deprives him from the pervert effect of cynicism and dishonesty and that strength and vigor governing his idealistic actions. Adele is overly romantic to the state of alienation and in a way she's more a victim of Pinson than the opposite and witnessing Pinson's cold reactions we end up rooting for Adele on the longer term and this is not the film's merit this is its triumph.Adele inherited her father's ideals both haunted by the memory of Leopoldine Adele's sister who died from a drowning accident at the tragic age of nineteen right after her marriage. This episode is essential because it consolidated Adele's view on love passion duty devotion and sacrifice like when Leopoldine's husband not tolerating to lose the love of his life let himself drown to death with her this was the meaning of love for Adele for her father who'd be forever devastated by this tragedy so great so dramatic that even Pinson is too small to be ever associated with these passionate persons. And it's not surprising that Adele's mental state finally exceeded the limits of her stressful quest before she finally came back to France to quietly die at 85 a silent and unnoticed death under the thundering canons of WWI.And speaking of war as I said in other reviews maybe if the greatest war movies were about wars that were lost maybe this applies to love stories too? Or can we really lose a love? Adele H. embodies the strong determination of a woman capable to cross the sea in the name of love and such a powerful and pure heart is just too mighty for Pinson or for anyone. And it's still better to lose the love of your life than your capability to love ...".

	schema:headline " A tale of obsessive love";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a true story about Adle Hugo the younger daughter of the famous 19th century French author Victor Hugo 18021885 best known today as the author of LES MISERABLES which is causing an even greater stir now that the musical show has been filmed and nominated for several Oscars. She was named after her mother who was also called Adle. This is a passionate and intensely tragic tale which is well known to all cultured French people over the age of forty who were educated in the days before the French education system collapsed into a pile of wreckage even more shattered than the rubble of the British and American education systems. No French young person today who has not made extra effort even knows the names of the famous French authors and poets of the 20th century much less their works apart from the noxious and revolting Sartre whose poisonous influence lives on like an ineradicable invasion of Japanese knotweed choking all the good plants around it to death. In this film the 20 yearold Isabelle Adjani gives the performance of her life a harrowing wholly compelling and convincing study of a disturbed girl who goes from obsessive love into detachment from reality and thence into total madness. The real Adle was by no means beautiful as the photos of her exhibited recently at the Victor Hugo House in the Marais in Paris make clear. Adjani on the other hand is ravishing and how the vain and narcissistic Lieutenant Pinson whom she adores can resist her is the only weakness to the film. The causes of Adle's madness will never be entirely comprehended as it was all too long ago in the 1860s but Francois Truffaut who directed this miniature masterwork hints at her being obsessively haunted by the death from drowning of her beautiful older sister Leopoldine at the age of 19. We see scenes of Adjani writhing in agony in her bed in the grip of nightmares calling out that they must not continue to keep Leopoldine's clothes preserved in her trunk at home. Is Adle afraid of drowning? Is she touched by the terror of death? Does she feel suffocated by the fame of her father? Did she pick up from her father as if by contagion his own obsessive grief at Leopoldine's death? Or was she just born to madness? We shall doubtless never know. But having been seduced by the French Lieutenant and this presumably also inspired THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN by John Fowles and having given herself to him 'by giving my body I give also my soul and it is forever'. The guilt and according to her faith the sin of allowing herself to be defiled in the flesh seems to have contributed to the resultant mania. Adle then becomes manically fixated upon Lieutenant Pinson and follows him across the Atlantic to Halifax in Nova Scotia here his 16th Hussars have been stationed and later still to the Island of Barbados in the Caribbean to which the Hussars were transferred. She thus became a primordial stalker whose masochistic tendencies extended as far as paying a prostitute to go to Pinson with a note to him saying it is with her compliments 'because you deserve all women'. As a study in female psychology gone wrong they don't come more intense than this. Can one really blame the heartless Pinson for finding his castoff mistress to be 'trouble' and wanting to escape her? Which came first the castingoff or the mania? We do not know that either nor will anyone. The film is made in a claustrophobic manner with subdued colour confined sets and a darkness reminiscent of that found in all of Victor Hugo's own paintings which lack all sunlight and are extraordinarily gloomy just as gloomy in fact as his house in Paris with its dark 'Chinese Room' and even darker inner chambers culminating in his funereal bedroom at the back. No wonder Victor Hugo's last words on his deathbed were 'I see a black light!' This film is a searing emotional experience largely because of Adjani's incredible performance where one forgets entirely that she is Adjani and believes one is in the presence of the demented Adle herself robed in all her despair and bespangled with the glittering hopelessness of a mind which is disintegrating like an atom in a cyclotron all before our horrified eyes. Truffaut made a quiet masterpiece one which has all the qualities of Edvard Munch's silent 'Scream'. By way of epilogue I might say that there is an Adle Hugo alive today and she even has a charming sister named Leopoldine who did not drown at the age of 19 but is still very much alive. They are greatgrandchildren of Victor Hugo two of the seven children two sons and five daughters of the famous French 20th century artist Jean Hugo by his second wife he had no children by his first wife also a famous French artist Valentine Hugo whose maiden name was Gross. And so the names live on and the family lives on trailing their traditions and their creative works behind them in their collective wake like a convoy of ships which drops buoys to mark its route across the troublous seas of creativity.".

It takes the true talent and caliber of a director like Truffaut to make a character such as Adele Hugo into a person that ends up being more sympathetic than deplorable.

There is a burning desire in this woman that is both disturbing and admirable at the same time.Isabelle Adjani won much acclaim for her work as Adele and it was well deserved. At a mere 19 Adjani showed incredible poise as a young actress capable of carrying virtually the entire picture mostly with her eyes which are a deep blue and give her face a hauntingly beautiful quality. There is the constant feeling about Adele that she being the daughter of the famous French poet Victor Hugo is simply a spoiled rich girl using her father's money to try and buy a husband. Yet Truffaut does not see it that way. Rather he views Adele as a tortured soul who had enough passion and love for both herself and the man of her dreams only to receive indifference and cold incredulity. It is a sad film but at the same time a film of remarkable human courage and persistence. Many would question Adele's motivations for doing the things she does which seem to be purely selfish but no one can question the heart and passion with which she does it.".

It's really noteworthy to say that this film has nothing to do with the majority of the Italian westerns.It reminded me a little of IL GRANDE SILENZIO.The hero is a man with no future and it is crystal clear that the ending will be sad. His main aim is to find his lost son who was stolen by the bad Fernando Sancho when he was a baby.The hero who is played by Antony Steffen is spending all his life to find him and when he succeeds on doing it he finds out that his son has become a cruel and pitiless criminal.Here we come to the tragic end a very well made sequence with the father and son in the final confrontation.".

But everything is not good enough and years passand the nice kid slowly evolves into a vicious jerk just like his foster dad.If you are looking for an Italian film of the quality of a Sergio Leone or even a Sergio Carbucci film then keep looking. This one is actually a bit funny since the guns didn't even use blanksand the actors had to pretend that the guns were firing something. However the gun sounds were added later and it comes off as kind of funny seeing the men jerking the guns even though nothing is coming out even a blank will appear out of the barrel the same as a normal bullet. Plus they also seemed to have tried to save money by eliminating bloodmaking the bulletriddled bodies oddly clean and without bullet holes.

The main distinctive element is the fact that the son character has grown up to be a total bellend of a man at least as bad as his adopted father possibly even slightly worse. The fact he is such an irredeemable violent chump kind of goes against what you expect as it means that a typical fatherson reconciliation becomes decidedly unlikely. Events eventually boil down to a final duel in the town square where the son character even finds time to shoot his adopted mother dead for a trivial reason.

	schema:reviewBody "Though you might think that with the title Seven Dollars On The Red that this spaghetti western centers around gambling it doesn't  it's just a reference to something that quickly happens in the opening sequence. This bait and switch does not ruin the movie but plenty of other things make this particular spaghetti western below average. Many of these problems can be blamed on the script. The movie is poorly plotted at times jumping ahead twenty or so years at one point with no warning or proper transition and containing plenty of padding that ranges from gratuitous and inconsequential action to characters feebly engaging in dialogue that does not advance the story at all. To be fair the script does have a little interest with the story of the hero's long lost son becoming an outlaw and eventually crossing guns with his father but this part of the plot is surprisingly underused. The direction lacks flair for the most part with a slow pace and action sequences that simply lack excitement which may explain why Anthony Steffen sleepwalks as the heroic lead. Fernando Sancho as usual in this genre adds a little fun as the scummy bandit leader. And there is some interesting background scenery here and there. But apart from those two things there's little else to make this spaghetti western satisfying to genre fans.".

This bait and switch does not ruin the movie but plenty of other things make this particular spaghetti western below average. Many of these problems can be blamed on the script. The movie is poorly plotted at times jumping ahead twenty or so years at one point with no warning or proper transition and containing plenty of padding that ranges from gratuitous and inconsequential action to characters feebly engaging in dialogue that does not advance the story at all. To be fair the script does have a little interest with the story of the hero's long lost son becoming an outlaw and eventually crossing guns with his father but this part of the plot is surprisingly underused. The direction lacks flair for the most part with a slow pace and action sequences that simply lack excitement which may explain why Anthony Steffen sleepwalks as the heroic lead. Fernando Sancho as usual in this genre adds a little fun as the scummy bandit leader. And there is some interesting background scenery here and there. But apart from those two things there's little else to make this spaghetti western satisfying to genre fans.";
