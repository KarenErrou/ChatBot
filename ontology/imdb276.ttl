It all goes flooey and the laugh riot begins. I did think the ending was sappy but honestly I couldn't think of one more appropriate so I had to give them a pass. The cast in general is first rate but the casting of Alan Arkin in the lead role is inspired.  He is absolutely hilarious as things spiral out of his control.  Soon there will be World War III and everybody is blaming YOU!  You will recognize some of the faces.  Carl Reiner as the selfimportant New York writer Brian Keith as the Town Constable Jonathon Winters as his befuddled deputy Ben Blue as the town drunk and Paul Ford as a pompous retired military type.  The only flaw was the casting of John Philip Law.  He is an engaging actor but his portrayal of the sensitive Russian sailor just didn't make the grade.Usually in a comedy this frantic the characters tend to get lost in the slapstick.  Not so in this case.  Each of the characters are fleshed out to the point that you really think you know what they are thinking.I don't know why I'm writing this review.

	schema:reviewBody "It's fair to say Norman Jewison has never directed a bad film. Fiddler on the Roof Jesus Christ Superstar and Other People's Money are excellent. This film is an antidote to all other Cold War films which are either about spies or impending nuclear holocaust. The Russian submarine beaches on the New England coast by accident and the crew are very anxious about the blunder they have made. I think there's a chance this film was partly inspired by 49th Parallel. At the beginning it's obvious that they do not wish to use their guns in anger. John Phillip Law does well as Alexei there's a lot more to him than the angel in Barbarella. He is quite afraid of what may happen and is genuinely distraught after he pointed his gun at the wee lass because she made a noise that made him panic. The Americans are not portrayed favourably for the most part. They are shown as jingoistic and they behave in a manner reminiscent of the people who thought Orson Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast was a news report on an actual Martian invasion. Americans young and old from Whittaker's 9 year old son to the elderly guys in the American Legion beanies are shown as spoiling for a fight. This might be meant to represent American cold war paranoia which had its dark side in blacklisting by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and Ronald Reagan's keenness to use military action in the 1980s. The Russians are shown as well meaning and decent genuinely afraid of what might happen to them. The scene between Alexei and Alison on the beach is very good and what they say to each other to be found in the memorable quotes section makes perfect sense. Alan Arkin is also very good as Lieutenant Rozanov. Whitakker is very concerned when he thinks he's killed him after impulsively firing a gun at the car he's driving. It's good the way mutual distrust turns into friendship. Leaving the serious analysis aside there are some very funny moments like when Arkin  co tie the elderly lady up and place her on top of the cupboard and her husband doesn't notice she's there. It's a good scene at the end when the townspeople escort the  submarine out the harbour in their boats and with them being there the McDonnell F101 Voodoos flying overhead don't attack the sub. A feel good comedy indeed.".

Alan Arkin does a great job as Rozanov I can't believe that he still hasn't won an Oscar after all these years along with great performances by Carl Reiner and Eva Marie Saint as Walt and Elspeth Whittaker listen to what Rozanov does with Walt's name and Jonathan Winters as a cop uhoh.

Some of the scenes could have used a little more room to grow.The actors are great and the languages they speak are hilarious American Russian and body language they all are great even if no self respecting Russian would ever speak that way. Alan Arkin excels at using his body language and his impersonation of a soviet officer is memorable. Carl Reiner Brian Keith and Jonathan Winters are hilarious. The music is good funny and witty.As with other movies made by Mr. Jewison this one has a message people do not want to hate each other it is a waste of time.

With nowhere else to turn the Russian submariners are forced to attempt contact with the natives. Therein lies the tale.Rumors fly around the little town. Misconceptions and stereotypes add fuel to the fire and the whole mess is fanned to absolute silliness by inspired acting and humor.Do yourself a favor rent or buy it and enjoy.";

Rozanov then asks Whitticker what he does. Whitticker says I'm a writer and Rozanov tells the captain in Russian that Whitticker's a writer. what does he write? the captain yells down. He's probably thinking that his man is an important writer perhaps a govt. reporter or at least a newspaper reporter. I'm writing a musical comedy... Whitticker says. It's just so hilarious. What in the world is a writer of a musical comedy going to do to help prevent WW111 from starting? I just love that part.I also love how there are crazy people on both sides the Americans  townsfolk  and the Russians  their crazy capitain . Both sides are treated in a funny way. And I loved seeing the growing affection and respect between Rozanov and Whitticker. I also loved the love scene between the two twentysomethings they are both so beautiful and gentle with each other.The only little problem I have with the movie is the depiction of the crazy old timer the one who wants to lead the town who is an old army hero. It seems to me that that's a little disrespectful to old veterans who fought to preserve our freedom  freedom to make any kind of movies that we want for example . He is depicted as a pathetic old man crazy to use his sword which he values so much and I guess I would have liked to have seen a veteran portrayed in a more admirable way. Other than that this is one of my favorite movies. I love the scenery the story the way it moves and most of all the comedy. two thumbs up!!".

Molina William Hurt is ostensibly retelling his favorite film to entertain Valentin Raul Julia and make the time pass more quickly but he himself admits that he embroiders the story to make it more real.  So who is to say if this film exists except in Molina's mind and if it does what really transpired in the film?  The story about the French woman who is in love with a German officer during World War II and must decide whether or not to betray him is an obvious parallel to Molina's decision to betray Valentin or not.  Even Molina says that he most identifies with Leni La Maison Sonia Braga in this film of his and it's not just because he is a drag queen. It's because he has to choose between the man he loves and patriotism in his case represented by the policegovernment as well as his ailing mother.This storytelling tactic works brilliantly in my opinion.  Kiss of the Spider Woman is indeed original quirky and a mustsee.".

For political prisoner Valentin it is a dream of freedom with the woman he loves for cellmate Luis it is to gain a sense of higher purpose by becoming involved with a selfless cause for a love he can never have. In Kiss of the Spider Woman film is an escape on two levels  a momentary reverie from inhuman conditions in a nondescript bastille and as pure cinematic escapism for the viewer who can become lost in a movie of thoughtprovoking fantasy and filmwithinafilm parallels. Luis Molina William Hurt is a homosexual window dresser now a convict in an undefined Latin American prison marked simply with the name Pavilhao IV locked away for corrupting a minor. His cellmate is Valentin Arregui Raul Julia a journalist revolutionary detained and tortured for his political ties. At first Valentin is annoyed by Molina's fanciful attitude as the two men clearly have opposite life views but eventually grows to depend on his kindness  a complex relationship that becomes even more intricate when Luis begins to fall in love.Molina passes the time by telling the story of one of his favorite films a German propaganda feature that finds distracted singer Leni Sonia Braga falling for an enemy Nazi soldier confused about whether to continue aiding the French Resistance with a plot to steal a secret map to a German arsenal or trusting in the man she loves. As her story progresses Molina's real life begins to imitate the embroidered fiction of the movie  for his involvement with Valentin evolves into something shockingly deliberate. The performances by William Hurt and Raul Julia are quite masterful with Hurt embodying a quirky and unexpected character resoundingly unique amongst major roles of the time they were purportedly cast in each other's roles switching when the chemistry wasn't natural. Although the story is daringly bizarre and oddly beautiful it is the performances by the leading roles that outshine the morals of the tale. Hurt in drag with his lingering monologues and frequent onesided conversations is a courageous role that won him the Best Actor Oscar of 1985.Kiss of the Spider Woman's claim to fame was it's groundbreaking achievement of being the first independent film ever to receive the top four Oscar nominations including Best Picture for producer David Weisman Best Director for Hector Babenco and Best Adapted Screenplay for Leonard Schrader from Manuel Puig's novel. A melancholy romantic theme presides over the muted browns of Molina's fantasy narrative and the darkly tinted blues of their bleak existence as pawns for the oppressive rightwing regime. The escapism and fantasy of Kiss of the Spider Woman is just as relevant as today and this disturbingly singular film is a oneofakind unforgettable retreat. Mike Massie".

No wild carchases gunfights or steamy sex sequences here but you'll be fascinated by the strong dialogs the mesmerizing acting performances and the professional directing skills of Hector Babenco. The growing relationship between the two opposite protagonists is masterfully illustrated and the depressing setpieces only increase your sympathy for the both of them. Kiss of the Spider Woman is the only film I've seen so far that successfully implements a complex structure containing flashbacks as well as dreamsequences  and even filminfilm images  without becoming overly confusing. Raul Julia and William Hurt both deliver their finest performances ever and the latter righteously got rewarded with an Oscar. A definite must see for every demanding fan of filmmaking.".

This movie resonated on many different levels that it's hard to describe. The friendship between the two main characters was absolute regardless of their present unfortunate situation. They are two ordinary people thrown together by fate in an extremely difficult situation and they make the best of it. The conflicts going on around them would destroy lesser men. Their reality is bleak at best and they find a way to survive. Powerful performances at every level are the order of the day. Sonja Braga is a delightful distraction as real as any fantasy.

Basically in Brazil set during the Brazilian military government in a prison cell are two unlikely cell mates Valentin Arregui The Addams Family's Golden Globe nominated Raul Julia who is imprisoned and has been tortured due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group and homosexual Luis Molina Oscar and BAFTA winning and Golden Globe nominated William Hurt who is imprisoned for having sex with an underage boy. Molina passes the time recounting memories from one of his favourite films a wartime romantic thriller also a Nazi propaganda film he weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Arregui and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and the separation from his lover Marta Golden Globe nominated Sonia Braga. Through telling him this Molina finds Arregui slowly lessening his defensive side and opening up as the story unfolds it is obvious that the jailers are poisoning Arregui so he will befriend Molina who is a spy for Brazilian secret police they want information obtained to find the revolutionary group's members if Molina succeeds he will be granted parole. Molina falls in love with Arregui he eventually responds and they make physical consummation of their love on Molina's last night in prison he is granted parole in the hopes that his cell mate will reveal information about his contacts when he knows he will be out of prison Molina first refuses to take a telephone number and message for the comrades when Arregui provides them but he relents they share a farewell kiss. The last scenes see Molina calling the number with a meeting arranged with the revolutionary group but the secret police have him under surveillance eventually a gun battle occurs with Molina shot by the revolutionaries they assumed he has betrayed him. Molina wanders the streets wounded the police catch up with him and demand he discloses the telephone number in exchange for them taking to hospital for treatment he refuses succumbs to his wounds and dies the homophobic police chief Pedro Milton Gonalves orders Molina's body be dumped in a rubbish pit and a story fabricated about his death and his involvement with the revolutionary group. Back in the prison Arregui has once again been tortured and is being treated the doctor risking his job in the process injects him with morphine to help him sleep in his dreams Arregui is able to escape to a tropical island to reunite with Marta. Also starring Sonia Braga as Leni Lamaison and the Spider Woman of the title from one of the stories Molina tells Jos Lewgoy as Warden Nuno Leal Maia as Gabriel Antnio Petrin as Clubfoot and Denise Dummont a Michele. Hurt definitely deserved his Oscar for playing a wonderfully flamboyant gay man Julia is equally fantastic as his reactionary political prisoner cell mate together as the pair sharing a cell in a South American jail they really convince you of their growing friendship and further affectionate relationship with each other. The film is all about the two men in their cell and their interactions mixed with some political subtext but it also fantastically mixes the harsh squalid reality of prison life with the juxtaposed dreamlike monochrome fantasy world imagined by the stories lovingly told by the leading gay character it is a terrific drama film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture Best Director for Hector Babenco Ironweed and Best Writing Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and it was nominated the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture  Drama. Very good!".

Everything reveals itself in the same way steadily and without explanation starting  eventually  with Hurt's hypermasculine cellmate Raul Julia. It's a dialogueheavy film and frankly could have been fairly successful given the well designed and shot cell and the wellplayed roles.Well Hector Babenco decides the use the opportunities cinema affords and opens the narration right out at the same deliberate pace as the rhythm of the script demands. The 'film' comes to life in a hot peach sepia becoming a cool moonlight blue for the second Spider Woman 'film' narration the men's own stories also start to emerge in flashback and an interesting development emerges beyond the confines of the cell. Are they simply telling their stories  or are they 'embellishing' as Molina excuses himself early on?For all these subplots parallel narratives and metaphors  for the film bears them all  the heart of the film beats only in the relationship borne by the men in the cell. Hurt's Oscar for his gay Molina is as deserved an award as any other and the suggestion that the actors switched roles shortly before filming tells you all you need to know about Julia's fine contribution.

The movie is a rich myriad of imagery poetics and emotions which all become thicker and more complex as the movie unfolds. On the surface Kiss of the Spider woman appears as a prison thriller. However what differentiates this movie from other movies of it's genre is the emotional questions that the movies raises. The movie is a study of moral rights in the modern world. In this movie the two leads are forced to evaluate themselves and rationalise their feelings with one another this is shown in the way the movie contrasts the politics of the free thinking individual that being revolution individual rights of man people forcing change with the prejudices of modern society mainly the modern day fear of homosexuality. Stylistically the movie is also outstanding taking an unconventional narrative that mixes the 'dream' with the 'real'. The character of Valentin represents the modern day hero with his idealism and dreams of change. Where as the character of Luis represents the failed dreams of the individual and the longing for fulfilment. The Nazi movie that is intertwined within the story should also merit a comment as it is through this sub plot where the story is able to ensnare it's audience into a labyrinth like world within a fictitiousmythological past within thirties Europe. The black and white movie within the movie 'The kiss of the Spider woman' serves as a continuous reminder of the power of the dream world with that of our everyday reality. The eighties was a bizarre time for art there was the prevailing sense of change in the air. With the Cold War coming to an end there was the popular belief of a new world emerging from the lesson learnt from two world wars. This movie 'The Kiss of the Spider woman' serves as a cautious warning that mans is a nostalgic yet forgetful beast and that hope of change and the dream of freedom within a society that is not yet ready to take on all of the socialpolitical dynamics of freedom remains nothing but a failed romance.A worthy classic.

Molina whose mannerisms and dialogue clearly reveal his homosexual inclination loves to describe his favorite film to Valentin a political prisoner who is straight but takes Molina's gayness in stride. Frustration anger emotional pain bitterness and fantasies fuel the conversations between Molina and Valentin.The film's script structure is a little unusual. Most of the plot takes place in the prison cell. But interspersed among these scenes are scenes from Molina's fantasy film a WWII Nazi melodrama wherein a flamboyantly ravishing French entertainer a woman named Leni Sonia Braga engages in a romance with a German soldier a man named Werner. There's an obvious parallel between Molina and Leni and their political liaisons.The Nazi film provides viewers with much needed diversion from the static scenes in the prison cell. But I found the fantasy characters not especially interesting. Plot pacing in Kiss Of The Spider Woman is rather slow. The prison cell scenes are heavy on dialogue.Cinematography is color throughout the film except in the fantasy film which is sepia toned. Background music is pleasantly artistic and sometimes nostalgic. Production design is fairly minimal the film is very low budget. William Hurt does indeed give a terrific performance in his role. Raul Julia is adequate. Sonia Braga's performance is overly melodramatic but maybe deliberately so.Kiss Of The Spider Woman is an arthouse film that is worth watching for its portrayal of social outcasts.

	schema:reviewBody "Kiss of the Spider Woman is a powerful and disturbing film made along the lines of MISSING 1982  Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek in that the story centers around a military government in a South American country and its involvement with its citizens. It focuses on a political inmate Raul Julia at a government prison whom holds information about a group of underground rebels that the government secret police are after. William Hurt Oscar winner is his homosexual cellmate in prison for a crime of statutory rape whom the government manipulates to get at Julia's character. Sonia Braga plays three roles in the film and did not speak English at the time of production she spoke all of her lines phonetically. The score and cinematography are quite impressive adding to this good to excellent movie with a surprise ending.".

I enjoyed attack of the killer tomatoes more than I did this movie or something more recent say Borat that was a better movie. Hell even white hunter black heart was a much better movie than this.

It's not that he made something accessible he made something great perhaps the best Oscar film of 1985. Kiss of the Spider Woman operates on so many compelling and complex dualities and contradictions. The most unlikely pair locked in prison and each with their own different visions of escape make for ripe and explorative drama. William Hurt and Raul Julia the former of whom deservedly won the Oscar for a real livedin and nuanced but powerful performance have electric chemistry and the film is wholly indebted to their commitment to their characters to make it work. It's delicate scenes such as when Hurt cleans up Julia's diarrhea that build their growing bond so organically. Never phased by the limited space the photography glides across the cell constantly making the film cinematic. The third act feels like something out of a political thriller from the 70s. It does tend to get lost in itself a bit and perhaps suffers most when the plot thickens including the plot of the fictional moviewithinthemovie and when the relationships are taken one step further. Some of the dualities seem placed in without being as well developed as the key ideas and knowing too little about Brazilian politics which is what Julia stood for also hurts. There's a lot of universality about it though which resonated and was often poignant. A rewatch could reconcile those nitpicks but otherwise I'm pleasantly surprised.810".

This is a story that unfolds in a squalid prison cell so the movie rests on the performances of William Hurt and Raul Julia. And both are indeed exceptional Julia the solid ground to Hurt's high camp. It's surprising how apolitical this manages to be while still dealing in politics torture and homosexuality which even more surprising is sensitively handled for the most part.710".

Any normal viewer will either despise or at least feel indifferent toward all of the nonzombie characters we are aren't in any way asked or persuaded to identify or sympathize with anyone here so like all of the 'Friday the 13th' movies and most slasher flicks you end up hating all of the victims and cheering on the zombies taking great satisfaction when they get their intestines pulled out or heads cut off. It doesn't help matters that all the living humans behave almost without exception in a fashion that can at best be generously called moronic no offense intended toward any of you morons out there  which only makes you want to see them all die that much more.

And even then that's probably giving Bianchi more credit than he deserves for this film. Burial Ground also goes down as the only living dead movie where the zombies are more intelligent than the protagonists although Nightmare City by Umberto Lenzi comes close. Certain considerations must be given to Bianchi on this film however. He doesn't flub the living dead film formula like the modern counterpart directors that try ineffectively to make living dead films these days. He is confident enough in the makeup FX to film the zombies in broad daylight. In this case the DVD reissue that cleaned the film up didn't do the movie any favors as the previously murky VHS release partially masked some of the more pathetic zombie FX. The plot falls on its face in most cases and could be a case example of choices a protagonist in a horror film should never make. The characters just continually make so many wrong choices you may find yourself rooting for the zombies. Then again if the characters made the right choices the movie would have been over in twentyfive minutes. Of course all these horrible choices have consequences in that characters do drop like flies throughout the film and meet one messy end after the other. The death scenes are creative and Bianchi at least stretched his imagination a little to give some interesting deaths to the characters in the film ludicrous as some of them may be. As usual for standard Bmovie fare the dubbing is weak at best an insult to eardrum at worst. Dialogue suffers a similar fate in this case it just stretches between illogical silly or plain sleazy. The dubbing doesn't help the representation of the characters' intelligence either.The graphic violence is excessive in almost every case a plus for those seeking grue and crimson splashes. The best actor in the film by far is Peter Bark who is a twenty thirty? something that plays the role of a tenyearold boy. This was due to child labor laws in Italy at the time and Peter Bark shines in his role of the Oedipal boy Michael. It adds so many levels of sleaziness to the film Bianchi is to be applauded for tackling this difficult social issue. The climax of the film is a guaranteed disappointment as the film feels more like it either just ran out of budget and closed shop or Bianchi just ran out of ideas. The ending is not unlike reading a book only to find out someone ripped out the last ten or fifteen pages it ends that abruptly. The pacing of the film up to the end is decent being that the characters are one step above an amoeba on the evolutionary scale we aren't bothered by such things as characterization or advancement of personality. From the moment the dead rise it's just a series of encounters where the protagonists make horrible judgment calls and pay the price for it. If anything the breakneck pace of the film keeps a person entertained rather than bogging down. Seriously if the characters are not fornicating they are battling the living dead. It at least keeps the action one way or another flowing. If you enjoy the Italian living dead genre Burial Ground will not disappoint others are probably better turned away.".

There's a brief attack at the very beginning on some professor a few obligatory sex scenes in which we meet the main characters and then before you know it the zombies are attacking in full force. No explanation is given for the zombies but none is needed. This movie is all about the gore effects. The zombies are very coollooking and I especially liked the repeated skullcrushing effect done to them. These zombies are tough too able to throw knives use a battering ram and even operate power tools. I'd sure hate to go up against a horde of the undead with that level of technical ability. Fortunately unlike many other characters in zombie movies the good guys here aren't stupid. They know to go for the head and do so every time.The whole subplot of the Oedipal son played by a midget is a bit creepy and ends very gruesomely but I didn't let that distract me from the real focus. Burial Ground obviously borrows from Zombi even having the same makeupeffects artists from the Fulci classic. However I must say I liked Burial Ground more than Zombi. Faster pacing I barely noticed the 90 minute run time more zombie for your buck and creepier setting in the abandoned mansion and nearby abbey. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Nights Of Terror' which is its real English name is one of the more forgotten Italian Zombieflicks that they were churning out like madmen in the early eighties. The story is simple but effective three couples is arriving at a remote villa where a Professor Ayres is going to announce something which have to do with the way we are looking at death. However as we could see before the credits the good professor is dead and the dead is rising from an old Etruscan cemetery just outside the villa. Apart from some brief sexscenes when the couples arrive at the house the whole movie is a long chase between the zombies and their potential victims. What makes this movie worth watching is the fact that it's trying to be a real horrormovie witch creaking doors old cemeteries and a fair bit of suspense. In fact most of the movie almost feels like Blind Deadmovie especially as the zombies use various tools to kill their victims. The zombie makeup by Gino De Rossi and Rosario Prestopino is impressing instead of the tired Saviniblueintheface makeup the zombies look genuinely scary.Of course it's not without faults the dubbing is terrible and the dialogue is laughable. Who can ever forget Professor Ayres' line when the zombies are attacking him No! I'm your friend! or the weird Michael Mama this cloth smells of death. To summarize it this movie is like a Lucio Fulci movie with an Amando De Ossorio script and Jess Franco characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the one. This is the one that puts them all to shame. Fulci Romero no one has ever made livingdead cinema seem so dark gritty and down right apocalyptic as Andrea Bianchi. Obviously less expensive than anything from those other guys Burial Ground is certainly no more complicated than anything else from the genre three giddy couples and a depressed manchild are vacationing in an old mansion in Italy. They couldn't have picked a better location. Little Michael the manchild is in love with his mother and he seems a bit jealous of his stepfather I'm not exactly sure what they intended with this little subplot but all I know is that incest is hilarious regardless of what genre it's thrown into and being completely random makes it all the better. I'm just glad little Michael is a character in a movie and not someone I have to deal with on a regular basis.Enough about Manchildren and incest there's much more fun to be had. The first twenty minutes of this epic mostly involves the giddy couples spouting ridiculous dialogue flirting with each other and frolicking about with not a care in the world until it happens the dead are coming back to life and unfortunately for some reason there are a dozen or so rotted corpses buried in the garden. As bad as the English voiceovers are they do a great job at sounding terrified once the madness begins. Probably more powerful than it was meant to be Burial Ground gives you the strong impression that these dozens of zombies some of which resemble the Toxic Avenger just might take over the world after they're done with these guys. Burial Ground is a prime example of grainy bad film quality unintentionally enhancing the horror quality. Some scenes you cant even make out what's going on. Although the scifiish sound effects are out of place it adds an apocalyptic feel that makes things seem even more hopeless and dismal. Some how the unintentional humor doesn't overshadow any of this. Calling Burial Ground creepy would be an insult nightmarish would be a good start.The darkness of this masterpiece goes far beneath the dark grainy quality of the film even when they show a sunny day all I see in this film is darkness things just seemed doomed from the very beginning and that exploitation fans is the makings for true horror. Burial Ground is best Italian gore has to offer better than The Beyond even better than Beyond the Darkness Burial Ground has no equal. The only thing I can recommend more than this is this on VHS the film quality is even worse the sky looks almost pink. VHS really brings out that look that the DVD format has ruined. Plenty of Gore nudity incesthumor Burial Ground is the measuring stick of any horror subgenre it may represent. Aside from the profecy being misspelled the ending leaves quite an impression. Don't talk to me about no damn Evil Dead. Burial Ground has them all beat. That one wasn't that great anyway. 1010".

The best part is that the zombies are twice as clever as the living. The undead concoct plans to outwit the living similar to tapping on the left shoulder then standing behind the right one.Plot 110 Thank goodness there were other zombie films made before this one otherwise you wouldn't know what the heck was going on! This is basically derivative of all the better done and known zombie films of the 70's with some totally bizarre twists thrown in to keep you guessing. The script is very disproportional and the dialog is awful. Basically it would be extremely challenging to write another script as horrible as this one ever again.Production Value 210 This movie has almost no directorial style and the class equivalent of an 80's porno movie. The gore and makeup is done with very little or no attention to detail so it's hard to believe that the same guy that did the makeup effects for Fulci's Zombie did the effects for this one. Also the image looks murky and the camera compositions undesirable. The crew is seen once for certain and the dubbing is sloppy. However it should be noted that now and then the score is pretty good. Acting 010 or 1010 depending on how you look at it The acting is completely overdone and definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie. I found myself gleefully anticipating every line.So there you have it a very entertaining very bad movie. Possibly one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. Check it out!".

	schema:reviewBody "Another zombie classic. Well it's a classic if you happen to enjoy bad Italian zombie flicks. Me? I can't get enough of 'em. Burial Ground ranks right up there with the best of the worst. Accordingly Suds  Buds see my Blood Freak review for clarity are handy to have around for your viewing pleasure. Don't be surprised if this one creeps you out at some points.... or if you turn it off right around the incest scene more on that later.I remember renting Burial Ground when I was like 15 except the box was labeled The Gates Of Hell. As any fan of Eurohorror movies knows these flicks sometimes have half a dozen different titles or more depending if you've got the Italian American German or Laplander version. But The Gates Of Hell was also the American title for Lucio Fulci's City Of The Living Dead. The box even had the same art as C.O.T.L.D. Yeah nothing too relevant to the review I just thought it was funny. As I started getting more into horror movies and heard about City... and it's U.S. title of Gates... I thought I'd already seen it. Then it took me awhile to figure out what I'd actually seen was Burial Ground.OK enough with the childhood memories. Almost 20 years later this is still one of my faves. You hear all the time about these types of movies being plotless and devoid of character development... welcome to exhibit A! Well there is an idea behind the movie but I wouldn't go as far as to call it a plot. Basically a small group of people two couples and a newlywed Mom and her erm son are heading to an Italian villa owned by their friend Professor Ayres. He's been working in a tomb on the property trying to... I dunno raise the dead? Well he succeeds just in time for his guests to arrive and is the first to go. While he's getting munched on his guests make themselves at home back at the mansion.By at home I mean they start boning hey maybe it was a long drive. These scenes feature a little softcore sex and randy dialogue. My favorite line of the movie is when one of the girls named Leslie is playing dressup for her man and reveals herself to him in a skimpy and quite fetching ensemble and asks him if he likes what he sees to which he responds You look just like a little whore but I like that in a girl. You sweet talker Betty Crocker! It doesn't take long for the zombies to make their way outta the tomb and towards the mansion. These aren't your average dumbass zombies either. They take up weapons climb walls and even use a battering ram on the door. When a maid reaches out of a window to close the shutters the zombies pin her hand to the outside wall with what looks like a railroad spike and cut her noggin off with a scythe. So these are some clever cadavers.At this point I'd like to take a moment to tell you about Peter Bark. I suppose anyone very familiar with Burial Ground knows where I'm going with this. Bark plays the role of the son named Michale. Now maybe it was the sexual content or child labor laws but this role was not given to a child. Instead Bark appears to be a 30 year old with a bone deficiency or something as he stands about 5 feet tall. The really creepy part is that he looks like a 30 year old. Well a 30 year old with a obvious problem.Michale is constantly on his Mom's jock. He gives her new husband the stinkeye something fierce. After surviving a zombie attack Michale cuddles up to his Mom and starts.... well he starts hitting on her. Yes friends The Incest Scene... part 1! I mean homeboy starts feelin' her up and whatnot. Well Mom for some reason freaks out and slaps him surprised it didn't turn him on kinky lil' s.o.b.. So he takes off seemingly forgetting that zombies are lurking about. Michale eventually falls victim to some zombie nastiness which sets up... Incest Scene part 2! When Mom next sees Michale such is her relief that she clutches him to her bosom... and offers him a suckle.... which he uses as a opportunity to bite her boob off.That's pretty much it. Zombies arise zombies attack zombies kill everyone in sight. That's the plot. If someone was to ask you what Burial Ground is about just repeat those three things... arise attack kill. Oh yeah and Peter F'n Bark! The Good They don't skimp on the gore here. As usual it doesn't always make sense like when a freshly turned zombie has her head bashed in why does it leak what appears to be gray paint? but like whatever. A couple of the lovely ladies get naked... not Janet though seriously am I the only one that thinks that chick looks a lot like Kate Hudson. The zombies look pretty good. Some are really revolting rotten fleshworms hanging outta their grill while others are kinda ridiculous you can plainly see the screened over holes at the eyes and mouth that the actors see and breathe through. I like the music very moody.The Not So Good All the usual suspects for this type of film. Bad acting bad dubbing and a plot you could jot down on the back of a pack of matches in about a minute and a half. All the stuff I mentioned in The Good could be in someone else's opinion considered Not So Good shock and disbelief!.".

While some of my fellow Italian Horror fanatics regard it as being among the greatest Italian Zombie gore flicks others seem to regard it as being completely worthless junk.

As far as I am concerned Burial Ground does not nearly rank among the greatest Italian Zombie flicks and yet it is an absolute mustsee for my fellow fans of the living dead mainly because of its extreme gore and its value as one of the most demented Zombie flicks ever made. Director Andrea Bianchi had already proved to be an expert for the sleazy kind of Italian Horror with his delightfully smutty Giallo Nude Per L'Assassino Strip Nude For Your Killer 1975 and he also proves that he's a master of extreme gore with this yummy flick.The storyline is extremely thin and the existence of the zombies gets even less explanation than in other zombie films. However the film's nauseating qualities easily make up for what it lacks in plotting. The living dead in this film are without exaggeration some the most disgusting Zombies ever in cinema. The makeup department really did an amazing job here  zombies do often look rotten but these guys are literally in the process of rotting. The zombies have disgusting worms and maggots crawling out of their eyesockets and other orifices and the mere look of them is already a delight for every fan of nauseating and disgusting gore. Additionally the film provides an enormous amount of remarkably nauseating gore even for Italian Zombie flick standards. The film furthermore includes an extremely irritating little boy who has the face of an adult and who was actually played by an adult Peter Bark and whose looks are not the only strange thing about him... I don't wanna give away more as I don't want to spoil any of the fun but I can assure that the fans of the really explicit and demented kind of gorecinema will have the time of their lives watching Burial Ground. The film is never even remotely eerie or suspenseful and the plot is as thin as it gets but there is no doubt about one thing this is demented stuff! I recommend Burial Ground to all my fellow fans of Italian Horror cinema especially to those who like their Zombie flicks extremely gory. If you want GORE then this is for you!".

But be warnedYou have to turn off your brain and throw your zombie rulebook out the window. These ghouls are smarter than your average bear. They disguise themselves as monks have the catlike ability to scale walls and have mastered the ninja ability to throw railroad spikes with the accuracy of Michael Dudikoff. Seriously though the film is a lot of fun. It doesn't seem to take itself too seriously and thankfully never gets dull. There are some pretty cool set pieces and the film does have a certain atmosphere to it. The best aspect is the setting. The movie takes place in an Italian mansion that is ripe for the living dead. Also it features one of the most memorable sequences of Italian cinema the incestuous zombie boychild being breastfed by his mother. Shudders That's creepy stuff. All in all Burial Ground is an offbeat zombie offering for those of us that can't get enough of the walking dead.".

The scientist is quickly killed and the zombies start to make it out of their Burial Ground. After this a group of people head over to a mansion to I believe go on vacation. It isn't soon after that the dead start to pick each of the people off one by one.I must admit this movie is rather hilarious almost all the way through. The characters all act like a bunch of idiots and you really don't feel bad when they start dying. The way the zombies looked was fake but still cool nonetheless as they looked like a bunch of rotted monks. The gore was all there so if you are a gore hound you should be pleased. Plenty of gut ripping and head smashing to go around. And the best part and most controversial is the mother and her incestuous son. If that doesn't leave you laughing for days I don't know what to say.Definitely a fun movie with some very bizarre music gore bad acting and bad plot. Highly recommended. 810 stars".

And the compositions are all over the place.But...it is also a classic for many reasons. The decision to cast thirtyyearold Peter Bark as the tenyearold son of Antonella Antinori is one of strange genius. Bark looks like a jockey and wears his pants so high he surely must have ruined his testicles forever. In one great scene he begins to feel his own mother up so he can return to munch on her breast later.The problem with many zombie films is the zombies don't get enough screen time. That's not the case here. Within ten minutes the zombies are everywhere and they remain centrestage for the entire movie. They are rotting shambling maggotridden creature of the Fulci variety and they are lots of fun to watch. In one scene a victim's eye is skewered by broken glass ala Zombie and the constant closeups of decayed flesh echo the master's best works.Director Bianchi uses the living dead army well and keeps them busy chasing a party of bad actors. The overlit nature of the photography robs the horror scenes of atmosphere at times but the simple electronic soundtrack keeps everything on a strange note.For fans of schlock there is plenty to enjoy. The flesh tearing and munching scenes are very graphic and the location  an old monastery  is suitably evocative.Valid in spite of its aesthetic deficiencies.".

Again we have the evil Knights Templar out for an evening of murder and mayhem at a village festival celebrating their deaths.  The film drags a bit in the beginning and the dubbing is rather poor on the Anchor Bay videodespite advertising subtitles instead.  But once the leprous rotting decaying Knights break from their earthy pits to exact their vengeance on the villagers the film starts and remains at a high fast tense frightening pace with some wonderful filmed images.  The basic premise of the film has a group of survivors holed up in a Church and what becomes of them through the dark night.  The acting is fair and the actor playing the mayor is humorous in a way.  If you enjoyed the first film I am sure you will like this sequel.  I look forward with anticipation to watching the third and fourth installments of this gothic moody series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reutrn of the Blind Dead is a slightly higher budget remake of Tombs of the Blind Dead. Return maintains the intriguing premise and textural richness of the first while also achieving a slightly faster pace and more accessible story. In all fairness Return is a remake in spirit only. The story arch and conflict differs very much from the first film. In the earlier film the director lavished time and extended shot composition to create a creepy mood. This second installment develops characters more and explores how some of the monsters may still be alive.This series has gained a cult following for a few reasons. First the premise of long dead satanic knight zombies mixes history occultism and gory monsters. Such a mix is near perfection in the overly exploited zombie genre. Second the stories are rather simple and straight forward. The director is clearly not attempting to create a nuanced and subtle piece of storytelling. Rather the films are a notable for the visual and color textures. The zombies are a wonderful combination of desiccated flesh and bones wrapped in earth hardened tunics. In addition these knights attack in force both on foot and on zombie horseback. The costuming and makeup effects are actually quite unsettling and some of the most original.While the zombies are very fun the lack of attention to story and development do hurt the film. The dialogue is simplistic and clearly serves to keep the pacing up. Whenever a movie sacrifices realistic scripting the production as a whole suffers from wooden performances and characters the audience cares little about. Return having made the above scripting sacrifice comes off as very clichd poorly acted and at times outright stupid. An important note is that even with these negative points the film still maintains a sense of excitement horror and fun. Return is a b zombie film and all of the staff know it. In a sense this film deserves to be judged by more lenient b criteria. By evaluating this film on less strict criterion Return is a success. The Editing is well done and maintains a good exciting pace. The acting is wooden which inevitably leads to unintended humor and laughs. The zombies are the star and clearly have been developed lovingly. The score is a mix of cheesy music and stereotypically creepy sound effects. This film attacks its goal with both a high degree of technical skill and an even higher degree of pride. Will this film ever make a come back and receive awards? No it will not. Will this film stand the test of time and be referenced for many years to come by horror enthusiasts? Yes it most definitely will. All in all this is a fun film that has a unique if campy perspective on zombies.On a personal note I have really taken to this series. The premise visual textures creepy locations and unplanned humor combine to make these films a pleasure to watch. These make great movie night fare when with horror buffs. In addition this series provides a great many examples of the wonderful techniques used in earlier horror. A great many films of today are clearly influenced by the likes of the blind dead.".

	schema:reviewBody "With Tombs of the Blind Dead being the absolute greatest and most original Spanish exploitation film from the seventies it was inevitable that a series of sequels would follow and fans could only hope that they were going to be half as good as the supersinister original. Mission accomplished as far as I'm concerned because this first followup in Amando de Ossorio's lifework already is a thoroughly exciting and occasionally very creepy horror highlight. The story develops itself very simple and logical and viewing the original isn't even required in order to enjoy this bloodsoaked sequel. Once again we're introduced to the Templar knights at first through a flashback in which these maniacal horsemen are publicly lynched by an angry mob of villagers. Even their eyes are burned out with torches just in case they would ever return from the dead to wreak havoc. Exactly 500 years later a small Portuguese community celebrates this historical victory but the local hunchback performs a sacrificial rite that unleashes the Templarskeletons and their zombiehorses from the nearby ruins where they were buried. A small group of people among which the cowardly mayor his fiance and her former lover initially entrench themselves in the local chapel but their blind attackers have endless patience and wait until personal vendettas and acts of desperation bring out the survivors one by one...Amando de Ossorio vividly remembers all the suspense aspects that made Tombs of the Blind Dead truly creepy and he shamelessly reuses them here in the first sequel. This means you may expect many extended sequences of the Templars riding their horses through the countryside in slow motion and guided by unsettling music. Despite also lacking the surpriseelement of the original Return of the Blind Dead remains a fairly original horror movie that makes full use of its extraordinary 'monsters'. The Templars are genuine zombies resurrected from the grave but primarily they're organized soldiers driven by revenge and not by hunger for human flesh. This somehow makes them a lot creepier than your average decomposing corpses that stumble around looking for brains to feed on. Particularly considering its time and budget this film is truly gore and gruesome. We're treated to several closeup sword stabbings and even a clean decapitation that horror fans will definitely appreciate. The makeup effects are surprisingly professional and the spilled blood remarkably looks like the thick red liquid used in contemporary Hammer films. Of course the film isn't entirely flawless as there are some obvious continuity errors and immense holes in the plot. The anticlimax ending is incredibly clumsy as well and only trained exploitationfans will be able to look past that. Nevertheless a highly recommended film experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a bit of a spoiler below which could ruin the surprise of the ONE unexpected and truly funny scene in this film.  There is also information about the first film in this series.I caught this film on DVD which someone gave as a gift to my roommate.  It came as a set together with the first film in the Blind Dead series.This movie was certainly much worse than the first La Noche del Terror Ciego. In addition many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly.  To boot the movie was dubbed in English the first was subtitled which I tend to find distracting.The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals.  Upon discovery of these crimes the local peasantry put the Templars to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used thus preventing them from returning from Hell to exact their revenge.  We then jump to modern times where because of some event the Templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place.  Of course since the undead knights have no eyes they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise.The Templars were a secretive order from about the 12th century coming out of the Crusades.  They were only around for about 150 years before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others.  Because they were secretive there were always rumors about their ceremonies particularly for initiation.  Also because of the way the society was organized you didn't necessarily have church officials overseeing things which meant they didn't have an inside man when things heated up.  And because of the nature of their trials they were tortured into confessions. The order was strongest in France but did exist in Portugal and Spain where the movies take place.Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin breast shots here of course this is a horror film after all and then once the knights come back to life they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood in this sequel this all disappears.  You still have the same scene redone not the same footage of them sacrificing the virgin but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that. Thus when they come back they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death which I have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience.  There's also a time problem in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake which would date it around 1473.  And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well.  In the first they have them pecked out by crows.  Now they are simply burned out and in quite a ridiculous manner.Oh yeah and maybe it was just me but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film despite having died.  Not really a problem since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation but odd nonetheless.The highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep.  The child's father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep so he walks out and tells her to find her father.  It comes somewhat out of the blue and is easily the funniest scene in the film.  Of course why the child doesn't die at this point is beyond me and disappointed for horror fans.I couldn't possibly recommend this film to anyone.  It isn't so bad that it becomes funny so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film.  The bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded.  When the film ends you are not surprised at the outcome at all in fact quite disappointed.  If you are into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film see the first movie which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes.".

Of course since the undead knights have no eyes they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise.The Templars were a secretive order from about the 12th century coming out of the Crusades.  They were only around for about 150 years before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others.  Because they were secretive there were always rumors about their ceremonies particularly for initiation.  Also because of the way the society was organized you didn't necessarily have church officials overseeing things which meant they didn't have an inside man when things heated up.  And because of the nature of their trials they were tortured into confessions. The order was strongest in France but did exist in Portugal and Spain where the movies take place.Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin breast shots here of course this is a horror film after all and then once the knights come back to life they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood in this sequel this all disappears.  You still have the same scene redone not the same footage of them sacrificing the virgin but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that. Thus when they come back they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death which I have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience.  There's also a time problem in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake which would date it around 1473.  And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well.  In the first they have them pecked out by crows.  Now they are simply burned out and in quite a ridiculous manner.Oh yeah and maybe it was just me but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film despite having died.  Not really a problem since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation but odd nonetheless.The highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep.  The child's father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep so he walks out and tells her to find her father.  It comes somewhat out of the blue and is easily the funniest scene in the film.  Of course why the child doesn't die at this point is beyond me and disappointed for horror fans.I couldn't possibly recommend this film to anyone.  It isn't so bad that it becomes funny so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film.  The bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded.  When the film ends you are not surprised at the outcome at all in fact quite disappointed.  If you are into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film see the first movie which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes.";

Jack is able to free the gateway by exploding some leftover firecrackers into the bodies of two guardian knights freeing those citizens who were able to flee from the slashing long strokes of the Templar swords. As certain Templar soldiers on horseback bunched villagers into a bundle faces met the hacking blades. Dropping like flies Jack bands some courageous men together with wooden pitchforks to battle with the knights on their horseback with far better weaponry. But those citizens who are indeed able to rush out from the plaza gateway will not get very far..trying to flee we see that the Templar knights have struck them down in a longshot of dead bodies lying in mass over the countryside. Jack Duncan..his wife and daughter Vivian Dacosta Moncha  Beirao however are able to hold up in a nearby Bouzano parish as the Templar knights await them outside. Jack as leader will try to find a way to see the group through the horrors that possibly lie in wait as others plan their own escape routes especially the mayorthis guy is a real piece of work I'll tell you he even tries to use a little girl as a distraction to escapewho only wishes to escape without one care in the world for the others in the church. Murdo the very one responsible for the terrors taking place is found hiding in the parish..he has a plan to guide Moncha through a secret tunnel not letting any of the others in on it. Will the group make it out of the parish alive? Or will the Templar knights eventually wait for them to merely fall apart at the seams?To be honest I myself found this second film of the series to be far superior to Tombs of the Blind Dead. I think this film is more focused and scarier with a better cast of characters. I even felt the Templar knights are scarier in this sequel than the original..their slow walk isn't a major problem in this sequel because there are so many of them. I couldn't help but compare the Templar knight zombies to those seaweed ghouls of John Carpenter's THE FOG in how they seem to be everywhere with little room for the characters to escape. If one thinks about it the church sequences in this sequel and THE FOG resemble somewhat as well..characters trying to remain levelheaded in quite a terrifying situation holing up in a church while undead monsters seeking revenge for what happened to them in the past await outside. This sequel has lots of bloodshed..swords are always plunging into stomachs chests or slashing across faces. The Templar knights are pretty much the same as they were in the original film but no less effective. I think their better utilized in this sequelremake because of the setpieces set up in the film...the massacre in the plaza and the holdup at the parish. Director Ossorio certainly has a flair for shooting those creepy Templar knights as their rotted skulls peek out from those dusty cloaks. They rise from their graves essentially the same way they do in the previous Tombs of the Blind Dead..but as before this sequence is quite eerie and effective. If you can tolerate the melodrama between Jack Vivian the Mayor  Dacosta there's so much to enjoy. I just think this is a good little Gothic zombie flick. Easily the film's most graphic scene comes when we see the Templar knights in human form as one of them removes the heart from the chest of a poor female sacrifice eating it! Good beheading in this flick as well.".

On the other hand this fright film has almost no dreary lulls to speak of substantially benefiting from a tightly wound plot a quick snappy pace more dynamic direction and an invigorating sense of ripsnorting vitality noticeably lacking in the previous movie.This time the murderous cannibalistic Knights Templar a dastardly group of Devilworshiping monks who drink human blood in order to acquire immortality are resurrected 500 years after they were slaughtered by the townspeople of a small Portuguese so they can butcher the ancestors of their killers during an annual gala bicentennial festival. With their hideous skulllike faces hollow eye sockets and filthy flowing white robes the Knights Templar qualify as genuinely scary and unnerving supernatural zombie menaces. The various attack scenes are executed with a truly rousing panache the fight between the townspeople and the Knights Templar in the village square is quite thrilling. There's even some nice touches of irony sprinkled throughout with the ultimate dismal fates of the contemptibly craven nocount mayor excellently played with hammy lan by rotund Italian spaghetti Western regular Fernando Sancho and the crippled local dolt being especially spoton. Furthermore the film earns bonus points for its grimly serious takenoprisoners tone A little girl who's put in considerable jeopardy loses both her parents to the unrelenting Knights Templar. And those strikingly ghostly slow motion shots of the Knights Templar riding their horses across the desolate countryside possess an amazingly eerie poetic quality. So if you only see one Blind Dead outing in your lifetime make sure it's this pleasingly lively and on the money entry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Less of a sequel and more of a remake this 2nd movie about the Blind Dead re hashes the whole scenario including the origin story and just remakes the first movie all over again with not very many new ideas.This time it's a whole village that is terrorised. Due to the actions of an imbecilic villager the log dead Templars are fed with blood and come out of their graves to wreak more havoc. The village suffers an invasion during a night of celebrations and many deaths occur before the Templars are defeated.The recycling of material from the first movie is very lazy. We have the same gory flashback to a sacrifice of a young girl rubber boobs being cut up with a knife again we have the slow motion clipclopping horses the moaning and clanking soundtrack and the macho fights over women by several boorish male villagers. Luckily the film benefits from very real settings of the village and ruined abbeycastle and the look of the ghouls themselves still packs a punch. The effects are not very good. In the crowd scenes it's very obvious that some of the zombies are just immobile skulls on sticks with a tatty robe thrown over them  especially when they are beaten down and collapse immediately like a pile of cardboard tubes and coat hangers. A few set pieces however really do work firstly when the evil major uses a small child as bait ! in order to selfishly escape from the monsters. This is a very effective sequence and the poor girl looks convincingly unhappy upon finding herself among the skeletal mob. Don't worry the evil major pays heavily for this craven behaviour! The second effective sequence is the climax when the survivors attempt to creep past the blind dead as dawn breaks...this is great film making and works despite the rest of the films cheap effects.On the whole though it's only a remake of the original which has so many original touches it was a hard act to follow. But follow it they did and then again two more times after this one!".

We have the same gory flashback to a sacrifice of a young girl rubber boobs being cut up with a knife again we have the slow motion clipclopping horses the moaning and clanking soundtrack and the macho fights over women by several boorish male villagers. Luckily the film benefits from very real settings of the village and ruined abbeycastle and the look of the ghouls themselves still packs a punch. The effects are not very good. In the crowd scenes it's very obvious that some of the zombies are just immobile skulls on sticks with a tatty robe thrown over them  especially when they are beaten down and collapse immediately like a pile of cardboard tubes and coat hangers. A few set pieces however really do work firstly when the evil major uses a small child as bait ! in order to selfishly escape from the monsters. This is a very effective sequence and the poor girl looks convincingly unhappy upon finding herself among the skeletal mob. Don't worry the evil major pays heavily for this craven behaviour! The second effective sequence is the climax when the survivors attempt to creep past the blind dead as dawn breaks...this is great film making and works despite the rest of the films cheap effects.On the whole though it's only a remake of the original which has so many original touches it was a hard act to follow. But follow it they did and then again two more times after this one!";

	schema:headline " Spanish Gothic horror is atmospheric gruesome and a personal favourite";
	schema:reviewBody "Forget the naysayers  RETURN OF THE EVIL DEAD is everything you could want from a cool Spanish horror movie. An attractive cast fun dialogue a smattering of gore fast pacing and exceptional photography highlight Amando de Ossorio's own followup to TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD as well as the fact that the film is actually scary! Yes the undead Knights Templar are back in another separate story and with lots of screen time to their credit they're just as terrifying as before  especially when Ossorio dubs them in with weird supernatural cries and creaking noises. Okay so the story is familiar and the film holds few surprises for the horror fan but everything is done so efficiently you don't mind the clichd feel.The opening is a superb minimovie in itself as we witness the Knights Templar cutting open the breast of a captive girl and draining her bright red blood into a bowl from which they then drink. They're interrupted by the classic group of torchwielding villagers who actually put their torches to good use this time by burning out the eyes of the Templars in an extremely graphic fashion! The evil knights are then burned alive for good measure just as the credits begin to play.What follows is familiar stuff the Templars return from their graves only fifteen minutes into the film so no waiting around! and attack an isolated house inhabited only by a man and a girl. He is throttled she narrowly escapes by stealing one of the undead horses in an exceptionally thrilling  and frightening  scene in which the space she has to escape keeps getting less and less until she's forced to jump out of the window onto a nearby horse. She escapes to the town square where party revellers are enjoy plenty of booze and fireworks. Minutes later the Templars arrive and slaughter half of the townsfolk in an excellentshot massacre in which you can almost smell the blood and steel as it puts you right in the thick of the action.After the actions of a brave few who put up a fight the rest of the townsfolk escape into the countryside later on in another solemn and horrific shot we see a field littered with the bodies of the dead exemplifying the hopelessness of the situations our characters are in. A group of survivors escape on their jeep only to be pursued by the Templars on horseback through the streets of the village an excellent chase sequence which was ripped off in JURASSIC PARK with a Tyrannosaur replacing the zombies. They escape into the refuge of a church and the film enters familiar NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD territory as the zombies surround the place and attempt to get in.This is a pretty mean spirited film. For instance one sub plot shows two characters painfully unblocking a tunnel for what seems like an age and finally escaping into a remote graveyard only to be instantly killed by the waiting Templars for all their hard work. Loads of cast members are brutally murdered in graphically gory scenes which have been excised from the UK print not sure why as they're gory for the time but not THAT gory these days for maximum impact. The interesting twist ending with more than a nod to THE BIRDS has the Templars being caught in the rays of sunlight and literally disintegrating before the eyes of our heroes.The group of survivors holed up in the church are an interesting bunch. Firstly we have the hero as played by Italian star Tony Kendall more at home in European spy and adventure flicks who supplies the film with muchneeded masculine energy and heroism. He's supported by a trio of Spanish beauties who inevitably end up being menaced by the zombies. Other folks include the village idiot Muerto an exceptionally creepy guy with one dead arm who spies on people making love an illfated family the selfish and cowardly mayor who causes others to die in his own attempts to escape and the mayor's righthand who has a change of heart and helps our heroes before his sexual desires get the better of him and he attempts to rape the heroine.The gory effects are cheap but hit home thanks to a good use of shocking music at the right time. There's an excruciating handlopping sequence a surprise decapitation an impaling and lots of dripping blood and other splattery stuff to enjoy. The effects of the Knights Templars on the other hand are excellent with the exception of the two guards who are blown up by fireworks and just look like scarecrows and once again Ossorio uses slowmotion to capture and highlight the eeriness of his zombies as they rise from their graves with their skeletal hands and ride through the countryside on horseback. RETURN OF THE EVIL DEAD is a fine Spanish horror yarn a good example of the genre and matching the best that Britain and America had to offer at the same time. Lots of action lots of fun and a jolly good viewing experience.".

Ther is a very silly scene two people trying to sneak out from a tunnel n when one of em is beheaded by the the evil Templar standing above the hole the other person is still standing next to the hole. The guy who played the mayor looked like Ron Jeremy. This movie may have its flaws but Amando De Ossorio does a great job using slowmo and an eerie score to intensify the film. The editing was shoddy. The skeletons attacking the village people n the aftermath fighting was tedious. The ending however is a complete disappointment there's no spectacular showdown the zombie skeletons just killed by sunlight. The ending of the first part was much better than this.".

The body count is thus much greater than the first movie which featured only a small band of heroes and antiheroes against the skeletons on horses.The violence is also much increased. This version features an impaling a limb being hacked off and in one particularly memorable scene a beheading. The festivalattack scene is nowhere near as violent as it could be. I guess it is harder to use those kinds of special effects the more people are on screen? Either way it is not until the end that the movie turns really violent.It is also not until the end that the movie turns scary. If you watch a lot of horror movies you know genuine fear is actually a rare emotion to feel during one's runtime. Like the original Return of the Evil Dead manages genuine tension thanks to the impressive set up the movie ends with and the minimalist heartpounding soundtrack. It is scarier than the original and in my opinion superior.It also features a moronic monobrowhaving halfwit who reminded me of Gotho from Paul Naschy's Hunchback of the Morgue. The scene where he sticks his head out only to be beheaded unbeknownst to the lady he is trying to save  until blood starts flowing down his arm  is a work of art.One thing that makes this movie more effective is its refusal to bow to the same old morality lessons Hollywood movies always feature it is Spanish. Everyone knows that in mainstream American films if a character acts brave or puts themselves on the line for another that character will survive the situation. In Return of the Evil Dead they don't. This ups the tension because you can see they're not playing by the same rules we're all familiar with and you really don't know what's going to happen next.".

But soon the eyeless zombies will be rising from their graves to attack the citizens and put a bloody end to the festivities.The central set piece around the halfway point is exhilarating. It features a fair bit of quick cuts and moving camera. Still despite all of the violence things never do get that gory which will disappoint various horror fans in the audience. The plotting also is decidedly more conventional with a bunch of disparate characters forced to hole up inside an old church in classic Night of the Living Dead style. And true to the nature of that films' story the people here are at odds with each other.Studly Tony Kendall makes for a believable hero while Fernando Sancho creates an effectively loathsome character with his portrayal of the worthless mayor a man who thinks nothing of making a little girl serve as a distraction for his attempted getaway. They're joined by the enchanting Esperanza Roy as the mayor's wife Vivian with whom Kendall's Jack Marlowe has a history Frank Brana as the mayor's sidekick Luis Barboo as one of the villainous knights and two holdovers from the first film Lone Fleming playing Amalia and Jose Thelman playing Juan. Jose Canalejas is deliciously creepy as the keeper Murdo he's got a great character face.The ending should have viewers all tensed up wondering if our last survivors standing will be able to pull off their escape attempt.This is about on a par with Tombs of the Blind Dead.Seven out of 10.".

I really liked it but it lacks the atmospheric pleasures of the first entry. It's not as old school. There is more gore in Return of the Evil Dead too which I dig. It reminded me more of Burial Ground and you can totally see where that movie came from.The Blue Underground version is masterfully redone the sound and picture are great and the packaging is attractive.6 out of 10 kids.".

I really liked it but it lacks the atmospheric pleasures of the first entry. It's not as old school. There is more gore in Return of the Evil Dead too which I dig. It reminded me more of Burial Ground and you can totally see where that movie came from.The Blue Underground version is masterfully redone the sound and picture are great and the packaging is attractive.6 out of 10 kids.";

As Chris and his buddies  each of whom comes for a different reason  must free a Mexican village imprisoned by nasty outlaws Emilio Fernandez  Rodolfo Acosta in similar roles to Calvera's Elli Wallach who are devastating the small location . All of them get a chance to redeem themselves . Later on  the group develops a plan to secure the villagers defend it against enemy attack.Chris character was played by Yul Brynner in two occasions and one performed by Lee Van Cleef and George Kennedy . Brynner as a twofisted pistolero is very good  in fact  it was Yul Brynner who approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of doing a Western adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic The seven Samurais. Yul insisted he would only make this film if Steve McQueen was not involved  McQueen felt the plot was too absurd and for this and other reasons was not interested anyway . The story is similar to previous entry  including customary outlaw band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse characters as well as speciality  as dynamite or guns . The film gets action Western  exciting riding shootouts it's funny and entertaining  although nothing new but displays a slight style . The movie contains some moment of violence and even touching on the relationships between the villagers and the Magnificent. Being a SpanishUS coproduction  there appears several actors usual in SpaghettiPaella Western such as Julian Mateos  Ricardo Palacios  Elisa Montes  Carlos Casaravilla and Fernando Rey playing his ordinary role as a priest . This is a passable though inferior sequel from the original and enduringly popular The magnificent seven John Sturges1960 that is equally remake of The seven samurais Akira Kurosawa .

Appropriate cinematography by expert cameraman Paul Vogel  filmed on location in Colmenar  Alicante  Nuevo Baztn Madrid Samuel Bronston Studios Madrid and  of course  Almeria  Spain . Although this film revisits the village from the first movie it was shot in Spain not Mexico.

The dialogue is OK and has some nice lines but it'll never match that used in the first film.  The outcome is obvious and no real surprise.The characters are less well defined.  In the first movie all of the seven had a presence  mainly due to them all trying to outdo Brynner watch McQueen  very few lines but he is always doing something in the background.  Here most of them are nameless and you would struggle to name more than three they all seem happy to let Brynner be the star  only Fuller and Oates really stick in the memory.  Even the bad guy is poor  before he was an oppressor without care or reason here he is a slave trader but he also has a history that gives him a sympathetic edge  but do you want that in a bad guy?Overall this is an OK western but when you match it up with the original film then you automatically put it in a huge shadow that it can't get out of.

	schema:reviewBody "One of my alltime favourite music scores is Elmer Bernstein's thrilling theme from 'The Magnificent Seven'. I was practically dancing in my seat when I got to hear it again during the opening sequence in 'Return Of The Seven' the first of 3 sequels to John Sturges' classic western. My enthusiasm was shortlived. Bernstein and star Yul Brynner are the only major players to return for this 1966 rehashing of the first picture. Their work is solideven though they just do the same things they did in Sturges' filmbut writer Larry Cohen and director Burt Kennedy don't have any new ideas of their own.It's impossible to replace actors like Steve McQueen Eli Wallach James Coburn and Charles Bronson with Warren Oates Fernando Rey and a slew of unknowns but that must have been the best they could do. It's just as foolish to remake the remake let's not forget that 'Magnificent' was a redo of Kurosawa's 'The Seven Samurai'. A completely different story might have worked better. Since only 3 of the original 7 survivedand neither McQueen or Horst Buchholz return as Vin or Chicoyou can't help noticing that the B team is just not good enough to match what the A team did with Brynner in 1960.So brace yourself as Chris Adams Brynner and company ride into battle against Mexican bandits all over again. This time they've got to save Chico and the other male villagers they saved years before. Same result? Not telling but there are 1 or 2 fun moments along the way. Any excuse to hear Bernstein's music is a good excuse especially when the movie is on free TV. All the same I think I'll skip the other sequels. 'Return Of The Seven' isn't horsepoo but it's certainly not worthy of riding with 'The Magnificent Seven' either.".

	schema:headline " Poor script good action";
	schema:reviewBody "In some ways it almost seems unfair to compare a sequel to the original that we should judge it on it's own merits. However usually the only reason we are watching a sequel is because of the original so my review consists primarily in comparison.The most interesting thing about Return is how hard the makers tried to make it like the original. They were largely successful. Burt Kennedy's direction is good and recreates the visual feel of the original. Of course Bernstein's score highlights the film. The story different in particulars is goes through essentially the same stages armed men attack the village the call for help the gathering of the seven traveling to the village defying the villain the first attack beaten off a pause where we get to know the characters and their motivations better the final attack. The only difference is that the villagers do not 'betray' their protectors as in the Magnificent Seven. A character even sneaks into the enemy camp in much the same fashion as in the earlier movie.The real weakness of the sequel is the script. Along with the excellent acting and music the dialogue in the first film was very well written and something of a departure from earlier westerns. It was terse oftentimes funny filled with meaning. In Return the delivery and the tone is the same but the words spoken so solemnly are utterly commonplace and with no humor. Robert Fuller would have been a good replacement for McQueen but the character is written completely differently and is far less interesting. The acting also is inferior to the first film.Another problem with the film is the portrayal of the peasants. They are a not characters as in The Magnificent Seven but a mass. This film is solely about the 7 Americans riding to the rescue to the rescue of defenseless peasants and at times seems to have a prointervention proVietnam? political subtext that the in first film which was a translation of Seven Samurai to the New World was either absent or more subtle.All this said and out of the way film has lots of action a good score and Yul Brynner who is always fun to watch in a western whether it is The Magnificent Seven or Adios Sabata. Fans of westerns and action films will probably find it entertaining.Familiar face Emilio Fernandez who played Lorca acted in over 70 films starting in Mexico and wrote and directed many of them. The relationship between his character his dead sons and Chris could have made a very compelling film. Unfortunately it was not expanded on.".

The story different in particulars is goes through essentially the same stages armed men attack the village the call for help the gathering of the seven traveling to the village defying the villain the first attack beaten off a pause where we get to know the characters and their motivations better the final attack. The only difference is that the villagers do not 'betray' their protectors as in the Magnificent Seven. A character even sneaks into the enemy camp in much the same fashion as in the earlier movie.The real weakness of the sequel is the script. Along with the excellent acting and music the dialogue in the first film was very well written and something of a departure from earlier westerns. It was terse oftentimes funny filled with meaning. In Return the delivery and the tone is the same but the words spoken so solemnly are utterly commonplace and with no humor. Robert Fuller would have been a good replacement for McQueen but the character is written completely differently and is far less interesting. The acting also is inferior to the first film.Another problem with the film is the portrayal of the peasants. They are a not characters as in The Magnificent Seven but a mass. This film is solely about the 7 Americans riding to the rescue to the rescue of defenseless peasants and at times seems to have a prointervention proVietnam? political subtext that the in first film which was a translation of Seven Samurai to the New World was either absent or more subtle.All this said and out of the way film has lots of action a good score and Yul Brynner who is always fun to watch in a western whether it is The Magnificent Seven or Adios Sabata. Fans of westerns and action films will probably find it entertaining.Familiar face Emilio Fernandez who played Lorca acted in over 70 films starting in Mexico and wrote and directed many of them. The relationship between his character his dead sons and Chris could have made a very compelling film. Unfortunately it was not expanded on.";

He's got all these peasants working as slave labors to rebuild a church as a monument to his two dead sons. The man's trolley has definitely slipped his tracks.I guess I miss Eli Wallach from the original. I found Fernandez's character to be just too off the mark for me. I can't believe his own men are standing for what he wants.Just as Steve McQueen came from western television so does his replacement Robert Fuller fresh from the Laramie series. Fuller is competent enough but does not have McQueen's charisma by a stretch. Too bad they couldn't get Steve McQueen to repeat his role.The other four of the new Seven are Jordan Christopher Claude Akins Warren Oates and Rudolfo Acosta. All of them fill roles that we've come to expect of them. Julian Mateos takes Horst Bucholtz's part a more mature Chico to be sure.You could not have done this film without that wonderful Elmer Bernstein theme again. What I can't understand is why his score was nominated again as there was nothing original in it.Return of the Seven is a decent enough remake but it ain't a patch on the original.".

	schema:headline " Return of the Seven Boasts Its Own Virtues!";
	schema:reviewBody "No Burt Kennedy's Return of the Seven doesn't surpass the John Sturges classic western The Magnificent Seven. Remember however the Sturges film itself was a remake of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's The Seventh Samurai. First I contend that The Magnificent Seven is one of the top ten best westerns. Second I get a kick out of watching Return of the Seven for its own modest virtues. This sagebrusher came about as a result of the sequel craze in the 1960s. After the tension on the set of The Magnificent Seven with Yul Brynner Steve McQueen refused to play second fiddle again to 'the King.' Anyway McQueen's star was rising while Brynner's stardom was waning.It is important to remember the theatrical title too because it is Return of the Seven with the omission of the adjective Magnificent. Indeed Brynner is the only one who made it back for the sequel. McQueen refused to and Horst Buchholz had disappeared in Europe making other movies.Mind you around this time the Europeans had spawned the socalled 'Spaghetti' western craze. Moreover the Franco government in Spain subsidized filmmakers and the roughhewn Spanish scenery substituted more than adequately for the frontier American Southwest. While the scenery is more interesting to admire the music stands out by itself and the corpses outnumber the horses tentoone you know that you're watching a 'Spaghetti' western. Oh yeah if the dialogue isn't lipsynched you know you're watching a 'Spaghetti' western. Consequently the Mirish Production company must have felt that they could knock out a sequel very inexpensively in Spain. Reportedly the Alicante location where they filmed Return of the Seven had not been used in a picture. Unquestionably Return of the Seven looks like an epic western and Paul Vogel's cinematography is a feast for the eyes. Everybody looks really picturesque when they shoot their guns in this western. Burt Kennedy's Seven surpasses Sturges' Seven only in terms of its rugged breathtaking scenery Vogel's ace cinematography and the lavish production values. Burt Kennedy stages some exception gunfights but he cannot top the vintage Sturges shootouts.Return of the Seven picks up years after the Sturges epic. An insane rancher decides to honor the memory of his two dead sons by abducting the farmers of several villages and having them build a shrinea churchto commemorate his sons. Right off Return of the Seven differs from The Magnificent Seven. Francisco Lorca Emilio Fernndez of The Wild Bunch looms above all as a law unto himself whereas Calvera Eli Wallach was a cunning ruthless bandit that lived outside the law. These films have different villains. One of the villages that Lorca's men raid and enslave is Chico's village. Julian Mateos takes over the role that Horst Buchholz created.The worst scene is the first between Chris Yul Brynner and Vin Robert Fuller of Laramie at the bullfight. Vin sidles up alongside Chris makes up a story that he is looking to collect bounty on Chris. Scenarist Larry Cohen of the It's Alive trilogy could have contrived a better reunion scene. Although Cohen received credit for writing the screenplay all the dialogue sounds like something that Burt Kennedy would have written for Randolph Scott on those Budd Boetticher westerns of the 1950s. My favorite line is when Chris and Vin meet again during a cockfighting tournament and talk about their luck rounding up candidates. Vin asks Are they any good? Chris retorts They're alive. Staying alive is what Return of the Seven is all about. Meanwhile Cohen replays themes from the original. The villagers huddle in a rainy church and admit their fear of anything.The cast differs obviously and so do the characters. Burt Kennedy's Seven is harsh definitely less sentimental than the Sturges Seven. Some of these guys rub each other raw. Chris averts a gunfight between the loquacious Colbee Warren Oates of Ride the High Country and the tightlipped Frank Claude Atkins of A Man Called Sledge in one scene. Is he faster than you Chris Frank asks. I'd hate to have the live on the difference Chris observes. I'd heard this line in Rio Bravo but it fares better here. Another great scene occurs earlier when Chris buys Frank out of jail. He killed five men in a gunfight complains the jailer about the amount of Chris' bribe. I could make it six growls Frank. The bargain is sealed. The dialogue in this scene compares with the dialogue in the Charles Bronson scene in the original Seven. This time the Seven confront at least fifty gunmen twenty or so more than in the first picture. Interestingly Chris gets not only Frank but also Luis Emilio Delgado Verglio Teixeira of The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad from the local jail. This anticipates the classic Lee Marvin war movie The Dirty Dozen. Another scene that matched the original is the initial hero and the villains confrontation. Chris rides boldly into the construction site and demands the release of Chico and everybody else to the incredulity of Lorca's secondincommand Lopez Rodolfo Acosta of Rio Conchos who replies I could have you shot like that. Lopez snaps. There are five Winchesters pointed at your head. Chris is far more audacious than he ever was in The Magnificent Seven. Emilio Fernndez is a splendid foll0wup to Eli Wallach. In real life Wallach was gentle whereas Fernndez was violent handy with a gun literally a gangsta of sorts. He looks like he means business as the villain in Return of the Seven. Like Yul Brynner Elmer Bernstein encores his original Oscar nominated orchestral soundtrack and amazingly he received another nomination for it. If you haven't seen the first Seven you could swear that Bernstein created the score for the sequel!".

The only character returning was Yul Brenner. he looked as if he was going through the motions to collect a check to pay the rent. The outstanding cast that made The Magnificent Seven what it was was not equaled in any measure by the replacements. Even the addition of Steve McQueen couldn't have saved this film. And the bad guy? Give me a break! Eli Wallach was a consummate outlaw and I don't even know the name of the baddie in this film  he is so forgettable.This film should not have been made. It shames the memory of The Magnificent Seven.";

The characters are not developed so we don't connect with them  and we hardly care when some of them die. This sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original.".

Fernando Rey also appears as a morally conflicted priest who wants a church for his pilgrims but disagrees with Fernandez's methods to achieve that goal. Each of the characters has a cross to bear and as in the original we learn about their path to redemption throughout the story. Elmer Bernstein's familiar score is once again on display and Burt Kennedy's experience with the genre is evident in his handling of the subject matter.But despite a good cast Return is just an inferior remake the dialogue is at times overly sentimental and the characters aren't as well drawn as in the original just shallow replicas.

	schema:reviewBody "The first of three followups to the John Sturges' western classic The Magnificent Seven is a prototypic sequel if there ever was one. It's a totally redundant and uninvolving rehash of the original that you nevertheless don't mind watching purely for popcorn entertainment value. The plot is almost identical the lead actor reprises his role although he doesn't seem all too happy about that and some of the original characters are there as well albeit portrayed by different inferior actors. I had some personal reasons for desperately wanting to see the film including this being one of the first scripts written by Larry Cohen and Warren Oates in one of his prePeckinpah roles but I could have guessed The Return of the Seven would be a forgettable and second class western. A large posse of bandits have kidnapped Chico who suddenly looks a whole lot more Mexican than in the original film and the rest of the male population in the original village to works as slaves. Under the reign of a man named Lorca they are forced to build a church monument in honor of his executed sons. Chris and a different Vin round up four more triggerhappy gunslingers to save the day. Most of the sequences in this film are actually shameless copies from the highlights of the original. The recruitment of the shooters goes a little quicker but they still use the same counting gestures. Why is it that cool stuff from the originals always looks silly in sequels? Chris' character also has become some kind of allknowing philosophizing prophet. He speaks the absolute minimum but nonetheless makes people question themselves. Usually he just goes standing next to them and they begin talking wholeheartedly about their lives and issues. Chris merely just replies with one sentence but apparently this is enough to make them contemplate everything all over again. The other characters on the other hand are colorless and dull. Vin and Chico are only shadows of what they used to be and the others are merely just caricatures. Claude Akins as the silent and embittered loner and Warren Oates as the sneaky womanizer to name just two. The shootout sequences are pretty boring and unexciting. Elmer Bernstein's music is still a joy to listen to but also that is exactly the same as in the original.".

This sequel released around 6 years later can't even aspire as 'magnificent' but it's still an enjoyable western flick with hour and a half of pure classic escapism. Yul Brynner returns to the role of the leader of the pack Chris Larabee Adams this time recruiting Robert Fuller fresh from the TV Shows Laramie and Wagon Train playing here the Steve MacQueen's role of Vin Tannen Julian Mateos playing Horst Buchholz's role of Chico Claude Atkins from Rio Bravo as Frank Portuguese actor Virgilio Teixeira as Luis Delgado Sam Peckinpah's 'usual suspect' Warren Oates as Colbee and Jordan Christopher in his screen debut as Manuel. The plot is a rehash from the first film with some interesting ideas thrown into it that could have produced a better movie if the budget was higher the writing had been revised the development expanded and the directing less pedestrian.6 years had passed and Chico is still living in the small village working as a farmer with his wife Petra Elisa Monts on Rosenda Monteros' role. One day a crazy bandido named Lorca Emilio Fernandez from The Wild Bunch and his army of onehundred men invade the village and kidnap all the male farmers to do slavery work on a 'villa' located in the middle of the desert rebuilding a Church in homage to Lorcas's two dead sons. Petra begs Chris for help and again with his 'secondincommand' Vin they must recruit 5 more 'magnificent men' to rescue Chico and the poor villagers from Lorca's evil hands. Yul Brynner is always cool to follow with his deep  imposing voice catwalk moves characteristic shaved head since The King and I and his commanding presence that can lead a bunch of misfits gunslingers to do heroic feats facing death to save a bunch of innocent peasants. Robert Fuller came from a background in television doing two western TV Shows like McQueen in the first movie that came from Wanted Dead or Alive but Fuller isn't McQueen neither Burt Kennedy is John Sturges and besides the lack of McQueen's onscreen presence and charisma his character is too shallow and very lowprofile for a second lead also the directing and writing for his character didn't help him to impose. Warren Oates leaves a positive impression his Colbee here reminds a lot of his future character in The Wild Bunch produced 3 years after this one Claude Atkins is good as the troubled Frank a man haunted by his past Virgilio Teixeira delivers as a flamboyant  womanizer character but he had too little to work with Julian Mateos is more restrained playing Chico than the 'overthetop' Horst Buchholz playing him in the original film and Jordan Christopher can't do much with only 5 or 6 lines in it but his naive  wellmeaning character became the heart of the movie. In short Return of the Seven if compared with the vastly superior The Magnificent Seven is a major disappointment especially back then when it was released but at least it's much better than the two low budget followups starring George Kennedy and Lee van Cleef playing the Chris Adams' role. Last but not the least the Elmer Bernstein's iconic orchestration in all its musical splendor is back just for it it's worth the viewing !!".

Warren Oates leaves a positive impression his Colbee here reminds a lot of his future character in The Wild Bunch produced 3 years after this one Claude Atkins is good as the troubled Frank a man haunted by his past Virgilio Teixeira delivers as a flamboyant  womanizer character but he had too little to work with Julian Mateos is more restrained playing Chico than the 'overthetop' Horst Buchholz playing him in the original film and Jordan Christopher can't do much with only 5 or 6 lines in it but his naive  wellmeaning character became the heart of the movie. In short Return of the Seven if compared with the vastly superior The Magnificent Seven is a major disappointment especially back then when it was released but at least it's much better than the two low budget followups starring George Kennedy and Lee van Cleef playing the Chris Adams' role. Last but not the least the Elmer Bernstein's iconic orchestration in all its musical splendor is back just for it it's worth the viewing !!";

Because of a terrific musical score and excellent cast the film was a resounding success. Now years later the studio is whoring out the name in a remake. I know it sounds very harsh but there is so much that disappoints in Return of the Seven.The biggest problem in this film is that of the three survivors at the end of the last film only one is played by the same actor in both films Yul Brynner. The other two are played by new actors. These two plus the new members of the group are all lightweights compared the the fine cast in the first film. Think about ithere we have the likes of Claude Akins Robert Fuller and Warren Oates instead of actors like Steve McQueen Charles Bronson and James Coburn! The second biggest problem in the sequel is that the film is pretty much the same as the first film. The SAME great music is once again here and the plot is pretty much the same as the seven rescue the exact same town that was terrorized in the first film! It cheapens the name of the franchise and offers nothing particularly new.Now the actors do try their best and the film is worth seeing as a timepasser. But it's just not a worthy sequel to one of the best westerns of the 1960sit's only a pale imitation. Interestingly the next film in the series The Guns of the Magnificent Seven is actually a bit better even though NONE of the actors playing the seven are back because at least the plot is a tiny bit different.".

By contrast Robert Fuller was virtually colorless in replacing McQueen's character Vin you almost didn't consider him to be the second in command.As for the rest Warren Oates stood out mainly by virtue of considering himself a ladies' man an idea I found I had to force myself to acknowledge for the sake of the story but it made me chuckle throughout. But he did prove to be a stand up guy for the heroes he made it a point to stay strong for the mission after the village elder tried to convince Chris Brynner that he should give up the fight.The only other character of note here was portrayed by Claude Akins in a role not unlike the one he had in the same year's Incident at Phantom Hill. In that one Akins decided it was a pretty good idea to attack six Cheyenne Indians all by himself with disastrous results. Here he decided to step in front of Brynner's character when he was about to get shot by the Mexican outlaw Lorca Emilio Fernandez. Not a good career move if this were real life.".

	schema:reviewBody "This wellshot viking movie from capable Italian director Mario Caiano offers up enough adventure and excitement to be watchable for genre fans  although the slow spots throughout the film prevent it from reaching classic status. As usual there are the requisite number of villains three this time who pose as allies until the time comes for dramatic revelations plus the pretty female love interest the brave and strong allies the warring tribes and the young noble hero as played by spagwest stalwart Guiliano Gemma. One thing the film does have as a difference is an American setting Caiano and his cameraman make great use of the scenic locations as much as possible and the result is a beautiful film to watch.The various battle sequences are energetic without being particularly skillful and utilise a fair amount of cast members.

Also popping up is DJANGO villain Eduardo Fajardo playing you guessed it another scheming villain. One thing to watch out for are the bloody inserts including a scene where a man has an axe thrown into his head  surprisingly gruesome for a mid '60s production.

	onyx:emotionText "This wellshot viking movie from capable Italian director Mario Caiano offers up enough adventure and excitement to be watchable for genre fans  although the slow spots throughout the film prevent it from reaching classic status. As usual there are the requisite number of villains three this time who pose as allies until the time comes for dramatic revelations plus the pretty female love interest the brave and strong allies the warring tribes and the young noble hero as played by spagwest stalwart Guiliano Gemma. One thing the film does have as a difference is an American setting Caiano and his cameraman make great use of the scenic locations as much as possible and the result is a beautiful film to watch.The various battle sequences are energetic without being particularly skillful and utilise a fair amount of cast members. They pop up often enough to make the film bearable and the slow spots usually concentrate on the bad guys and their scheming which is always interesting.

	schema:headline " Dr Phibes' return isn't quite as good as it was first time round";
	schema:reviewBody "Dr Phibes Rises Again is the sequel to the magnificent 'The Abominable Dr Phibes'. The original film achieved cult classic status through a magnificent performance from Vincent Price as the vengeful doctor of the title and an over the top absurd camp styling that set it apart from most other films in it's field. Both of these ingredients are present for the sequel but it doesn't succeed like the first one did because there's just something missing. The sequel sees Dr Phibes 'rise again' upon the moon aligning itself in a certain way or something and travelling to Egypt to find a river that will grant him and his neither living nor completely dead beloved immortality. However things aren't so simple because the scrolls that lead the way to the river have been stolen and Phibes has a contender someone that needs to find the river just as much as he does out there in Egypt with him.What's basically missing from this film is assurance. The first film obviously knew what it wanted to do and so was able to do it and not let anything get in the way this one is very muddled and it never completely gives the impression that it knows where it wants to go. Just like the first film this one delivers some very imaginative and very grisly methods of dispatch for it's lesser characters. However these death scenes almost appear superfluous to the plot and appear to only be there to continue what the original started as Phibes probably could have gotten where he wanted to go without thembut I'm not one to complain about a film that sees a man trapped in a giant gold scorpion while being eaten to death by live ones and another man killed via a sharp spike shooting out of the telephone so whether they're needed or not they're nice. The film also features like the original did a lovely camp feeling but it's never on the same level as it was in 'The Abominable'. Perhaps it's the move to Egypt and the low quality of the set's as opposed to the grand and lavish ones of the original what's done it.As mentioned Vincent Price returns to take up one of the roles that have helped cement him in the minds of his fans  Dr Phibes himself. This role frankly was made for Vincent Price and he excels at playing it. It can be said that he doesn't do quite as good a job here but then again he didn't have as much good stuff to work with. Also making an appearance is fellow horror legend  Peter Cushing. Cushing only actually appears for all of about two minutes but it's nice to see him nonetheless. Robert Fuest returns to the director's chair as you'd probably expect but the most notable performance in the film other than Price comes from Peter Jeffrey in the role of the inept Scotland Yard inspector  Inspector Trout. Jeffrey delivers his lines with impeccable comic timing and steals every scene he's in. I'd even go as far as to say that Jeffrey is just as important a part of these two movies as Vincent Price is.Overall this film isn't nearly as good as 'The Abominable Dr Phibes' but fans of the original will find lots to like and despite the fact that it's a lesser film and has many flaws I love this kind of stuff so it gets a big thumbs up from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!This follow up to 'The Abominable Dr Phibes' just goes to prove that you can't keep a good man down. Vincent Price as knowingly camp as ever tips a nod and a wink to the audience through his portrayal of Byronic romantic hero Anton Phibes  a disfigured creature determined to revivify his dead wife Victoria and for both of them to live happily ever after throughout eternity.Fair enough! Stopping him from achieving his goal are the usual suspects of devious businessmen sly archaeologists and incompetent policemen. Through 1920s England and Egypt Phibes pursues this goal merrily dispatching all those who stand in his way through a truly ingenious catalogue of murderous mayhem.What makes the movie superior to the original is that director Fuest has used his knowledge of television production he helmed some excellent 60s 'Avengers' episodes to create an altogther realistically fantastical world played out in the normal sphere of everyday life. Therefore whilst the sets are artdeco in style and incredibly inventive and playful the murders are juxtaposed to the settings in a neat and carefully composed almost romanticised view of the world. For example whilst the settings in the Egyptian desert are almost always stagebound the settings within the pyramid which houses Phibes key to immortality are incredibly detailed and beautiful to look at engaging the viewers sense of aesthetics not normally called upon in early 70s horror. Overlapping this is the sheer delight found in the way the labyrynthine plot overcomes its shortcomings by allowing the viewer to identify with Phibes  primarily because of the first movie and the wish to see him survive.Of course the undeniable strength of the movie is the portrayal of Phibes by the always enigmatic Price. It is this familiarity of the actors playing that engages the viewer. Portrayed as a man searching for love at all costs Phgibes is not a monster but a tragic and lonely figure thus creating audience sympathy immediately.That the last view of Phibes is of one of triumph indicates that perhaps a sequel was to be made. But in hindsight Phibes got the richly deserving send off that he so desparately wanted.The movie really is a truly globetrotting almost Bondlike adventure. Despite the low budget the movie does indeed look at times absolutely magnificent. The cinematography the miseenscene the lighting and music all combine with excellent direction and acting to provide the audience with a movie that could outshine all postmodern horror movies. It is one of the last truly great gothic outings that British cinema has provided.MISS IT AT YOUR PERIL!".

	schema:headline " Good to see more of Phibes and his magicalGothicArt Deco world.";
	schema:reviewBody "Just saw the movie on DVD. I have never seen it before and I am glad I found it. Of course this is an almost unnecessary reworking of the first movie but it is great for those like myself who can't get enough of Vincent Price's Phibes.The British cast is very stiff here and the almost chanting 'Harvard Univeristy drama teacher' voice of American actor Vincent Price when he is thinkingtransmitting to Vulnavia as opposed to the stark tone when he uses his electromechanical speaking apparatus provides grandeur and menace. This is a very challenging role since the story is badly underwritten everything just exists and appears no explanations the dialog is pompous and overwritten and Price must work with no facial expression or better with an absolute minimum. He did that with bravura in the first pic and he only slips during the opening close ups at the organ where his facial muscles move a little too much but I still accept it. I must admit that I had some difficulties watching such a low budget movie. First I didn's understand what happened. What? The house is in rubbles torn apart by the villain who stole the papyrus? When? The house was there just a second ago. I thought it was meant to be some kind of theatrical language I didn't understand. To my embarrassment on second viewing I found out that Price says 'Let's go upstairs' and the organ like in the first movie acts as an elevator. I missed the visual explanation.The shot which shows Phibes and the new Vulnavia where the heck does the beautiful female servant come from? Is she a ghost? Sure not the writers couldn't come up with any explanation.Period rising into the rubbles clearly is a camera moving downward and there is a pitch black background. I needed to relearn to listen more to dialog. The visual overload of today is hazardous to these kind of films which of course have worked much better in their time. I agree with most of the comments that state that the deaths are less imaginative than in the first movie but I like this fact that this sequel was made only two years after the original  the look and feel are similar even if some of the lushness is missing.I like the two policemen acting as a semi workingclass people with a common sense and humor counterbalance to the Gothic Phantom of the Opera style Phibes. I like the way they have given up trying to catch Phibes and these of course are the two we can identify with yet there is too little material here and some of the scenes with the policemen look like a family gathering from the first movie and of course as in so many sequels the acting becomes a little too self aware. The villain his hopingtobe wife and his henchmen are all very dull characters so this is basically a Vincent PricePeter Jeffrey movie with wasted but welcome guest appearances from TerryThomas and Peter Cushing. Both wonderful actors with careers mostly made of making the most of bad material.The 1970s version of late 1920s British Art Deco since the Parisfair that introduced the Art Deco style was held in 1925 I'd say it should be rather early 1930s but the cars look more late 20s in both movies plus the theatrical magical Gothic deep menace of the priceless pun not intended Phibes as only Price could have played makes this very low budget film a little treasure even if it's basically only for those like me who can't get enough of the magical world of the wonderfully abominable Dr. Phibes.".

	onyx:emotionText "Just saw the movie on DVD. I have never seen it before and I am glad I found it. Of course this is an almost unnecessary reworking of the first movie but it is great for those like myself who can't get enough of Vincent Price's Phibes.The British cast is very stiff here and the almost chanting 'Harvard Univeristy drama teacher' voice of American actor Vincent Price when he is thinkingtransmitting to Vulnavia as opposed to the stark tone when he uses his electromechanical speaking apparatus provides grandeur and menace. This is a very challenging role since the story is badly underwritten everything just exists and appears no explanations the dialog is pompous and overwritten and Price must work with no facial expression or better with an absolute minimum. He did that with bravura in the first pic and he only slips during the opening close ups at the organ where his facial muscles move a little too much but I still accept it. I must admit that I had some difficulties watching such a low budget movie. First I didn's understand what happened. What? The house is in rubbles torn apart by the villain who stole the papyrus? When? The house was there just a second ago. I thought it was meant to be some kind of theatrical language I didn't understand. To my embarrassment on second viewing I found out that Price says 'Let's go upstairs' and the organ like in the first movie acts as an elevator. I missed the visual explanation.The shot which shows Phibes and the new Vulnavia where the heck does the beautiful female servant come from? Is she a ghost? Sure not the writers couldn't come up with any explanation.Period rising into the rubbles clearly is a camera moving downward and there is a pitch black background. I needed to relearn to listen more to dialog. The visual overload of today is hazardous to these kind of films which of course have worked much better in their time. I agree with most of the comments that state that the deaths are less imaginative than in the first movie but I like this fact that this sequel was made only two years after the original  the look and feel are similar even if some of the lushness is missing.I like the two policemen acting as a semi workingclass people with a common sense and humor counterbalance to the Gothic Phantom of the Opera style Phibes. I like the way they have given up trying to catch Phibes and these of course are the two we can identify with yet there is too little material here and some of the scenes with the policemen look like a family gathering from the first movie and of course as in so many sequels the acting becomes a little too self aware. The villain his hopingtobe wife and his henchmen are all very dull characters so this is basically a Vincent PricePeter Jeffrey movie with wasted but welcome guest appearances from TerryThomas and Peter Cushing. Both wonderful actors with careers mostly made of making the most of bad material.The 1970s version of late 1920s British Art Deco since the Parisfair that introduced the Art Deco style was held in 1925 I'd say it should be rather early 1930s but the cars look more late 20s in both movies plus the theatrical magical Gothic deep menace of the priceless pun not intended Phibes as only Price could have played makes this very low budget film a little treasure even if it's basically only for those like me who can't get enough of the magical world of the wonderfully abominable Dr. Phibes.";

	schema:reviewBody "I bought this one as part of a back to back Dr. Phibes Midnight Feature DVD. I didn't like it quite as much as the original but it was not completely without its charm. Vincent Price's performance was good as per usual and Robert Quarry did well as Biderbeck Dr. Phibes' foe in this film. As anyone who has seen the original can guess there's a lot of really elaborate deaths and more of Vincent Price talking through a machine plugged into his neck.The film picks up with a brief recap of the original Phibes out to kill the doctors who where operating on his wife when she died. Phibes then arises from the tomb in his basement where he and his wife's corpse were resting for about three years. Phibes has a plan this time to find a secret river of life in Egypt that comes to a pharaoh's tomb once every 2000 years so he can bring his wife back to life and have eternal life. However Phibes' house has been demolished and a priceless scroll that had the secret of the tomb has been taken. Biderbeck Quarry somehow acquired the scroll and intends to find the river for himself and his girlfriend. Both travel to Egypt to find the river of life and Phibes kills Biderbeck's lackeys along the way in his usual methods.It's not that bad. It didn't live up to the original but it still delivered big on the theme deaths. The deaths aren't quite as structured as in the last Phibes film but they're still pretty fun.".

Phibes has risen from suspended animation and once more has a bee in his bonnet for those who killed his wife and took away his face. He's not content with simply killing them. Oh no each murder is creative elaborate and basically nonsensical in their conception. But still horrific somehow.

Then he chooses to reason with the one man who is actually trying to destroy him. Very EC comic inspired and if you like that sort of thing you will like this film.

In the first film whether right or wrong Phibes felt he had a legitimate reason to kill. Here in Dr. Phibes Rises Again he clearly kills completely innocent people and is much more of a jerk. Also the plot is not nearly as coherent as the first film and seems like it could have used some rewriting. Still worth seeing but clearly not up to the standards of the first.".

The movie sort of carries on the theme of the original.  But without a driving force or motivation of vengeance or a theme like the Plagues here it's just a matter of seeing how many nifty ways Phibes can rather implausibly knock someone off.  And some of those a raven? aren't even that interesting.The humor here is also a lot broader which wasn't really to my taste either.  Watching Phibes chow down on grapes through his neck hole and almost choking struck me as parodying the character itself which tends to rob Phibes of much of his menace.Overall this sequel is enjoyable but to me it ultimately fails to rise to level of its predecessor.".

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say? Vincent Price as the abominable Doctor Phibes really packs a punch. Since the first instalment called The Abominable Doctor Phibes a cult following has been reaching new heights. Basically a story of a man who was once a brilliant Doctor himself had his wife under go a surgical procedure for some small problem. Instead she died on the operating table six minutes into the surgery which caused the Doctor to exact revenge on all parties involved with the operation. Except one thing by happenstance he was disfigured by an unknown accident which gave his appearance an ugly result which causes him to use makeup to give himself a new face. And a talent for which he uses a speaker through his neck. Besides this new appendage an assistant named Vulnavia who is his silent partner helps him on each excursion for his revenge. Where she comes from nobody knows. Now with a new journey he goes to Egypt to find the famed and legendary river of life where the pharaoh's of the past used after death to give immortal life. In the middle is a man named Viderbeck an archaeological scientist who is also seeking the river is now in the way of Phibes and his goal. But what others do not know is that Viderbeck uses an elixir to give him life for his continued search. Running low he and his team mates desperately try to find the chamber except each team mate dies most brutally with Phibe's brand of justice. With Scotland yard back on the scene Phibe's begins to mount the pressure by kidnapping Viderbeck's would be fianc only to coax Viderbeck to give Phibe's a key which opens the gates to the river. This film is an ultimate classic. Of music chaos murder in the most heinous ways and a beautiful story of true companionship for Phibe's and his wife Victoria. Whether the legends are true or not this film gives the audience a glimpse of magic in the forms of faith. For Phibes it was true love all the way. To go beyond the reaches of morality to save his beloved wife is the calling of one's self worth. Excellent movie for all Vincent Price fans.".

But then she is played by Valli Kemp instead of Virginia North so I guess that makes sense I'm kidding. He finds his map to the river in Egypt has been taken by Darius Biederbeck Robert Quarry. He wasn't mentioned in the first film either. He gets it back but Darius also knows where it is. Phibes and Biderbeck race to get there...and Phibes promises to kill anyone who gets in his way.Also TerryThomas appears briefly. He was killed in the first one so he plays a different character here. Whether that's supposed to be funny or...something I don't know. As you can see this makes little sense and there's a total lack of logic but I still had fun. Price really seems to be getting into his role and Quarry is amusing. The actors hated each other and that comes through loud and clear during their final confrontation. Also Inspector Trout is back providing some very funny comic relief. And Kemp is not as good as North was as Vulnavia she seems to be quite shocked when she sees Price in his skeleton face and she's called upon to make these ridiculous poses.Like the first one this has bloody inventive and sometimes hilarious murders. The ending especially is greatprobably your only chance to hear Price singing Over the Rainbow! Also Peter Cushing has a cameo as a ships captain.Fun gory and fast. Like the first this ends after the closing credits with Price giving an evil little laugh.".

The actors hated each other and that comes through loud and clear during their final confrontation. Also Inspector Trout is back providing some very funny comic relief. And Kemp is not as good as North was as Vulnavia she seems to be quite shocked when she sees Price in his skeleton face and she's called upon to make these ridiculous poses.Like the first one this has bloody inventive and sometimes hilarious murders. The ending especially is greatprobably your only chance to hear Price singing Over the Rainbow! Also Peter Cushing has a cameo as a ships captain.Fun gory and fast. Like the first this ends after the closing credits with Price giving an evil little laugh.";

I don't know how it ever got a 6.9 it shouldv'e gotten at least 8! Everything works. The plot involves Vincent Price's character Dr. Phibes pursuing the elixir of life in Egypt followed by an explorer with a secret as well as the bumbling police officers Trout and Waverly.

The original easily is one of the most pleasant and creative horror movies ever made while this sequel answers to the prototype idea of an unnecessary extra adventure. Every aspect that makes the original film enjoys the classic status it lives now has disappeared. The scenes where Phibes gets rid of his enemies are just a lame shadow of the exiting and creative killings in the first one. Even the endless monologues he holds for his deceased wife start to become boring and annoying. The story starts with Phibes awaking from his temporary grave after 3 years. He resurrects Vulnavia again and prepares a journey towards Egypt. Somewhere in a forsaken mountain there lies the secret for eternal life. There he will give life to his wife again and they'll be together at least. Yet there's another scientist who's in desperate need for the secret to immortality.  He and his crew provide Dr. Phibes with the joy of killing again. One could bring forward many reasons why this sequel is more or less a failure. Perhaps it came way to soon after the original allowing too less time to write a decent screenplay. Or maybe director Fuest had a lucky shot when he made The Abominable Dr. Phibes because in this sequel his lack of talent and professionalism shows well. Yet Dr. Phibes rises again isn't ALL bad and still has several elements to satisfy horror lovers. Vincent Price for starters naturally. He shines again in the title role and completely pulls all attention towards him. There also is one terrifying killing scene that totally lives up to the original death by scorpion! and the spooftribute towards The Wizard of Oz near the end is excellent!  In fact this film still is highly recommended when compared to the dull and irritating nowadays horror movies".

	schema:headline " Disappointing sequel to a minor horror classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES was for me at least a horror classic that ranks amongst the best the British film industry has produced in this genre.In contrast DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN is a disappointing sequel that lacks the creativity intelligence and wit that made the first movie a success.I have read the comments page carefully. Some of those who disliked the movie make it out to be a terrible sequel. Two even consider it to be one of the worst movies ever made. I think to even use words like terrible awful or dreadful would be too strong to describe it. However a good argument can be put forward to demonstrate how disappointing this sequel is for those who have seen the first movie.The plot will seem a little bizarre for those who have seen the first movie but can be recited without revealing spoilers. Dr. Phibes revives himself from his state of suspended animation and voyages to Egypt in search of a gateway to eternal life.Following a few flashbacks from events in the first movie this sequel sets off with almost complete disregard to its parent!A new protagonist is introduced  Darius Biederbeck. He is a wealthy man with the same goal as Dr. Phibes. Early in the movie it is revealed he has taken from Dr. Phibes a papyrus showing the whereabouts of the gateway to eternal life.Vincent Price has a great time playing Dr. Phibes although the touching moments where he would reminisce over his deceased wife have been massively reduced. These moments were so important in the first movie because they enabled the audience to connect with him and sympathise to an extent anyway with his motivations.The killing scenes this time are not nearly as creative as those in the first and there seems to be no obvious planning behind them. In contrast it was revealed in the first movie that Dr. Phibes spent years planning his revenge on the doctors who performed an unsuccessful surgical operation on his wife and whom he blames for her death. The results clearly demonstrated a carefully planned revenge.Robert Quarry had a wonderful role in his later collaboration with Vincent Price  MADHOUSE. He played a smooth but slimy character who was very interesting to watch. In DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN his Biederbeck character is incredibly bland and dull to watch. He did not make anywhere near as good a protagonist as Joseph Cotten did in the first movie.Dr. Phibes's assistant Vulnavia returns. But she is played by a different albeit very attractive actress. However her performance doesn't come close to that of Virginia North in the first movie who made excellent use of facial expressions to convey the character's thoughts and emotions.Fiona Lewis looks very glamorous in this movie wearing very expensive looking dresses and sporting a lovely hairstyle. Unfortunately her character is given nothing to do and is merely used as a prop for the ending chapter.Peter Jeffrey and John Cater reprise their roles from the previous movie as the two police investigators trying to hunt down Dr. Phibes. Unfortunately the comical scenes involving them that seemed so natural in the first movie seem very forced in this one.Building on the point raised in the previous paragraph the level of humour in this movie is too high and too obvious. In fact most of the humour is so obvious that it comes off as ridiculous and cheap rather than witty.Dr. Phibes's victims are nowhere near as interesting as characters as those in the first movie.Gerald Sim who delivered such a wonderful performance as Professor Robertson in DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE is given a very uninteresting character to play in DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN. I won't give away spoilers but I will say that the death of his character is easily the lamest in the whole movie and one of the lamest I've ever seen in any movie.But the movie's biggest failure is the waste of firstrate talent in the form of Peter Cushing and TerryThomas.TerryThomas who was in the first movie plays a very different character here. He receives around three minutes of screen time in a scene that is meant to be funny but simply wasn't.Peter Cushing fares even worse as the Captain of a ship on route to Egypt. He receives around two minutes screen time. It seems rather obvious to me that Peter Cushing should have been playing the Biederbeck role in this movie. After all he was offered the protagonist role in the first movie which he turned down. His presence here was clearly just a gimmick by the producers to help promote the movie.Beryl Reid also appears in this movie. Whilst she has a little more screen time than Peter Cushing and TerryThomas I thought her scene was one of the most boring in the entire movie.As pointed out by another person on this page the production seems rushed as though the movie was put out quickly to ride on the back of the first movie's success.After drawing attention to the negative aspects of the movie I turn to the few good points.Hugh Griffith has a somewhat amusing role as an alcoholic associate of Biederbeck on board the ship bound for Egypt.The movie also retains much of the style and class as the first ensuring it does not come off as cheap or sleazy in any way.Overall DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN is a subpar sequel that will disappoint most fans of the first movie. This advice comes from someone who actually saw this sequel before its parent and still found it disappointing in its own right! It comes as no surprise that plans for a third movie were shelved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though it has some outstanding sequences great music great production values one of Vinnie's greatest performances and one of the most memorably creepy endings in the genre's long history I have to tell the truth I never cared much for the original Dr. Phibes movie. I don't hate it but I just didn't find it to have the qualities it is most often praised for and those I did find certainly were not as effective as they could have been.That said I was expecting the often lambasted and socalled 'inferior' sequel to be a waste of time. I was dead wrong!I will concede that this film is technically inferior as a film to the original and the script is so full of holes it is ridiculous it also features a crass waste of actor Peter Cushing that is simply unforgivable several 'guest stars' appeared in the previous film and several elements that kept the original film glued together are missing. But that doesn't matter because the film is FUN FUN FUN!Theatre of Blood is still better though.All of the elements of humor and horror that the original is often praised for are actually more prominent and much better handled in this film. Several scenes are truly frightening and the comedy bits are hilarious without becoming just silly.The story is quite simple Phibes is restored to life because of movement of the planets which replaces the embalming fluid he replaced his blood with at the end of the previous film andnow much more talkative spouting dialog worthy of Dr. Doom through his phonographhe summons Vulnavia againconfirming that she was a supernatural figure and is about to take off on a quest to the river of life only to discover his former lair ravaged by the greedy corrupt businessman and archaeologist Darius BiederbeckRobert Quarryand his map stolen. Phibes doesn't need the map and Biederbeck who is also seeking the river has no knowledge of his existence but that's okay it gives the Nogoodnick Doctor a chance to pass the time doing what he does best.....in Egypt no less!! Although hardly 3dimensional fleshed out characters all of Biederbeck's allies are given flaws and personalities so that we either like or dislike them and thus get to either fear for them or laugh to death at their murders. The Egyptianthemed murders range from truly unpleasanta man gets pecked to death by vultures another has his flesh sandblasted offto laughoutloud funnyBig Milton Reid the evil Mulatto from 'Captain Clegg' and a henchman from the James Bond movies ends up 'phoning it in' quite literally after battling robotic cobras and a horny guy seduced by Vulnavia gets....well you'll see... even the lamest of them puts the ones in the original to shameNever mind that Phibes couldn't possibly have planned or had the materials necessary to carry out a single one of them.....The film is no masterpiece but it's very entertaining and the film has a feel reminiscent of both the Indiana Jones movies and the Adam West 'Batman' show if 'Batman' had actually been funny. It features all the qualities the original is praised for a 1000x better plus it features the earsplitting spectacle of Vincent Price 'singing' Somewhere over the Rainbow in a grating mechanical voice!!!!!!! How can you hate a movie with THAT in it??? Pull out the weed and enjoy.".

Several scenes are truly frightening and the comedy bits are hilarious without becoming just silly.The story is quite simple Phibes is restored to life because of movement of the planets which replaces the embalming fluid he replaced his blood with at the end of the previous film andnow much more talkative spouting dialog worthy of Dr. Doom through his phonographhe summons Vulnavia againconfirming that she was a supernatural figure and is about to take off on a quest to the river of life only to discover his former lair ravaged by the greedy corrupt businessman and archaeologist Darius BiederbeckRobert Quarryand his map stolen. Phibes doesn't need the map and Biederbeck who is also seeking the river has no knowledge of his existence but that's okay it gives the Nogoodnick Doctor a chance to pass the time doing what he does best.....in Egypt no less!! Although hardly 3dimensional fleshed out characters all of Biederbeck's allies are given flaws and personalities so that we either like or dislike them and thus get to either fear for them or laugh to death at their murders. The Egyptianthemed murders range from truly unpleasanta man gets pecked to death by vultures another has his flesh sandblasted offto laughoutloud funnyBig Milton Reid the evil Mulatto from 'Captain Clegg' and a henchman from the James Bond movies ends up 'phoning it in' quite literally after battling robotic cobras and a horny guy seduced by Vulnavia gets....well you'll see... even the lamest of them puts the ones in the original to shameNever mind that Phibes couldn't possibly have planned or had the materials necessary to carry out a single one of them.....The film is no masterpiece but it's very entertaining and the film has a feel reminiscent of both the Indiana Jones movies and the Adam West 'Batman' show if 'Batman' had actually been funny. It features all the qualities the original is praised for a 1000x better plus it features the earsplitting spectacle of Vincent Price 'singing' Somewhere over the Rainbow in a grating mechanical voice!!!!!!! How can you hate a movie with THAT in it??? Pull out the weed and enjoy.";

How does Phibes survive undetected if his house is torn down? How does he build so many elaborate traps in Egypt? How does he hide the bodies so quickly? And then there's the Clockwork Wizards his robot friends who play instruments with him as he plays his organ. They are great and call to mind Argento's Deep Red but it seems unlikely they would be able to be transported with such ease. Oh and if Phibes needs his special tool to speak why does he ever disconnect it? It is not like it gets in the way or something except maybe while sleeping.You like Vincent Price. You like 1970s horror films from American International Pictures. You will like this film. Some say it's not as solid as the first other say it's on par. I would suggest seeing the first one first that makes sense but there's no reason to avoid this film. It deserved more sequels but this was not to be.".

Just as in the first one one of the finest points is the overall feeling present as this is still a nice campy ride. Seeing Price return to the role is a great deal of fun and the amount of screen time the film gives him causes that. We have a lot of great moments that just prove to be a collection of camp strung together because Phibes is now out and about in the world where his threat is greater. No longer stuck basing the deaths off the ten plagues of Ancient Egypt he can let his imagination run wild and this lets in some pretty ingenious setpieces as he is now no longer bound by the confines of London anymore to spread his vision. That this is a road movie allows for greater and more elaborate deaths which is a great advantage as instead of guessing when Phibes would attack here it's a where and with what and that gives the film a little extra suspense. The film also has a great sense of setdesign and there are some wonderful sets here. The initial Egyptian design is one of the best and it looks suitably forgotten in the ruins and the final location sets are just simply breathtaking to behold. It certainly ends the film on a positive note that few other films in this particular style don't often do. This also goes along with the rather strong finale where the action is quite fun and thrilling within the catacombs of the pyramid and really lets us side with him during this section of the film when it's needed the most. These here really hold it up as there isn't much really much wrong here. The biggest issue here is that the opening flashback to the original wasn't one of the best ways of getting a movie started. It spoils too much of the first film and didn't really do much to bring new information to light. The narrator was the final straw for the scene as it just completely ruined the mood of the scene. It's one of the few times that a film opens on a downward note. Just as in the first one the fact that Phibes still talks with the voicebox is a disappointment. Even though it doesn't make sense to change it as it wouldn't really fit well with the movie the fact that it's still here is a hurdle to overcome for Price fans. There is also something different in the campiness in this one over the first one that doesn't make it as fun. It's an indefinable quality but it is there. It's still a fun campy movie but not like the first one.Today's RatingPG13 Violence.".

From these four films Fulci later used most of the gore effects again in his Un Gatto nel Cervello aka Nightmare Concert.The idea is a good one Two children get abducted by villains who take their organs to sell it illegally for transplantation. The ghosts of the kids return and take revenge forcing the bad folks to suffer more or less nasty deadly accidents. The problem is that Giovanni Simonelli brought too much insignificant dialogue into this film so it early loses most of its pace and goes on rather slowly. The budget obviously was quite low therefore even though the villains suffer mostly ghastly demises only few of them are really gory especially an accident involving the victim's eye which is the only scene Fulci used again for Nightmare Concert.Although the film isn't really good it's still quite interesting and entertaining mainly because of the good idea. I just don't understand why this film never was released even in Italy the same fate suffered Fuga Dalla Morte while Snake House got a release in Italy and Germany Massacro at least in Germany and The Murder Secret in France because compared to many other mostly directtovideo low budget horror Non Si Seviziano i Bambini is an okay film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hansel e Gretel 1990  out of 4 The plot has very little to zero to do with the fairy tale. The story is pretty simple as a couple kids are taking a shortcut when they are kidnapped by a gang of thugs who sell children to a doctor who takes their organs. After the children are murdered their ghosts come back to seek revenge.That seems like a cool little movie doesn't it? Sadly the end result is rather bad and it's really too bad because this could have made for a good movie but it's just another example of the Italian horror market having no budget and not much going for it. Lucio Fulci presented this movie as well as four others. I think it's pretty clear that they didn't have too much here so they wanted to use Fulci's name to try and bring people to the film. I'm sure this worked but that doesn't make the movie any better.Most people will only know this film from one sequence where an eyeball is severely damaged. This scene would make an appearance in Fulci's A CAT IN THE BRAIN. The death scenes are what most people come to these movies for but the budget here was so small that they really couldn't do much. In fact the majority of the death scenes are incredibly lame including one woman who simply falls into a pool and drowns within seconds. Another woman slips in a bathtub and there's one guy who gets sucked into the ground. Whenever gore is involved it seems like pieces of steak are used as flesh.The biggest problem here is that there's just no budget to do special effects so we're given a lot of silly dialogue scenes. This thing clocks in at 87 minutes which is about twenty too long. The cast are mostly forgettable although Paul Muller appears briefly but even he can't save this turkey.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll give you three reasons why Hansel  Gretel was on top of my mustsee list for several long years in a row and why I never abandoned my search for a decent copy with English subtitles. For starters I'm a giant fan of a very small and peculiar subgenre of horror cinema namely films that are based on or inspired by fairy tales. They are rare but definitely do exist like The Company of Wolves 1984 or Blancanieves 2012. Secondly I'm an avid collector of Italian horror and especially during between the 1960 and 1990 this was the finest and most prominent country to produce horror cult and exploitation classics. Even though numbers and quality were drastically declining as per the mid80s this effort still narrowly falls within the golden period. And finally there's a direct link with Lucio Fulci and  as far as I'm concerned  Fulci was God! Together with Mario Bava and Dario Argento Lucio Fulci was one of the sole true deities of the Italian horror industry. Obviously my concerns increased as the years went by and I still couldn't manage to find a halfdecent copy of the film. The fact that Hansel e Gretel remained tremendously obscure and little known even though modern technologies like digital remastering kept spawning movies out of oblivion was an alarmingly bad omen. If nobody bothers to make it available then it must suck right? Well guess what! I did find it eventually and of course it sucked  but I nevertheless enjoyed it a lot! The basic premise is brilliant and there are a handful moments of adequate suspense and marvelous gore but the execution is poor  borderline amateurish in fact  and the film is literally chockfull of foolish and utterly senseless sequences. Two siblings Hansel and Gretel are sold by their wicked stepfather kidnapped by thugs and transported strangely enough in two different cars to a sleazy private hospital. The poor kids' organs are removed to be sold on the black market while their bodies are simply buried in the garden of a remote farmhouse. By the way in case you assume the clandestine organ business is run by the mafia or hardcore Eastern European crime networks you are wrong The evil brains behind the nasty organ business are a family of farmers! Without any type of explanation the bambini resurrect from the dead with a vengeance and kill everyone at the farm. They don't get their hands dirty mind you. They merely just stand motionless while their eyes glow red and their victims die in nasty freakaccidents. A young and ambitious female police detective is put on the case and she randomly decides to move into the farmhouse during her investigation. Sure live together with a bunch of deviant criminals that makes sense! While the corpses keep piling up the children's ghosts even come to talk to the police woman and naturally she  professional that she is  sympathizes with them. Some of the death sequences are weak like inflicted heart attacks or drowning but most of them are vintage Fulci material with people ending up underneath tractors suffocating in manure and  inevitably  having their eyeball poked out! Recommend to fans of unscrupulous and exploitative Italian smut but for everyone else this film shall remain eternally obscure.".

Totally throwaway and probably not very satisfying to the adult actors and most serious adults watching it really wasn't meant to be leisurely dissected in the armchair 50 years later  but I can't help it! Originally produced by the alwayscheapandworthy Children's Film Foundation and later thanks to Rank and Norman Wright it was first made available in the mid '90's.It sticks pretty well to the story of the location of shipwrecked treasure gold ingots being hunted down by 4 children George Julian Dick and Ann sic and their dog Tim up against a couple of machinating baddies only occasionally veering into using bits from other Five books or original screenplay. Some points If Aunt Fanny was changed to Margaret to lull the huge vast American audience who would be watching why was AlfJames the fisher boy changed to Jan? Did Uncle Quentin the poor propertyrich scientist think his island was worth next to nothing? A little difficult to arrange but Tim appeared a bit of a dolt compared to the books which made chunky baddie Robert Cawdon's nonBlyton order at a tense moment to keep him quiet or he'd blow his brains out! a bit rich. The classic view of Kirrin Island in the bay on a sunny day is seen repeatedly as the Five keep running on the shoreline in front of a superimposed image of it Eileen Soper should have appreciated that touch. It made me wonder if they'd caused any damage running and squeezing into every nook and cranny of Corfe Castle you get the feeling you know every inch of every window arch stairway and blade of grass by the end. Apparently Blyton actually saw and enjoyed some of the filming at Corfe but I don't know what she thought of some of the liberties taken with her story.Either way it captured the spirit of the adventure and with all faults and without rosetinted spectacles it's still memorable and something I can watch shamelessly every few years wishing they'd filmed a few more of the books in the same carefree vein just after this one.".

It's one of the most enjoyable giant monster movies Toho Studios ever made and it's certainly one of the best Godzilla films of all. It can be silly it can be jokey and it's also a hell of a lot of fun.I have seen both the U.S. Version and the Japanese Version and I'll have to confess that while this review will be based on the proper Asian edition I also have a nostalgic fondness for the American Cut which actually benefits from some added jokes When you and the monster meet be sure to tell him all about your corn problems! and the exciting Universal stock music which compliments much of the action.Godzilla was still a bad guy at this point in time and I'm among the group who considers his costume here my personal favorite it was very much like the Aurora model kit or maybe it was the other way around. It's not very original to bash the obvious awful King Kong suit so I'll say that while it's definitely kind of ragged I actually think it's appealing in its unusual weirdness. Kong is more or less painted as the heroic one of these two and I have to tell you that I absolutely love that native song of worship which is chanted at him by the island dwellers who dance and pray on his home turf. I appreciate it even more when it's used as the title credits music in the Toho version.The story is silly and simple but it works. Godzilla is back in town after awakening from the iceberg he froze in at the conclusion of GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN and so a frustrated pharmaceutical advertiser decides to send a couple of his zany cronies to King Kong's Island to capture and bring back his own monster to give Godzilla some competition. Humor is very well used here and it works well alongside the usual rampages and city stompings.The touted battle of the giants has been unfairly maligned as looking too much like a wrestling match but I don't see how else these creatures are supposed to tangle with one another unless they opted to stare each other down for ten minutes.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the biggest hits of all time King Kong vs. Godzilla!! Well Toho style. Seriously this is the highest grossing Gfilm ever of course due to Godzilla's equally popular foe. or the third installment all four fathers were brought in Ishiro Honda director Tomiyuki Tanaka producer Eiji Tsubaraya SFX and Akira Ifukube composer. Hauro Nakijima returns to play Godzilla as he would until Godzilla vs. Megalon in 1973. but the screenplay was provided by the man who would do so for another eight films Shinchi Sekizawa. I think he did a great job and Godzilla still isn't a hero here but the villain. Yes!!! Cutie Akikko Wakabayashi stars along with Jun Tazki and other notable G actors and the performances are excellent. The first new version of Godzilla appears looking more reptilian and having lost the distinctive ears. A fantastic suit with an excellent heat ray. Kong well let's just say that I always thought his face needed a good plastic surgeon. Plus the weird floppy arms but overall the suit isn't terrible just barely decent enough to get the job done. This one is one of my favorites due to the action. As a young child and to this day I love it! Godzilla's entrance is probably one of the coolest ever debunking the notion of him always emerging from the sea. His rampage scenes are well done and Tsubaraya knew what he was doing. Kong and Godzilla's first meet was exciting but I never liked how the ape attacks Tokyo instead of Godzilla. I the Japanese version version plays out more like satirical comedy of the Japanese business industry which I view as an interesting take on this film. like a 60s satire of sorts. The American version removes a lot of this but the dubbing ensures some of it remains. Instead once more newly filmed scenes are added which don't really add anything to the story but are nice touch. EXCEPT when they say Godzilla is an peabrained idiot while Kong the intelligent one. The only other thing is how they Completely cut out Ifukube's score. It just seems at the time these U.S. distribution companies just didn't like Ifukbe's scores. Every film with a score by Ifukbe has some minor or major edit in it.Anywho the two monsters fight a spectacular battle at Mt. Fuji that had some great moments. It's so full of kicks flips and trips I just never get tired of it. And along the film is backed by Ifukube's grand music a great and fun film for sure.".

The original Japanese release was apparently much more satirical in tone whereas the American version removes all the comedy. It is still enjoyable as a giant monster movie though.This movie originally began life as a stopmotion feature entitled KIng Kong VS Frankenstein and was conceived by Willis O'Brien as a sequel to the 1933 Kong gradually turning into a Godzilla movie after Toho studios got involved. Although there are some brief stopmotion sequences it is by and large a typical kaiju ega movie in other words it's men in rubber suits. While fans of O'Brien's stillimpressive stopmotion work on the original King Kong may be irked by the idea of the big ape being played by a Japanese guy in a suit I personally think Kong looks pretty cool it's certainly more impressive than the suit Toho used for their second Kong film King Kong Escapes.There are some inconsistencies most notably the fact that King Kong and Godzilla were radically different sizes in their respective films but Toho got around this by the simple expedient of ignoring it. We've got two great big monsters beating each other up so who cares about details? Also in the original King Kong the big ape had no special powers beyond being very strong whereas Godzilla has radioactive breath Toho addressed this seeming imbalance by having Kong derive strength from electricity whereas Godzilla is weakened by touching power lines. One point that bugs me a little is the fact that although this is the third Godzilla film and the second to feature King Kong there seems to be no connection to the previous movies. When the two monsters appear the human characters act as though they have no prior knowledge of them which seems odd when you take into account Godzilla had twice previously tried to destroy Tokyo and King Kong did make kind of a mess of New York. King Kong VS Frankenstein was intended as a sequel to the original but this idea was obviously dropped from the movie it became.The climactic fight between the two monsters is great fun sort of a giant sized version of a WWE match only with more believable physiques and personalities. Kong shoving a tree down Godzilla's throat and the big green guy responding by walloping Kong with his tail are highly entertaining moments obviously not as spectacular as the scenes of Kong fighting the dinosaurs in either the 1933 original or Peter Jackson's remake but that's not the point. King Kong VS Godzilla is an enjoyable example of this type of movie if you're new to the kaiju ega genre it's an excellent starting point. It's just a shame King Kong VS Frankenstein never got made. Maybe if we all ask Peter Jackson nicely....".

He as usual is intelligent and cerebral and his statement  or the monster will kill us all pretty much sums up the problem they are facing. His presence adds continuity to the film since he was the real hero of the original Godzilla King of the Monsters. The main female actress is unbearably helpless and is by no means a 'Fay Wray'. The Kong suit is ridiculously poor but who cares. I guess Kong is supposed to be the good guy in this flick if either can be considered good. I loved the scene where Dr. Johnson paleontologist? holds up the text book to compare Godzilla to a TRex and a stegosaurus. The book just has to be a part of the kids Golden Book series and I loved the when he likened Godzilla's brain to a marble. With 'K'and'G' stepping on everything in sight I always wonder why it never seems to hurt their feet. The native girl that does the lead dancing on the island is the prettiest Japanese woman I have ever seen and in my view should have been the key actress.

	schema:reviewBody "I have always been a fan of this film. I think it was the first Kong film I had seen other than clips from the original in a documentary about movie monsters. I was always a huge GodzillaKing Kong fan and can't really decide which one I like better. I think at the time I watched this I was more into Kong so I was glad to see him come out victorious. He beat the big green guy so bad that he was still sore in his next movie Godzilla Vs. The Thing where he lost against Mothra or actually Mothra larvae and I was glad though I still love and respect 'Zilla. This really was the battle between two of the greatest movie monsters of all time. I used to have all the Godzilla films on VHS but they were all lost in a flood but I plan on replacing them on DVD real soon. I used to have this awesome movie on VHS and look forward to buying it on DVD along with the rare King Kong Escapes in four days. I also loved the brilliant fight between King Kong and the Giant Octopus I think his name was Oodaku or something back on Faro Island even though it looked really fake. I will soon own this masterpiece as part of my King KongGodzilla DVD collection and be able to watch it over and over again just like the old days reliving some great memories. I also wouldn't mind seeing this film remade perhaps by Peter Jackson as a second sequel after a Son of Kong remake to his new 2005 remake of the original Kong. That would be pretty awesome with today's special effects and technology though it could never live up to the magic of the original. Jackson be sure to include the Giant Octopus if you ever consider this! On the whole this film is a worthy entry to both the Godzilla series and the King Kong series and will always hold a special place on my heart. I give this great film a 10 out of 10.".

I was always a huge GodzillaKing Kong fan and can't really decide which one I like better. I think at the time I watched this I was more into Kong so I was glad to see him come out victorious. He beat the big green guy so bad that he was still sore in his next movie Godzilla Vs. The Thing where he lost against Mothra or actually Mothra larvae and I was glad though I still love and respect 'Zilla. This really was the battle between two of the greatest movie monsters of all time.

So let's jump right into King Kong vs Godzilla.Seven years after the military trapped Godzilla in ice Godzilla Raids Again the radioactive dinosaur is accidentally freed from his frozen prison by a nuclear sub and he quickly makes his way back to Japan. Meanwhile an underhanded company sends a few of our main characters to Faro Island which has gained popularity for two reasons red berries with chemicals that can be useful for medical purposes and a monster god the natives feed the berries' juice to. The god is unsurprisingly King Kong and after he defeats a giant octopus he gets taken by the company but he soon escapes and heads out to confront the mighty Godzilla in a showdown that will have Japan tremble before these great titans.Undoubtedly this is one of the best of the Godzilla movies and is the best Versus movie ever made. The Godzilla suit is great and considered a fan favorite. The Kong suits on the other hand are not so much especially the embarrassing closeup puppet of Kong's face. Nonetheless my favorite Kong suit is the action suit which allows the actor to grab things. I like how they used a real octopus four total most of the time only using a puppet when the creature is in the same shot as Kong. There are a lot of cool and sometimes funny scenes involving both the monsters and the humans but the scene that really makes it worthwhile is the final fight between Kong and Godzilla. It has great moments such as when the big ape shoves a tree in Godzilla's mouth only for the dinosaur to use his fire breath to get the tree out hitting Kong in the process. They just beat the living heck out of each other! Despite an ending that left me a little disappointed and a few cheesy effects moments Kong's face this is the absolute battle of the century and I wish for you to check this creature feature out.

However in my opinion King Kong vs Godzilla is both the greatest Godzilla film and Toho Film ever made.A submarine is doing an expedition in the arctic. It is destroyed by Godzilla who emerges from a Glacier. Godzilla then heads towards Japan according to a television reporter acting like a fish that is heading back to its old waters. A man in charge of a television channel sends a group to Farrow Island hoping to bring back a supposed monster that lives on the Island. He does this to gain better publicity. On the island a giant octopus attacks the group and a native tribe but a giant monster King Kong comes and dispatches the octopus. Kong is then taken on a raft back to Japan. Kong fights Godzilla and is forced to retreat mainly due to the fact that Godzilla's radioactive fire is to much for him. Japan then uses Electrical cords to surround Japan it works on Godzilla but not with Kong. Kong is put to sleep and taken to Mount Fuji to fight Godzilla with the hope that they will both die.Godzilla and King Kong fighting against each other. A perfect idea. At the time this film was made though both monsters were not legendary film monsters. King Kong was a bigger star and had been around since 1933. This was the first Godzilla film to be in color and it started Godzilla on a stretch where he would become the most popular movie monster. This film helped develop Godzilla it was his first film in a while and it helped start him off on the stretch that I just mentioned.This is not the same King Kong from the original classic King Kong. If it was then Godzilla could merely step on him. This is Toho's version of King Kong. Not a bad version I must say. Kong gets in a lot of good action fighting a giant Octopus smashing through electrical cords and of course going against Godzilla. In this film electricity makes Kong stronger an interesting ability to make him stand a better chance against Godzilla. I always liked Godzilla better than King Kong but Kong is a great monster also.Godzilla is great in this film. Not only is he in color for the first time but he also once again is a villain. Awesome! The Godzilla in this film looks really good probably third behind the Godzilla from Godzilla King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs Mothra. Godzilla is bulky has an evil looking head and just looks like nothing can stop him. Except electricity apparently. That is one thing that always confused me Electricity did not stop him at all in Godzilla King of the Monsters so why did it work this time? Probably because in this film they state that Godzilla has the brain the size of a cherry. I think this is the only film where Godzilla's brain size is talked about but I do not think that Godzilla's intelligence is the same in every film.The story is pretty easy to follow. Mr Sato needs a giant monster to give him better ratings since he is sick of Godzilla. So an expedition to Farrow Island Island takes place to find another monster. I guess you can always find Kong on Islands in the middle of nowhere. Once Kong is taken back to Japan the film gets really interesting as there are two giant monsters around. Also the whole tension leading up to the battle between the two is great.Acting is awesome. Not much more to add. I would just like to say that I love how on the boat one of Sato's men calls Sato a 'dumb bell and states how King Kong could kill us all and you wouldn't care. Publicity is all you want! It is funny because it is true.The monster fight at the end is awesome. Really is the best monster fight I have seen. Both get their moments but I really can see that clearly Godzilla has the upper hand. So I guess Kong is portrayed more as the hero than Godzilla is. BUt that is OK I love when Godzilla is a villain.One thing I would like to add. THere has been a long running rumor that the ending is different in the Japanese Version than in the American Version. All I can say without giving too much away is that you should check where bits of information you heard comes from and not believe everything you hear.Also I really hope they do not re make this film. I know that sounds bad but I have seen so many re makes as failures and this is the type of film that could be re made. Just let this film stand by itself.A great film. Godzilla against King Kong. GO see it it is a classic.".

It's a movie to see for all the fans of badly executed special effects in the true spirit of 50's scifi bmovies. In that respect it's a true classic. If you enjoyed the Beasty Boys' video for Intergalactic Planetary you'd love this movie as a Japanese feature length counterpart. They've got the same quality feel to them and the same incredible special effects  and here incredible is meant literally.Some of the highlights of this movie for me the toy plane a little boy sees hanging in a toystore and makes him stop because he badly wants it is the same plane that flew in formation attacking Godzilla. And by that I don't mean the same type of plane but it's the exact same plastic model! Also true to the original story King Kong comes from a tropical island. As we all know the clich has it such an island is inhabited by black people wearing bananaleaf skirts and toting spears. This being a Japanese production the natives are played by Japanese painted black and given curly wigs...So if you enjoy laughing at the ridiculous details in movies love to see fights between people wearing halloween suits trying to make it look like the real thing with some mediocre fireworks in between you have to see this movie. If you're looking for a credible classic such as the original King Kong movie or hightech special effects and stunning visuals this is not the one for you ".

They've got the same quality feel to them and the same incredible special effects  and here incredible is meant literally.Some of the highlights of this movie for me the toy plane a little boy sees hanging in a toystore and makes him stop because he badly wants it is the same plane that flew in formation attacking Godzilla. And by that I don't mean the same type of plane but it's the exact same plastic model! Also true to the original story King Kong comes from a tropical island. As we all know the clich has it such an island is inhabited by black people wearing bananaleaf skirts and toting spears. This being a Japanese production the natives are played by Japanese painted black and given curly wigs...So if you enjoy laughing at the ridiculous details in movies love to see fights between people wearing halloween suits trying to make it look like the real thing with some mediocre fireworks in between you have to see this movie. If you're looking for a credible classic such as the original King Kong movie or hightech special effects and stunning visuals this is not the one for you ";

As we all know everyone loves these two monsters that have terrorized Japan with their huge menacing bodies. And we all want to know who wins right? So 10 years after the first Godzilla movie was made the King Kong vs Godzilla was the next hit. I love the whole idea of the story that sounds suitable and convincing enough to attract the audiences and two huge menacing monsters.The special effects and animation is very powerful for a movie made in the 60's. The Japanese actors are very persuasive and you can think that they're in a real event. The total destruction of Tokyo could never be any better. The imagination of the director's mind speaks for itself in this movie. He totally wants you to get the whole idea of the monster battle between King Kong and Godzilla. The direction is realistic. So is the acting. But character development was never shown in this movie. But I guess that the battle is what it's all about.The monsters were perfectly destructive and when they fought they sure crushed the city to its knees. This aspect of the movie makes the characters interact with the eventual situation well. That idea was well thought of. Some movies like these never show good interaction.Except for my favorite scene being the battle between King Kong and Godzilla another was when the musical natives put King Kong to sleep. That was funny. Now about the hilarious moments in the movie. Well the movie was indeed serious business but some jokes relieve you from all the excitement which is good otherwise your head would start thinking what will happen next.Most of the characters in the story play a good enough role but some are very useless. That is one of the worst part of the movie. Another is we still don't who won. This made me really mad because I was rooting for Godzilla. I mean that guy's got fire for breath a long tail and huge teeth. What chance does Kong have.Other than that this is a movie worth seeing if you love to see cities crumble.".

Godzilla is portrayed much better by the best Godzilla actor Hauro Nakijama who played the big guy from 1954 to 1972! The costume used in the film has a bulky and reptilian look while Kong reminds me of a bald bot bellied old guy. His mouth doesn't move his eyes are all googly looking... it's just one awful suit.

The established teachers at the school try to counsel the newcomers all inexperienced in such situations as how best to handle the rowdy students. Regardless Dadier tries to exert discipline in his class which provokes a violent response. Dadier believes the student leaders against him are Artie West but more specifically Gregory Miller who he thinks uses the fact of being black as a means of racial provocation.

For me the key to the whole story is when Ford has to get down to the level of running a movie cartoon of Jack and the Beanstalk in order to communicate with them. That's when he reaches them and also takes control of the situation in his classroom away from the school thug as graphically portrayed by Vic Morrow.I was involved with someone for many years and his literacy level was very low. It made him angry and unable to handle the world and all the problems he had in life. He had a worse situation than the kids in The Blackboard Jungle. He was raised in a group home where they didn't care at all if you learned anything.Blackboard Jungle is also memorable for the use of a previously recorded song by Bill Haley and the Comets that sold a few records the year earlier but didn't set the world on fire. Director Richard Brooks heard it in young Peter Ford's collection and decided it would be his theme. Rock Around the Clock became a rock and roll institution after The Blackboard Jungle was out in theaters.Blackboard Jungle also started another less fortunate trend. That of picking very obviously adult actors to play high school kids. A trend that has continued to this day with such shows as Beverly Hills 90210 carrying on the tradition. Capable players that they are and they certainly delivered fine performances Sidney Poitier and Vic Morrow don't look like high school kids especially not next to Rafael Campos who was in the correct age bracket when the film was being shot.Teacher burnout is also covered in Blackboard Jungle with Louis Calhern leading the pack of cynics Glenn Ford has as colleagues. In many ways Blackboard Jungle is the grandfather of a film like Stand and Deliver where Edward James Olmos is the dedicated math teacher of inner city kids a generation later. Other than ethnic not too much difference between Richard Dadier and Jaime Escalante.Richard Brooks assembled and directed a cast that made a classic that's still agonizingly relevant today.".

Overshadowed due to that was Blackboard Jungle a superior and more important film than the aforementioned Rebel Without a Cause contrary to popular belief admittedly. It is New York in the mid1950s and former military man Glenn Ford in his greatest screen role takes a job as a high school teacher in the innercity. Soon it is blatantly apparent that the school is full of male thugs most notably guys like Sidney Poitier Vic Morrow Paul Mazursky and even Jamie Farr who run things with total disregard of faculty rules and policy. Ford becomes enraged and proves to be a lot tougher than originally thought. However when pregnant wife Anne Francis starts receiving anonymous phone calls and letters from one of Ford's students about a possible affair between he and one of his female coworkers the real fireworks start. At first Ford believes that Poitier is the culprit probably based more on race and Poitier's obvious intelligence rather than actual proof. It takes lots of time and effort but Ford becomes determined to get through to his pupils and weed out those who are trying to impede his progress and the advancement of others at his school. Blackboard Jungle is another excellent piece from writerdirector Richard Brooks Oscarnominated for writing. It is the first truly legitimate movie that dealt with 1950s teenage angst and it rises above every other movie of the genre. Ford is a revelation once again showing that he is probably the most underappreciated actor throughout the history of the cinema. With that said Blackboard Jungle is likely best remembered as Poitier's breakthrough role a role which ultimately led to outstanding movie after outstanding movie throughout the late1950s and 1960s. Poitier 28 at the time plays much younger than he was and adds much emotion and depth to a potentially flat character. A booming rock'n'roll soundtrack and topflight performances dominate Brooks' outstanding winner. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:headline " Taut tense and thrilling  a jungle of inner city excitement";
	schema:reviewBody "Blackboard Jungle 1955 is director Richard Brooks' watershed effort to shed light on the slow moral decline of youth in the inner city. The film stars Glenn Ford as Richard Dadier  a high school teacher whose optimism is sullied when he realizes the teens he is attempting to impart wisdom on are a bunch of wolfish reprobates in adolescent sheep's clothing. Dadier is further disillusioned when he talks to other school staff particularly Prof. Kraal Basil Ruysdael and Jim Murdock Louis Calhern. They have merely accepted their loss of control in the classroom and do not seem to mind the fact one way or the other. After having a baseball hurled at his head while teaching a history lesson Dadier confronts Gregory Miller Sidney Poitier about the rumor that is being spread regarding his romantic badinage with one of his colleagues. Miller's tough and he doesn't deny the accusation. But is he really the one responsible for letting Dadier's wife Anne Anne Francis in on the secret? Dated by today's standards the film is a fascinating time capsule on juvenile delinquency  then perceived as an emerging evil in the public school system  and later along with a basis in Romeo  Juliet became the gestation for 'West Side Story.' The film also introduced rock and rollers to Bill Haley's 'Rock Around The Clock'  the song went on to become number one on hit parades across the country. Glenn Ford's central performance is among his best. He's cold steelyeyed and aloof harboring just the right amount of sarcasm to pit his considerable brain against the unyielding brawn of his sullen motley crew of students. In a very early performance in his career Poitier illustrates the hallmarks of why he later went on to have such a brilliant career. And the story ironically foreshadows Poitier's stepping into the authoritarian shoes of an educator in To Sir With Love a decade later.The DVD from Warner is a beautiful BW presentation. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with deep rich blacks very clean whites and a minimal amount of film grain. The original theatrical aspect ratio of 1851 has been slightly cropped for DVD to 1781 but the loss of screen information is limited and excusable. The audio is original mono but presented at a listening level that will surely please. Extras include a jumble of audio commentaries from Jamie Farr Paul Muzursky Peter Ford and Idel Freeman a cartoon and the film's original theatrical trailer.".

	schema:headline " Blackboard Jungle is a breakthrough film that brings up important issues about urban schools.";
	schema:reviewBody "I chose to watch Blackboard Jungle after I saw Rebel Without a Cause in Film class. I enjoyed the first movie and after I learned what Jungle was about I assumed that I would enjoy it as much as Rebel. I was wrong I enjoyed Blackboard Jungle twice as much.Blackboard Jungle premiered in 1955 the same year as Rebel Without a Cause and historical milestones such as Rosa Parks' monumental protest of bus segregation. In fact race relations pay an important part in this film which I will discuss later. The movie is about a teacher Richard Dadier who accepts a job at North Manual High School. At this school he encounters a schoolwide discipline problem. The two main perpetrators in Dadier's class are Gregory Miller a black student whom Dadier comes to see much promise in and Vic Morrow the true instigator of violence whose gang attacks Dadier. Over the course of the film Dadier also encounters apathetic teachers a principal in denial and a wife who gives birth prematurely. Eventually Dadier must decide if his pursuit to teach is important enough to endure the hardship.This movie brings up some very important issues that were just important in 1955 as they are in 2001. Violence in schools is still a major topic culminating in the Columbine shooting which everyone should remember. Also important is how teachers are to deal with this threat. Dadier dealt with it by reaching out to Miller and by confronting Morrow. But is this a realistic scenario? Sometimes students just cannot be reached and it is irresponsible to ask teachers to directly confront weapontotin students who have a propensity for violence. This just goes to show that solving violence in schools is difficult. It has taken at least 46 years it will probably take many more.No female students are portrayed in Blackboard Jungle. This contributes to the stereotype that usually teenage boys are the ones who instigate violence. Of course the statistics show that male students are mostly responsible for school violence and many stereotypes exist for a reason. Rebel Without a Cause demonstrates the female role in school insubordination well by including a woman in the main gang. Still I would have liked to see a female student element in Jungle to show that girls are often involved and that they also influence male student's behavior.For the era the racial attitude of Blackboard Jungle is very progressive. Dadier confronts racial slurs in the classroom. The principal who was tipped off by a student that Dadier was using racial epithets when all he was demonstrating was the dangerous consequences of such racism is not happy with this report and chastises Dadier. Both situations show that two important protagonists object to racism signifying the film's aversion to this social aspect. This comes just after Brown v Board simultaneous to Rosa Parks' significance and long before the high point of the Civil Rights Movement. Blackboard Jungle should undoubtedly be recognized for its attitude on race relations and other controversial elements such as rock and roll. At a time when rock music was still controversial and outside the mainstream Blackboard Jungle opened and closed with Bill Haley and the Comet's Rock Around the Clock. This was a bold step to take and was one of the reasons that the film was banned from many theatres. The relatively violent content also contributed to the barring of the movie and probably contributed to many riots that occurred in theatres while the movie was shown.Overall I enjoyed this movie both for the issues it addressed its support for educators and their responsibilities and for its entertainment value alone. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in educational dilemma or someone who simply would enjoy a classic film with a progressive realistic attitude. However for anyone looking for a clone of Rebel Without a Cause they won't find what they're looking for but I guarantee they will enjoy it just the same.".

Glen Ford is in fact truly commanding here and he becomes the movie. Most of the rest really all the rest are supporting roles and not all of them do him credit. And this comes not from lack of talent but from a script that has too many little agendas at work. Hey but they are important and interesting agendas so fear not. It's exciting going every step of the way.Even young Sydney Poitier for all his charm and ease on screen is forced into a role as a reluctant but talented student that makes him a twodimensional and his relationship with Ford is pushed on us at the expense of the others. Some of the other teachers are convincing in their own ways most of all Louis Calhern as a grumpy and jaded older teacher who expects the worst and gets it. There are moments of high drama that workmostly violence or the avoidance of violenceand there are moments too contrived and too foreshadowed to contribute very much. The female teacher is set up to tempt the determined Ford main character and she plays out in expected ways.It might be a testament actually that the movie grabs you and won't let go even with these storytelling flaws. For one thing it looks great with photography by Russell Harlan and is edited crisply so technically it soars and in a vivid widescreen black and white not 43 like IMDb says. The director Richard Brooks clearly makes the most of the material. His career has left us a number of almost great movies and this might be his greatest. It seems to have had the most impact in its time sparking violence in the theaters where it was shown. And by using Rock Around the Clock it helped make Bill Halley and Comets and white rock and roll hugely popular. But as just a movie on the screen it is Ford who takes on the subtle turmoils going on in his character's head and you read it in his face and his stiff body language and you believe him.".

	schema:reviewBody "A history professor once told me If you want to change history become a historian. This statement might also apply to movie critics. I came of age turned 13 when I saw this movie when it was first released in 1955. My buds and I liked the movie not because it was a shocker which it was not but because it dealt fairly realistically with teenagers much more so than say the old Andy Hardy series. To my knowledge no one was really shocked by this movie. There was no big hoopla by concerned citizens as there would be when Elia Kazan's Baby Doll played on the same screen a few years later. And Rock Around The Clock was not considered rock 'n' roll by most teens only a pop hit along the lines of Shboom. The first record actually considered rock 'n' roll by most teens was Chuck Berry's Maybelline. When my buds and I first heard it on the radio we stopped the car and listened intently to a new kind of teen music. That did not happen with anything Bill Haley and the Comets put on wax. Those who say The Blackboard Jungle was a shocker simply did not live through that period of history. Some of these same critics believe that the average family of the 50's was like the one portrayed on Leave It To Beaver. I knew of no family in my neighborhood that lived like the Cleavers. We found Rebel Without a Cause and a somewhat neglected film The Wild One to be the ones that related to our rebellious side. The Wild One especially Marlon Brando's performance was the standout film for us teens in those days. Another later Robert Mitchum flick Thunder Road was also a movie that spoke to the teens of the period. Marlon Brando James Dean and Robert Mitchum were movie role models for many of us growing up in the turbulent 50's not Glenn Ford or even Vic Morrow and Sidney Poitier.That's not to say that this movie is not worth seeing for it is a good movie dealing in a somewhat no nonsense way with teaching rebellious and sometimes dangerous teens who see nothing relevant in book learning and who don't want to be exposed to the higher levels of intellectual endeavors. How do you teach the unteachable? Still a challenge today in the American classroom.".

I was all of seven years old when I walked to the local movie theater in my Rhode Island suburban neighborhood and laid out the grand total of 20 cents to see it.It was the first movie that I ever watched alone and it is the first major Hollywood movie to use a rock 'n roll song for the credit roll. Rock Around the Clock by Billy Haley and the CometsThe black and white look gave it a gritty even scary feel to my very young impressionable mind. I knew that Glen Ford was in an awful situation dealing with these inner city punks and that Vic Morrow was the worst of the lot. I gotta admit he was just a little cool to me as well especially when he put his switchblade into his desk top.Despite being released in 1955 BLACKBOARD JUNGLE is not quite as dated as one may believe. Many of the issues within are as current as modern times. It remains a gripping drama.Anne Francis is the gorgeous frightened wife and Sidney Poitier gives a terrific performance as the guy Glen Ford must win over to gain control of his class.I wouldn't hesitate to check this out again.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the Thirties through the Fifties it was usually Warner Brothers who brought the themes of drugs poverty crime and juvenile delinquency to the big screen. However it was MGM that took the first real hard look at troubled inner city schools with Blackboard Jungle breaking with it's tradition of deep dramas and frothy musicals. It's too bad none of this really helped looking back from the vantage point of today we know that the warnings presented in pictures like these didn't make a difference. Things are worse than ever to the point where the subject matter has escalated to topics like guns in school as depicted in Bowling for Columbine.The trailer for the movie prepares the viewer for 'teenage terror in the school' and quite remarkably the picture succeeds on a number of levels. Not only does it show newly hired high school teachers attempting to deal with delinquents in their classrooms but there's also a subtext involving race relations that nearly boil over in the confrontation between Miller Sidney Poitier and West Vic Morrow. Richard Dadier's Glenn Ford coolness under fire goes a long way to win his students' trust but it wasn't easy. Balancing the demands of a new job against the responsibilities of marriage and impending fatherhood Dadier questions his ability to survive the classroom after being beaten up accused of racism and generally tormented by his students. This is one of Ford's finest performances.Considering Sidney Poitier's record as an actor in mature professional roles In the Heat of the Night Guess Who's Coming to Dinner it's a bit awkward seeing him play a heel role like he does here. A year later he upped the ante as an escaped convict shackled to Tony Curtis in The Defiant Ones. For viewers who have only seen him in noble roles like the character Mr. Tibbs it's a treat to catch him in his early career revealing a hint of what was to come.The rest of the juvenile cast quite a misnomer as all were in their twenties is quite effective here particularly Vic Morrow as the openly defiant thug who continuously challenges Dadier over his control of the classroom. Dan Terranova Belazi Rafael Campos Morales and Paul Mazursky Emmanuel all do well representing their ethnic counterparts. But you could have knocked me over with a feather when I learned that the character Santini was played by Jamie Farr in his very first screen role! There's a bit of trivia worth noting.Overall I think this is a film worth recommending both as entertainment and for it's historical perspective. It's interesting to reflect on how far we've come in the half century or so since the picture came out. In retrospect it doesn't strike me that Rock Around the Clock was exactly the right theme song to bookend the picture as it's upbeat tune and lyrics seem more appropriate for something along the lines of American Graffiti. But then again if you look at a 1955 play list you won't find anything that comes close to matching the rebellious spirit of the era. Of course there was more to come and compared to the headlines of today the events portrayed here virtually pale in comparison.".

My question through the movie was why do these kids even bother to show up? Anyway there is one really good scene when Ford's character Mr. Dadier gives all his fellow teachers a verbal lashing on how they keep their classroom under control. There is a message of hope when the hardship Mr. Dadier endures inspires another apathetic teacher to begin to reexamine his teaching methods. Everything finally comes to a head in the end when Mr. Dadier takes on Vic Morrow's character when it becomes evident the class's loyalty has shifted to that of the teacher and not a fellow student.

A jungle is where the wild animals rule a Blackboard Jungle places those animals in school.I was a young boy in the 1950s and I remember two big fears. There probably were others but the two I remember were Communism and juvenile delinquency among teenagers. The latter is what this movie deals with. In fact it opens with a message printed in large white letters on a black background that this fictional story is intended to portray what might happen in schools everywhere if society doesn't take care to prevent it.Glenn Ford was a veteran of film and here he stars as a new English teacher a war veteran Richard Dadier. His wife was played by Anne Francis who at 25 was about the same age as many of the students. He gets the job and quickly finds out that his students are about as badly behaved as one might imagine. But behavior was minor several of them were in a gang with Artie West Vic Morrow in his first movie where no crime was off limits.So much of the movie deals with Dadier trying to reach the kids and West trying to sabotage all of his efforts including a gang attack and beating one night in a dark alley.Sidney Poitier almost 30 was good as Gregory W. Miller who at first was made to appear to be a trouble maker but in the end was an ally. He was portrayed as a hard worker in his after school mechanics job and the pianoplaying leader of an allblack singing quintet.SPOILERS. The tense final scenes are in the classroom. Dadier orders West to bring up his paper West doesn't cooperate. Dadier wants to take him to the principal's office but West pulls a knife. Dadier gets wounded but corners West who asking his friends for help gets none and must face Dadier alone. West is disarmed he and the other main thug are held for the cops.

	schema:headline " The film that shook up America";
	schema:reviewBody "In terms of impact on the public this was one of the most important films ever made in America. When it was released there in 1955 it caused an earthquake of terrified and enraged response from around the country. Some people might say no one was shocked but in my experience everyone I knew was. I was a child when I saw it and I was shocked to the tips of my toes. But then I was not yet a teenager and teenagers were incomprehensible psychologically disturbed creatures as far as I could see from my perspective. The scene which most upset me then was the breaking of poor Mr. Edwards's 78 rpm record collection. It was obvious to me that West the boy brilliantly played by Vic Morrow was psychopathic and it is well known that psychopaths cannot bear to hear music especially good music. It was obviously too much for Vic Morrow to hear Bix Beiderbecke playing jazz see my review of the film about his life YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN aka YOUNG MAN OF MUSIC 1950 so he had to smash the records. All the parents I knew met or overheard talking to one another were in a state of utter shock about this film and had become neurotic overnight about what might be happening in the classroom with little Johnny. This film blew the lid off the suppressed story of classroom violence and of what were becoming known to every parent's terror as 'juvenile delinquents'. This was when feral youth began. The lead character in this film is a dedicated teacher played by squarejawed and honourable Glenn Ford whose name is Mr. Dadier. The kids in the class tease him by mispronouncing his name and calling him 'Daddio'. From this origin came the 'cool' expression 'Hey Daddio' which tough kids in gangs then used as part of their street slang all over America for another 20 years or so and less than one percent of the kids who said that had ever seen or heard of the film from which the expression came. So is slang created in the least likely of ways. I was electrified as a child when this film began when I heard on the soundtrack over the credits the totally new experience of rock and roll music. The song 'Rock around the Clock' sung by Bill Haley and the Comets sent shock waves through all young people even as young as me. No one I knew had ever heard such a sound or could imagine such music. This song and this film ignited a revolution in the world of popular music which meant that the world would never be the same again. It also suddenly seemed acceptable for youth to be rebellious raucous and irreverent. Not like the 'juvenile delinquents' in the film of course who were too extreme and violent but just as a general idea of youth unleashed. 'The younger generation' as a separate stratum of society was born at this moment too. We all saw the film and you couldn't keep us out of the cinemas. It was like a forest fire that spread across a continent. Glenn Ford became such a hero after this that all the films where he played a sergeant or a captain in the Army or a police detective were as nothing compared to the courage he showed in that violent school in New York City. It was as if Glenn Ford had really done that. We didn't think of him as an actor anymore BLACKBOARD JUNGLE was too real to be fiction and he had to be real too. His wife Anne Francis did not attract much respect as she was too feeble and played a rather insipid goodygoody prone to irrational jealousies. Louis Calhern was superb as an older teacher of 12 years' experience at the school who had become a hardened cynic. When he spoke his words of wisdom we all listened believing every word. This film was above all about ourselves the young people. I may have been only an apprentice youth but I was still amongst the group below the level of the parents who were suddenly looked upon by our elders with the same fear as if we were wild Indians circling a wagon train a wagon train which might even be defended by Glenn Ford. This film was the seventh screen appearance of Sidney Poitier though the first in which he was really noticed. He played a boy of 18 even though he was really 28 which was a considerable feat as he pulled it off. His role as Miller made a big impact with everyone and essentially made his future career. The film was written and directed by Richard Brooks who generally wrote his own scripts. Apart from this one his three best films were probably the two Tennessee Williams films which he adapted CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF 1958 and SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH 1962 as well as the amazing ELMER GANTRY 1960 the screenplay of which won him an Oscar. Brooks was not afraid to tackle significant subjects ELMER GANTRY was about an evangelical preacher and his later film of Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD of 1969 was an attempt to deal with murder from a philosophical perspective though not everyone appreciated Capote's viewpoint including myself. There are few films of which one can honestly say that it changed society but BLACKBOARD JUNGLE is certainly one of those. It holds up very well to viewing today and has not lost its power. For the sake of perspective after seeing it one should then watch the magnificent modern film about this problem FREEDOM WRITERS 2007 see my review. Both of these films deal with some of the most serious issues of any society and both are classics deserving of the highest respect. Both are also absorbing and compulsive dramas of the utmost integrity.".

There are few films of which one can honestly say that it changed society but BLACKBOARD JUNGLE is certainly one of those. It holds up very well to viewing today and has not lost its power. For the sake of perspective after seeing it one should then watch the magnificent modern film about this problem FREEDOM WRITERS 2007 see my review. Both of these films deal with some of the most serious issues of any society and both are classics deserving of the highest respect. Both are also absorbing and compulsive dramas of the utmost integrity.";

Beaten but declaring I've been beaten up but I'm not beaten Ford decides the students are worth the trouble  even if they are mixedup scared neglected and lacking in religious or parental guidance...For a few minutes you wonder if the film is going to leave acts of rape serious property damage and brutal assault unpunished. It doesn't help that the main troublemakers are closer to age 30 than sweet little 16 in the closing scene Mr. Poitier looks like he's old enough to be teaching his own class in To Sir with Love 1967. But writerdirector Richard Brooks effectively takes Blackboard Jungle to the edge and brings it safely home. It is cool to see the villains are likely weeded out of the system their identities are not really much of a secret by the way so you don't have to worry about Sidney...It seems silly today but this film depicted race in a way that was very much needed.More interesting historically is the bracketing of the film with the song Rock Around the Clock by Bill Haley and His Comets. The record had peaked at a modest 23 in May 1954 before the group exploded in popularity with their cover of Shake Rattle and Roll that summer. The earlier hit was rereleased actually depending on your location it was never really unavailable for sale and appended to the film. Rock Around the Clock went to 1 for a multiweek stay and sold many millions. It helped promote the link between rock and roll and delinquency but the song has little to do with the film thematically.

Ford is Rick Dadier pronounced Dadiyay and the kids have a field day with Daddyyo. The movie is dated in many ways most of them superficial. And when he's writing his name on the board a baseball sails past his head and chips some oversized flakes out of the board.None of the students is cooperative or pleasant in any way. Ford identifies Sidney Poitier as the gang leader but he's wrong. It's really Vic Morrow the slouching negativist with the villainous face who's behind most of what goes wrong.Ford and his teacher friend Richard Kiley are clobbered at night in an alley. Ford is out of school for a week. Kiley quits after the kids destroy his precious 15year collection of old records. Ford's wife receives poison pen letters and gives birth prematurely.Finally Ford begins to reach the students partly by showing a cartoon about Jack and the Beanstalk partly by stimulating them with Socratic questions about justice violence and tolerance. After a violent showdown with Morrow and one other malignant adolescent it's clear that Ford has won not only the hearts of his students but those of his fellow teachers as well.This was a pop sensation when it was released. Bill Haley and the Comets sing Rock Around the Clock and it was on all the AM pop music stations. If Elvis had his ducktail haircut Bill Haley had a commashaped curl on his forehead. It didn't fly. The story is schematic almost to the point of pain but there had never been anything quite like it before and it resonated with the public. The dialog has a hell in it still unusual for the time. It also uses the N word and if I'm not mistaken the F word cut off by the honk of a horn. All very daring stuff.Paul Mazursky the director responsible for several modernist movies later plays an idiot student who saves Ford's life in the climax by pinning the miscreant to the blackboard with the lancelike point of a large American flag. The symbolism howls.It all gets extra points for originality. Evan Hunter on whose novel this is based was born Sal Lombino and some have claimed he changed his name because publishers were prejudiced against ItalianAmerican writers. Nonsense. Publishers will kill for the opportunity to publish anything that seems like a good seller and Blackboard Jungle fit the bill. Gay Talese suggests that Sal became Evan because reading and writing aren't highly valued skills for a man in an ItalianAmerican household. Talese himself grew up in a home with no newspapers or magazines on the shelves. In any case Lombino later adopted half a dozen aliases including Ed McBain best known for his Third Precinct policiers.The movie is enjoyable in itself but has added interest because of its historical value.".

	schema:reviewBody "Erin Clark Katrine Lazarski The Blackboard Jungle review December 4 2002We enjoyed The Blackboard Jungle and would strongly recommend others to see it.  It was an interesting depiction of youth culture and the educational system during the 1950s.  We liked it because it was prevalent to the issues that were occurring at the time as well as those in the present day.  For example the Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education dealt with racial integration in public schools. The film explored race relations as well as juvenile delinquency.  Music was also a significant theme in the film because of the controversy among rock n' roll and youth culture. We particularly liked Mr. Dadier's strength and determination as a teacher. He chose to work at an urban vocational school with kids who were notoriously troublemakers when he had the option of working at an affluent middle class high school.  We found Dadier's commitment to the boys' education to be selfless and honorable which is why we enjoyed the film so much.  We would especially recommend this film to teachers who may perhaps be searching for a motivation other than capital satisfaction.As students we have seen characteristics of Miller and West in classmates but don't have first hand experience.  We felt understanding of their situations more than actual identification with them.  The female roles were inaccurately portrayed for our time but suited females roles of the 1950s. The female characters therefore were even less identifiable for us than the students.  Concerning Dadier's social views and motivations he is most identifiable to us. One of the main messages this film provides is that the stigma of being a teenager is equivalent to being a delinquent is really a stereotype rather than a reality.  There obviously are teenage delinquents but the entire youth culture should not be blamed for this troublemaking few.  This film is very progressive in taking that stance.  This notion applies to every decade no matter if it is the 1950s or the 2000s.  Because of this The Blackboard Jungle is a realistic and relevant portrayal of youth culture even though it's not a recent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first feature length moral tale La Collectionneuse is easily better than its predecessors. Offering a realistic look into the lives of three young people and narrated perfectly by one La Collectionneuse is a beautiful film. This is Eric Rohmer's first color feature and it is absolutely magnificent to look at. There are several gorgeous beach scenes. The cinematography all around is just glorious. Aside from that the acting is wonderful. There is so much chemistry between the main characters that it electrifies the film. It also provides a realistic tale of the struggle to keep morality. Translated as The Collector in English La Collectionneuse is an overlooked underrated film that should be considered a classic.The story begins with three prologues. The first Haydee's prologue simply shows the girl on the beach in a skimpy bikini. The second prologue introduces the viewer to Daniel a painter who becomes a key character. Adrien's prologue the third and last gives us an introduction to Adrien who becomes our narrator throughout the rest of the film. These three characters are whom the story revolves around. Sharing a mutual friend the three of them come to share a villa during their vacation. Adrien an art dealer who is played by Patrick Bauchau has made it his goal to do absolutely nothing during his stay. He and Daniel Daniel Pommereulle become friends fairly quickly but both keep their distance from Haydee Haydee Politoff the beautiful young girl who beds a different guy every night. Adrien is at first disgusted with her behavior calling her a collector of men but eventually becomes intrigued by her. As he grows more and more attracted to her Adrien must decide whether or not to sleep with her and forget his moral integrity or to abstain and do what he knows is right. Through his narration Adrien debates this and plays mind games with Haydee although he's not sure if she shares the attraction or if she simply wants to add him to her collection.This film is simply beautiful. The sexual tension feels very real which is due to both the performances of the actors and the direction of Eric Rohmer who is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. The narration is refreshing offering a good look into Adrien's mind. La Collectionneuse is very sharp with its dialogue and themes. Like the other Rohmer films I've seen this one ends very abruptly. It reminds us that we're watching these people's lives for only a short time. The 87 minutes is completely worth it though. La Collectionneuse is a great film and should be regarded in higher esteem than it seems to be. I can't imagine why this one isn't ranked alongside the greats.1010".

This 'game' between the sexes only leads to unwanted desires for the men and a resumption of her search by Haydee.

Straying habitually close to the same story that makes up what the Moral Tales are about this one concerns a frisky female Haydee Haydee Politoff who captures the attention and equal repulsion of two other young men Daniel Daniel Pommereulle an artist with a penchant for making art that literally cuts its viewers who aren't sharp and Adrien Patrick Bauchau a young art dealer who is soon to make a lucrative purchase from an American artist.Haydee is first seen in a frank objectified way walking on the beach of Saint Tropez alone as the camera lingers on her face reminiscent of Charlize Theron her torso her legs. It's in a way Rohmer's mode of possibly depersonalizing his heroine since she remains a murky character with little definition  one moment submissive another moment quite takecharge but always obscure. It's also a way of introducing her carefree way to the viewer had she been introduced as a buttoneddown prim female it would have been clear her role would be that of a woman of stiff mores. But as we see throughout the movie Haydee is living in the middle of the swinging Sixties and she could care less about those things. Nor if her partying disturbs the sleep of Adrien or Daniel.Their share at the summer house in Saint Tropez is anything but placid. The two men are appalled at her behavior and decide not to have sex with Haydee for her own good. Adrien even decides to dub her The Collector  a moniker that makes up the title of the movie and points at a spiteful machismo because where men can be womanizers and be called studs women who take on this attitude are sanctioned. He stays at a distance from Haydee as she becomes involved with Daniel. Their liaison however becomes rocky and both soon part ways leaving Haydee and Adrien with an open door to come one step closer. In a shocking move Adrien offers her to a prospective client in order to secure a Song vase. Surprisingly she accepts not without an incident involving the aforementioned vase which in turn leads Haydee right into Adrien's arms.Rohmer's movie is not without its Rohmerisms where characters introduce themselves with lengthy discussions as to the nature of life love attractions and repulsions. In fact every character minus Haydee does so which makes her the more elusive and difficult to describe. Is she just floating along with what the men think they want? Or is she really clueless a woman who has a simple view on life and who doesn't find any guilt in her actions? Interestingly enough her philosophy is rather close to that of Adrien's girlfriend every male character in his Six Moral Tales arc has a steady who sees love as universal indifferent to beauty or ugliness. That Haydee acts upon Adrien's girlfriend's statement says a lot more about who the girlfriend might be but sheds an accessible light on Haydee.And anyways she comes off better than any of the two men as do the other females of Rohmer's sextet  Maud Laura or Chloe. It's also interesting that all of the other women are mainly brunette and aggressive or assertive in temper whereas the ideal one is frequently blond or passive in character. Even when objectified there is a mysterious likability within her that is missing in his two male leads. Adrien is a little hypocritical of his own observant nature and while he openly derides Haydee he also wants her. Daniel is a dark guy in this story and in all of the Six Moral Tales collection not just because of his paininducing art but a veneer of violence just underneath his arrogant demeanor. Maybe in this story  as well as all of his others  Rohmer seems to be the Ultimate Observer painting a picture in regards to immature men their attraction to a worldly female and their decision to remain in a complacent union with another one that can only be there as a Barbie doll.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to explain what is the Rohmer's cinema. In his movies you can't find heroes incredible adventures or great action sequences. Everything happens inside the mind of the characters and the most important aspect is the psychology of them.La Collectioneuse is simply the masterpiece of Rohmer. The plot is very simple two boys and one girl in their friend's house in St.Tropez. That's all. There are not incredible events that happen they simply LIVE there. It's an typical situation of Rohmer who likes to study the evolution of love triangles in different situations. The explanation of the development steps made by the usual interior voice of the main character Adrien it's incredibly accurate and likely. It's fantastic that sometimes Adrien's thoughts look at first to be absurd but even in this case if we reflect a bit to that we can realize that it's true that really in similar cases we have nonsense thoughts like those. In this way Rohmer is unique the psychoevolution of the characters is incredibly real. Dialogs internal and not are superb and the directing essential. Rohmer shows us how it's possible to make a masterpiece with a ridiculous budget and how an intellectual movie can be also enjoyable and not so heavy.The vote of course can't be different by 10 out of 10.".

Everything happens inside the mind of the characters and the most important aspect is the psychology of them.La Collectioneuse is simply the masterpiece of Rohmer. The plot is very simple two boys and one girl in their friend's house in St.Tropez. That's all. There are not incredible events that happen they simply LIVE there. It's an typical situation of Rohmer who likes to study the evolution of love triangles in different situations. The explanation of the development steps made by the usual interior voice of the main character Adrien it's incredibly accurate and likely. It's fantastic that sometimes Adrien's thoughts look at first to be absurd but even in this case if we reflect a bit to that we can realize that it's true that really in similar cases we have nonsense thoughts like those. In this way Rohmer is unique the psychoevolution of the characters is incredibly real. Dialogs internal and not are superb and the directing essential. Rohmer shows us how it's possible to make a masterpiece with a ridiculous budget and how an intellectual movie can be also enjoyable and not so heavy.The vote of course can't be different by 10 out of 10.";

	schema:headline " Rohmer's Slow Burning Tale Of Sixties Hedonism And Moral Pomposity";
	schema:reviewBody "Eric Rohmer's movies are it seems almost without exception slow burners that reward those with the patience to sit through them preferably more than once in some cases and think about whats being said as much as whats being shown. This his first feature in colour requires considerable thought on the part of the viewer serving up nothing in the way of dramatic excitement and featuring three loathsome main characters who's morals are very in keeping with the era of late 60s self satisfaction and hedonistic excess. Not that the hedonism is very wild. Jimi Hendrix does not blast from the simple record player that sits near a chair and provides the only music in the film. No one smokes anything illegal or pops any pills talks of Indian mystics or goes in for meditation. But there is the very liberated nowadays we'd say reckless attitude to casual sex although we don't see very much the relaxed tangle of naked legs half glimpsed through one doorway a brief an unrevealing shot of the main protagonist the disturbingly young looking Haydee quietly enjoying the intimate attention of another onenightstand. Otherwise it's all hints and the more effective for that. Haydee is the very image of a swingingsixties bed hopper. Young slender independent cool and seemingly amoral she wrecks the plans of Adrian an art dealer with time on his hands when he finds her resident in a borrowed holiday villa at which he intends to devote himself to doing nothing at all for a few weeks while his girlfriend is in London. Haydee's noisy nighttime frolics disturb his sleep and offend his self declared sense of morality and the added presence in the house of his lazy grumpy painterfriend Daniel sets up a spiralling tension between them all. But this is pure Rohmer and that tension manifests itself not in fistfights broken furniture tearful confessions and bloodletting but insults lowkeynighbrow arguments teasing sniping and political manoeuvring. In fact the more one thinks about the film and it's one of those movies that does hang around long after the credits the more one realises it's actually rather more like reallife certainly as most of us endure it from time to time than the overdramatic offerings we are used to from mainstream moviemakers. Haydee maybe cute Adrien describes himself as handsome and the setting is idyllic but you really wouldn't like to be on holiday with these unsympathetic characters. Observing their antics from without is one thing but to be part of it would be a nightmare! Oddly with it's morality so perfectly fixed in it's own time this seems far more like a film from the 1970s. Something in it's look and aftertheparty sense of deflation and disenchantment fits in with that later decade. Seeing it without knowing the release date you might well guess at 1972 or even later. If Godard's BANDE A PARTE is set in a SwingingSixties that hasn't yet arrived Rohmer's film portrays one that has already left the building although it's aftereffects continue to create a problem. It all sounds somewhat depressing on paper and to some extent it is! It's not an easy film but if you give it time and maybe second look you might well find there is more to this outwardly simple tale than you thought.".

Art.Prologue 2 Two French pseudointellectuals with mailorder Philosophy degrees engage in a discussion about a coffee mug with razorblades glued to it. The deep thinker on the right suggests it means something. The other deep thinker agrees. Nothing gets the blood of two 60s New Wave hobbythinkers boiling like a cup with razorblades clumsily attached to it. Art.Two friends Adrien and Daniel the cup gluer are resting on the French Riviera. They have decided not to do anything be idle for a while. And when two New Wave French cinema deep thinkers are on vacation you just know it won't be long before they do two things 1 exchange philosophical musings about the world and 2 share a woman. Which brings us to the toandfro beachwalking floozy from Prologue 1 Haydee. She and another man lover no.23783 join Daniel and Adrien. The gal and her loveur hurl pebbles at a group of chickens. Adrien is not amused but his curiosity is tickled. Art. The narrator initially wants nothing to do with this chickenhating harlot he finds her too base even for his amoral hedonistic ways he claims to have high morals in the dating arena but we know better than to believe him. Haydee has the voice of an 11 yearold boy and just as much below the neck i.e. you can certainly understand why artloving men fall for her in their thousands. To be fair she has a very cute face i.e. not at all boyish  which might just explain why she isn't an instant object of desire for Daniel and Adrien.Nonetheless our monotonevoiced narrator soon starts to rationalize the growing number of Haydeeinduced erections in his pants by deceiving himself that his growing interest in her is because she isn't empty headed like the others. Art.How he reaches the rather suspicious conclusion that her IQ is higher than a chimp's I do not know. Her sentences rarely contain more than 3 words. But I guess when you do nothing all day but read Rousseau your judgment tends to get a little clouded. French philosophers will do that to youSoon we find out what German Romantics do to the floozy. Rather unconvincingly she holds a book called Les Romantiques Allemandes in spite of the fact that even the average episode of Asterix the Gaul must be far too demanding for her. That very day as if wanting to release her from the boredom of having to spend the whole evening pretending to read a philosophy book Adrien suggests a night out. Soon he makes his moves but she plays hard to get. She runs away sobbingly? laughingly? the editor decided not to make her weird grunts comprehensible to the viewer straight into the hands of Daniel with whom she had a brief fling a few days earlier. The two embrace passionately  in spite of the fact that Daniel and Haydee were supposed to be not on good terms. Don't ask me what the hell is going on. I'm just the viewer. Needless to say art.Next up is a brief scene in which Adrien shows a 10thcentury vase to Haydee. He turns it around so the cameraman can capture its other side too which looks pretty much the same and then he flips the vase back to its original position. I'm just glad this wasn't a 15minute scene. Art. Later grumpy Daniel vaguely resembling David Warner bangs his right foot against the livingroom floor over and over like a semicatatonic lunatic. Haydee dares complain about the annoying noise. Daniel reacts to her with a vicious yet pointless diatribe about beauty and ugliness. Being unusually homely himself I'm a little surprised that he'd even dare touch the subject. He also mentions the Sun briefly making some NewWaveian analogy not worth repeating here. Summa sumarum this entire venomous antiHaydee tirade occurs just because she rightfully complained about his childish behavior. Daniel should be glad that a cutie like Haydee ever even looked at him  let alone actually agreed to bed him.Breaking the bliss of this slightly idle trio is an art collector Sam. He sounds like Darth Vader and throws in a few exciting comments about the muchtouted elephantbased ancient vase. Daniel shows up and true to his fickle 60s New Wave temperament starts berating Sam for being an art collector. The rant is mercifully short though and the message is as simple as it is moronic and pointless I hate art collectors so I refuse to kiss your behind. Was Daniel molested as a child by a similar kind of baritonevoiced art collector or is he merely as dumb as a doorknob? Later Sam decides to berate Adrien for his sloth while the latter defends himself by trying to rationalize his layabout existence as some form of higher existence a typical languagerapist in the best New Wave tradition.In the end we find out that these 80 minutes of New Wave French cinema were about Adrien's attempts to start feeling independent. Hallelujah.Rohmer once said that he focused on the cinema of thoughts rather than actions. So why didn't he just publish books then? Cinema happens to be largely a visual medium. Perhaps someone forgot to tell him But next to Godard he must be a genius.Still LC is a watchable flick some of the dialog being fairly interesting. On the other hand I'm not one of those Tabula Rasa viewers who are easily impressed by any thought or conversation deeper than a pub discussion about a Premier League draw. It takes more than coffee table philosophers to get my adrenaline going".

In doing so he became perhaps the cinema's greatest director of women. Let's forget for a moment that he divided his films into series Six Moral Tales for example of which La Collectionneuse is one and concentrate on the film at hand.La Collectionneuse is very simple and very straightforward. Two male friends spend a summer sharing a villa in the south of France. There is another occupant a slightly younger woman who sleeps around and it is she the men christen the collector since she 'collects' men wherever she goes. They of course consider themselves moral but they are also intellectuals and perhaps womanisers too. They want to collect the girl they want the girl to collect them.Like all of Rohmer's best work this is a film of talk rather than action. Rohmer doesn't film love scenes or sex scenes once his male and female characters enter the bedroom he loses interest. It's the chase and not the catch he cares about and whether men and women really can be friends as well as lovers. He takes his subjects seriously but he also likes to have fun at their expense and like so many of his films La Collectionneuse will have you chuckling if not exactly laughing out loud.In his later films it was usually the women who took the lead but here it is Adrien a superb Patrick Bauchau who acts as our narrator guiding us through the moral maze but then all three players are excellent. This may be a minor Rohmer film but minor only in the way a short story is considered minor when compared to a novel. Personally I think La Collectionneuse is a Rohmer crying out for your collection.".

You might wonder why I keep watching his films and it's because sometimes I have enjoyed themsuch as with Autumn Tale. But too often I find his films extremely talky and slow...too slow.This story is about a pretentious and morally superior man named Adrien. He is the sort of guy who THINKS he's somehow better and more intelligent than most but in this film he just seems like a jerk. This jerk goes to stay at some summer home along with his friend Daniel. Daniel is a sullen and grouchy jerk and perhaps even more difficult to like than Adrien. Into this joyous household comes a freespirited and VERY sexually liberated young lady Hayde. Daniel and Adrien immediately look down on her because of her blas attitude about sex but soon it becomes clear that the two men would be more than willing to score with her. Adrien takes the approach of a guy who is indifferent to her and he seems to spend most of the film convincing himself he does NOT want Hayde. By the end of the film will Adrien and Hayde 'hook up'?The idea of a pseudointellectual snob who feigns indifference towards a sexually adventurous lady isn't the most exciting thing but it could have been much more interesting. First injecting the movie with ENERGY would have sure helped. Instead this movie is almost glacially slow and dull. Second making the characters likable in some way would have increased the audience's connection with the film. I hated Adrien and Daniel in particular. Third the movie should not have been done mostly with voiceovers by Adrien. Allowing the characters to talk and allowing everything to unfold without narration would have made it more interesting and less pretentious. Overall I guess this is another one of Rohmer's stories that I just don't get.".

	schema:headline " Unravelling ego of a socialite art dealer";
	schema:reviewBody "Adrien the narrator and main character of La Collectionneuse vacations at a house of a friend and patron in the south of France. He is planning to open an art gallery after years of supporting himself in a murkily defined role in the art scene based on his connections his personal charms and his scheming. He is separated perhaps permanently from his girlfriend a polished model beaming with positivity who doesn't take him altogether seriously. While on vacation he shares the house with Daniel an awkward intense avantgarde artist with a hatred of mediocre society and a pretty inarticulate young drifter Haydee. Adrien wants to center himself in a feeling of solitude in preparation for his gallery opening but instead becomes increasingly obsessed with Haydee who is not his type but whose escapades with other men dent his ego. Neither Adrien nor Daniel find it acceptable to be just another in a long line of mostly mediocre men that the somewhat generic and vague Haydee finds only okay yet they don't want to be left out either.The tropical location and good looking leads of the film provide eye candy but the overall message of the film is sour and bleak. However this is a bleakness and sourness that is enjoyable revealing a psychological terrain that is realistic rather than filmic. None of the relationships pictured are profound but overall are driven by a need to score points over others or a involuntary desire for acceptance and gratification. Reunion with his girlfriend in London is less a moral triumph of true love and more a desire for a more satisfactory ego prop.Most striking is the antiromance at the heart of the film. Adrien and Haydee are not dissimilar both of them bohemian outsiders who don't take well to conformity and the 9to5 life both of whom get by on their personal charm and willingness to ingratiate themselves with the more stable. However far from finding true love together they never really connect. Haydee's attention drifts from man to man and Adrien is caught up in posturing to prove that he is someone. The simple childlike Haydee with her lack of ambitions and pretenses is not good enough for him in his mind while to her he is perverse and feels superior for no reason.Two of the best moments in the film are the beginning and the end. In the beginning we are presented with Haydee. She is beautiful young healthy walking on a beautiful beach. It is a perfect picture. Only she is walking back and forth to nowhere in particular her face is rather plain her haircut silly her expression vague and dissatisfied. She's desirable but there's nothing especially impressive about her hence the dissatisfaction to haunt the protagonist. Then at the end the protagonist finds himself alone in paradise freed from bickering. Far from being peaceful there is a sense it is depressing. One longs to return to the happier days of unhappiness just as Haydee expressed in her simple and seemingly stupid fashion earlier in the movie and like the narrator is forced to admit in the end.This is one of my favorite of the Moral Tales feeling less talky and ultimately moralizing than most. It's a somewhat small film ultimately about one man's imperfect character and his squabbles with a few others. Nothing much happens and the point seems to take the cheap shot of snarking on the egotist male protagonist. However still it's a movie well worth seeing and enjoyable.".

Searching inwards what takes me aback actually is the three protagonists Adrien Bauchau an art dealer Daniel Pommereulle a painter and Hayde Politoff a young girl the titular collectionneuse none of them is really simpatico enough to deserve viewers' attentiveness on top of that after three rapid prologues introducing those three the entire film is vexingly hinged on Adrien's viewpoint with his  and he is the most obnoxious one among them narcissistic supercilious and selfcentred ever since he meets Hayde a stranger who stays with him and Daniel in a villa of their their common friend in Riviera for vacation. The arrival of Hayde disrupts Adrien's doing nothing plan of his holiday especially when he can smugly occupy the moral high ground to hold her promiscuity in contempt meanwhile his resolution of not being one of her collection is persistently being challenged by Hayde's sensuality a typical tugofwar between moral superiority and libidinous inferiority. Hayde sports an ingnue appearance is in another quandary as she confesses without the usual pretence she is looking for a normal relationship but every man she meets only attracts to her sex appeal obviously she forgets birds of a feather flock together if she wants a more meaningful relationship she should opt for a different potential market not those hormonedriven lads. Yet the heart wants what the heart wants she is too young to realise that and which is why she enjoys playing the catchandrelease game with Adrien treats him like her usual prey starts the first move then retreats to a blas niche towards his tentative courtship as titillating as it can be sometimes it backfires.

Daniel the third footing of the triangle is more elusive since mostly he is more of an outsider observing the game emotionlessly until he participates in as a catalyst to meddle with the imbroglio at one time it seems he would play a more significant counterpart in the contest but after a bit he is defeated and drops out leaving the room for Sam Archer an American art collector whom Adrien is doing business with to be manipulated for another test of the bottom line between the sex battle only it will cost him an expensive Chinese vase from Song Dynasty. Majestically shot under the natural light after all as cerebral and insightful as Rohmer's master stroke is THE COLLECTOR doesn't strike the same chord as his two latter films THE AVIATOR'S WIFE 1981 and PAULINE AT THE BEACH 1983 I've previously watched but it will not discourage me from his works it is just a little bump on the road never mind.".

At first the boys don't care about Haydee except finding her an annoyance but shortly they include her in their inner circle.

At the same time however Adrien lusts after the girl. A set of mind games unfold with the two people pushing and pulling eachother waiting for their prey to show its weak spot so they can emerge victoriously in the end.The movie was very entertaining I'm not sure if I ever saw such honest sexual chemistry on screen before. And not just that all the characters work very well with eachother in every sequence. The actors are great the writing is smart and sharp with a deal of great oneliners although sometimes the plot felt a bit dragged. The camera work is incredibly well done especially for a '60s movie. Despite the tense nature of the main subject how a relationship forms between two people the movie feels very light  I guess it has to do with the characters I dont give a damnmentality which was well shown through their actions. The reason I'm giving 8 stars while the movie was very entertaining I don't feel like it had any real impact on me. I don't believe it should have though.Overall La Collectionneuse is an excellent movie to watch with that Art Student girl you've been chatting with on Tinder for three days now.".

Here we have several characters who are either incredibly cynical or hedonistic. Haydee provides a true match for the two young men who seem to have an incredible amount of time on their hands.

	schema:reviewBody "Three gogo dancers  Varla Tura Satana Rosie Haji and Billie Lori Williams  are racing their sports cars out in the desert when they meet up with a young man named Tommy Ray Barlow and his girlfriend Linda Susan Bernard. Tommy is an amateur car racer who has come out to do some time trials. Varla challenges him to a race. When she cuts him off with her car it leads to a fight and she kills him. Dragging the frightened Linda with them the trio go into the nearest town to fill up with petrol. There they see a muscly young man Dennis Busch carrying his crippled father Stuart Lancaster to his truck. The petrol station attendant Mickey Foxx tells the girls that the muscle man is retarded and that his bitter old father is reputed to be rich but must have his riches stashed away somewhere at his isolated homestead. The girls decide to drop in for a visit hoping to find the old man's riches. They pass off Linda as a rich man's runaway daughter they are bringing home against her will. What they don't know is that the old man is a misogynist who delights in kidnapping women for his son whom he refers to only as The Vegetable to rape. They will have to rely on their own deadly talents and the possible decency of the old man's other son Kirk Paul Trinka.Russ Meyer's black and white ode to the violence in women made little impact when first released in 1965. Meyer had taken the world by storm with The Immoral Mr. Teas 1959 the film most often credited with kicking off the nudie cutie craze. And he would become a household name with the success of Vixen! 1968. But the films he made between those two landmarks though some of them are among his best work didn't attract much attention. But then John Waters in his 1981 autobiography Shock Value wrote  'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'...is beyond a doubt the best movie ever made. It is possibly better than any film that will be made in the future. Waters dubbed Meyer the Eisentein of sex films because his use of skillful editing to get maximum impact out of scenes of sex and violence is reminiscent of the methods by which the Russian director managed to powerfully convey his political messages. Waters' championing of Faster Pussycat! in particular led to it becoming a favourite on college campus's across America.If Meyer is the Eisenstein of sex films then Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! is the Citizen Kane of trash films. I don't use the term disparagingly. For me a trash film is a film which appeals on a visceral rather than purely emotional level. In trash films realism is bad style. We must always know that we are watching a movie and enjoy it as a fantasy formed from our own base drives  from those uncivilised aspects of our nature that we must repress to live a civilised existence. Hence the term trash for the substance of these films is those aspects of ourselves which must be discarded. The violence in the trash film appeals to the knot in our stomach from every time we've had to bite back on our anger. It's prurient sexuality appeals to the lusts generated by everyday existence for which we may have insufficient outlet. We don't sympathise with the characters in a film like this but we can identify with their actions because they take place in an obvious fantasy world. But the trash film has another appeal  the exhilaration that comes from the transgression of the bounds of good taste. And its sense of humour is the kind which elicits a bellylaugh. The anarchic spirit of the trash film has no less value than the more rarefied pleasures and intellectual stimulation of the art film.What makes Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! great is the way that it takes the sex and violence of the trash film and distills them into something more iconic than explicit. Unlike most of Meyer's films there is no frontal nudity or sex scenes. The violence is powerful but not extended or shown in gory detail. Yet Tura Satana in her tight black jeans halfexposed breasts practically bursting free as she eyes up a man like a side of beef or takes him out with karate chop to the neck distills any amount of sex and violence into a single unforgettable mythic figure. Similarly the vastly underrated Stuart Lancaster is the very personification of sleazy misogyny. Add to this the brilliant buildup of the opening monologue Meyer's masterful editing and Jack Moran's eminently quotable and often hilariously funny camp dialogue and you have a trash film masterpiece that just gets better and better the more times you watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched and enjoyed most of Russ Meyer's output and will quite happily defend his lesser works but two of his movies have a life of their own and have managed to reach a larger audience than just card carrying Meyer nuts. They are 'Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls' and this one 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'. Both movies are trash classics and never fail to entertain no matter how many times you have seen them. 'Faster Pussycat!' really succeeds mainly because of the three strong leads Tura Satana Lori Williams and Haji. Any one of them would be enough for Meyer to plan a killer movie around but all three together is dynamite! Satana strangely enough did very little movie work after this mainly a couple of Ted Mikels turkeys. But it doesn't really matter because her screen immortality is assured. Her performance in this movie is more than enough! Williams also went on to very little but she is very good here and stylistically reminds me quite a bit of Erica Gavin in 'Vixen!'. In fact one could almost bet that if Meyer had been aware of Gavin when he made this movie she would have played the part of Billie. Haji appeared in a few more Meyer movies including his masterpiece 'Supervixens' but this is probably her strongest role. All three women who play gogo dancers by night thrill seeking criminals by day are simply wonderful and their chemistry and repartee are priceless. Meyer regular Stuart Lancaster is also in fine form as a dirty old man with more issues than a daily newspaper. There are so many unforgettable scenes in this movie it's difficult to single any out. The whole movie just rocks period. Many late 60s movies attempted to emulate a camp comic book appeal 'Barbarella' 'Diabolik'etc.etc. but in many ways Meyer beat them all and did so without technicolor large sets multiple costumes special effects and other gimmicks. Just crisp black and white photography and three chicks in the desert. Plus a brilliant theme song later immortalized by The Cramps. Russ Meyer divides most viewers. You either get it or you don't. If you aren't familiar with his work this is probably THE place to start. Watching this movie for many is a life changing experience! 'Faster Pussycat!' is one of the most original and entertaining movies made in the 1960s and continues to amuse and inspire right into the 21st Century. Every time I watch this movie I am knocked out. This is a bona fide cult classic that gets better and better as the years go by. Absolutely essential viewing for anyone who loves exploitation movies The Sixties rock'n'roll andor buxom babes!".

	schema:headline " Female domination meets Nouvelle Vogue in amazing trash cult fashion!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've got to admit after the first ten minutes or so I really didn't think I was going to like this film. However it isn't long before Russ Meyer's film takes off  and before I knew it I was watching one of the greatest pieces of trash ever to hit the silver screen! If you want a Bmovie this film has all the essential ingredients. We've got fast cars fighting killing snappy dialogue and a trio of buxom beauties in the lead roles! It's quite clear that this film is made purely for entertainment value  as the plot is nonexistent and the characters don't go any deeper than the common Bmovie stereotypes but it doesn't matter  because entertain it does and this is about as 'cult' as it gets! Shot in crisp black and white and with all the energy of the Nouvelle Vogue cinema doing the rounds in sixties France Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! awesome trashy title follows three women dancers by night and fast car riding killers by day! We follow them as they stumble upon an old farmhouse inhabited by an old man as sick as they themselves. He's got some money hidden and the lead chick wants it...only the old man and his sons stand in her way.It's immediately clear that acting isn't this film's strongpoint the dialogue sounds forced and ridiculous and none of the cast do good jobs of making their characters real  yet in true trash fashion it's the ensemble that is this film's main asset. The trio of women are the main players with the busty and exotic Tura Satana taking centre stage and being backed up by Haji and the stunning Lori Williams. These three would make any film worth watching and the way that Russ Meyer ensures that the girls are always the strongest presence on screen gives Faster Pussycat a lot of its cult value. The film moves quickly and the action is fast edited and cut with an imminently cool soundtrack thus making the film amazingly watchable and an obvious influence on the likes of Quentin Tarantino. The fact that this film pokes fun of cinematic violence by having women in the leads will always make it memorable the fact that they've got big breasts only makes that more so. This is an absolute cult classic and I suspect a film that I'll be seeing over and over again. This is one of those films that has to be seen to be believed  so make sure you don't miss it!".

	onyx:emotionText "I've got to admit after the first ten minutes or so I really didn't think I was going to like this film. However it isn't long before Russ Meyer's film takes off  and before I knew it I was watching one of the greatest pieces of trash ever to hit the silver screen! If you want a Bmovie this film has all the essential ingredients. We've got fast cars fighting killing snappy dialogue and a trio of buxom beauties in the lead roles! It's quite clear that this film is made purely for entertainment value  as the plot is nonexistent and the characters don't go any deeper than the common Bmovie stereotypes but it doesn't matter  because entertain it does and this is about as 'cult' as it gets! Shot in crisp black and white and with all the energy of the Nouvelle Vogue cinema doing the rounds in sixties France Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! awesome trashy title follows three women dancers by night and fast car riding killers by day! We follow them as they stumble upon an old farmhouse inhabited by an old man as sick as they themselves. He's got some money hidden and the lead chick wants it...only the old man and his sons stand in her way.It's immediately clear that acting isn't this film's strongpoint the dialogue sounds forced and ridiculous and none of the cast do good jobs of making their characters real  yet in true trash fashion it's the ensemble that is this film's main asset. The trio of women are the main players with the busty and exotic Tura Satana taking centre stage and being backed up by Haji and the stunning Lori Williams. These three would make any film worth watching and the way that Russ Meyer ensures that the girls are always the strongest presence on screen gives Faster Pussycat a lot of its cult value. The film moves quickly and the action is fast edited and cut with an imminently cool soundtrack thus making the film amazingly watchable and an obvious influence on the likes of Quentin Tarantino. The fact that this film pokes fun of cinematic violence by having women in the leads will always make it memorable the fact that they've got big breasts only makes that more so. This is an absolute cult classic and I suspect a film that I'll be seeing over and over again. This is one of those films that has to be seen to be believed  so make sure you don't miss it!";

The only not typical thing about this movie is that none of the chicks has a nude scene what is really a pity! On the first view Russ Meyers flick is nothing else but a funny piece of trash from the swinging 60s. But on the second its a portrait about the power of female sexuality on men. The sex characteristics differ from the usual stereotypes the male are the victims the women are the offenders who apply their weapons unscrupulous to reach their aims. Also they are physically stronger and more cunning than the naive guys in this film. Especially Varla becomes a sexy but immense violent murder machine and that makes her being one of the most frightening women in the history of cinema! But Faster Pussycat! Kill!

First there are the two quintessential Meyer women Tura Satana and Haji towering brunettes with enormous breasts who dominate all the men around them or at least Satana does Haji's character with a strange ItalianMexican accent? is more focused on Satana than on men. They actually come across as a feminist empowerment fantasy which is consistent with Meyer's almost exclusive career focus on situations in which women wreak their will upon men.If they are too extreme for your tastes there is blonde free spirit Lori Williams and airheaded sweet young thing Susan Bernard. While arguably the two prettiest women to have ever graced a film there is no argument that William's character is the sexiest of all time. Interestingly it was the sweetfaced Bernard who became a Playboy centerfold just a few months after the movie December 1966.But Pussycat's greatness comes from the visceral power of Meyer's unusual images can you say Fellini. Add to this abundant humor inventive camera angles fast pacing clever editing violence and a generally amoral cast of characters.The film gets even better with subsequent viewings you connect better with the twisted dialogue and the wry humor.".

Names like Jess Franco Herschell Gordon Lewis Al Adamson Pete Walker and Russ Meyer would be mighty high on any list of exploitation masters. The latter Russ Meyer may well have a serious claim to be labelled the most important of all the exploitation directors for his work goes beyond merely making money from sex nudity violence and other such sensationalism. Meyer is actually a serious artist whose philosophies and techniques make his films instantly recognisable. In some ways he is just as important and influential as Hitchcock Huston Lean and Visconti  though critically perhaps correctly his films are received with far less acknowledgement and acclaim. Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! is Meyer's most popular most famous and probably most entertaining film. It is a true original perhaps too different for many tastes but certainly one of the quintessential films within the exploitation genre.Three sexy gogo dancers  Varla Tura Santana Rosie Haji and Billie Lori Williams  spend their spare time carracing in the Californian desert. Varla in particular has a competitive edge and a vicious streak so when challenged to a car race by egotistical Tommy Ray Barlow she cannot resist. The race gets out of hand and Varla a karate expert ends up savagely murdering her rival Tommy. Following the killing the trio of girls decide that they have nothing to lose and so indulge in various other unsavoury activities. First they kidnap Tommy's girlfriend Linda Susan Bernard then head off into the sunset in search of further kicks. They eventually wind up at a ranch owned by a wheelchairbound old man Stuart Lancaster who lords over two sons with an iron fist. One of the sons is sensitive Kirk Paul Trinka the other is a gigantic retard known simply as Boy Dennis Busch whose brute strength alone is fearinspiring. Varla and her sidekicks suspect that the ranchdwellers may have a fortune in cash and set about finding it and stealing it. They use their considerable sex appeal to seduce the younger ranch hands but the bitter old man proves a far tougher nut to crack.This film is typical Meyer  the usual doses of perversity nastiness and excessive cleavage are there for all to see and it is put together with considerable skill. Meyer usually served as his own producer and editor on films and in this one his editing is especially impressive. The film is shot in black and white but still manages some startling imagery notably Santana's crunching slaying of Barlow early in the film expertly framed against the dusky desert wilderness. The script is less impressive with an almost adolescent singleminded reliance on flesh and brutality that is taken to and beyond the extreme. Sometimes you might find yourself asking what the hell you're watching especially as the film enters its deranged final section. You might even find yourself fearing for Meyer's mental wellbeing for it does indeed take a pretty perverted imagination to come up with a story as twisted as this one. Generallyspeaking the performances are rather amateurish although Santana makes an unforgettable impression through sheer lipsmacking relish as well as her extraordinary cleavage in her role as the most sadistic femme fatale ever seen on film. If you're interested in cult movies then Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! is an absolute mustsee. indeed only when you've seen it can you consider yourself a genuine authority on the subject of cult films.".

Three beautiful exotic dancers with the exact right measurements revolt against the masculine lifestyle and go out on a rampage. Riding fast cars provoke men and sweet similar stuff. Leader of the pack is the gorgeous Varla portrayed by the more than impressive Tura Satana. She's one massive heap of estrogen who kills men with her bare hands and enjoys riding over people with her car. Her two accomplices have a tad bit more humanity in them. They're Lori Williams a gorgeous looking blond girl and Haji her accent alone causes chemical reactions inside a man's body. The lovely threesome ends up among rednecks in a farmhouse somewhere in the middle of a desert. Meyer's style is a joy for all senses! The film is filled with memorable quote material and the screenplay is very ingenious at times. The male weirdoes in the farmhouse actually predate Tobe Hooper's Sawyer family with almost a decade! Faster Pussycat! Kill Kill has pretty much in common with Motor Psycho a film shot by Meyer in the same year. There's a main villain ultrainsane and prepared to go all the way while his followers merely fear him rather than support him. So basicallythis IS Motor Psychobut with boobs!! Hey I'm all for feminism so let's hear it for FASTER PUSSYCAT! KILL KILL!".

Find something weird surround it with anything. In this movie Meyers takes four wellendowed females and makes them mean. Well one is stupid and likes to cry and run away. The other three are mean for no reason to everybody. Even when they are trying to trick people they are mean. The bodies look great. The faces are hard. The minds are psychotic. Most comments go overboard about how beautiful these women are but in truth if you saw these women on the street they should send you running. Even the stupid one looks psycho enough to make you hide the steak knives before you go to sleep. Meyers successfully ensures that the plot does not get in the way of the action. Great movie if you like angry women with large breasts loser men who deserve to die and a gas station attendant who must be the crazy uncle of Goober and Gomer Pyle.".

It would be hard to refer to it as the kind of film that or it's like this or that because it truthfully stands alone. If anything most of the relationships this film has to anything else have been forged with the pop culture it inspired.Given it really has one at all the film's plot revolves around a trio of tough women who are gogo dancers by night and wickedly violent speed demons by day. During one afternoon in the middle of the desert they encounter a young couple. Ultimately one of the women kills the man kidnaps the young woman and attempts to use her as bait for a dirty old man and his sons.There's little rhyme or reason to most of what happens except as an amped up display of wellendowed sexually engaging women and raw in your face violence. This highly lauded film among the art house and drivein set is great juvenile fun with some exceedingly memorable albeit corny dialogue.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering its fame it comes as a bit of a surprise to learn that this Russ Meyer movie wasn't successful on first release. In fact it did a lot worse than Meyer's subsequent effort Motor Psycho. The latter was essentially a more traditional exploitation flick in which a gang of thugs go around causing violence. The chief difference between this movie and Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! was that in the latter the villains were a gang of girls. It seems audiences in 1965 weren't ready for the kind of dangerous women that Meyer unleashed women as amoral and violent as traditional male villains. Nowadays there will be very few people indeed who consider Motor Psycho the better film while Faster Pussycat is not only regarded by many as Meyer's best film but also one of the very best exploitation films ever made. The reason it didn't connect at the time was really because it was too far ahead of the game.For a film made in the mid60's Faster Pussycat has a very modern feel. One of the reasons for this was because of Meyer's sharp photography coupled with his precision editing. His films were very stylised and Faster Pussycat is a great example. His camerawork is always consummate and great looking while the three lead women are consistently well shot  Meyer always ensures that they look fantastic. These women are of course the pussycats  gogo dancers drag racers killers  and a cooler gang of villains there has never been. The leader Varla is truly a one in a million. Played by the indescribably sensational Tura Satana she is clad entirely in black and goes around shouting lines of great dialogue at whoever comes within distance. Has there ever been a temptress as cool and dangerous as Varla in cinema ever since? No there certainly has not. Then there is Billie played by Lori Williams who is the loose cannon of the group. On the surface she seems the least threatening of the trio but she is under no one's thumb and Williams is extremely seductive. Completing the trio is Rosie played by the one and only Haji. Personally she is my favourite of the three. She has the most magnificent overthetop Latino? accent and gestures I have ever seen. Needless to say all three pussycats are glorious. The male characters are much less interesting  how could they not be?  but still Meyer regular Stuart Lancaster is once again very good in the role as a wheelchairbound nasty misogynist while it would be remiss not to mention that he has a simple minded son who is known simply as The Vegetable.But Faster Pussycat is not all about the visuals. The script by Jack Moran is extremely memorable and full of brilliant oneliners. Varla in particular spits out this dialogue with some verve. It remains a very amusing film because of the sheer funniness of the script. The movie even begins with a voiceover that starts with the genius line 'welcome to violence!' We are subsequently warned of a new type of woman a dangerous female who will kill without warning. All of this is accompanied by a black screen with audio distortion lines. Directly after this we are in a gogo club where we are immediately introduced to the pussycats. And we are off driving through the desert along with the ultracool theme tune by The Bostweeds. It's one of the greatest openings to any film in my personal opinion.Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! is a film full of entertainment from start to finish. There are many moments to savour and it shows  if evidence was really needed  that Russ Meyer was a really great filmmaker. And yes this really is one of the greatest exploitation movies ever made!".

Billie sets her sights on the retarded muscular sonDennis Buschwho has a specific irritable weakness when trains pass..something about them scars his psyche. Will Varla find the old man's money? What will happen to poor Linda who tries so often to get away but seems to never quite make it? Will anyone survive with Varla always scheming to find that cash? Ultraviolence prevails in Meyer's flick which is interesting because he allows Varla to be such a tyrant and seemingly indestructible when battling men. She swallows the weak whole and dominates all the characters. She sets her furious sights on something and doesn't think twice about diving after no matter what it is. Men presented in the film are weak and they seem almost kneebent to the lusts they carry. The film has wonderful slick beatnik dialogue and the way the camera shoots the characters is excellent. I loved how Meyer shoots the women behind the steering wheel. We can easily tell that they are merely in a superficial concoction with film crewmembers moving the fake car with the girls inside but this provides Meyer with a unique way of lensing their expressions of joy and malice as they race each other and chosen victims who have no idea what kind of dames they are dealing with.".

So maybe it was a kind of pilgrimage but at least I knew I wouldn't have to kiss a large rock at the end of it. ....The key to enjoyable junk is that everyone involved with it be on the same page.

And if movie buffs watch LA PASSANTE DU SANS SOUCI their reactions are usually diverse. It does not occur to be a great production nor a wonderful film that one could watch all over again. LA PASSANTE DU SANS SOUCI is rather an average work. Yet after viewing the film the majority occur to remember it. Why?Its content is pretty clichd the action is far from good the colors appear to be clearly long in the teeth. A story of a Jewish family escaping the cruel Nazis is rather a widespread theme nowadays some people would say... This goes in pairs with weak character development since the film is based on flashbacks the gist being the events of yore that find the light of truth at present in the court. Murder suspicion fear war hardship prejudice these are the themes of the movie. The script is also not very clever except for some minor moments. Of course we get the insight into the psyche of the main character a Jew Max Baumstein Michel Piccoli his childhood youth and adulthood yet it is all around the things that we all know pretty well. Nevertheless the movie can boast two aspects that are so powerful that lead us all to pardoning possible flaws.The first strongest point of the movie is the acting from two people the famous pair of fabulous artists Romy Schneider and Michel Piccoli. Romy Schneider in her last movie plays two roles two women that appear in Max Baumstein's life Elsa Wiene a symbol of motherly love and Lina Baumstein a symbol of female love. It appears that her two roles are integral create as if the main character's dream memory combined with reality and upright thoughts. She is the female of Max's world existing in his inner and outer world. But the most important fact to mention about Romy is not so much her double acting but the way she executes it. After the first viewing of the movie I became breathless for a while and asked the person who was watching the film with me is it possible that this is all acted? Is it possible to achieve such a marvelous insight into art of portrayal? No these roles are biographical. In the famous scene when Max plays the violin at the Christmas party Romy looks at him and genuine tears fall on her cheeks. Max reminds her of her beloved son David whom she tragically lost in July 1981. In another powerful moment when she says It's all over referring to her husband Michel she desperately looks for relief in drinking. That's what the actress did in the last years of her life. She not only shouts in despair I want my Michel but also I want my David! Yet the destiny occurs indifferent to cry. Besides you cannot skip the nostalgic scene at the railroad station... Romy Schneider does something absolutely unforgettable a thrill that goes through your back something you cannot resist. Therefore LA PASSANTE DU SANS SOUCI being Romy's last film is undeniably one of the most Romy Schneider films.The male star of the movie Michel Piccoli is also very convincing in the role of Max. He kills the eminent figure but gives a logically heartfelt justification for his deed I wish no one would have to live so difficult a life I had in my youth due to Nazis and the hell they had given to us. Mr Piccoli had appeared in films with Romy before but I admit that this is the best of his roles. Piccoli appears to be genuine very memorable and clever enough to manage difficult scenes that create dense atmosphere. Yet no one can say in spite of the fact that he plays the main role that it is so much the Michel Piccoli movie as the Romy Schneider one.The second strong point of LA PASSANTE DU SANS SOUCI is the exceptional sentiment. Due to specific music dense atmosphere nostalgia created mostly by Ms Schneider you as a viewer are unwillingly even led into the world of this film into the tragedies of people that suffered into the endless walk towards happiness. You together with the characters have a feeling more to say a desire to create something better in the world. You suddenly realize that there is something missing around us shortage of empathy perhaps. It all raises questions and reflections about such critical truths like justice dignity of life social relations etc. Young Max playing the violin seems to symbolize this quest for a better world lost world that we have to recapture. And that is the strongest power of the film because if it hadn't been for the heartfelt message and reflections what sense would that all carry? I agree that the Nazis are showed in a very stereotypical way just a group of bandits who want to raise the terror on the streets and who are only good at beating the Jews whom they meet by chance. However what could be the view of these people created in the mind of a small boy who lived in fear. I personally think that those scenes showing Max hiding himself under tables and trembling with fear draw our attention to one of the key aspects of war who really suffers are the innocent children. All in all there would be of course much to criticize about the film. It's a flawed movie certainly. Yet it has the fabulous rolesrole of Romy Schneider and the truly unforgettable mood. The message is all right too. It makes us realize that both the characters and we all are constantly the endless walkers towards happiness. Therefore I rate it 710".

The only thing I remember before this projection is that's a sad story between Romy and a kid in the Nazi time. surprised to be back in the Paris of the 80s as the start of the movie as it remains a golden period for me. In France everyone everything seems filled with a sense of new age new spirit new ideas that technology today fails to bring. For those like me who interests in human rights you can see that maybe the world has gone in a good direction as all the abuses Piccolli addresses in his speech are now closed Ireland Apartheid South America USSR. Then the movie goes indeed back to time and it's a bit Schindler's list and Music Box before them. Usually now when a single mother is left with her kid i get anxious for the family but here it wasn't really my feeling the kid is too much in Oedipus complex and Romy is too much into her husband. Nothing really happens between them. Piccoli is as serious and rock as usual and it's a bit strange that he begins as the youngest character and ends like the oldest as the makeup are not really good. In my opinion all the emotion of the movie comes from Gerard Klein who plays the typical easygoing French at first he can't believe the Nazi system and finally comes to discover it. The final twist is accurate as vengeance can be a neverending drama and it offers the opportunity to Jean Reno to claim he has played with Romy!".

This is an idea that is vehemently denied by Neo Nazis in my own country South Africa even now.The actors are simply superb and the story is very well written and one becomes totally absorbed as one follows the machinations and plot twists in the film when one sees what happens in a country where human rights and their violation are at the whim of thugs.The theme music is haunting and memorable as is Romy Schneider's performance in twin roles. The great love that the lovers demonstrate is but a dream for many people  that makes the separation and the loss all the more acute one feels for the protagonists as they try to overcome the enormous challenges with which they are faced by a brutal racist Nazi state which demands total subservience and which destroys minorities and the untermenschen quite pitilessly.The film is rich in ironies. One is faced with many questions as one sees a wealthy person risk his life the organisation he has founded challenges the violation of human beings in the Apartheid state in northern Ireland in South America and across the planet.A recurring theme is that of lovers looking frantically for each other... and missing each other the anguish and the emptiness that fills one as one searches for the one human being with whom one feels whole.The fate of the two loving couples in this tale fills one with emotion. If this was based on true experiences even partially one just keeps saying NO! NO! NO!The love that human beings can come to feel for other human beings is a divine emotion. It is a love that ensures the immortality of Homo Sapiens. When authoritarian states interfere with and undermine that emotion then they undermine themselves. This should not happen to any human beings people who love who care who are kind should not have endured this  innocent people who just want to love and follow their careers and nurture them families should not be tormented like this.The film shows Germans who write and publish against the Nazis in a similar manner to how whites Africans Indians and coloureds did the same in Apartheid South Africa. Germans caring for brutalised Jews is a recurring theme in post war German films. In my opinion not enough films can be made about that theme.The state might be evil. People do not have to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Erich von Stroheim's stern Prussian persona would seem to make him an unlikely love interest to anyone not into SM but anything goes in Gambling Hell an Axisera war movie that couldn't have been made in Hollywood at the time thanks to the restrictive Production Code. The squat 'n stocky chromedomed Vonster plays Werner von Krall a sardonic selfserving soldieroffortune in wartorn Canton who saves Mireille Mireille Balin a downonherluck cabaret entertainer from a firing squad while brokering an arms deal with a Chinese general. Taking a French reporter they fish from the sea along for the ride the chivalrous but flatbroke Krall and his loose lady yacht to Macao to try and somehow get the weaponry from gunrunning gambling czar Ying Tchai poker faced Sessue Hayakawa whose teenaged Eurasian daughter home from boarding school doesn't know what daddy does for a living. There's trickery treachery and dangerous romantic entanglements ahead for the motley crew some of whom are morally ambiguous but not half bad before the shady shenanigans end in a couple of conflagrations one involves Japanese bomber planes that wipe out most of the cast.Director Jean Delannoy reviled by proponents of the New Wave as the ultimate antiauteur isn't at sea in Josef von Sternberg territory and creates through striking cinematography and some creative sets a jaded desperate atmosphere in a nicely realized Orient landscaped with bombedout ruins and exotic gambling dens. The film has a curious history it was made in 1939 but wasn't released until 1942 with von Stroheim's who had become persona non grata in Vichy France scenes cut out and another actor Pierre Renoir inserted. After the war the film was edited once again and rereleased with Erich back in the picture. In real life the langourous leading lady sexy Mireille Balin here resembling Joan Crawford made up to look like Marlene Dietrich fell in love with a German Wehrmacht officer and they tried to flee during the Liberation but were captured by the resistance enroute to Italy. Balin was beaten raped and thrown in prison and her lover killed. Once freed Mireille was punished for her crimes by not being able to work for a year and her career in shambles soon drifted into alcoholism. She later suffered from a disfiguring facial disease and eventually had an operation in a comeback attempt but neither were successful and the destitute actress died in obscurity in 1968.".

The two bear more than a passing resemblance Orientalist concoctions where central ruthless characters are tasked by affection for their only children and a gambling hall predominates. At the highs in this movie Delannoy outdoes von Sternberg at his own game particularly with the ludicrous arrival of Mireille played by Mireille Balin so erotic and worldsure. However there's something of the Rubens where the master paints the face and hands leaving the rest down to his studio. Delannoy's heart definitely wasn't in the action scenes and he's palpably unable to create suspense or a lurid atmosphere. Roland Toutain journalist Pierre Milley looks positively bored at one point when he hides behind a door bottle raised to strike. For all that the film is glorious.There's a sort of devilmaycare attitude from the main characters where they treat death as if he were a very impudent child. The chaste central love story between Erich von Stroheim's adventurer and Mireille decades his junior adventurer in her own way manages to pull my heart strings. There's a sensitivity in Erich von Stroheim's face that prickles my skin Mireille is no less convincing. It was mentioned to me once that great actors are the ones who carry on acting even when it's not their line reacting to the dialogue of the others. Mireille Balin manages a rare look she listens as if she cares what she's hearing. In a jaded world where it appears people succumb only to charm rather than sensitivity and enthusiasm I found it quite affecting. There's a visible pang when she's watches him lose at baccarat. It's a bad era to be a man I think and it's nice to see someone care about a man's misfortune.There's a little flurry of contrasts in one segment of the film where Delannoy ticks some production box about creating the degenerate atmosphere two examples are Ying Tcha staring lovingly at a portrait of his daughter whilst ordering the sinking of fishing vessels that haven't paid their protection money and Almaido Henri Guisol telling those fresh off the boat that Macao is a city of joy whilst kicking a vagrant out of his way. To me this came off as more a general existential commentary rather than an evocation of a fleshpot. There's so much sunlight in the film and the casino is positively airy nothing like the termite mound of The Shanghai Gesture.There's quite a few moments in Macao that will haunt me forever the introduction of Mireille and when she's taking off quite the most magnificent dress I've ever seen to a similarly magnificent Georges Auric score. Just those two on there own and von Stroheim's sublime acting make it eternal Sessue Hayakawa plays a blinder as well but is upstaged his line I'm less lucky than you I've always been my only friend. heartbreaking. I couldn't care less that Delannoy basically gave a twofingered salute to the script idea and makes something a good deal more sensitive. It's why I've renamed the film in my review title Macao  graveyard of hearts.As a footnote Delannoy was high up on the hitlist of the New Wave critics and his wartime film l'Eternel Retour filmed under the Occupation was described with much innuendo as a pleasure for the Nazis. Because of this he remains a director unfairly overlooked.".

She has never met her mother and always hated her as a heartless woman for giving her away as a small child. Yet Elisabeth herself seems to be a cold and unhappy woman obviously suffering from her inability to relate to others. As Elisabeth arrives in her late mother's house she not only finds her eccentric drunk brother Thomas there but also  a little four year old girl that appears and disappears like a ghost. Elisabeth has to learn that the little girl is  or was  no one but herself thirty years ago. She begins to doubt her own perception and slowly comes to the conclusion that she must be insane just like her late mother was according to the locals. Even the slowly arising love affair with the shady head of the local hospital cannot keep her from falling deeper and deeper into a psychological checkmate. She ...";

Set in Belgrade in Oct 1918 during the final days of the First World War Officer Menis Simon Ward does his duty in defending the battle flag of the defeated AustroHungarian empire while his fellow troops a motley gang recruited from several different countries not loyal to the royal family simply try to survive by any means possible. The battles are elaborate but far too lengthy while the romance between Menis and Louise Lang Veronica Forque daughter of a wealthy Viennese industrialist only cripple the pace even further. Considering he was working with three different languages Ward performs admirably alongside Jon Finch's Major Charbinsky and Peter Cushing's cameo as the mysterious Baron von Hackenburg a 'strange character' and reserve major with some influence in Vienna. Entering at the 39 minute mark the bearded Cushing's scenes were shot in Spain his smoking Baron surrounded by his dogs carefully observing the battles without ever taking part like Barack Obama 'leading from behind'. His big scene finds him speaking to the standard bearer revealing him to be a lowly gypsy posing as an aristocrat a solid five minutes. This was the last time he could be seen astride a horse...just as we first viewed him on screen in 1939's The Man in the Iron Mask. Peter Cushing was reunited with Simon Ward his assistant in Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed and Jon Finch who had paid his dues in Hammers like The Vampire Lovers and The Horror of Frankenstein before stardom in Roman Polanski's Macbeth and Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy.

Taking time off from the job Brad begins to fall for the captain of the ship they contracted and dreams of a quieter life while Tony is approached by the supposedly dead captain of the sunken ship with the real coordinates and an offer of a cut of the gold if he salvages it without telling the ship's owners.The exotic location the beat of voodoo drums beautiful women comradeship sinister villains what else could this be but a Bmovie!  Even the gaudy colours from the very start reveal this to be what it is.  The plot is pure B but is still reasonably enjoyable.  It is strongest at the start where Brad and Tony are together whereas for the middle section they follow separate stories and the film sags a little bit.  The ending is OK but seems to lack real excitement or tension.  The central relationship between the two men is interesting when it is tested and I wish that the film had explored this more  as it is it appears to break and be mended in a matter of minutes without much detail.The direction is on a par with the quality of the film.  The underwater scenes are quite flat and are clearly as near to being in a real sea as I am right now.  The limitations of whatever soundstage or tank they filmed them in means that the scenes all occur in small areas which again takes the edge off a little too much.  The setting of the film calls for an exotic feel but the majority of the cast are American white actors.  Even in a scene where voodoo dancers dance round a fire it is clear that the skin of those involved is very pale this is maybe to be expected from the period and in shows in the fact that the nonwhite support cast are credited with names like halfcaste woman'.  It makes no difference to the quality but does make it feel a little fake.The main drawing point for the film is the strength of the two leads although this is diminished by their separation in the middle section. Quinn is larger than life and a fiery character he hogs the attention and the only weakness is that he fails to bring out the complexity that he suggests in his character when it is needed the final third.  Ryan is a talented actor and underplays next to Quinn.  His presence alone kept me watching although it is undeniable that this is below the quality of his most memorable work.  The support cast are OK and fit the B movie billing much better.  So in place of characters we get feisty girl' bloated villain' pathetic crooked businessman' etc.  They all do OK and never forget their station.Overall this is a watchable B movie that has all the little touches that make it such.  The plot could have been used a lot more effectively in regards the friendship of the two divers but it is watchable nonetheless  mainly due to good performances by both Quinn and Ryan.".

	schema:reviewBody "City Beneath the Sea came on BBC2 one Saturday afternoon some years ago and I was pleased I taped it. This has never been released on video so I was glad I kept this TV copy.Two divers come to Jamaca to recover some gold on a sunken ship off the coast. One evening they visit a club and meet two girls and both subsequently fall in love with them. Rivalry then breaks out between the two men over who will keep the gold when retrieved. The ship sunk near the ruins of an underwater city not Atlantis and the locals are against the men recovering the gold because the city is one of their tabu's. Not surprisingly danger looms when the city collapses as a result of an undersea earthquake trapping one of the divers. He is rescued by his mate and neither of them get the gold in the end.Despite being a bow budget movie the underwater scenes in City Beneath the Sea are not that bad.The cast includes Robert Ryan and Anthony Quinn as the divers and Mala Powers and Susan Ball as the love interests. This also stars George Mathews and Woody Strode.Watching this movie is a good way to spend just under 90 minutes one afternoon or evening. Very enjoyable.Rating 3 stars out of 5.".

A delightful romantic comedy from writerdirector Micha Lewinsky and cowritten by Jan Preuss and Anna Luif this is a fun little film and well worth seeing. It likely will get distribution in American art house theaters. Rahal Hubli Marie Leunberger works as a civil registrar in the village courthouse and her primary function there is to conduct justice of the peacetype wedding ceremonies as it is one of the courthouse's biggest means of revenue. She has a mundane life and a mundane marriage to Thomas Beat Marti and is the mother of a son Luca Majek. One day her former boyfriend Ben Hofer Dominique Jann who also used to be her songwriting partner when they were a local duo shows up with his glamorous girlfriend Tinka Panzer Oriana Schrage and announce they want to get married in a civil ceremony away from the limelight of the big city. Tinka is a famous actress and Ben is a fading rock star and the two of them are the glamor tabloid couple flavor of the week. Ben might revive his career with a marriage to Tinka but he still has feelings for Rahal that have reawakened. A great cast especially Leunberger and a great supporting role from her coworker Jennifer Schmid. This is light fare and predictable but it works. And even though there may not be as much chemistry between Leunberger and Jann they do make a believable couple. Great use of supporting characters and a fast paced charming and witty story. Not too cerebral or too ridiculous and though not too full of belly laughs this is what a romantic comedy should be. Romantic and funny. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 and highly recommend it.".

She meets an older guy on a plane shags him rotten and THEN gives him a tour of the city. Like Dietrich and Steeger's earlier collaboration I a Groupie this is kind of a sexy travelogue with the exteriors at least filmed in world cities like Munich Copenhagen and New York City which I at least appreciate more than most modernday sex films that seem to take place entirely in some producer's condo in the San Fernando Valley. There's an especially good sequence of a pornographyfueled orgy in swinging Denmark. Unlike Ia Groupie or some of the other report films however this doesn't have wild shifts of tone where some stories are lighthearted and silly and others downright disturbing. This movie is just consistently silly.As DietrichSteeger films go I'd rank this ahead of The Young Seducers but definitely behind I a Groupie.

About this one here you already read the subject in the title. But it is not really true. Yes we see stewardesses in all kinds of erotic adventures from start to finish but I felt that the longer the film went the less it focused on stewardesses really and just became boring uninspired Euro trash porn. It is also more of a collection of short films than one film with one plot as each sequence focuses on one or two stewardesses getting laid for example by their pilots or by possibly everybody else you can imagine. This film here is a perfect example of a European trash softcore porn film from the 1970s and there are really many of these with Dietrich being one of the most important filmmakers of the genre. Storywise however these films have almost nothing to offer and this one here is not the exception to the rule at all. The acting is also pretty bad for the most part. Watch something else instead.".

Then he built a bedroom in his studio where his actors could have sex. Tedious nonexplicit sex of course this is 1971.The result is a boring movie not unlike numerous others made in the 70's. There are a few lame jokes but actually this movie is not funny. There is sex but with the exception of Ingrid Steeger the actors are not very attractive. There are pictures of cities in Europe but you probably saw them before or were there yourself.I rate this dud 2 out of 10 because of Steeger. If you are not a fan of hers you may feel 1 out of 10 is sufficient and actually it is for most viewers!".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Stewardessen 1971  out of 4Entertaining if rather unintelligent report film that shows what stewardesses do whenever their flights land and they're stuck in a city overnight. For this film various stewardesses fly from New York to a variety of European locations where they enjoy various sexual encounters.This Erwin C. Dietrich film is known under a variety of titles including STEWARDESSES REPORT but no matter what you call it if you're willing to watch it then it's not going to be for the story. No if you're willing to watch one of these Dietrich titles then you're expecting a lot of beautiful women in a variety of sex scenes and of course you want them totally naked which is exactly what you get here.You can say what you want about Dietrich but there's no question that he knew what his target audiance wanted and more times than not he delivered just that an even more. He might not have been a great filmmaker but as an exploitation pioneer he deserves every bit of credit that he has gotten over the past few decades. DIE STEWARDESSEN features the likes of Ingrid Steeger Ursula Marty Margrit Siegel and Evelyne Traeger all of the ladies act out the various fantasy scenes that are shown here.Obviously the ladies weren't asked to give heartfelt performances but rather just be fun easy and of course nude. That's all this film tried to accomplish and I found it to be quit entertaining because of the sleaze factor but also because the ladies were so charming goodspirited and just downright fun. This type of picture is certainly a male fantasy picture and there's enough entertainment here to make it worth watching.".
