Pollock needs her help but when she repeatedly seems to double cross him in one escapade after another he can't decide on whose side she is working.

As the hieroglyphics expert embroiled in Middle Eastern intrigue while decoding the cipher everyone's after the usual slightly wooden note in Gregory Peck's delivery is oddly effective as he tries to loosen up and deliver Cary Grantlike witticisms from coscripter Pierre Marton a.k.a.

Alan Badel looking like a polished Peter Sellers in cool shades virtually steals his scenes as the suaveborderingonunctuous villain with a foot fetish.

Suspenseful and sparkling as this twistfilled adventure is ARABESQUE's biggest mystery is why it's still only available in VHS format. If this gem ever gets deluxe treatment as a DVD including letterboxing please! I sure hope they get Donen and Loren together to do the kind of entertaining informative commentary that Donen did with the late great Stone for Criterion's CHARADE DVD.

Ingenuous Gregory Peck and enigmatic Sophia Loren involved in sinister goingson around .

Exciting and clever pursuit film about a naive professor and his unsettling involvement with all kind of baddies along with a beautiful as well a suspicious woman . From the opening credits by Maurice Binder to the ending entertainment and amusement are well provided . It is thrilling and intelligent at times  but results to be pretty amusing  being very subHitchcock and in James Bond style . Interesting screenplay by Peter Stone  alias Pierre Marton  being much flashier than Donen's earlier Charade also written by Stone . Although the part of David Pollock was originally scripted for Cary Grant . Stanley Donen is prepared to resort to all the tricks in the cinematic trade to make this a fascinating thriller and he carries out a conscious effort to capture the peculiar look of the sixties . It packs fun scenes with Gregory Peck in the shower  along with moving action sequences . Peck is perfect as a botcher professor who is drawn into espionage . However  Gregory found the stunts particularly difficult because of an old leg injury due to horseback riding . This was last picture Peck made for three years while he concentrated on his humanitarian efforts that included the American Cancer Society . Gorgeous Sophia Loren is amusingly enigmatic and provides the glamorous mystery element in the plot  she manages to change her Christian Dor's dresses at various scenes . Support cast is frankly good  such as Alan Badel  George Coulouris  Carl Duering  Duncan Lamont and last feature of John Merivale . Colorful and glimmering cinematography in Panavision by Christopher Challis . Enjoyable score by Henry Mancini  including catching musical leitmotif .This espionage adventure picture was stunningly directed by Stanley Donen who made in similar style Charade with Gary Grant and Audrey Hepburn who was never more beautiful . Donen directed some of the best musicals of history such as On the town Singing in the rain Royal Wedding  It's always fair weather Seven brides for seven brothers  Funny face  among others . The posterior Donen films were heavyhanded  exception of Two for the road again with Hepburn  and too few to show if the magic had really gone . Arabesque rating  6510 . Agreeable film  enough to entertain young and eldest people . It is essentially a hollow and calculated attempt to cash on the Continental spy trend the Eurospy Subgenre of the time .".

	schema:reviewBody "As has been duly noted before Arabesque is essentially an update of Stanley Donen's own Charade. This time however the plot twists are more convoluted the camerwork is decidedly more mod shooting through chandeliers reflections in sunglass lenses etc. and there is an even greater emphasis on the female star's wardrobe. If the story is more confusing and less compelling than Charade it certainly isn't at the expense of entertainment. Its derivative nature it not only incorporates parts of Charade but also the drunk and cropdusting scenes from North by Northwest prevents Arabesque from entering the elevated realm of its predecessor but it's a delight nevertheless. Its strongest selling point really is the utterly delectable Sophia Loren as Yasmin the sideswitching enigma. It is a strong statement to declare that the glorious Miss Loren has never appeared more beautiful before or since than in this filmbut I'm willing to take the risk. Her huge almond almost Egyptian eyes tawny caramelcolored skin lustrous hair and worldfamous curves have never been seen to better advantage. Her stunning Christian Dior costumes certainly add to her already formidable allure. She also displays a very nice light comedic touch it wouldn't be difficult to dislike someone so supernaturally gorgeous but instead Loren's natural warmth and humor shine through. Gregory Peck on the other hand looks more than a little ragged around the edges Cary Grant obviously didn't lend Peck any of his agedefying secrets. His performance isn't nearly as bad or hammy as some other reviews have indicated but where Loren's charisma and beauty aid her in creating a completely different character than Audrey Hepburn's in Charade Peck comes off as an unfortunately blurred carbon coby of Grant in that earlier film. Having said that Arabesque still stands on its own merits as a cracking good comedythriller the final few scenes are terrifically suspenseful. Alan Badel makes a wonderfully oily villain love the shades! and Kieron Moore adds a healthy shot of dated humor as a jivetalking Arabian !. Although the twists and turns might be confusing for some just sit back and bask in the glory that is Sophia Loren. You know the good guys will win in the end anyway.".

Here it is an equally glamorous couple being chased around London with the Zoo and Ascot races playing the backdrop to the film's key action sequences. Like the Grant character in Charade it is impossible to work out just which side Loren is on until the film's final stages. The plot in which Egyptology Professor Peck tries to unscramble a hieroglyphic for madman Alan Badel and Israeli agent Kieron Moore is as dispensable as Charade's was. This is not quite up to the standard of the earlier film but never mind the action is breathtaking the finale genuinely surprising and the Mancini score is riveting.".

	schema:headline " Serpentine comedythriller smoothly executed throughout.";
	schema:reviewBody "After the success of his Hitchcock homage Charade director Stanley Donen made this very similar comedythriller with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren in the lead roles. While Peck and Loren are not quite as suited to this kind of thing as Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn they still make an attractive couple. If you thought Charade was complex you'll find Arabesque resembles a hundred shoelaces tangled into an impenetrable knot. The plot is not really meant to be followed  it merely exists as an excuse to stage one dazzling set piece after another.American scholar David Pollock Gregory Peck works at Oxford University and is noted as one of the world's foremost experts in ancient hieroglyphics. He is asked  firstly by oil tycoon Beshraavi Alan Badel and later by a Middle Eastern prime minister Carl Duering  to decipher a hieroglyphic code that contains details of a sinister espionage plot. Not really a man of action Pollock suddenly finds himself thrust into the world of international intrigue where sudden death and doublecrosses are never far away. Various factions want to know the secret of the hieroglyphic code and Pollock finds himself on the run from enemies on all sides. The only person who seems willing to help him is Beshraavi's mistress Yasmin Azir Sophia Loren but she lies to and crosses him so frequently during their flight that he begins to question whose side she is really on....Arabesque is beautifully shot by Christopher Challis and memorably scored by Henry Mancini. The kaleidoscopic plot throws in everything from James Bondstyle humour and villainy to Hitchcockinspired chase sequences. Utterly derivative and muddled it may be but noone seems to mind. Indeed the fun in Arabesque stems from the elegant outfits the silky smooth villains the chases and romances the lavish locales and the touches of humour. Donen marshals proceedings with skillful authority moving things along at a dizzying pace which helps disguise many of the plot holes. The performances of the handsome leads are adequate throughout but the villainous support players really steal the movie  Badel especially in a role that oozes sinister menace. Arabesque is inconsequential professionallyassembled and effortlessly entertaining stuff. Watch....enjoy....forget.".

It's definitely entertaining and more than one scene may stick with you for some years  although I find it difficult to say just why. My suspicion is that the glittery surface of the film which is very light is used to make palatable realities that are very dark  like the drowning of the killer in the aquarium.

Then he seeks out the American Professor David Pollock Gregory Peck who is an expert in hieroglyphics at the Oxford University and tells that his name is Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane John Merivale. He invites Pollock to travel to London to meet the wealthy Nejim Beshraavi Alan Badel to translate a cipher in a hieroglyphic but Pollock refuses the work.Soon Pollock is summoned by the Arabian Prime Minister Hassan Jena Carl Duering who is unofficially in England and asks him to accept the assignment and spy the activities of Beshraavi that might be plotting something evil. Beshraavi offers 30000 dollars to Pollock to work in his mansion deciphering the hieroglyphic.

OK so it's not quite as good or as witty as CHARADE which I gave a 910 but it's a very solid followup. Some of the camera anglestricks in this one courtesy of cinematographer Christopher Challis  who also shot A SHOT IN THE DARK are simply amazing!!! They give the film a certain psychedelic feelquality to it which is very reflective of the times  midtolate 60s. Plus the score is by the great Henry Mancini. And Maurice Binder who did the titles for the Bond films does the title sequence here. Both Mancini and Binder also worked on CHARADE. And I gotta say that you'll never see a hotter Sophia Loren than in this flick. It's impossible for a woman to look any hotter than Sophia in this one!! That alone is reason enough for checking this movie out! It was also fairly interesting to see the typically nononsense Gregory Peck in a comedy role but I thought he handled himself quite well here. He obviously wasn't as good as Cary Grant was in CHARADE Grant is a natural with this material but he was better than I would have imagined him to be. Plus I really enjoyed Alan Badel as the villain  he has a falcon for a petweapon. He really looked like Peter Sellers for some reason. Oh and it has a creepy opening at the eye doctor's office. I won't spoil it for anyone. Let's just say that I will definitely think of this film the next time I go to see the eye doctor. It's as unsettling as the dentist scene in MARATHON MAN.".

	schema:headline " Peck and Loren vs Grant and Hepburn";
	schema:reviewBody "...Audrey H I mean.I highly respect Stanley Donen. This film and Charade prior to this shows that Donen was simply not just a Dancer turned Director who directed only Musicals. Donen has genuine talent and just about every film he made has something about it that is done well. In his early films it was the Dancing sequences and Musical Numbers. Bless yo Byootiful hide... Well Donen is a man that just kept going and I am glad he did. This film was supposed to be a kind of sequel to Charade... and we can only imagine Grant and Hepburn doing it. But instead we have Bless yo Beautiful Hide Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck.Now to me Peck reminds me a lot of Gary Cooper in this film. Almost Looks like Cooper in a way. In other films Peck is the very competent man. In this film he is just a little clumsy just a little mistaken just a little shot at Shoved into fishtanks drugged mowed by a combine and the various other ways the crooks try to get him in this. Just a little like Mr Deeds in some way. Maybe it is just because Peck and Coop were very tall men of the stringbean type. I respected both of them in my mind there is always an association between Peck and Cooper.The story is a good spy story. It is almost the same formula as Charade with some of the roles changed around a bit. Peck is one of my favourite actors  In this film is he a Professor of Ancient MiddleEastern and Egyptian Languages who is tricked beguiled and otherwise charmed into playing a spy and as such this sets the table for all kinds of misadventures. And this film has many misadventures which are extremely amusing and humorous.I was just diffidently reminded by Ben Mankiewicz of TCM Not personally but on tcm just now that Peter Stone who did the adaptation of the book The Cipher to the script that was filmed as Arabesque wrote the script as if Cary Grant was to play the part. So if Peck seems a little wooden at times it is because of that fact. Grant wore humor like a glove and wallowed in it Peck is much more serious.At times we forget that this film is a spy thriller due to the comedy elements. We have 1 A careless assassin who starts off in the film as a threatening character which degrades to a bandaged bumbling fool Sloane 2 A Hip Arab rebel who tries to talk ModTalk while torturing Peck. Kasim Daddyo 3 An Arabic PeterSellers clone with a pet meatfaceeating Peregrine Falcon who you think is about to trip fall down start speaking in another dialect or do any number of Sellerstype gags Beshraavi and 4 A Beautiful Italian? Arabic Woman who changes sides in this series of incidents as often as she changes her outfits Which are incredibly sensual Guess who I am talking about.This film is well directed as are all of Donen's films. At first I thought that this film did not work as well as Charade but then I realized it is not charade it is a whole other film. Maybe it was not what the public expected out of Donen after Charade but it does not matter The film works on several levels. I like it lots. I like Charade lots. I like Donen lots. Donen was the man that made Hollywood Musicals more enjoyable simply by trying new things and not going over the same old slung hash.It is pretty amazing that the guy who brought us Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling also brought us this film and many other welldirected films... In all genres from Musicals to Science Fiction. This film may not be the best Donen film but it is certainly worth watching.".

Well Donen is a man that just kept going and I am glad he did. This film was supposed to be a kind of sequel to Charade... and we can only imagine Grant and Hepburn doing it. But instead we have Bless yo Beautiful Hide Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck.Now to me Peck reminds me a lot of Gary Cooper in this film. Almost Looks like Cooper in a way. In other films Peck is the very competent man. In this film he is just a little clumsy just a little mistaken just a little shot at Shoved into fishtanks drugged mowed by a combine and the various other ways the crooks try to get him in this. Just a little like Mr Deeds in some way. Maybe it is just because Peck and Coop were very tall men of the stringbean type. I respected both of them in my mind there is always an association between Peck and Cooper.The story is a good spy story. It is almost the same formula as Charade with some of the roles changed around a bit. Peck is one of my favourite actors  In this film is he a Professor of Ancient MiddleEastern and Egyptian Languages who is tricked beguiled and otherwise charmed into playing a spy and as such this sets the table for all kinds of misadventures. And this film has many misadventures which are extremely amusing and humorous.I was just diffidently reminded by Ben Mankiewicz of TCM Not personally but on tcm just now that Peter Stone who did the adaptation of the book The Cipher to the script that was filmed as Arabesque wrote the script as if Cary Grant was to play the part. So if Peck seems a little wooden at times it is because of that fact. Grant wore humor like a glove and wallowed in it Peck is much more serious.At times we forget that this film is a spy thriller due to the comedy elements. We have 1 A careless assassin who starts off in the film as a threatening character which degrades to a bandaged bumbling fool Sloane 2 A Hip Arab rebel who tries to talk ModTalk while torturing Peck. Kasim Daddyo 3 An Arabic PeterSellers clone with a pet meatfaceeating Peregrine Falcon who you think is about to trip fall down start speaking in another dialect or do any number of Sellerstype gags Beshraavi and 4 A Beautiful Italian? Arabic Woman who changes sides in this series of incidents as often as she changes her outfits Which are incredibly sensual Guess who I am talking about.This film is well directed as are all of Donen's films. At first I thought that this film did not work as well as Charade but then I realized it is not charade it is a whole other film. Maybe it was not what the public expected out of Donen after Charade but it does not matter The film works on several levels. I like it lots. I like Charade lots. I like Donen lots. Donen was the man that made Hollywood Musicals more enjoyable simply by trying new things and not going over the same old slung hash.It is pretty amazing that the guy who brought us Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling also brought us this film and many other welldirected films... In all genres from Musicals to Science Fiction. This film may not be the best Donen film but it is certainly worth watching.";

	schema:headline " Satire With a Comlpex Spy Plot Engaging Characters Donen's Artistry";
	schema:reviewBody "Those who enjoy this film have not recognized it for what it isa satire in the form of an espionage adventure in cinema noir. It is therefore much like a lightertoned North By Northwest than it is like a Vertigo. Taking his cue apparently from Alfred Hitchcock Director Stanley Donen here freed his camera to use reflections and deeper shots than usual and developed opportunities such as the aquarium destruction and the intraffic danger to do very unusual and artistic things all in the line of story development. The film has only three major charactera professor of Wgyptology played tongueincheek and beautifully by Gregory Peck a gorgeous and mysterious female who may or may not be bad played with style by Sophia Loren and an understated Britishaccented Arabic villain brought to life by Alan Badel. Nice person and boring professor David Pollock Peck is an American teaching a course in hieroglyphics at Oxford. Nejim Beshraavi Badel hires him to decipher a puzzling inscription for 30000. The film opens with the murder in an optometrist's office of the inscription's owner a professor Pollock is encouraged to take the job by one Hassan Jena Prime minister of an Arab country Jena is in England to sign a treaty and recruits Pollock as a spy. Working at Beshravi's mansion on the inscription Pollock meets the man's mistress Yasmin Azir Loren. whatever her loyalties or his interestespecially when he hides with her in her shower at one pointshe helps him escape when he learns he is to be executed once he deciphers the test. She leads himright to her other boyfriend Yussef Kassim Kieron Moore also after the inscription. He takes flight but keeps ending up with Yasmin who is either saving him or making excuses why she could not do what she was supposed to. He makes up a fake explanation of the inscription at one point but genuinely has to solve it in order to prevent the assassination of Prime Minister Jena trusting Yasmin to help him in this climactic attempt to extricate himself successfully from the entire labyrinthine plot. Do they succeed? Why is there a James Bond style menace? And whose side is Yasmin really serving? As the two flit about England trying to save the Prime Minister get the treaty and sort out their own relation the storytelling by Donen is masterful throughout. You will have to see this delightful film to find out who was in league with whom and for what purpose. The complex script for the film was written by Goron Cotler in his novel the Cypher with screenplay credit given to Julian Mitchell Stanley Price and Peter Stone writing as Pierre Marton. Donen produced with gorgeous cinematography by Christopher Challis very good art direction by Reece Pemberton and serviceable music by Henry Mancini who also did Charade for Donen. Gregory Peck is far better as a professor here in my judgment than Cary Grant was an advertising executive in North By Northwest for instance Sophia Loren has one of her most charismatic and successful roles in the film given how little there actually was for her to work with. Badel and Moore are powerful and professional as always Carl Duering as P.M. Jena John Merivale George Colouris as the unfortunate Professor Ragheeb Sloane Duncan Ernest Clark and others have smaller roles in this exciting and artistic spy romp. Because of the unusual and fun spirit of the film a credit to Stanley Donen it is a great favorite with many viewers myself included.".

The only small criticism I would offer is that it could have probably lost 10 minutes or so to make it a little punchier and some of the action scenes now require some suspension of close examination  why does one man select a mechanical wrecking ball as a murder weapon rather than the slightly more practical knife or gun and an Ascot race crowd push British reserve to the limit by largely ignoring a stabbing in the middle of them but overall this is a very entertaining film which I am sure you will enjoy if you liked North by Northwest or Charade.".

	schema:reviewBody " MAY BE SPOILERS Finally a movie that represents professional wrestling as exciting powerful and important. RIKIDOZAN is a fantastic work that illuminates the desire of a man who wants to be something more and how that same passion caused his selfdestruction. One important aspect of this film is the portrayal of Rikidozan as a hero instead of the usual representation of wrestlers as animals and baffoons. It not only showed his professional success but allowed us to follow in the demise of his private life. I'm sure there are many wrestlers from yesterday and today who can identify with his rapid climb and fall as well as the struggle to hold on to what you had.Professional wrestling in the United States is considered the male soap opera and as of right now is regarded as little more than a joke. Are the matches predetermined? Yes. Is it fake? No. Because in that ring you have wrestlers who have spent years perfecting their craft to try and make you believe. They get injured more frequently and more severely than many athletes in other professional sports. They train and pull off stunts that other professional athletes can't even begin to dream about. But do wrestlers get the proper recognition for their efforts? No. Why? Well they're not real athletes are they?Rikidozan was a real athlete and has been immortalized in this film. When Japan was crippled from World War II Rikidozan became the nations inspiration. After being rejected from sumo wrestling because he was Korean he went to America where he became an in ring sensation. Upon his return he made the biggest impact of his life on the people of Japan as they considered him to have conquered America their wartime enemy. He was a national hero. He brought professional wrestling to Japan where it has flourished ever since. In Japan wrestling is not a fad that comes every now and again it's a rite of passage.The downfall opposite Rikidozan's rise somewhat reflects today's current state of the business. He simply did not want to lose his status. The movie sees Rikidozan even change the finish of a match on the fly so he would not have to lose which was then topped by his already violent temper growing even worse due to his paranoia of the Yakuza murdering him. Here Rikidozan represents Triple H. Triple H refuses to build up new talent in wee because he is paranoid about losing his top spot and insists that he is still the top draw. Rikidozan followed this same path and ultimately succumbed to using drugs Western Medicine like so many of the greats have like Jake The Snake Roberts and Mr. Perfect. This movie portrays wrestling as what it really is A gritty business full of politics and corruption and pain with the only light being performing for the fans. Technically speaking the movie is no wunderkind. The translation of the dialog is weak. The performances tend to be a little over the top at times. The direction is not strong and at times during the montages can be a bit overbearing. But none of that is as important as the story. It follows the path of one of the all time great wrestlers a true legend who despite his personal problems brought a nation out of their seats at the mere mention of his name.".

Kyunggu Sol in the lead perfectly captures the character. His Japanese is flawless and he exhibits the hybridity of Rikidozan in his every gesture.

The film becomes more interesting every time she appears but unfortunately her role is underwritten and the part does now do her acting skills justice.The first 60 minutes expertly chronicle Riki's rise the odds he faces and the significance of all this to postwar Japan. In the last 30 minutes the film sags and a sentimental tone creeps in. This culminates in a last scene that literally looks like it was shot in a giant snowglobe with toecurling melodramatic music to match. A tighter edit and more cinematic approach could have made this tale truly memorable. However while the story of Rikidozan grips you the patchy pacing and average technical skills on display are slightly disappointing.At a time when banal nationalism is rampant in Japan Rikidozan's story is a sobering reminder of the complex realities that confound Japanese identity.

But the thing that hits you right in the forehead is the reality. It made me project myself into the poor soul of a simple man whose life is not much more than a non stop struggle for survival and then such a simple tiny joy like a summer shower makes you happy and brings a smile to your face. Even in the toughest times life is about little things and it does make you appreciate all that you have.The mark is 10 and even that's way too low for what this brilliant title made me feel.

In fact many Koreans living in Japan returned to North Korea to join the building of paradise on earth. But since then the country kept going downward. Nowadays they are isolated at the dead end. The reason why such country still survives is that by giving people at the power side extreme privilege so that they want to keep the regime made of fictions.In such a country there is a family of the father once a hero of soccer team and his loving wife and their son who likes soccer too. The atmosphere of the family which is poor but tied with love emphasizes how loveless the country is.In fact looking at the officials of the camp or boarder security I could not help wondering if it is possible for the same human being become arrogant and cruel like this. I feel some sense of impotence because I can do nothing to the situation close to my country.This movie focuses on the fate of a family. This is beyond a propaganda movie to accuse North Korea nor to glamorize the rescue group. This portrays the dignity of human being.".

The production is excellent and the storyline is very believable  well it is based on real events! In fact you'll find many of the topics covered in documentaries made on N. Korea over the last 10 years  particularly those that include secretly shot footage smuggled out of the country. While there are elements of sentimentalism it isn't overdone as it is in many Korean movies.However there were a couple of minor annoyances1. The bible cropped up early enough in the film and I thought Oh no the director is going to spin some proChristian message later on but while this thread is returned to later in the movie it is pretty much left hanging.2. The makers of this film couldn't resist making the main character a a former footballer soccer player of some repute. This was totally unnecessary and distracted somewhat from the credibility of the content. This needed to be a movie with ordinary characters in what is simply an extraordinary but common predicament.Nevertheless despite these small annoyances the film gets across its main tenet and should leave no viewer unmoved.".

The more I thought about it though I suspect that the choice was made for two reasons 1 to make the protagonist appeal to the rest of world especially South Koreans by creating this common interest footballsoccer. I think the world has a hard time relating to North Koreans. Americans and some South Koreans have this phobia of communist countries. Furthermore North Koreans have been in a hermit state for a very long time. Very little is known or seen of the North Korean citizens themselves. The football thing was a simple way of making people realize that North Koreans are human beings and in some ways they're just like us. 2 to show that the protagonist was not against the North Korean government. Well at least not outwardly. I think this film did a good job of staying away from direct commentary on the N.K. government. Yes the film paints the government in a bad light at times. That really can't be helped as many of the scenes are based on true accounts. However not once does the protagonist start ranting about how his government failed him. While there is heavy censorship in North Korea to speak against the government the film could have had the protagonist 'think' these thoughts or discuss them safely with his family but it didn't. The main problem that the protagonist faces and that many North Koreans face is not that he resents his government although we like to think North Koreans do. His problem is that his family is starved sick and unable to find help in a country that lacks resources. For those two points I have to applaud the film. I think it made a sincere effort to do what's best for the cause North Korean Human Rights and not just focus on what's best for the art.If anyone is interested in learning about how they can help you can search the web for The Chosun Journal U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea Liberty in North Korea or Amnesty International's page on North Korea. Like any cause donations are very important. But unlike most causes I think the biggest challenge for N.K. Human Rights is that most of the world and concerning most South Koreans ignores it. I hope this film succeeds in bringing more awareness to the plight of the suffering.".

South Korea's leading actor InPyo Cha plays the father in what is essentially a fatherson tale played out in exquisite but heartwrenching detail. If you're into stories that express the fullness of human experience this is one worth experiencing. It will haunt you and alter your perception of freedom and everything else you hold dear. I read someone's complaint on here that the father should not have been a soccerfootball star... but that's such a pointless criticism for the sake of criticism. WATCH IT!!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Scandal Makers";
	schema:reviewBody "It's little wonder how Scandal Makers turned out to be a blockbuster hit in South Korea. It doesn't have any offensive jokes that could put anyone off relied on slickly crafted humorous situations that don't try too hard and has characters that will endear and grow on you. It has some feelgood messages to impart without being preachy and one would almost be surprised that this is a first time effort from writerdirector Kang Hyeongcheol.Sure the premise may not be something that's new and coming to mind is The Game Plan where Dwayne The Rock Johnson finds his orderly playboy life being abruptly interrupted by a kid claiming to be his daughter. Over here though this Korean film upped Hollywood's ante by adding to the family tree complexity and also to the magnitude of laughs. Hyeong cheol's story has three generations living under the same roof and it played out very nicely with little scenes that go to waste. I suppose with first time fearlessness Hyeongcheol provided the story with an air of freshness over a tried and tested formula about unexpected gatecrashing family members.Nam Hyeonsoo Cha Taehyun is a radio DJ whose afternoon talk show gives him a new lease of life and popularity especially with a single mother sharing her story on his show about her search for a long lost father. Bur his orderly playboy lifestyle and bachelor pad get unceremoniously imposed upon when Hwang Jeongnam Park Boyeong and her son Hwang Kidong Hwang Seokhyeon come knocking on his door claiming to be his daughter and grandson even! I think for any bachelor in the 30s ahem like myself this would either turn out to be a bad April Fool's Joke of mistaken identity or horrorofhorrors a tryst early in life that had gone totally wrong. What more with such a scandal  a swinging bachelor with a young adult daughter who in turn is a single mom at a young age  it threatens Hyeonsoo's career and lifestyle and so begins the comedy of keeping under wraps the situation as well as to learn how to live and tolerate his new found family who have come from the village where Hyeonsoo's only common ground with Jeongnam besides their talent for music is their propensity to have early offspring.A perfect dysfunctional family that serves up as a perfect scandalous story given the follies of youth. But this film is more about perceptions despite its title. We have a man who perceives himself as a major celebrity who would be ruined as he has observed should the paparazzi expose his childhood shenanigans. We have a daughter who perceives that it would be easy for her neverseenbefore dad to accept her when she appears out of the blue with kid in tow. And the young kid too perceives that his crush it's in this family's genes to start young will only like him if he wears fancy clothes rather than to rely on his musical talent.While Cha Taehyun plays his selfish character who through the course of the film learns something important about family with aplomb Park Boyeong's single mom role seemed to be too entrenched in her livethesingingdream subplot and little is seen in the dynamics with her young son. In fact Hwang Seokhyeon is the ultimate scene stealer here as the roundheaded kid with curly hair and his storyarc opposite Taehyun as grandfather and grandson is perhaps the best of the lot with plenty of laughs guaranteed. This kid just oozes charisma and charm and from the moment he appears the magic got weaved and you'll find him totally endearing himself to you the audience with his smilenonsmile antics and those crazy sleepwalking spells.Scandal Makers is easy going fare that would appeal to a broad spectrum of audiences with its fine comedy and positive messages of love and enduring family ties that remind you of blood running thicker than water. Bring a date take your whole family and discover just why the South Koreans went gaga over this. It could be that kid Hwang Seokhyeon whose performance alone would justify the price of a movie ticket! Highly recommended!".

And it's mix of funny sad and touching moments kept me entertained throughout the whole film and although there is quite a bit of singing in this it was well done as well but wished they took the stuff about the kid in the story being a prodigy at playing cards playing the piano and etc in order to be likable. I also though the part of Cha TaeHyun singing in order to impress the teacher to be lame and not necessary maybe it's cause he just doesn't have the charisma or cause he is just not a likable character.

But what intrigues me in this is the journey that as audience we are put through which gives us a sweet feeling long after the movie is over. It is to be noted that the director's second venture sunny is more mature than this but still speedy scandal is the most fun of the two. It's Cha Tae Hyun's movie and he does justice to it and he brings dimensions to the movie unlike anyone. Though his character in My Sassy girl is my all time favorite speedy scandal will come next to it! To enjoy this movie all you have to do is to shed the inhibition that movies that are predictable will probably suck but the bitter truth is that sometimes being predictable doesn't hurt and this movie sure will put a smile to your face as the end credits roll.".

	schema:headline " Speedy Scandal contains similar lighthearted humor and serious drama that made My Sassy Girl such a hit";
	schema:reviewBody "Cha Taehyun has come a long way since his big debut in My Sassy Girl. 14 films later he starred in a dramedy that potentially rivals the 2001 classic. Speedy Scandal contains similar lighthearted humor and serious drama that made My Sassy Girl such a hit. Just with a different kind of love story. While My Sassy Girl centers around the romantic relationship Speedy Scandal focuses on the love between family. Cha Taehyun's character Nam Hyeonsoo is a radio DJ who finds out he has a long lost daughter and grandson. Being a bachelor and a famous person the sudden intrusion of taking in Hwang Jaein Park Boyoung the nation's little sister and Hwang Kidong Wang Seokhyeon is certainly overwhelming. And so the journey of accepting his unwanted family begins.Pretty much right off the bat the premise of the story starts. The film does a great job of showing Hyeonsoo's uptight personality with the opening credits being a tour of his large apartment filled with neatly organized suits and cologne. His high class lifestyle makes the entrance of unknown dependents so much more shocking and entertaining. And it's not just Cha Taehyun that makes the film interesting to watch. Park Boyoung who has since gained a lot of popularity for her role as the under aged mother makes for a cute daughter who has a lot of spunk. And as for the little boy who is also kind of cute Wang Seokhyeon he's not only responsible for the main portion of the humor but also acts as the catalyst to bring the family together. All the actors make the film very enjoyable and hard to let go.It's obvious that Nam Hyeonsoo will change his characteristics and become a better person in the end so the conflicts that occur are what you're really watching the film for. Just because Cha Taehyun is the main protagonist doesn't mean that the film is all fun and games. The film touches upon some serious topics such as abandonment family values and the need to be loved. Park Boyoung delivers some pretty great crying scenes that make even the viewer feel the guilt of the father.After watching the film I couldn't help but feel the need for a sequel. Like when many good shows or movies end people require a fair amount of closure to feel satisfied. The end of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is a good example. Ending scenes in The Return of the King seem to go on and on. For Speedy Scandal the ending is complete and ties up all loose ends unlike a lot of Korean films but I guess I like the characters so much that I wish for a sequel. That will most likely not happen though since Korean cinema isn't so keen on spinoffs. Maybe the film is missing just one more scene in the end to give it the perfect closure.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cha Taehyun has come a long way since his big debut in My Sassy Girl. 14 films later he starred in a dramedy that potentially rivals the 2001 classic. Speedy Scandal contains similar lighthearted humor and serious drama that made My Sassy Girl such a hit. Just with a different kind of love story. While My Sassy Girl centers around the romantic relationship Speedy Scandal focuses on the love between family. Cha Taehyun's character Nam Hyeonsoo is a radio DJ who finds out he has a long lost daughter and grandson. Being a bachelor and a famous person the sudden intrusion of taking in Hwang Jaein Park Boyoung the nation's little sister and Hwang Kidong Wang Seokhyeon is certainly overwhelming. And so the journey of accepting his unwanted family begins.Pretty much right off the bat the premise of the story starts. The film does a great job of showing Hyeonsoo's uptight personality with the opening credits being a tour of his large apartment filled with neatly organized suits and cologne. His high class lifestyle makes the entrance of unknown dependents so much more shocking and entertaining. And it's not just Cha Taehyun that makes the film interesting to watch. Park Boyoung who has since gained a lot of popularity for her role as the under aged mother makes for a cute daughter who has a lot of spunk.

	schema:reviewBody "Normally when it comes to voting for movies on the IMDb I'm quite liberal. I don't set very high standards for movies. I always tend to rate films based on how much I enjoy them and this means that most of the time I always rate films highly cos I try and find something good in every film I see. I saw this film when I was vacationing in England. BBC One actually transmitted this at 11 PM since they believed that The Peacemaker was a film more deserving of the 900 slot. Unlike the Peacemaker Shooting Fish is a film that almost anybody would enjoy unless heshe was the kind of person who found simple effective storytelling a turnoff.Everything about this movie seems in perfect harmony. The chemistry between Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend is perfect word for word. And Kate Beckinsale is a perfect third piece to the puzzle When the conversations in the movie occur you never get the feeling you're watching a contrived conversation written by someone else you get the feeling you're watching real life unfold. That's a hallmark of a good scriptwriter and the people who wrote this deserve credit for the story.As for the story itself it never lets itself become too complicated and lends itself to a lot of funny situations. Fasttalking Dylan and socially naive Jez Futterman and Townsend are two con men trying to raise money to build their dream house. They end up enlisting Georgina's shorthaired Kate Beckinsale in a beautiful role from her preHollywood Glamourpuss days help on a particular scam. Soon she discovers what they're up to and the story unfolds from there with both Dylan and Jez seemingly falling for Georgie. Here again the movie doesn't nosedive and morph into a conventional love story rather the romance builds in a backdrop to the main story and culminates in a heartwarming finale. As for Dan and Jez some of their schemes may not be very believable and yet you cant help but be amused by the way they go about implementing them. This film is a good reason why small budget comedy romances are popular  simply put they work. On every level. Watching this film gives you the same kind of feeling as watching While you were Sleeping for example. For the sheer sweetness of the film and for Kate Beckinsale's performance I'd give it 7 on 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Take a couple of con men who see an opportunity to separate a mark from his money in just about everything throw in an attractive young woman with an altruistic agenda blend together for about ninetythree minutes and the result is Shooting Fish' an amiable entertaining comedy directed by Stefan Schwartz.  It's the story of two guys who grew up in orphanages on opposite sides of the ocean Dylan Dan Futterman in America Jez Stuart Townsend in England and who by the time they had reached the age of consent had each been endowed with a particular talent Dylan has the gift of gab Jez is a technical wizard.  Dylan's gift has quickly gotten him into hot water with the wrong kind of people however and to stay healthy read Alive' he flees to England where he meets Jez.  And it's a friendshippartnership born in scamscheme heaven.  If there's a way to make a fast buck they know it from selling bogus computers to selling insulation for homes that's never installed to entering any and every contest that comes down the pike.  If there's a nickel in it they're in.Then one day they hire a girl from the temp pool to help them out with one of their scams.  Georgie Kate Beckinsale is beautiful smart and has a cause she's trying to fund so she needs the job but from day one she's on to what Dylan and Jez are trying to pull.  She stays on board however when Dylan convinces her that they are something like modern day Robin Hoods that the money they're raising' is going to orphans.  What he doesn't tell her is that the orphans' he's referring to is them.  And Dylan is a born salesman not to mention the fact that he's a real charmer and the three of them become a real team.  Schwartz delivers a film that is in no way exceptional nor particularly memorable but it is entertaining.  It's exactly what it promises to be  a diverting hour and a half or so that provides some laughs and a good time. It's pleasant fare that's inoffensive and features some engaging performances and a story that will keep you involved.  There are a couple of scenes in fact that are downright hilarious.  And Schwartz has good timing and sets a pace that keeps it all moving right along which when you add it all up makes for a satisfying enjoyable experience.Futterman has a winning personality and a resonant mesmerizing voice that fits his character perfectly.  Dylan is the salesman you hope you'll never meet because if you do chances are you'll walk away with the deed to the bridge.  He's a likable heel convincingly brought to life by Futterman who is probably best known for his role of Vincent Gray in the Judging Amy' TV series.  It's a good performance and one of the strengths of the film.As Jez Townsend does a fine job too and though he's overshadowed a bit by Dylan intentionally the flashier of the two Jez is the one who secures the sympathy of the audience.  After all this is the guy who at least seems a bit remorseful as he's taking other people's money and trust. And it's interesting to compare Townsend's fairly reserved performance here with his role of the vampire Lestat in the more recent Queen of the Damned.'  He's a fine young actor whose style contrasts nicely with Futterman and along with Beckinsale they make quite the team of scam artists.The one who draws the attention however is the lovely and charismatic Kate Beckinsale who is beguiling in the role of Georgie.  She makes her character accessible and plays her with a savvy rather than naive sensibility and it's a portrayal that works well.  Most importantly she makes Georgie real with a winsome appeal that makes you care about her and what happens to her.  She's the most grounded of the trio and it's her character that keeps the story within the realm of credibility.  This may not be the stuff Oscars are made of but it's an enjoyable engaging performance that will win you over without question.The supporting cast includes Rowena Cooper Jez's Teacher Myles Anderson Jez aged 8 Jacob Macoby Dylan aged 8 Jane Lapotaire Dylan's Headmistress Tom Chadbon Mr. Greenaway Phyllis Logan Mrs. Ross Peter McNamara Geoff Arabella Weir Mrs. StrattonLuce Nickolas Grace Mr. StrattonLuce and Claire Cox Floss.  An easygoing comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes Shooting Fish' is a solid feel good film that will put a smile on your face and provide a pleasant evening's entertainment.  And in the final analysis that's not such a bad deal and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.".

And Schwartz has good timing and sets a pace that keeps it all moving right along which when you add it all up makes for a satisfying enjoyable experience.Futterman has a winning personality and a resonant mesmerizing voice that fits his character perfectly.  Dylan is the salesman you hope you'll never meet because if you do chances are you'll walk away with the deed to the bridge.  He's a likable heel convincingly brought to life by Futterman who is probably best known for his role of Vincent Gray in the Judging Amy' TV series.  It's a good performance and one of the strengths of the film.As Jez Townsend does a fine job too and though he's overshadowed a bit by Dylan intentionally the flashier of the two Jez is the one who secures the sympathy of the audience.  After all this is the guy who at least seems a bit remorseful as he's taking other people's money and trust. And it's interesting to compare Townsend's fairly reserved performance here with his role of the vampire Lestat in the more recent Queen of the Damned.'  He's a fine young actor whose style contrasts nicely with Futterman and along with Beckinsale they make quite the team of scam artists.The one who draws the attention however is the lovely and charismatic Kate Beckinsale who is beguiling in the role of Georgie.  She makes her character accessible and plays her with a savvy rather than naive sensibility and it's a portrayal that works well.  Most importantly she makes Georgie real with a winsome appeal that makes you care about her and what happens to her.  She's the most grounded of the trio and it's her character that keeps the story within the realm of credibility.  This may not be the stuff Oscars are made of but it's an enjoyable engaging performance that will win you over without question.The supporting cast includes Rowena Cooper Jez's Teacher Myles Anderson Jez aged 8 Jacob Macoby Dylan aged 8 Jane Lapotaire Dylan's Headmistress Tom Chadbon Mr. Greenaway Phyllis Logan Mrs. Ross Peter McNamara Geoff Arabella Weir Mrs. StrattonLuce Nickolas Grace Mr. StrattonLuce and Claire Cox Floss.  An easygoing comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes Shooting Fish' is a solid feel good film that will put a smile on your face and provide a pleasant evening's entertainment.  And in the final analysis that's not such a bad deal and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.";

While the plot is occassionally disjointed it never fails to keep moving along and is throughly charming along the way  helped greatly by the winning main characters. I was very surprised to see the mixed reviews it is hard to work out what there is not to like in this thoroughly likable movie  occassionally clever sometimes sappy possibly a little predictable  but never unlikeable. As for the title if you can't work it out you don't have enough intelligence to be allowed out of the house by yourself. My vote 710 and a fun movie for some lighthearted entertainment.

Dionne Warwick.  So anyway to make a long story short I searched in vain for the soundtrack for nigh on a year but to no avail.  Anyway then one day I was at the video store Major Video before Blockbuster decided to buy that too and I saw it and thought Jaysis there's something I need to see!  It had that snazzylooking retro box too and I was in a happy mood so I gladly went home and popped it in.This must have been the cheeriest movie I'd seen in years.  It made me think of Bringing Up Baby it was so happy and that's a good thing by the way. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely charming the American guy is lots of fun and the English guy has the great sense to be charming AND insanely cute in that odd way that the British have.  The movie has a plot sure but it doesn't matter.  You should just watch it and be haphaphappy!  Revel in the retrokitsch set design and the goofy dialogue and that English guy's striped tshirt.  It's the best pickmeup since Bounty or you know whatever. By the way I warn you... after I saw it I caught myself singing that Dionne Warwick song for weeks afterwards.".

This is a film pleading for the equality of homosexuals and it features a lecture within the lecture doing the same the sexoligist Magnus Hirschfeld giving a slideshow presentation which is attended by Else. I think it makes the film more honest and at the same time it's a way for the filmmakers to be as blunt as possible.It's difficult to appreciate the film aesthetically anymore. The gay nightclub scenes are frank but the film seems to shy away from too much intimacy between homosexuals. Philadelphia 1993 has been criticized for it's lack of a kiss too so I suppose it's asking too much of a film from 1919. The camerawork appears rather static as well. On the other hand Conrad Veidt was an admirable man and quite an actor. This is as much bravery from a prominent actor as you'll ever see. And he was outspoken against the Nazis as opposed to Emil Jannings probably the other major male star of German silent film. Although Veidt's performance is much in the style of the time he shows the right balance of effeminacy without being stereotypical.Other than Veidt the film isn't of much entertainment or artistic value. The film's message however is very important even today as the reconstruction introduction says Germany while a generally liberal government and populace today Paragraph 175 wasn't repealed until 1994. And there's the marriage debate in the US and elsewhere. Different from the Others is powerful in that way.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to vote for this film because it is really just the shreds of a film. The odd thing is that ONLY the parts of the story relevant to gay sensibilities remain the relationship between the violinist Paul Krner Veidt and his youthful proteg the scenes of allmale partying Paul making a pass at the man who turns out to be a blackmailer and apparently the slideshow lecture on the sexual continuum though perhaps this was reconstructed from the historical sexologist's actual slide shows?. Besides this there is the skeleton of the legal plot Paul reading about suicides and knowing what's behind it the judge giving the blackmailer 3 years and Paul one week and Paul coming home to kill himself. What you don't see is any scene at all with a woman in it except for one where young Paul runs in terror from a whorehouse. Evidently there were two sets of parents and a young woman all active in the original film and they all ended up being cut from the final film. There is not much development of the character of the boy Paul lovesit is not quite clear from the end whether he mourns Paul as a selfsacrificing friend a great violinist or the love of his life. Paul himself in an extended flashback evidently realized he was gay at the moment a whore kissed him the fillin titles explain that a young woman of dubious morals kissed the boy at a point after his story has disappeared from the surviving clips of the film. So presumably the boy has realized that since he does not like being kissed by a woman he must be gay and love Paul after all. It's an odd logic redeemed only by Veidt's combination of sensuality and morality great moment when he starts eagerly kissing a pickup and then is horrified when the man asks for money. Veidt is pretty amazing. The man played vampires or at least exotic sexual predators Jews Nazis in Allied films a Devil's Island inmateevery kind of marginal monster in one movie he seems to be playing Jesus. When he played kings he played them mad andor deformed. Yet he gave every character an edge a dignity a strength that made you feel it wasn't right if he got shot in the back. In this film he looks rather like Cesare from Cabinet of Dr. Caligari but the same skeletalelegant physique and haunted quality and haunted makeup become expressions of human sorrow longing and a frail nobility of character. It is interesting to compare this film to Victim made 42 years later. In both stories the protagonist is a man who discovered and explored his sexual feelings for other men as a schoolboy as a mature adult having achieved a position of great prestige he becomes involved in an unconsummated relationship with a much younger man who admires him passionately. In both stories a law makes homosexuals an easy target of blackmailers and both men attempt to defy the blackmailers and the law. In the 1919 movie however Krner after attempting to redirect his sexual desires by various means accepts himself as the way he is and lives a gay lifestyle or so we may assume from his activities at the drag ball. When he is confronted with the prospect of marriage he sends his parents or prospective girlfriend to a sexologist so that they too can accept him as he is. If he does not try to seduce his proteg it is presumably from a sense that it would be wrong to exploit his position of power over a very young indeed virginal student and the boy is horrified when he realizes that the relationship is potentially sexual. Melvin Farr on the other hand has succeeded in redirecting his sexual desires he is married to a cool blonde and together they are confident that he is if not completely heterosexual completely monogamous. No gay bars for him. The boy with whom he is in love on the other hand is frankly gay and would like to seduce his hero. In both stories the tragic victim is the man who openly and unreservedly gay is vulnerable to blackmail tries to protect the man he loves and finally kills himself. The earlier movie has a distinguished doctor arguing that there is a sexual continuum which is natural and good and should not be subject to legal penalties or blackmail the later movie just has examples of presumably good eminent men who happen to have secret homosexual sides and the hero's nobility lies in going to bat for a workingclass boy who could not keep his own sexuality secret. I am struck by the fact that both the tragic victims look physically frailthin as if worn to a bone in the hope that if they turn sideways they will be overlooked by society. Both the ambiguously sexual survivors are heartier types physically more solid and substantial though of course Dirk Bogarde could outedge even Veidt.".

Kurt dreams of taking lessons from his idol so visits the kimonodressed man in his apartments where he is soon being given private violin lessons.

The print for the scenes that are intact look quite nice here the music is appropriate and pleasing. Parts of the film almost come across as instructional including a lecture given by a sexologist featuring a slide show of males and females mostly in various states of crossdress. Conrad Veidt gives a very welldone touching performance here really giving off a keen sense of the strong relationship and love felt between Paul and Kurt. Well worth seeing.".

What is odd is that probably the tamest portions of the film are missing  the parts with Paul Krner Conrad Veidt and his family and the parts in which Paul interacts with Else the girl who loves him. The parts that are missing though are masterfully replaced by still shots and enough intertitles that you get a pretty good idea of how Paul gets along with his family.The film was made after World War I during a brief time of relative tolerance for homosexuality in Germany and rather than try to be titillating the film tries to teach of the problems with the German law that made it a crime to be homosexual. Paul Krner is a famous violin virtuoso who harbors a terrible secret  he's gay and constantly in fear of being discovered and prosecuted under the law. As a result you realize that Paul is a rather sad and lonely man despite his professional success unable to openly express himself and look for a lifepartner out in the open. Things change when Paul takes on a pupil Kurt Sivers a young man who idolizes Paul. Paul seems to really fall for Kurt but you can tell that Kurt is still somewhat unsure of what to make of his own feelings at this point. Unfortunately Kurt's sister Else loves Paul too not knowing that Paul is unable to return the sentiment.Paul is also being hounded by a blackmailer who first met him in a gay dance hall. When Paul mistook the blackmailer's advances as romantic he took him back to his home and there the man spurned Paul and demanded money. You get the impression he's been hounding him ever since that time. What is odd is that the gay dance hall where he and Paul first met almost seems to be the blackmailer's second home so I have to wonder why the blackmailer isn't afraid of being blackmailed himself.There's a well done set of scenes with Paul looking back on his life  his adolescence at boarding school specifically  and the trouble he had there on account of his orientation. There's even a scene with a sexologist lecturing on homosexuality  oddly enough this is how Paul explains to Else the truth of who he is and that his rejection of her is not personal.Highly recommended as a good reconstruction of a lost silent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The character of Franz here is a real smarmy hustler type who victimizes gay men he picks up in Berlin gay bars and threatens to squeal on for breaking some morals law. The sad thing is that he's breaking the law but he has the upper hand. For concert violinist Conrad Veidt that's the sad story of his life and here his story is documented and there's only few moments of happiness when he seems to find real love. The film is greatly edited from its original form utilizing stills and newly created title cards to help move the action along with what remains so it's not the product that German film audiences saw between 1919 and 1920 when it was banned. What remains is a compassionate portrayal of an aging gay man who becomes the mentor of a young violin player the romance that follows between them and the threats of scandal that tear them apart. Flashbacks to Veidt's younger self with another actor portraying the character during his school years who looks very much like a younger Veidt himself show all of the trauma he's gone through with a rather effeminate schoolmaster coming between the younger version of Veidt's character and the fellow student who can't seem to live without him. The blackmailer Franz is seen in a cabaret consorting with a very unattractive yet effeminate man who seems to be a part of the blackmail scheme making it appear that if you were not attractive enough to find companionship you would do what you could to prevent somebody else from finding it.The newly made dialog or letter cards seem sort of forced and not like real letters or pieces of dialog so that becomes one of the film's few detriments. A scene of a costume ball shows men dancing with men women dancing with women and Franz lingering around Veidt to pretend to make a play for him. A real life sexologist is there to provide a scientific reason that homosexuality exists and to show the audience that there is nothing unnatural about it. This was banned because it put a positive light on the reasons for homosexuality and was considered almost like an invitation to become gay. Veidt's character has some effeminate mannerisms but in a confrontation with Franz shows that he has the strength to carry the upper hand so he's no limp wristed poof. A disturbing party scene has Veidt being molested by female college students hoping to straighten him out but Veidt's reaction to all this shows that he is who he is and like Jerry Herman wrote for La Cage Aux Folles didn't need no excuses. The ending is a downer but has an element of hope looking fifty years into the future when gay liberation really began to move forward.".

	onyx:emotionText "The character of Franz here is a real smarmy hustler type who victimizes gay men he picks up in Berlin gay bars and threatens to squeal on for breaking some morals law. The sad thing is that he's breaking the law but he has the upper hand. For concert violinist Conrad Veidt that's the sad story of his life and here his story is documented and there's only few moments of happiness when he seems to find real love. The film is greatly edited from its original form utilizing stills and newly created title cards to help move the action along with what remains so it's not the product that German film audiences saw between 1919 and 1920 when it was banned.

It was probably a bit longer and parts may be lost from the original version written and directed by Richard Oswald. This film will soon have its 100th birthday it is from 1919 and this makes the message in the movie extremely interesting. Homosexuality was considered abnormal back then people were sent to doctors to be cured from this disease. this is also what the film shows. However it supports homosexuals and this is a truly progressive message for its time. The couple is likable the blackmailer is the bad guy. It should not come as a surprise that people who worked on this movie in major roles probably had a tough time working successfully under the Nazi regime 2 decades later. Conrad Veidt not only because of his participation in Casablanca was a big name back then and I can see why. Yes there is the usual unnecessary overacting from silent films but he certainly has his good moments too and carries this film nicely from start to finish. Today almost a century later gaythemed short films are very frequent and frequently very bad. I wish the makers of this new generation of movie about this subject would watch stuff like Anders als die Anderen. Maybe this could teach them how to make a quality film. Good watch and I recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A German movie from the 1950ies showing how a homosexual is cured? Directed by a notorious antisemitic Nazi director? Before we bash it with all our power let's take a closer look A young man of 17 years is a gifted painter and feels misunderstood by his father a bank manager who apparently doesn't know anything in life but money. His best friend is a young lyricist living with his poor mother. The lyricist is the protg of an homosexual art dealer who attracts the young painter too because he is obviously a valuable conversational partner for him. The father suspecting his son's interest in abstract art and electronic music to be an expression of abnormal behavior sues the art dealer to have seduced the son  without any reason not to mention evidence. Meanwhile the mother who shares her husband's fear that her son might be gay also tries to cure him by successfully making a match between him who never said of himself to be gay and her maid. The art dealer gets to know about that and sues the parents for procuration hoping in vain to defend himself from the father's legal attack. In the end the mother is convicted while the art dealer is arrested  still without any reason and admittedly without a warrant. All in all not as homophobic as many reviews want us to believe. It comes better There are indeed many homophobic statements in the film but if you watch carefully you'll see that they all are DUBBED except for those of the father which intendedly characterize him as an unteachable square and that the unmotivated arrest of the gay art dealer was obviously filmed later maybe even by another director andor DOP because it matches neither the movie's style nor plot!Fortunately the Filmmuseum Mnchen Munich Film Museum has undertaken the effort to find footage from the original version of the movie called Das dritte Geschlecht The 3rd Sex and has just released a DVD of Anders als du und ich European PAL region code 0 German soundtrack with optional English subtitles which provides the movie not only in stunning technical quality but also with extensive extra features including comparisons of all edited scenes with their original version. And these original scenes are far from homophobic! To give you just one example in the edited version the lyricist's mother tells the painter's uncle who joins the father in searching for his son that she knows her son is gay and that she has learned to accept it and the man replies that she mustn't accept it. In the original version he simply replies Well that's fate. A multitude of more examples prove without doubt that the original intention of the film was remarkably enlightened and the superb and highly recommended DVD edition even contains a ROM part with documents that explain why the alterations were performed The Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle a German film rating organization comparable to the MPAA rejected the original version  for advertising homosexuality!To get that straight sorry for the pun All this doesn't make Mr Harlan a saint. There are elements in the film that are hard to explain Why is the art dealer filmed in a sort of demonic light during his allmale soires? Maybe to parody the society's view on homosexuality? If so this would be a risky approach.In the end we cannot accuse Mr Harlan of homophobia but certainly of naivet He who always claimed that Goebbels Hitler's secretary of propaganda had not only forced him to shoot Jud S but also destroyed his own nonantisemitic cut of the film there are at least clues to support his version of the story should have been warned that something similar could happen again and that this in conjunction with his reputation would destroy any noble message he may have wanted to communicate.All in all a highly interesting and truly unique historical document of the situation of homosexuals in Germany very far before Stonewall.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sixty years after it premiered I saw the West German film Different from You and Me Article 175. Made in 1957 by Nazifriendly filmmaker Veit Harlan it is also known as The Third Sex which was its original title. Despite the time elapsed it was like travelling in a time machine and listening to stoneage notions about human sexuality. Moreover I felt I was watching a portrait of the repressive Panamanians who had recently marched in the streets with apocalyptic hatred in their hearts to exterminate all that does not fit in their 1957 notions of sex life. I do not doubt that the origins can be found even further back in time.By 1962 when I was about 11 years old The Third Sex was still in the local cinema circuit.

	onyx:emotionText "Sixty years after it premiered I saw the West German film Different from You and Me Article 175. Made in 1957 by Nazifriendly filmmaker Veit Harlan it is also known as The Third Sex which was its original title. Despite the time elapsed it was like travelling in a time machine and listening to stoneage notions about human sexuality. Moreover I felt I was watching a portrait of the repressive Panamanians who had recently marched in the streets with apocalyptic hatred in their hearts to exterminate all that does not fit in their 1957 notions of sex life. I do not doubt that the origins can be found even further back in time.By 1962 when I was about 11 years old The Third Sex was still in the local cinema circuit. I never saw the movie and I did not even try in adolescence. By then I was more curious about Isabel Sarli's megabosom and her adventures in waterfalls and beaches until the British Protestant boys appeared and seduced us all with the Beatles and Malcolm McDowell leading hordes of rebels.

	schema:reviewBody "The original title of this film and the title under which it appeared uncensored in Austria was The Third Sex. This expression does not date from the Hitler era as one rather hysterical reviewer suggests but from the Weimar period. It was associated with the theories of Magnus Hirschfeld who was not only openly gay but also Jewish. Two films had been made during that period both hostile to the notorious article 175 of the German legal code. Both refer specifically to Hirschfeld's theories that there was a naturally occurring third sex whose orientation should not therefore be regarded as abnormal. Hirschfeld himself appears as the sexologist in Richard Oswald's Anders als die andern 1919 and Dreyer's Mikal 1924 was subtitled the third sex The reviewer is also wrong in supposing that postwar Germany was well on the way to reforming the law. It actually took a very hard line not greatly different from that of the Nazis. Homosexuals incarcerated by Hitler were not released in 1945 but obliged to continue their terms of imprisonment under article 175. The official view as represented by the filmcensorship body the FSK was that homosexuality should be portrayed as a menace to society. The situation in Germany was very different from that in Britain where the Wolfenden Report in this same year advocated a reform of the law for which there was now a favourable consensus although the actual reform would have to wait for the election of a Labour government. Basil Dearden's 1961 film The Victim restates the case for reform but it was already in fact expressing a view endorsed by the Wolfenden Commission.In Germany it was now much more difficult to make a film sympathetic in its treatment of homosexuality more difficult than it had been in the much more tolerant atmosphere of 1919 or 1924. Although the Harlan film is based on a screenplay by Felix Ltzkendorf entitled Eltern klagen an Parents Accuse designed to highlight the dangers of homosexualityhe also employed homosexual activist Hans Giese as scientific consultant for the film and very clearly intended it to be broadly sympathetic towards homosexuals and to shift German opinion towards reform of its archaic laws. It is even in the original a somewhat timid and clumsy effort but Harlan's intentions are not really in doubt.The film does not portray homosexuality as evil. The homosexual characters are not simply demonised and the depiction of the gay world is not altogether unsympathetic. As other reviews have pointed out the original film refers to the more tolerant attitudes in other European countries and is implicitly critical of German intolerance in this respect. The audience's sympathies throughout are with the tolerant uncle and mother not with the hectoring blackmailing father whose intolerance is clearly shown to be part of the problem.Of course homosexuality is not cured by a heterosexual relationship but this is not really the intended message. Harlan is on record as believing that there were both those who were naturally homosexual the Hirschfeld thesis and those who were attracted towards homosexuality for other reasons the case of Klaus in the film. Harlan typically hedges his bets warning against homosexuality in the second case n conformity with the official view but nevertheless making a case for more tolerant attitudes with regard to the first category.The FSK certainly had no doubt whatsoever about its sympathies and not only was the title changed for release in Germany but not in Austria but Harlan was obliged by the censors to make many small changes that greatly mitigated the message of the film you can find a catalogue of these changes in the relevant article on Wikipedia.The US was at this time quite as bigoted in its attitude as Germany but censorship was more relaxed with regard to foreign films and Harlan was able to release a version there under the original title The Third Sex which still omits material from the original including comically enough cuts to the heterosexual scenes but is closer to the original than the heavily censored version that appeared in Germany itself. This dubbed version is also available on Youtube.It is ironic that having been condemned for his wartime complaisance towards official German policy to which he may have had no strong objections Harlan should have been condemned again in 1957 for the changes that official censorship had imposed this time very clearly at variance with his own intentions. Jud Sss is not really the genocideinciting film that. It is racist but its racial thesis is almost identical to that of The Birth of a Nation and its treatment of Jews and Jewish culture distinctly less caricatural and dehumanising than Griffith's treatment of blacks. It is entirely possible to sympathise with Sss in the film in a way in which it is not really possible to sympathise with blackface Gus in The Birth of a Nation and to feel that he is treated hypocritically when he is condemned  an interesting element in common with this film  by an archaic law. The meanminded German bourgeoisie who take their revenge on him for his support of a petty tyrant historically accurate enough are portrayed in a not dissimilar to the intolerant father in this film. Jud Sss is in many respects a good film it won the Coupe Mussolini at the Venice Film Festival and was praised by young Italian critic Michelangelo Antonioni and would doubtless have been less racist had Harlan not had Goebbels breathing down his neck just as this film would have been different had Harlan not been up against German censors.The trouble is that Harlan made little effort to resist Goebbels and was just as pathetically compliant with the censors in 1957 redubbing significant sections of the film and even reshooting scenes at their behest.Perhaps Harlan's real crime was simply a consistent lack of moral courage......".

	schema:reviewBody "Today hardly anyone can view this movie unprejudiced. But paradoxically it may even benefit the final impression it leaves when you initially expect the worst and it turns out not that bad the impression is in the end much more favourable than if there were any expectations the film couldn't live up to. This sounds like a truism but can be a useful tip on how to view this movie. Certainly it would be ridiculous to expect political correctness or an indepth and realistic study of homosexuality from a movie released in 1957. Yet it seems to be exactly the approach all the users who gave a 'one' had or they just voted without seeing the movie. Neither did I share this kind of approach nor intend on rating the director's personality and his ethical or political choices instead of the film. The result was that the latter pleasantly surprised me turning out better than expected  and not only contentwise. One of the previous reviewers has already mentioned the important difference the deleted scenes make. But even in the edited version the only blatantly homophobic character is Klaus's father You can also count schoolboys bullying Manfred in but they appear only briefly and it can hardly be said they are portrayed in a positive light. All the others appear rather indifferent and mostly they even try to cool his zeal  even Klaus's uncle whom an aged bourgeois familyman just like Teichmann you would naturally expect to be as narrowminded and bigoted as his brotherinlaw. The mother appears to an extent instrumental  initially she is far from suspicious but gets too impressed by her husbands alarms. Of the edited scenes only the first one a discussion on homosexuality between two doctors at what appears as a TVshow could actually have made the film look more homophobic  and it's an exception. Besides the already described 'It's fate' scene with Manfred's mother there's a really interesting scene in which Dr. Winkler talks with his gay lawyer who refuses to back him upon hearing that he had actually seduced an underage boy. This scene also explains the subtitle 'Paragraph 175'  as Winkler retorts nihilistically that regardless of their conduct they both are criminals for society. The lawyer advises a monogamous relationship to him as an only moral and 'respectable' mode of sexual life  Winkler laughs and compares him to a priest in response. If the scene wasn't cut the lawyer would arguably be the second wholesome gay character in the film furthermore making a point of separating homosexuality from pedophilia and promiscuity  while even today now and then we encounter the attempts to blur this distinction. The following edited scenes include Winkler's foreign friend's mention of the more lenient attitude to homosexuality in other European countries and the officer confiding to Teichmann that the gay bars are permitted and monitored by the police. it could be this that was seen as 'advertising' homosexuality. The edited scenes also add some definitiveness to the relationship between young heroes Manfred's jealousy not only towards the girl but to Winkler also is emphasized and his grief about parting with his friend  'And me? Who have I got? No Boris and no Klaus!'. All in all the movie would have benefited if all of them except the first one weren't edited out. The most homophobic about the content of the film is the idea that homosexuality is not innate but a result of some deviation in development  throughout the movie this idea isn't explicitly contested. In one of his letters found in the booklet with other documents Harlan as far as my command of German lets me understand differentiates between 'natural' homosexuals and those giving in to weakness lasciviousness or desire for profit. The first kind that he calls 'sexual cripples' deserves sympathy in his opinion and in general homosexuals are not to be prosecuted except for seducing 'normal' young men. He even states that said sympathy should be promoted by the film. Still he sounds rather evasive. Consider for a moment that in America even this kind of a movie on homosexuality wouldn't be possible at the time  not with the production Code! And in this 'fascist' German movie we get a handsome lead his friend Klaus who is also pretty and despite a certain amount of touchiness and sickliness still isn't portrayed as completely worthless and has a loving mother who fully accepts him the way he is. And... what looks like no less but in some sense a full reversal of the infamous Wilde vs Queensberry and Crown vs Wilde cases by the way in the unedited version the mother gets imprisoned not put on probation. If not in its own right this film can still be highly interesting as a rarity and a curious artifact from the prehistory of queer cinema.".

	schema:headline " What else can you expect from the director of Jud Sss";
	schema:reviewBody "At the end of World War II during which he directed Jud Sss the vilest genocideinciting antiSemitic movie of all time the mediocre director Veit Harlan escaped going to jail on a technicality it could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Reich's propaganda minister Dr. Joseph Goebbels' office did not tamper with a few minutes' of film of Harlan's supposedly wellmeaning movie.Harlan soon staged his muchawaited comeback and started making movies in which the word Jew was taboo. Alas all he was interested in making were movies inciting hatred. So if you are no longer allowed to openly incite hatred of the Jews  though soon even that may be allowed again in a unified Germany where the death of thirty thousand Aryans during the bombing of Dresden is nowadays widely viewed as comparable if not worse than the wanton genocidal murder of six million Jews there is always some other group to pick on.Not aware that homosexuality was on its way to becoming legal in the land of Roehm Harlan had decided he would make a gayhating movie for a change. The story is so inane that I will forgo any spoilers. What no one can miss though is the fact that the way the good Germans in this movie talk to and about gay men is a mutatis mutandis quotation of the way they used to talk in Harlan's wartime movies to and about the Jews shortly before murdering them. This does not stop at spoken language but extends to body language as well.Though the word Jew is never uttered in Anders als Du und Ich the movie's openly gay bad guy goes by the certainly nonAryan name of Dr. Boris Winkler and his manservant is known only by his in Germany most Semitic of surnames Maurice. I guess the Goebbels boys must have been at it yet again even though like his childmurdering spouse the cowardly propaganda minister had swallowed his cyanide more than a decade before the shooting of Anders als Du und Ich.. Maybe the most disgusting feature of this movie is the participation of the legendary stage actress Paula Wessely who had acted in Nazi propaganda movies during the war and then asked to be forgiven for this lapse. There is no denying that Wesssely was one of the most spellbinding stage actresses of all time. But to participate in a movie in which she is asked to act the role of a mother who after having heard rumors that her son may be gay learns all she ever wanted to know about homosexuality by furtively looking up the oneparagraph entry Third Sex in a Hitlerera lexicon indicates that a very limited intelligence informed Wessely's great acting talent.".

	onyx:emotionText "At the end of World War II during which he directed Jud Sss the vilest genocideinciting antiSemitic movie of all time the mediocre director Veit Harlan escaped going to jail on a technicality it could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Reich's propaganda minister Dr. Joseph Goebbels' office did not tamper with a few minutes' of film of Harlan's supposedly wellmeaning movie.Harlan soon staged his muchawaited comeback and started making movies in which the word Jew was taboo. Alas all he was interested in making were movies inciting hatred. So if you are no longer allowed to openly incite hatred of the Jews  though soon even that may be allowed again in a unified Germany where the death of thirty thousand Aryans during the bombing of Dresden is nowadays widely viewed as comparable if not worse than the wanton genocidal murder of six million Jews there is always some other group to pick on.Not aware that homosexuality was on its way to becoming legal in the land of Roehm Harlan had decided he would make a gayhating movie for a change. The story is so inane that I will forgo any spoilers. What no one can miss though is the fact that the way the good Germans in this movie talk to and about gay men is a mutatis mutandis quotation of the way they used to talk in Harlan's wartime movies to and about the Jews shortly before murdering them. This does not stop at spoken language but extends to body language as well.Though the word Jew is never uttered in Anders als Du und Ich the movie's openly gay bad guy goes by the certainly nonAryan name of Dr. Boris Winkler and his manservant is known only by his in Germany most Semitic of surnames Maurice. I guess the Goebbels boys must have been at it yet again even though like his childmurdering spouse the cowardly propaganda minister had swallowed his cyanide more than a decade before the shooting of Anders als Du und Ich.. Maybe the most disgusting feature of this movie is the participation of the legendary stage actress Paula Wessely who had acted in Nazi propaganda movies during the war and then asked to be forgiven for this lapse. There is no denying that Wesssely was one of the most spellbinding stage actresses of all time. But to participate in a movie in which she is asked to act the role of a mother who after having heard rumors that her son may be gay learns all she ever wanted to know about homosexuality by furtively looking up the oneparagraph entry Third Sex in a Hitlerera lexicon indicates that a very limited intelligence informed Wessely's great acting talent.";

Today he is known mostly for his infamous Nazi propaganda movies but this one here he made more than a decade after World War II in the final stages of his career. And in contrast to some of the color films from Nazi Germany this one here is once again in blackandwhite. The core element in the story here is love and this refers to heterosexual as well as homosexual love which was a pretty controversial topic back then still. Oh well.. it somewhat is even today. So it should not be too surprising that the law also plays a major role in this film. Unfortunately I do not think the premise they had here lead to a real quality film. The script was probably just not good enough but I also cannot say that too many of the actors elevated the material. It is interesting because of the homosexual context which really was not common at all in film back then but this context is just not enough to make it interesting enough and make up for all the weak aspects here. As a whole it was a very forgettable watch and there is not one single memorable aspect about this film really. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Anderson was not setting out to write a manifesto for the gay rights movement or for anyone's agenda when he wrote the original play. He has said it's not about homosexuality  it's about love and those who are different being persecuted by those obsessed with conformity. The play and the film are more interesting as a deconstruction of traditional gender roles if we need to look at the political aspect of it. But this is mainly a work about two lonely literate gentle people who find each other at a wearisomely macho conformist boy's prep school. Robert Anderson himself adapted his play into the screenplay and did a good job of opening it up. Minelli does a beautiful directing job and the original Broadway cast reprising their roles all do fine work. The problem is that the censors at the Hayes Office made them butcher Tea and Sympathy as badly as with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. In the original 1954 play a teacher takes Tom swimming then the teacher is fired for being gay and the other students assume Tom is gay and begin throwing around terms like queer and fairy. The Hollywood 1956 film is reduced to implying he's less than manly because the other boys see him sewing with the faculty wives. They start calling him sisterboy. The original play makes clear that the husband of the Deborah Kerr character played by Leif Erickson in a fine bravely repellent performance abets the boys in persecuting Tom because he himself is really gay and in the closet. The film of course cuts her line near the end of the play which causes the couple to break up Did it ever occur to you that you persecute in Tom that boy up there you persecute in him the thing you fear in yourself? The film would be more powerful and less dated and make more sense if Anderson and Minelli had been allowed to leave these things in. But the worst act of Hayes Office butchery does not relate to the issue of homosexuality it has to do with the fact that the censors felt adultery must never ever seem to be endorsed onscreen. The film is given the framing device of Tom returning to the school at reunion time and the epilogue when it gets back to the framing device ... that's rubbish there for the censors. It has nothing to do with the real story. Wise viewers will switch off after Deborah Kerr's line Years from now when you talk about this and you will be kind. That's where the play ends. This was Deborah Kerr's favorite role in all her years of acting and Laura Reynolds is the character she has said she most identified with. It shows she does a lovely heartfelt job. I'd say she and John Kerr no relation have fine chemistry. I find the Ellie Martin character a bit overdone otherwise the performances are strong. It's interesting that the head bully in the house Ralph is played by Tom Laughlin who went on to make the Billy Jack films. Perhaps he and John Kerr became buddies in the years they worked on Tea and Sympathy in various incarnations he also plays the pilot who flies Kerr to the island at the beginning of South Pacific. There's a moment in The Trial of Billy Jack another period piece from a very different era! where an Indian wise man is advising Billy Jack about how we are most hostile to the things we fear in ourselves as the athletic man mocks the longhaired youth because he doubts his own masculinity. Something like that  it reflects sixties and seventies arguments about longhaired hippies but it's also right out of Tea and Sympathy where the majority look askance at anyone without a crewcut. The macho selfhating Bill Reynolds character is like the repressed married dock worker in Last Exit to Brooklyn  it's startling to find such a character in a film that was actually made right then back in that era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those who had the good fortune to see Deborah Kerr onstage in the Elia Kazan production of Tea and Sympathy will attest to her unforgetable performance.  Kerr not only played it on Broadway but also toured with it a treat for all attendees.  Now nearly a half century later her performance on film which was very much influenced by her stage style begins to show a little wear around the edges. It must be difficult to change one's approach after having played a role so successfully night after night. In this case her inflections accents phraseology pauses gestures and the like are essentially theatrebased designed to play to the whole house up to the balcony.  In the intimacy of film this becomes a bit much in the long run and results in a much more broad deliberate and stylized Kerr than in any of her other film work. Her character tends to emerge now more as a busybody snooper peeping tom than was ever intended and certainly it did not come across that way when the film was first released. A landmark film of sortsfor a major studio to tackle a sensitive subject in a major productionTea and Sympathy benefits from a sincerely written script by Robert Anderson solid direction by Vincent Minnelli and a secure supporting cast.  Visually Deborah Kerr is beautiful and is totally committed to both the play and her role.  During her lengthy film career Kerr certainly contributed a wealth of finely crafted performances.".

Now nearly a half century later her performance on film which was very much influenced by her stage style begins to show a little wear around the edges. It must be difficult to change one's approach after having played a role so successfully night after night. In this case her inflections accents phraseology pauses gestures and the like are essentially theatrebased designed to play to the whole house up to the balcony.  In the intimacy of film this becomes a bit much in the long run and results in a much more broad deliberate and stylized Kerr than in any of her other film work. Her character tends to emerge now more as a busybody snooper peeping tom than was ever intended and certainly it did not come across that way when the film was first released. A landmark film of sortsfor a major studio to tackle a sensitive subject in a major productionTea and Sympathy benefits from a sincerely written script by Robert Anderson solid direction by Vincent Minnelli and a secure supporting cast.  Visually Deborah Kerr is beautiful and is totally committed to both the play and her role.  During her lengthy film career Kerr certainly contributed a wealth of finely crafted performances.";

But Tea and Sympathy tells a very real and poignant story and if you allow yourself simply to be swept up by that rather than looking at the film in a sceptical and critical manner you may actually enjoy it. John Kerr does a wonderful job of playing a teenage boy Tom Lee who cannot seem to fit in with those around him and Leif Erickson does just as good a job portraying the schoolmaster Bill Reynolds who sees being 'manly' as one of the most important things there is. And lovely refined Deborah Kerr no relation to John Kerr in the role she played on stage does an impressive job of portraying Laura Reynolds the lovestarved faculty wife who still thinks about the husband she lost in the war. And she is the one who is disturbed by the treatment Tom gets from his schoolmates and even from her husband himself and she is the one who takes action to try and help him. The fact that there are large references to 'out of bounds' sexual activity in the film make it rather unique and daring for the decade in which it was released. Director Vincente Minnelli does a superb job of capturing the sexual tension within the Reynolds house and makes the film that much less twee. A great film and a must see for Deborah Kerr fans.".

I loved it and didn't find it objectionable in the least. Here was a movie where someone other than me was a loner and different than the popular boys and was the hero of the story. What I had forgotten or not picked up on at the time were some of the supporting performances. The supportive roommate was brave and although he did eventually give way to the pressure how many folks today would have been as brave? I also saw the housemaster in a different light. He had always seemed to be a big bully to me but today  I really heard his wife's complaints that they had been married less than a year and that they hardly ever touched anymore. Add that to the way that he seems to spend a lot of time playing' with barechested young men and that he never remarried after his wife left him and one has to wonder if he weren't in a closet of his own.I think that this movie has stood the test of time better than most and is in no way objectionable although it does describe an objectionable time.

	schema:reviewBody "Some of the comments here puzzle me and really point out how people can see the same film and yet see entirely different films nonetheless.Yes Tea and Sympathy addresses homosexuality  but there isn't a single bit of actual homosexuality in the film. It's not about actual homosexuality but about perceived homosexuality... and the fear thereof. It's completely obvious within five minutes that Tom Lee is completely in love with Laura and there's nothing whatsoever in the film that suggests he might feel romantic or erotic attraction to men... nor is there anything whatsoever in the film that suggests that he's confused about whether or not he likes men or men and women.Of course back in the fifties most really all film language that dealt with homosexuality was coded. Things stood for homosexuality rather than directly displaying it. So one could be tempted to say that Tom Lee is a coded closet case. But far too much of the script is explicitly about the external challenge of his being seen as or feared to be queer while absolutely none of it is about an internal struggle with his orientation. He struggles with the perception his own and others of his masculinity but nothing in the film indicates Tom himself might think he's queer.And again his obvious infatuation with Laura permeates the whole film. He doesn't stalk her at the beginning because he needs a sympathetic ear...And when she tries to set him up on a tea date with a girl there's no sense that she fears Tom is queer that she must straighten him out. But she is horribly concerned that they keep others from thinking it. She even has one line of dialog in which she speaks to him directly of the need to nip this in the bud or somesuch. Even in a 1956 film it wouldn't make any sense to think that this woman would think a tea date would straighten Tom out but it does make sense that she would believe it could be part of repairing his reputation.The closest the film ever gets to suggesting the potential much less the actuality of Tom being queer is when Laura voices fears that Tom being treated not like a man could lead him to become unsure of himself as a man... If you want to infer she fears he might become queer because of this there's room especially given the overall coding Hollywood demanded of such material but again you've got everything else in the film to work against this interpretation. And it's an interpretation of what Tom might be in the future not what he is in the timeframe of the film itself.Furthermore even this is only the perception of another character  not Tom himself displaying any indication that HE fears he may one day become queer.Tom's conflict revolves around his trying to navigate his way in the world as the atypical man he is find his identity as a man and be accepted as such... in a world that doesn't want to.And it's other people not Tom who clearly altho thru coded film language see him as queer or fear he might be.And while I understand that Anderson's play was more forceful in suggesting that the housemaster was a repressed homosexual it's really stretch to see it in the film version. The building blocks of the coding are there yeah he hangs out with the boys and roughhouses with them and he neglects his wife but the film also goes to considerable lengths to paint him as a typical man who's lost interest in his marriage once he's claimed his wife. What with that and the context of a film in which the main character is so clearly painted as a perceived homosexual rather than as an actual one even in potentiality the coding is so incredibly watered down that it's really not even there at all effectively.Tea and Sympathy is a pretty compelling film about the definitions of masculinity and gender role enforcement and homophobia. It's really upsetting to see that homophobia and misogyny and incredible pressure to conform on screen but it is compelling. Even if Minnelli turned out to be a horrible choice for director.His avoidance of closeups reveals him to be in this case at least what feels to me like a very selfish director. More than the topic more than the writing it's the performances of Kerr and Kerr that make this film. They are constantly having to fight Minnelli's apparent desire to keep them at a visual distance from us. I guess in a way it's a credit to both the stars and Minnelli himself that he could get such strong work from them despite the sparseness of closeups that the film so desperately needed.It's as if Minnelli thought that he was  or should be  directing a pageant rather than a drama. Look I can make even an intimate human drama great in WIDESCREEN!!! Except that you can't Vincent. I don't care about you in Tea and Sympathy Mr. Minnelli I care about Tom and Laura. Give me the characters!Matthew".

	schema:reviewBody "Here we are in 2008 and the pendulum of sexual misunderstanding has swung both ways now in a few generations. Once homosexuality was despised.

Even 'eyewitnesses' to major news events often don't really know what they're talking about.If this is a cult film for homosexuals it is because they see what they want to see in the movie and not what exists. Clearly Tom Lee is smitten with Laura long before the film starts just as his first love was a blond schoolteacher when he was only twelve. Laura's line to his roommate Maybe Tom is deeply in love could only apply to Tom's feelings toward herself.What is to be learned from Maxwell Anderson's sensitive writing as well as from Tennessee Williams' best work is that love is the main thing and that we choose those whom we love because they meet our psychological and emotional needs and many times we are not even consciously aware what those needs really are. Reynolds for example although he was certainly ambivalent in his sexuality still truly wanted a good woman to be his wife which is why he married Laura and fully loved her in his own way but he also needed patient help right from the start whereas Laura was slow to realize his dilemma and being admittedly a selfish woman at times nursed her own hurts as their relationship deteriorated quite apart from Tom's involvement at all. Her husband ended up a broken man not because he was a frustrated repressed homosexual but because he had failed the love of his life and couldn't trust himself not to do the same again with another mate.In Tea and Sympathy and in reactions to the film for the past decades we see how the norms of society can entrap all of us at both ends of the spectrum.".

Its subject matter was a shock to many people at the time but alas on second viewing this film seems a bit dated. Of course one has to put oneself back in the fifties when the play opened on Broadway it almost seems a daring attempt to speak about homosexuality back then. If you haven't seen the film please stop reading now.Vincente Minelli made the best of the adaptation by playwright Anderson for the screen. In fact most of the perception about Tom's homosexuality seems to be center stage but no one really focuses on the one that really is and is trying to hide the fact Bill Reynolds!We realize at the end of the film that Tom was a mixed up young man rather than a gay man coming to terms with his feelings. In fact if one watches closely Tom seems to be terribly attracted by Laura but he is too shy to do or say anything that will make him be seen differently by her. Also Laura confronts Bill toward the end of the film and confesses the way she feels about Tom and what she almost did the night before in order for the young man to have a real sexual experience which occurs later on.While Tea and Sympathy concentrates on the lonely Tom it presents us a masculine Bill who confesses he had gone through the same things Tom is experiencing now at one time in his life but who in reality is hiding his own homosexuality from everyone. Bill is the most dangerous individual because he will probably prey on the young men under his care and force them into satisfying his own gay urges as has been seen in the case of Catholic priests abusing children. It is also revealing that in the last scene when Tom finds him at home he is listening to the classical music Tom loved and Laura is has divorced him.Deborah Kerr having played Laura on stage brings her own interpretation of the role which in a way works. Also the same could be said of John Kerr who originated the role of Tom. The only thing is that one doesn't see strong chemistry between the costarring Kerrs in our humble opinion. Leif Erickson gives a subtle reading on Bill Reynolds. While he is not the center of the story he looms large in the background because we realize that instead of asking the guys under him to behave he seems to be enjoying that someone else is being ridiculed as a sissy. Edward Andrews Daryl Hickman and Norma Crane are seen in supporting roles.Being dated aside the film shows how America dealt with this subject in that era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tea And Sympathy offers a rare chance to see the three Broadway leads of Robert Anderson's play repeat their roles. Although they didn't finish the 712 performance run Deborah Kerr John Kerr and Leif Erickson all do a fine job on the screen. Tea And Sympathy actually won two Tony Awards for Anthony Perkins and Mary Fickett who replaced both the Kerrs in the Broadway run.It goes without saying that if the film were done today it would be a lot more frank about the characters. John Kerr would be more definitely bisexual and Leif Erickson would have his issues more openly discussed.John Kerr is a sensitive kid who doesn't quite fit into the gender roles that back in the Fifties were pretty rigid. At the boys prep school he attends the other kids call him 'sister boy' and tease him pretty bad. The only one who notices his plight with any degree of concern is Deborah Kerr who lives in his dormitory with her husband Leif Erickson. Deborah was married once before to a young man killed in the war and John reawakens something of her feelings. In the end she gives her all to John.Sadly Leif Erickson's performance is sadly overlooked when discussing Tea And Sympathy. He comes across at first as the usual jock lout but it goes quite a bit deeper than that. The Code did not permit a more open performance but Erickson's is one of the best examples of a self hating latent gay man I've ever seen on film. Notice the only time he really comes alive is when he's with his boys doing all the imbecilic rite of passage things that are encouraged in society back then and in some cases still are. In the end Deborah realizes that she really doesn't mean anything to Erickson although the tacked on ending is something of a cop out.Another performance that stands out is that of Edward Andrews who is John Kerr's father. He and Erickson unite in the fact that they want young Kerr to butch it up and start taking up more masculine endeavors.In these days of the suicides of young gay youth hitting the national media with government finally taking notice of the problem Tea And Sympathy takes on a frightening relevance. The characters from the Fifties will be immediately recognized by many today most especially the young who are going through exactly what John Kerr is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Slickly done MGM soaper. As I recall the movie was much talked about at time of release no doubt because of its touchy subject matter. Homosexuality was primarily a taboo topic in the straitened 1950's. The question posed is whether Tom's nonmasculine traits are traceable to a latent homosexuality. That's what the film's basically about though the word itself is never mentioned. Due to family tradition Tom's required to attend an upperclass allboys college. That would be okay except hypermasculine behavior is the required norm and since Tom's basically a sensitive type seemingly uninterested in girls he's ridiculed and shunned by the other lads as a sisterboy. The wife of his macho housesupervisor however is a sensitive soul herself. She cares about his plight when no one else does. But Laura's not sure how to help especially when the school environment discourages sensitivity as unmanly. So how will Tom's predicament evolve when so much of his life combines against a nonconformity he seems unable to resist.The story's told in Tom's flashback so we know that whatever happens he physically survives. But in what kind of mental state we don't know until the end. Note how director Minnelli films entirely at an impersonal distance. There are no subjective closeups. That way story remains uppermost at the same time personal emotions are minimized. Whether this was the best course remains I think debatable.Fortunately the lead actors Kerr Tom and Kerr Laura avoid excess. Thus the results avoid treacle the usual pitfall of a movie of this type. However the boys' boisterous horseplay is spread on with a trowel an overexaggeration I guess to better contrast with the withdrawn Tom. But it's not really needed to that distractive degree.Anyway the story manages considerable human interest as both Tom and Laura try to deal with the travails of a hypermasculine environment. I like the way Laura is slowly drawn into Tom's kindred soul predicament and in a way that provides her own selfdiscovery after years of feminine conformity. Also catch how subtly impotence is implied when Tom visits bargirl Ellie Crane. The problem also turns out to be a key plot ingredient.By and large the taboo elements appear dated. Still interest is pretty well maintained over the twohour runtime. That plus a thoughtful upshot makes this MGM production worth catching up with.".

I didn't feel the issue was being forced on me  I was truly being entertained. Three gripping scenes in particular stick out in my mind  if you haven't seen the movie I won't ruin it for you but you'll know which ones I mean after you see it.It is all the more impressive that this movie was made in restrictive conservative 1956 America. It is a five star classic  and I consider myself a pretty strict judge of movies. I have maybe seen only 6 or 7 movies in my short lifetime which I consider to be true 5star quality  that is by my definition a unique groundbreaking historic cinematic achievement which has withstood the test of time  out of scores of possibilities. I have added Tea and Sympathy to that short list.".

I didn't feel the issue was being forced on me  I was truly being entertained. Three gripping scenes in particular stick out in my mind  if you haven't seen the movie I won't ruin it for you but you'll know which ones I mean after you see it.It is all the more impressive that this movie was made in restrictive conservative 1956 America. It is a five star classic  and I consider myself a pretty strict judge of movies. I have maybe seen only 6 or 7 movies in my short lifetime which I consider to be true 5star quality  that is by my definition a unique groundbreaking historic cinematic achievement which has withstood the test of time  out of scores of possibilities. I have added Tea and Sympathy to that short list.";

	schema:reviewBody "As a child in the 1950's and then as an adolescent and teenager during the 60's I have many mixed feelings about the era. I loved the music many of the movies the Golden Age of Television which lured me away from despised homework assignments each and every night the relative safety especially for a kid and the uncomplicated simplicity of the times. What I don't miss however are the oppressive narrowminded stereotyping and the stifling social conformity that were so prevalent during that period. So what if you occasionally or even frequently enjoyed your own company and wanted to listen to phonograph records by yourself or on impulse even hopped the Number 8 bus to downtown Elizabeth New Jersey where there were no fewer than four different movie theaters on the same block from which to choose a really big deal at the time. I didn't find this movie dated at all. Not only does it offer a glimpse of what life was like in the 1950's which should have some historical significance to younger folks today but its message regarding the enslaving circumstances of rigid social conformity is ageless. Although it is obviously a stage adaptation praise goes to director Vincente Minnelli for so vividly bringing it to the wide screen. The three leads Deborah Kerr John Kerr no relation and Leif Erickson who all revived their original Broadway roles were exceptional. I also loved the scene when Al Daryl Hickman Tom's socially pressured roommate attempts to provide Tom with tips on how to appear more manly to the world. Norma Crane who wonderfully played Golde in the film version of Fiddler on the Roof perfectly portrayed a very unsympathetic if not nasty Ellie Martin. Ironically Edward Andrews depicted Tom's demanding father as anything but manly perhaps intentionally. Be as I say Tommy not as I am. While Tom at first appeared to be the focus of the film the stories of Laura and Bill Reynolds the dorm house parents slowly begin to overshadow Tom's miserable situation. This amounted to some excellent work by screenplay writer Robert Anderson who also wrote firstrate scripts for The Nun's Story The Sand Pebbles and I Never Sang For My Father. And what is Bill Reynolds doing at the end of the movie? Listening to phonograph records by himself. Heaven's to Betsy! What's the matter with him? My only criticism is that it ran a bit long and could have been reduced in length without losing its powerful impact.".

Tom's sexual orientation had been blurred down to the question of whether he was a regular guy or not. Key speeches like Laura's challenge to Bill's sexuality were missing.

The film is hard to watch because it is so overwrought. That is easier to understand when you know that all three leads are reprising their stage roles. Even so there is a desperate tension running right through it. With the possible exception of the faculty wives not a single person in it is comfortable with their sexuality. The guys are without exception overanxious to prove something and Laura is frustrated. Ellie Martin at least knows what she wants  a radio that works  and what she wants to pay to get it. Overlaid on this nothing can be explicit everyone talks all the time in circumlocutions. Of course that was the rule in films of those days and possibly real life as well. Therein lies a contradiction that can only be resolved from outside the film and in its future now. The film was trying to liberate people like me and heterosexual nonconformists while staying within the confines of a deeply closetted and homophobic film industry.Should you see this film? As a piece of gay history perhaps. As a commentary on a homophobic time it is instructive both for what it says and doesn't say. As a worthwhile drama that will involve you in its issues no. Has it anything worthwhile to say as someone says above about the importance of love?

	schema:headline " This is my first affair so please be kind";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoliers Coming of age movie with the stately and beautiful Deboarh Karr Laura Reynolds as the ignored and frustrated wife of heman and collage athletic director Bill Reynolds Leif Erickson. Laura's concern for young 18 yearold collage freshman Tom Lee John Karr leads to her bringing him out of his shell and making Tom see that love can be sweet tender and touchings. Not the hell that he's been taught by his hard driving and insensitive father Herb Lee Edward Andrews and the collage students who feel that being a man is judged by how many women one seduces and beds down.With an added prologue and epilogue inserted into the movie having Tom get married that was needed to get the green light by the Hollywood watchdog Hayes Commission after his stay in collage. Tea and Sympathy is a heart rendering story about a young man trying to fit into the 1950's postWWII mans society by going so far as almost killing himself. After he's made to look like a complete fool in trying to make it with a the local town fast  easy girl Ellie Martin Norma Crane. An affair that ended up with him being kicked out of collage.Having grown up without a mother and domineering father Tom was influenced by the house maid who taught the young boy cooking sewing and listening to folk music on the radio and phonograph player. Mr. Lee wanting to make a Man out of his son Tom had him accepted into his alma mater Clinton Collage and put under the tutelage of his old friend and classmate Bill Reynolds who's in charge of mens athletics.Excelling in tennis which is considered by the students Clinton seems to be an allmale collage as a sissy sport Tom is also very apt in sewing gardening and other womens activities that has him become the butt of everyones jokes. Tom is also singled out for special and humiliating treatment by the students that has Bill's wife Laura go out of her way to help Tom overcome his shyness with women that's the root cause of all these degrading actions against him.Laura who lost her first husband John he was 18 when he was killed in action in the Second World War sees in Tom what she saw in John a scared little boy who's being driven to destruction by his abusive and bullying fellow students. Like her husband was driven to lose his life by trying to be a hero to prove himself to his comrades on the battlefield that he was a real man.Bill is just as bad as the students who constantly abuse Tom by not only letting it happen but by encouraging then to do it. It's also evident that Bill is hiding his lack of being a husband to Laura by going out with the boys in sporting events and on mountain climbing trips every chance he gets. Leaving Laura alone and without male companionship for weeks at a time.Laura and Tom slowly gravitate to each other seeking out the love and understanding that they don't get from those their so dearly dependent on. That leads to the sparks between them that ends with Tom showing his affection towards Laura and she toward him that he kept hidden deep inside of him for almost the entire movie.Even with the script heavily censored Tea and Sympathy still grabs you and doesn't let go as Tom is almost brought to a nervous breakdown much less suicide by the treatment he receives in the film. In him trying to prove to himself and the students who so brutally and unmercifully pester him in that he's not unworthy of being a member of their fraternity. It's Laura who's kindness and understanding that in the end when Tom is at his lowest point mentally and emotionally  brings the best out of him but leads to the Reynolds splitting up never to see each other again.It's hard to sit through Tea and Sympathy without your heart swelling up and skipping a beat or two. With a tender and sensitive performance by Deborah Karr as Laura Reynolds and John Karr's portrayal of the confused and introverted Tom Lee. The movie was a landmark in films of the post WWII era in showing a leading man more in tuned and accepting and not being embarrassed by his deepest and most inner feelings. Then falsely trying to prove himself like Bill Reynolds did with his overly macho act in order to keep them from himself and those abound him.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spoliers Coming of age movie with the stately and beautiful Deboarh Karr Laura Reynolds as the ignored and frustrated wife of heman and collage athletic director Bill Reynolds Leif Erickson. Laura's concern for young 18 yearold collage freshman Tom Lee John Karr leads to her bringing him out of his shell and making Tom see that love can be sweet tender and touchings. Not the hell that he's been taught by his hard driving and insensitive father Herb Lee Edward Andrews and the collage students who feel that being a man is judged by how many women one seduces and beds down.With an added prologue and epilogue inserted into the movie having Tom get married that was needed to get the green light by the Hollywood watchdog Hayes Commission after his stay in collage. Tea and Sympathy is a heart rendering story about a young man trying to fit into the 1950's postWWII mans society by going so far as almost killing himself. After he's made to look like a complete fool in trying to make it with a the local town fast  easy girl Ellie Martin Norma Crane. An affair that ended up with him being kicked out of collage.Having grown up without a mother and domineering father Tom was influenced by the house maid who taught the young boy cooking sewing and listening to folk music on the radio and phonograph player. Mr. Lee wanting to make a Man out of his son Tom had him accepted into his alma mater Clinton Collage and put under the tutelage of his old friend and classmate Bill Reynolds who's in charge of mens athletics.Excelling in tennis which is considered by the students Clinton seems to be an allmale collage as a sissy sport Tom is also very apt in sewing gardening and other womens activities that has him become the butt of everyones jokes. Tom is also singled out for special and humiliating treatment by the students that has Bill's wife Laura go out of her way to help Tom overcome his shyness with women that's the root cause of all these degrading actions against him.Laura who lost her first husband John he was 18 when he was killed in action in the Second World War sees in Tom what she saw in John a scared little boy who's being driven to destruction by his abusive and bullying fellow students. Like her husband was driven to lose his life by trying to be a hero to prove himself to his comrades on the battlefield that he was a real man.Bill is just as bad as the students who constantly abuse Tom by not only letting it happen but by encouraging then to do it. It's also evident that Bill is hiding his lack of being a husband to Laura by going out with the boys in sporting events and on mountain climbing trips every chance he gets. Leaving Laura alone and without male companionship for weeks at a time.Laura and Tom slowly gravitate to each other seeking out the love and understanding that they don't get from those their so dearly dependent on. That leads to the sparks between them that ends with Tom showing his affection towards Laura and she toward him that he kept hidden deep inside of him for almost the entire movie.Even with the script heavily censored Tea and Sympathy still grabs you and doesn't let go as Tom is almost brought to a nervous breakdown much less suicide by the treatment he receives in the film. In him trying to prove to himself and the students who so brutally and unmercifully pester him in that he's not unworthy of being a member of their fraternity. It's Laura who's kindness and understanding that in the end when Tom is at his lowest point mentally and emotionally  brings the best out of him but leads to the Reynolds splitting up never to see each other again.It's hard to sit through Tea and Sympathy without your heart swelling up and skipping a beat or two. With a tender and sensitive performance by Deborah Karr as Laura Reynolds and John Karr's portrayal of the confused and introverted Tom Lee. The movie was a landmark in films of the post WWII era in showing a leading man more in tuned and accepting and not being embarrassed by his deepest and most inner feelings. Then falsely trying to prove himself like Bill Reynolds did with his overly macho act in order to keep them from himself and those abound him.";

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently De Tweeling or The Twins has been based on a very popular Dutch novel. I'm not able to compare the movie with the book because I haven't read it yet but I can and will tell you something about this movie and how I feel about it.The movie starts in the 1920's when after the death of their parents the two twin sisters are separated at the age of six. One of them will stay in Germany where she'll have to work hard on her uncle's farm the other sister will live with her upper middle class Dutch aunt and uncle in Holland. For many years the girls try to contact each other but both families are able to intercept their letters and to make them believe that the other sister is dead. While they both grow older and the Second World War affects their lives in a very profound way both try to renew their bond several times but fail time after time because of different reasons. Only at the end of their lives they are able to forgive and forget...Even though the movie has its weaker moments overall this is some very nice and touching cinema. Especially the beginning and the end of the movie are hard to forget. And even though I'm not Dutch myself I'm from their 'little neighbor' in the South I could easily recognize the feelings between the Germans and the Dutch. I don't know if anybody has his or her doubts about that but the movie exactly shows it as it was during those days not that I experienced it myself I was born more than 30 years after the war.If you are looking for an alternative war movie than this is certainly something for you. By alternative I mean that you won't see any soldiers fighting or bombs exploding but you'll get an idea of how life was for the civilians who had to try to survive during the German occupation. Another reason why I call it alternative is because the movie does not only cover the small time period of 19381944 the period in which Europe was in the war. It tells the story between the 1920's and the present day. What might be a bit confusing from time to time is the fact that the actors constantly switch between German and Dutch especially at the end of the movie. Of course when you don't understand anything of both languages and have to read the subtitles you won't even notice. But anyway I must congratulate the Dutch with this movie as a Belgian this hurts a bit hahaha. With this one they have a nice movie they can be proud of. I give it a 7.510.".

It shows how the twin sisters that already didn't had any contact for years are driven further out of each other because of WW II. It doesn't only show the NaziGerman military perspective of war but also that of the German civilians and in a way helps you to understand why so many Germans supported the Nazi's in WW II. It's a shame that there are still some typical book elements present in the movie that I sure work fine in the book but not in the movie including the typical book ending I say no more..The acting is for especially Dutch standards pretty high. Jeroen Spitzenberger acts magnificent but of course also the German actors pull of very well.There are some excellent and impressive scene's. The movie doesn't show any gore or horror of WW II but focuses on the emotional effects of it on individuals and especially the twin sisters of course of which one grew up in the Netherlands and the other in Germany. It doesn't only show the effects of the relationship between the two during the war but also long after it.I even like it a bit better as The Pianist.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The central premise of separated twins growing up under different circumstances in different social circles has been explored in literature before for example in the novel Kronprinsarna 1972 by Swedish author Lars Ardelius but the novel Twins 1993 by Tessa de Loo has the added element of the Second World War and all the suffering that it entailed. The film follows the novel quite closely which has resulted in a richly layered drama in which nothing is as black and white as history may make us believe. The SSofficer is a reluctant soldier and a loving husband while the cultureloving Dutchman hiding Jews in his house is a reluctant hero and a petty man. Through the eyes of the twin sisters we are able to appreciate the war experience of German and Dutch people and understand how it drove people apart and how hard it was for them to reconcile. The attempts of the German sister to reach out to her twin even at a very advanced age make for some very moving drama that will leave no one indifferent.".

After the girls' father dies they are left alone at the mercy of relatives who separate them in an act of sheer cruelty. Lotte and Anna go through a lot in life not knowing at times about one another and spend most of their lives apart.Lotte fares better of the two sisters. She was a frail girl growing up and her relatives dote on her since they regard her as an invalid. Lotte writes to Anna letters during the first years of being apart but those letters are never sent. Anna on the other hand is made a slave practically as she is made to help in the family farm and is never given the opportunity to attend school until the kind priest discovers how she has been severely beaten.The other encounter of the sisters occur too late in life. Lotte who when first visits Anna at the place where she is employed as a maid by a wealthy Nazi sympathizer is appalled by the way Anna has turned out to be an anti Semite. This puts a barrier between them not to be broken until both are too old and too stubborn to recognize how wrong they both have been about the past. Their last reunion is a bitter experience especially for Anna who is in poor health.This excellent Dutch film directed by Ben Sombogaart is based on a novel by Tessa DeLoo which was published in this country as Twins gets a magnificent treatment in a lavish production that covers several decades. The action is set in Holland and in Germany.The basic reason for watching the film is the great acting the director got from Thekla Reutins and Nadja Uhl who are seen as the young Lotte and Anna. Both these young actresses are perfect as the twins in their youth. Ellen Vogel and Gudrum Okras on the other hand are also effective as the older sisters have a final confrontation at a spa where both have gone for cures.The film shows a talented director Ben Bombogaart doing an excellent job in this richly layered tale of sisterly love and missed opportunities.".

Anna on the other hand is made a slave practically as she is made to help in the family farm and is never given the opportunity to attend school until the kind priest discovers how she has been severely beaten.The other encounter of the sisters occur too late in life. Lotte who when first visits Anna at the place where she is employed as a maid by a wealthy Nazi sympathizer is appalled by the way Anna has turned out to be an anti Semite. This puts a barrier between them not to be broken until both are too old and too stubborn to recognize how wrong they both have been about the past. Their last reunion is a bitter experience especially for Anna who is in poor health.This excellent Dutch film directed by Ben Sombogaart is based on a novel by Tessa DeLoo which was published in this country as Twins gets a magnificent treatment in a lavish production that covers several decades. The action is set in Holland and in Germany.The basic reason for watching the film is the great acting the director got from Thekla Reutins and Nadja Uhl who are seen as the young Lotte and Anna. Both these young actresses are perfect as the twins in their youth. Ellen Vogel and Gudrum Okras on the other hand are also effective as the older sisters have a final confrontation at a spa where both have gone for cures.The film shows a talented director Ben Bombogaart doing an excellent job in this richly layered tale of sisterly love and missed opportunities.";

Although in vastly different settings both sisters are actively discouraged from contacting each other by letter 'for their own good' we are told. Mercifully Anna is eventually rescued from her cruel guardians and put into a school  an experience she has only been able to dream of up to that time. We follow the two sisters as they mature including the longawaited first reunion which is a happy moment.  With the advent of World War II however they find themselves in opposite camps.  Romantic attachments bring things to breaking point with memories of the joyful reunion all but forgotten. Little things like a handkerchief embroidered rather poorly by their mother play a healing role and the film ends with the twins still struggling for that final reconciliation in old age. Twin Sisters provides a valuable insight into the effect that national conflict can have on personal relationships.  It opens with a delightful musical score and gives us some pleasant European scenery from Netherlands and Luxembourg where the film was shot.    7.5 out of 10 from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "DE TWEELING TWIN SISTERS based on the highly successful novel by Tessa de Loo and adapted brilliantly for the screen by Marieke van der Pol is assuredly one of the most touching films to date about the strength of family bonds decimated by the horrors of WW II. Director Ben Sombogaart follows Dutch writer de Loo's lead in making this story about the differing fates of twin girls separated at the death of their parents more of a parallel tale than capitalizing on the grim reality of Hitler's influence. The result is a cinematically magnificent gently hued verismo style of film that succeeds even more in its impact than if it were constantly doused in the dark side of its subject.Germany 1920. Lotte Bamberg played by three actresses though a long life  child Julia Koopmans young woman Thekla Reuten and aged woman Ellen Vogel and Anna Bamberg child Sina Richardt young woman Nadja Uhl and aged woman Gudrun Okras are inseparable twins at age six living life to its fullest until suddenly both parents are gone and they are split up the consumptive Lotte goes to live with her upper class Dutch aunt in Holland and the healthy Anna remains in Germany with her poor uncle on a pig farm. Lotte lives a life of privilege recovers form tuberculosis studies German at University and sings Schumann 'Frauen Lieben und Leben' appropriately! accompanied by her soon to be husband David Jeroen Spitzenberger who happens to be Jewish. As the war threatens Hitler's invasion on Holland David is sent to Auschwitz and brokenhearted Lotte marries David's kind brother and has a child. Meanwhile Anna leads an abused life on the poor and filthy farm is beaten by her heinous uncle when she begins dating a young handsome Austrian Martin Roman Knizka and runs away to work as a maid. Martin believes in Socialism and joins Hitler's army and is killed.Throughout the years of separation each twin writes to the other but their guardians for varying reasons never mail the letters. Anna finally finds Lotte and they have a brief time together in Lotte's elegant surroundings. But when Anna observes German dinner guests berating Jews she flees. The two sisters find it difficult to separate the losses of their husbands Lotte blames Anna's siding with the Nazis as a cause of David's death. Anna defends Martin's role as one of idealism that had nothing to do with the genocide of the Jews. They part seemingly to never meet again. But as old women bedraggled Anna seeks out the elegant Lotte and the two come to understand their opposite opinions of what the war did to destroy their happiness.The entire cast is so fine that it is difficult to single any one actor out for distinction this is truly ensemble acting. Never pushing the story to the edge of saccharine or excess of war violence director Sombogaart keeps his focus on the dialogue between the sisters central embroidered with the opposing dichotomies of class and political commitment visceral but understated. The cinematography of Piotr Kukla and the radiant musical score by Fons Merkies are astonishingly effective. This is one of the powerful movies about the Holocaust from an entirely different stance  one that grabs you by the heart and holds on for the 135 minutes of the film...and beyond. In Dutch German and English with subtitles. Very Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1926 in Colony Germany the twin sisters Anna and Lotte Bamberg are separated after the death of their parents. Anna stays in Germany with her ignorant catholic uncle and aunt in their small property and Lotte with tuberculosis moves to Holland. Anna is not sent to school to work in the farm while Lotte is raised by an upper class family having good education. They do not have any contact with each other but near the World War II they meet each other. Later Anna marries a young SS officer while Lotte is engaged of a Jewish musician. Their lives follow different and opposite paths with the war.Based on the Dutch bestseller novel written by Tessa de Loo the Oscar nominated De Tweeling is a magnificent movie. The dramatic story of these twin sisters forced to a separation in their childhood and following parallel lives due to WWII is very sad but never corny. I felt very sorry for the suffered character of Anna and in the end I was very sad with this touching and sensitive movie.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1926 in Colony Germany the twin sisters Anna and Lotte Bamberg are separated after the death of their parents. Anna stays in Germany with her ignorant catholic uncle and aunt in their small property and Lotte with tuberculosis moves to Holland. Anna is not sent to school to work in the farm while Lotte is raised by an upper class family having good education. They do not have any contact with each other but near the World War II they meet each other. Later Anna marries a young SS officer while Lotte is engaged of a Jewish musician. Their lives follow different and opposite paths with the war.Based on the Dutch bestseller novel written by Tessa de Loo the Oscar nominated De Tweeling is a magnificent movie. The dramatic story of these twin sisters forced to a separation in their childhood and following parallel lives due to WWII is very sad but never corny. I felt very sorry for the suffered character of Anna and in the end I was very sad with this touching and sensitive movie. The direction and performance of this unknown cast is amazing and this movie is a mustsee. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Irms Gmeas Twin Sisters";

I haven't read the book since and I'm not some kind of purist heck I don't even remember the specifics of the book. At best that makes me as biased as someone who didn't read the book at all...or at worst it means that I'm not a 'purist'.Translating a book into film the visible medium there are so many stages at which it can go wrong. Luckily it didn't with this one. The casting is perfect. I especially liked how Lotte and Anna spoke believably broken German and Dutch. Not as it sometimes happens in American productions when they for instance speak Dutch and say it is German. This was very well done indeed and added to the films worth. What touches me most about De Tweeling though is the fact at heart that you get shaped partly by your environment. It is worked out very well in this film and my favorite part is that the film distances itself as does the book from pointing out one of the two sisters as 'the bad guy'. The film just shows the horror the desperation and the pain on the common man from both sides the aggressor and the wrongfully invaded. It is a truly great theme and it is one of the few films I guess in which you actually get to feel sympathy for the Germans or at least some of them. Maybe that is understandable. Maybe it is logic that most films portray the Germans as gruesome and despicable as quite a lot of them maybe were. But every once in a while a film comes along that shows us that they are human too that they suffered losses that German lives lost shatter German families as they shatter American Dutch Polish Jewish English and so on. This is one of those films. It strays from the clich which is what I liked about it as I did like Stalingrad 1993 and Die Brcke 1959.8 out of 10".

This is the only reason why I haven't rated it with a ten out of ten. The movie perfectly reflects the great and small drama's that certainly happened during the war and grasps the public's attention from beginning till the end.

They want to reach each other but the 'parents' make sure that does not happen.In the beginning of the movie we switch from 1926 to the present a couple of times. Two old ladies in a Spa meet. The Dutch one is called Lotte and doesn't want to speak with the German one Anna. What has happened? The movie shows us what happened. It is a sad story a beautiful story as well. It could have been a very true story.The lead actresses are great. Thekla Reuten and Nadja Uhl make sure that the sisters are lovely characters you will like both of them and you feel sorry for both of them. They play the sisters when they are around 25 years old. The little girls playing the twins when they are six years old are amazing and lovely too. As the old ladies they are very touching. It is just beautiful.With the perfect cast and its nice acting a fine direction a great cinematography and a very beautiful score this is one of the best Dutch films I have seen.

The film tells about twin sisters that love each other deeply separated by chance and war brought up in different countries that suddenly find themselves on opposing sides of a battling world. Their emotional distance grows on and on. At the end of the war second world war there's so much bitterness that their reconciliation seems difficult. This story as you see can be rendered in a very interesting way but as I said before there's something important missing. The relationship between the sisters as portrayed in the film lacks warmth. For instance their first meeting in the train station after so many years of separation could be really moving. It isn't it's just average. For real emotion in acting see Penelope Cruz in Non ti Muovere. And the relationship between Lotte and the Jewish pianist looks like a TV commercial selling whisky or cars. It's not convincing at all as a deep love relationship. Don't get me wrong. The acting is generally good but what about the chemistry? Still I think that this is a good film but it could have been so much better! Nadja Uhl playing young Anna gives the better performance of the film. She's more intense and if she finds a talented directorfor instance Almodovar she'll be able to shine.".

In fact the German Actors playing Anna and her Husband were far better actors and better looking than the Dutch ones playing Lotte and Davidjust a fact.It would get about a 7 if the PC filters were not needed as they are it gets a 5. Put some PC filters on and and give it time it is slow moving in the beginning. It will make you cry.

	schema:reviewBody "Recently a Dutch documentary was shown on Israeli television destroying the image of the Dutch as fierce resistance people saviors of their Jews and Dutch noncooperation with German authorities during WW2. For most Jewish people this came as quiet a shock because the image of the Dutch caring for its Jewish people was well established in the minds of Jews living in Israel and the U.S. Of course many were saved but a lot were betrayed also. Unlike say the Danish Jews. The novel and movie De Tweeling  Twin Sisters carefully builds the image the Dutch want to have of WW2 and themselves so it defines in a strange way its national identity.Two twin sisters are separated very young as their father dies. One ends up in an upper class family in Holland the other in a farming family in Germany. This setup is used to tell parallel story lines of events before during and after the war We have the Austrian soldier joining the SS a Jew going off to the concentration camps a Jewish family finding shelter for the war and razzias Polish forced laborers in Germany the Nazis overclichd but that fits the tone here. At some points the sisters meet again only to be separated by other events. The story is a framework around the last meeting the two sisters have telling the story of their lives.It moves unnecessarily slow and has a leisurely pace. The direction is straightforward and on the level of a TVmovie without much imagination. However there are moments of good storytelling as a new storyline is sometimes introduced without explaining too much e.g. Anna throwing away some baby cloths Lotte is married but we have to derive that ourselves.The acting is sometimes disappointing Especially Thekla Reuten as Lotte is unable to carry the movie having one of the lead roles this applies also to her male counterpart Jeroen Spitzenberger as David. Overall the German actors are somewhat better experienced than the Dutch ones.When seen as a simple WW2story De Tweeling is an average movie suitable for a large audience of all ages. But the book is more interesting as this is not the best adaptation from a novel.".

I a native German speaker watched the UK release which is the original German version with English subtitles.  The dialogue of this film is very funny and sharp it is quite different from contemporary funny English dialogue which usually goes for funny oneliners it has more in common with the humour you find in Oscar Wilde for example in The Importance of Being Earnest.  In other words the characters are constantly trying to literally outwit each other whilst keeping the conversation afloat.  This kind of dialogue is quite fashionable in certain parts of German culture but at least in Britain it has become fairly rare.  Consequently the translators had a difficult job on their hands.Occasionally my eyes wandered towards the subtitles to see what the translators did with the latest banter  and I was appalled with what I found.  Yes the translation was factually accurate i.e. the content of what was said was accurately translated but all the wit the sharpness the humour had gone.

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe Maybe Not' is one of the most odd movies I've ever seen.  I liked it.  I think I liked it because it is so completely different than all the American movies I'm used to seeing.  In the beginning the main character Axel decides to randomly have sex with some girl in the bathroom of his workplace.  A woman in the next stall recognizes the key chain that dropped from one of the fornicating couple's clothes.  She peeks over the stall to find her boyfriend of three years mindlessly humping another woman.  She kicks him out of their apartment and throughout the rest of the movie he struggles with where to live.  Initially he calls old girlfriends who all readily turn him away.  Then he ends up at a men's group' with a lot of gay guys.  After that he gets drunk at a party and goes home to sleep at one of their houses.  This is when the gender preference battle begins. A lot of stereotypes were defied in this movie and I found that extremely refreshing.  For example it is commonly thought in American society that gay men are promiscuous however in this movie no homosexual sex is shown. There is one mantoman kiss in the club and in another scene homosexual activity is inferred while watching slides but not directly shown on the screen.  There are however two comparatively graphic heterosexual scenes. Another stereotype defied was the effeminate gay men' stereotype.  The main gay character Norbert didn't act effeminate at all not even in drag. My favorite part of the movie however perpetuated and made fun of an existing stereotype  the stupid Stalloneloving straight guy.  The guys in the movie theater were very intriguing.  I thought they added welcome comic relief to an otherwise tense and dark movie.".

Norbert's rough boyfriend the incident with Axel and his former classmate and the rough boyfriend doing the girl in the bathtub while Axel stands frozen like a fly.. That scene was absolutely priceless.As for the casting Katja Riemann is not only beautiful as a goddess she's also an awesome actress. It's so surprising that she doesn't have the fame she deserves. Or maybe not considering how many copies of DVD's boring Hollywood movies sell... Each time the word gay comes up in this movie her gestures and facial expressions are outstandingly flawless. Even if you start watching the movie after the 40th minute and start from a scene with that word you'd perfectly understand she's sick of homosexuality. Joachim Krol and Til Schweiger are also performing great here. I actually thought Joachim Krol was gay in real life after watching the movie. Well I don't have any evidence about his sexuality but chances are he's not.My German is quite rusty and I still loved this movie. I'm sure I would like it even more if I understood the dialogues perfectly. So go and watch this movie and shoot me if you don't like it. A little note the main characters of this movie can be classified as eye candy. Katja Riemann is beautiful and Til Schweiger is handsome.

It is based on the comics by Ralf Knig and won big at the German Film Awards 20 years ago Feature Film Direction and lead actor for Joachim Krl. Maybe he got it over Schweiger as he played the much more likable character and for the epic wardrobe scene of course. For Riemann and Krl it was also the big breakthrough although the latter had been nominated previously already. And the biggest breakthrough it must have been for Til Schweiger under 30 and only known to Lindenstrae audiences at that point. The only reason Rufus Beck Waltraud or Armin Rohde did not win in the supporting category was probably as it did not exist.The movie has lots of dirty humor some of it obvious some of it not for example if his offer still stands. And there is other quotes for example about sleeping at his place that night im Ernst or im Bett. It's pretty impossible to translate accurately. Anyway there are drag queens and there are absolutely no taboos in terms of talk about male and female sexuality. And we get to see the two protagonists' naked butts. Schweiger plays a hetero male who just lost his girlfriend and dives into the gay scene more and more. He has nothing going on with them of course but they somehow see him as an object of desire. What I did not like was that the gays were displayed somewhat simple and dumb as they were obviously not realizing or did not want to realized that Schweiger's character wasn't even remotely interested. Of course right before they split he still managed to get his girlfriend pregnant. My favorite comedic parts were how she always enters when he seems in dubious homoerotic situations.Occasionally I found it confusing if Schweiger's character wasn't actually gay as the film sometimes tried to make us think that way but then randomly another woman entered the picture and the love life of Schweiger's character. Anyway as a whole I recommend watching this movie especially if you are interested in German cinema. I am not sure if it was good enough to deserved all the accolades it got but it is a fairly decent film and it was also a huge commercial success being among the three most lucrative films that year in Germany together with classics like Forrest Gump and The Lion King. Qualitywise I have to say however it is not on par with these two.".

I think I liked it because it is so completely different than all the American movies I'm used to seeing.  In the beginning the main character Axel decides to randomly have sex with some girl in the bathroom of his workplace.  A woman in the next stall recognizes the key chain that dropped from one of the fornicating couple's clothes.  She peeks over the stall to find her boyfriend of three years mindlessly humping another woman.  She kicks him out of their apartment and throughout the rest of the movie he struggles with where to live.  Initially he calls old girlfriends who all readily turn him away.  Then he ends up at a men's group' with a lot of gay guys.  After that he gets drunk at a party and goes home to sleep at one of their houses.  This is when the gender preference battle begins. A lot of stereotypes were defied in this movie and I found that extremely refreshing.  For example it is commonly thought in American society that gay men are promiscuous however in this movie no homosexual sex is shown. There is one mantoman kiss in the club and in another scene homosexual activity is inferred while watching slides but not directly shown on the screen.  There are however two comparatively graphic heterosexual scenes. Another stereotype defied was the effeminate gay men' stereotype.  The main gay character Norbert didn't act effeminate at all not even in drag. My favorite part of the movie however perpetuated and made fun of an existing stereotype  the stupid Stalloneloving straight guy.  The guys in the movie theater were very intriguing.  I thought they added welcome comic relief to an otherwise tense and dark movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is only one reason to watch this film sexy Til Schweiger. He has beauty and magnetism besides being an extraordinary young actor with subtlety understated power and depth. Unfortunately these qualities are all but lost in this heavyhanded comedy. It is beautifully shot but considering its comedic intent rather darkly so. The story and its underlying principles leave much to be desired. Handsome Axel Schweiger works in a 30'sstyle supper club presumably to remind us of the wacky social farces of that period. Any illusions on that score end however when he gallantly accompanies an inviting woman into the bathroom for a quickie. His girlfriend Doro in the next stall informs him that they're through. Axel is a very pretty boy but looking for a place to stay he is rebuffed with varying degrees of vehemence by former girlfriends all too familiar with his womanizing. Alas Axel's unfortunate coitus interruptus is the inauspicious high point of the movie with the opening credits barely over. Axel is adopted by a group of 'thoughtful' gay men in his hour of need. Norbert a middleaged nebbish gives him a place to stay in hopes that there is a 'maybe'. What ensues is a series of awkward and tasteless gags mostly involving Axel's discomfort being around gays. Stereotypes abound and no one comes off particularly well. The straight men are dorky unattractive and strangely mortified by the use of common euphemisms for breasts. The gay men are selfish unattractive and impossibly flamboyant in case we miss the point. Doro is shrill intolerant and controlling. Axel is shallow thoughtless and virtually monosyllabic but adorable .When Axel speaks of 'us normal men' we know where the film stands politically. The gay men appear in female attire much of the time but speak in caricatured bass voices in case we miss the point. Axel is deeply offended when cruised by a gay man in a gay disco especially surprising as he asked the man for a light and directions to the bathroom while hot sweaty and very sexy in a tight muscle shirt. 'Nuff said.The plot thickens  and so does the humor  when Doro finds that she is pregnant and decides to get Axel back. She finds him in her own bed with unsightly Norbert disturbingly naked in the middle of a very inept seduction. Despite this awkward reunion Axel and Doro get married. Axel unceremoniously drops Norbert because his wife is 'allergic to gays' .The downward spiral continues unabated. Norbert a strict vegetarian hooks up with a repellent and humorless butcher about whom the best one can say is that he has shaved every inch of his gross body. Axel cheats on Doro yet again with a woman whose animal stimulants put him a coma. We finally hit rock bottom when Doro is bitchslapped during one last bout of hysteria and goes into labor. This is funny?Til Schweiger is scrumptious eyecandy and looks stunning throughout the film in tight tshirts muscle shirts open shirts no shirt. Thank heavens for small mercies. But in one unfortunate aesthetic choice after another the odious older men appear in greater states of undress more often than the exquisite young man who makes this peculiar move worth watching. The ending has a nice feeling and suggests some reconciliation between Norbert and Axel. It's way too little too late.".

Norbert a strict vegetarian hooks up with a repellent and humorless butcher about whom the best one can say is that he has shaved every inch of his gross body. Axel cheats on Doro yet again with a woman whose animal stimulants put him a coma. We finally hit rock bottom when Doro is bitchslapped during one last bout of hysteria and goes into labor. This is funny?Til Schweiger is scrumptious eyecandy and looks stunning throughout the film in tight tshirts muscle shirts open shirts no shirt. Thank heavens for small mercies. But in one unfortunate aesthetic choice after another the odious older men appear in greater states of undress more often than the exquisite young man who makes this peculiar move worth watching. The ending has a nice feeling and suggests some reconciliation between Norbert and Axel. It's way too little too late.";

You would think they don't like to open old wounds but there isn't a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war. Perhaps it's a way of dealing with their past I don't know but you sure can't blame them of ignoring what happened. And it has to be said most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about Der Untergang or The Downfall as you might now it which are also very realistic.One of those movies is Rosenstrasse. It tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the USA at the present day. After Hannah's father died her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasn't been very religious before. She doesn't know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mother's troubled childhood Hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother's past.The fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising. For as far as I know there hasn't been another movie that deals with this subject. For those who didn't know this yet Being married to a socalled pure Aryian man or woman meant for many Jews that they weren't immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory. But it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives. How difficult it sometimes was for them during the Nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the Rosenstrasse...The acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didn't really do it for me and that's exactly the only part that you'll get to see in the trailer. Perhaps it's just me but I would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day. At least of the part that is situated in the USA because the part where Hannah goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother's past definitely works.If you are interested in everything that has something to do with the Second World War and if you aren't necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see. This isn't a movie in which you'll see any battles or gunfights but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of. I give it an 810.".

	schema:headline " A vibrant tapestry of love and courage";
	schema:reviewBody "In Rosenstrasse Margarethe von Trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage. The film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter and the story of German women who staged a protest on Rosenstrasse to free their Jewish husbands from certain extermination. In addition to the dramatization of historical events the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother. While Ms. von Trotta shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference she does not use it to excuse German society. Indeed she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination the wealthy artists and intellectuals of German high society went on about their lives and parties oblivious to the suffering.Rosenstrasse opens in New York as a Jewish widow Ruth Weinstein Jutta Lampe decides to sit Shiva a sevenday period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which Jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased. When her daughter Hannah Maria Schrader is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fianc Luis Fedja van Huet a nonJew Hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an Orthodox tradition that she previously rejected. When Ruth coldly rejects her cousin Hannah questions her and learns about a woman named Lena who took Ruth in as a child when the latter's mother was deported and murdered by the Nazis and she vows to find Lena and discover the secret of her mother's past.Her quest takes her to Berlin where she finds Lena Doris Schade now ninety years old and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the Holocaust. With unfailing memory Lena tells her story of how as a young 33year old woman Katja Reimann she searched for her husband Jewish pianist Fabian Israel Fischer Martin Feifel who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given Jews in mixed marriages. Lena in a radiant performance by Reimann discovers that her husband and other Jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the Rosenstrasse.Standing together in the freezing night German women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting Give us back our husbands.

	onyx:emotionText "In Rosenstrasse Margarethe von Trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage. The film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter and the story of German women who staged a protest on Rosenstrasse to free their Jewish husbands from certain extermination. In addition to the dramatization of historical events the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother. While Ms. von Trotta shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference she does not use it to excuse German society. Indeed she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination the wealthy artists and intellectuals of German high society went on about their lives and parties oblivious to the suffering.Rosenstrasse opens in New York as a Jewish widow Ruth Weinstein Jutta Lampe decides to sit Shiva a sevenday period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which Jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased. When her daughter Hannah Maria Schrader is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fianc Luis Fedja van Huet a nonJew Hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an Orthodox tradition that she previously rejected. When Ruth coldly rejects her cousin Hannah questions her and learns about a woman named Lena who took Ruth in as a child when the latter's mother was deported and murdered by the Nazis and she vows to find Lena and discover the secret of her mother's past.Her quest takes her to Berlin where she finds Lena Doris Schade now ninety years old and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the Holocaust. With unfailing memory Lena tells her story of how as a young 33year old woman Katja Reimann she searched for her husband Jewish pianist Fabian Israel Fischer Martin Feifel who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given Jews in mixed marriages. Lena in a radiant performance by Reimann discovers that her husband and other Jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the Rosenstrasse.Standing together in the freezing night German women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting Give us back our husbands. Lena finds Ruth Svea Lohde a young girl whose mother is in the building. She takes care of her protecting her from the Gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed. Lena comes from an aristocratic German family and her brother recently returned from Stalingrad is a Wehrmacht officer. After being refused help from her father to free Fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow Officer I know what they do to the Jews. I saw it.

	schema:reviewBody "Most of the critics raved about this film from a cinematographic point of view but missed its major message.The viewing public thought the story line thin and contrived the characters shallow and undeveloped but they also missed the major message. The film is a first time public presentation of how a handful of unorganised Aryan women in 1943 held a spontaneous week long vigil outside the Jewish Community Center in Rosenstrasse in the heart of Berlin where their Jewish husbands were detained by the Nazis pending transportation to the extermination camps. Their demonstration eventually forced the Nazis to release the men.The film's major message was that the Nazi regime was conscious of public opinion and backed down when resisted on the extermination issue. Whilst the women of Rosenstrasse were the only public demonstration of such resistance inside Nazi Germany there were 2 notable acts of resistance to the Nazi's final solution. One was the refusal of Boris King of Nazi occupied Bulgaria to hand over Bulgaria's 50000 Jews to the Nazi Murder Machine claiming that they were too important to the wellbeing of the country and the other was by King Mohamed V of Morocco who answered the Vichy French demand to deport the 265000 strong ancient Jewish community by saying There are no Jews in my country only Moroccans!The ladies of Rosenstrasse also showed that the Nazis when challenged backed off  it is said that Goebbels himself ordered the rapid  release because he feared that if the story be publicised it would encourage further demonstrations against the extermination program.The film left me with the feeling that if the German people and the leaders of the states of occupied Europe had also protested many of the 6 million Jews and many millions of other minority groups could have been saved from the death camps. It reveals as a lie the claim  that ordinary people could do nothing against the Nazi regime   this for me is the film's most important message.".

	schema:reviewBody "Berlinborn in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer.  She has been described perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths.  Rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street.Cowriter von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II.The husband of Ruth Weinstein Jutta Lampe has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance Ruth not only sits shivah the Jews' weeklong mourning ritual but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith.  Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors.  Her Americanborn daughter Hannah Maria Schrader and her brother are a bit putoff by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in.  The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance a nonJew named Luis Fedja van Huet. A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting handsome Luis.  Stay tuned.A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin.  Hannah is intrigued  she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very very realistic.  I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the Holocaust.  Those days were simply not discussed.So Hannah having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing.  Were she not this would have been a very short film.  But Ruth pretending to be a historian locates 90 yearold Lena Fischer Doris Schade now a widow.  As the happytobeinterviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the wartime capital.The young Lena of 1943 Katja Riemann was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer Martin Feifel.  With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use Israel as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add Sarah to their namesincidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false Israel includedit simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation.While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps those married to Aryans were exempted.  For a time.  Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too most were men a minority were Jewish women married to nonJews.  The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity.The young Lena tries to locate her husband.  All she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse.  The crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them Jewloving whore being one appellation.  As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eightyearold Ruth who hid when her mother was seized remember Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan.  The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde.  Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men and a handful of women are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story.Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal.  Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murdered.The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well.The main actors are uniformly impressive.  Lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters  including the local police and military  as a oneway trip to oblivion. The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life.  Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen although the Times's critic appears not to know that.Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect.  A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive.  The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical toplevel Hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim copy and paste school of Teutonic nastiness.  But that's understandable.The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested.  Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably selfinterested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent antiSemitism.  THAT'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular.  Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that preNazi endemic antiSemitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on.The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So a ray of light it was and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists.  And always will.910".

The details are given in an addendum that follows this review.The film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in New York City in the present. Here a well off nonobservant Jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. She goes even further demanding that her daughter's nonJewish fianc leave the house.The distressed daughter Hannah Maria Schrader then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during WWII in Berlin her mother then 8 years old had been taken in and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything goes to Berlin and finds this woman Lena Fischer now 90. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story.

While scenes in the present are color saturated the 1943 scenes are washed out strong on bluegray tones.The quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta New German Cinema's most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress.The story of the protest is told simply. Only one feature is lacking that would have helped stilltext notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at Rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive.Rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics. Overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual raps. It is too long. But I found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction.The very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed. You keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute. The somberness of the film stayed with me afterward. I awoke often later in the night I saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film. For me that happens rarely. In German and English.

The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction. Adapted from an article posted at the University of South Florida website A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust.";

	schema:reviewBody "Goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored. In the aftermath of Stalingrad the Reich had decided to go for 'total war'. This is referred to in the film. Part of this was to use women in the war effort which Germany had not previously done to any great extent. An SS massacre of women would have faced Goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportion. His preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible on the basis that the Jewish men could always be rounded up later. I understand the majority survived the war.His other problem was that the 'Red' Berlin had never been very enthusiastically behind the Nazi cause and had to be handled cautiously. Again a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city.It was interesting that the majority of SS uniforms showed patches which indicated that the men wearing them were not of German nationality but were from German origins in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia".

Although this may have seemed implied it was not the intent. Von Trotta told me so herself! And she is a very nice lady by the way!Secondly the timeframe of events was in fact historically accurate the actual dates are shown on the closeup of the memorial and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film. There is evidence showing that Goebbels was annoyed about having done this and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free.Overall what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much 'overmovied' era. It seems a shame that it has taken such a long time for various reasons for this film to hit our screens.More of the same please Margarethe!".

	schema:headline " Film remembers a small but important event in history";
	schema:reviewBody "This isn't another searing look at the Holocaust but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in Berlin and some of the people that were involved. This film starts in the present time in New York City where Ruth Weinstein Jutta Lampe is in mourning over the death of her husband and family members have all gathered to her side. Ruth's daughter Hannah Maria Schrader slowly learns that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer Doris Schade and so she travels to Germany and locates the 90 year old who tells her about the events on Rosenstrasse.SPOILER ALERTLena talks about Berlin in 1943 where the Gestapo would hold all the Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse Street even though they are supposed to have immunity for being married to Aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release. Eight year old Ruth Svea Lohde awaits for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go but she meets 33 year old Lena Katja Riemann who takes her in. Lena's husband Fabian Martin Feifel is also inside and eventually she tries to socialize with Nazi Officers to get them to do something.This film is directed by Margarethe von Trotta who is making her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in Europe. This is not one of those Nazi films where we view horrible acts of inhumanity to Jews although we do see some severe treatment being issued out but instead this is more of a retelling of a small event that meant life and death to the people involved. This film isn't trying to shock anyone or open the door to debates on the circumstances but what it simply wants to do is just shed a light on a small but true life event that occurred during an historical period. Part of the films strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine through especially by Riemann and young Lohde and it's always good to see Schrader Aimee  Jaguar in a pivotal role. This isn't a great film or something that's going to change your perspective on WWII but considering that innocent lives were put to death because of the events that took place I think that reason alone is important enough to retell this true story.".

Why not show other possible reasons for the mens' release such as the disaster that was Stalingrad or the Nazis' fear that the international press based in Berlin would find out about the protest.Also why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again?

As such it is a unique story and what's more is the only film about the Holocaust that I have ever seen that shows that there were GOOD Germans the helping family in Anne Frank for instance was Dutch who did NOT support the Nazis and in fact had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the Nazi regime at the risk of their very lives. The acting is great across the board the framing story in New York interesting and intricate the direction from Von Trotta masterful in every scene and the production values including the gorgeous cinematography outstanding. Of course the family in New York could be speaking German.  Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their familya common occurrence.  So that criticism is unwarranted.  To say more would spoil the experience.  The film is long but I did not look at my watch once.  I am hoping this film gets some distribution is North America for not only is this film a masterpiece but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the Germans because of their support of Hitler.

This is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling...How can Riemann know about the fate of the little girls mother and her interrogation for example?The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place.

The scene looks like it is set in the Twenties...Riemanns character is of course a talented pianist well she is even a Baroness! Wow. Her brother comes back from the Eastern Front he has received a Ritterkreuz which he is showing in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience. And he gained knowledge of massacres committed by Germans. He even made some photographs! And so it goes clich after clich is piling up and this is why the movie does not work.Basically von Trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie. And in the end its all very simple. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels into bed and  ta da!  everyone is free.

	schema:headline " Weak and ultimately silly";
	schema:reviewBody "This was disappointing. It started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar it fell flat. Maria Schrader's acting is dreadful never seeming to mean what she says or even knowing what she says until she says it. She showed no genuine emotion at all not for her beloved goy or her mother's story. When with Lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding which isn't much. The supposed parallel between Hannah's mixed romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clich as they come and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish. The climax of the protest was uninspiring and no matter what Lena had or had not done to influence the outcome she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time a haunted look an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark. It was very hard to care about any of them even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. Why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation whatever for that. If every reference to him was removed it wouldn't be noticed. A simple story made confusing by poor character development who was whose mother again?? weak acting and directing that made everyone look like they were acting. You could almost hear quiet on the set!.... I started thinking this was worthy of a 7 but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4 then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene. This was about as cold and sterile a movie as I have seen. A terrible waste of a good story.".

Maria Schrader's acting is dreadful never seeming to mean what she says or even knowing what she says until she says it. She showed no genuine emotion at all not for her beloved goy or her mother's story. When with Lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding which isn't much. The supposed parallel between Hannah's mixed romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clich as they come and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish. The climax of the protest was uninspiring and no matter what Lena had or had not done to influence the outcome she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time a haunted look an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark. It was very hard to care about any of them even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. Why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation whatever for that. If every reference to him was removed it wouldn't be noticed. A simple story made confusing by poor character development who was whose mother again?? weak acting and directing that made everyone look like they were acting. You could almost hear quiet on the set!.... I started thinking this was worthy of a 7 but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4 then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene. This was about as cold and sterile a movie as I have seen. A terrible waste of a good story.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rosenstrasse is a German film from almost 15 years ago written and directed by Margarethe von Trotta. It runs for an impressive over 2 hours and was written and directed by Margarethe von Trotta. Based on what I have seen from her I cannot understand why she is really acclaimed as a filmmaker here in Germany these days. Disapppointing and this adjective also applies to this film here. It is the epitome of a Maria Schrader movie. Seemingly emotional sometimes heartbreaking story beautiful sets and costumes but a story that never feel authentic or compelling at all. I may be a bit biased but I just don't see any acting talent in Schrader and it's a bit of a joke she is still getting lead roles in German films these days. Very limited actress and she is also the biggest weakness of the GoldenGlobe nominated Aimee  Jaguar.But back to this film here it tells us the story of a couple women whose men are taken away from them during the days of Nazi Germany. The colead is played by Katja Riemann who is better than Schrader which is obviously not difficult at all but also not particularly memorable. The worst moment of the film were probably the chanting We want our men back scenes from a couple German women. They were clearly intended as moving and significant but they seemed so amateurish and even cringeworthy. Apart from that the film is also way too long for its own good with many insignificant scenes. The story it tells offered the possibility of a good film but von Trotta certainly messed up with the script and the choice of Schrader playing the main character. A movie that is truly pretentious and empty and takes itself way too seriously. I do not recommend watching it. Thumbs down.".

They didn't want any one to know what they were doing hence they arrested the people in the dead of night. Unfortunately everyone else in the country was too frightened or too complacent to see that these women had exposed the Nazis for the lawless thugs that they were.";

Based on a truelife unsolvedcase from 1991 Han Kyung Bae Sol Kyung Gu plays a successful yet ruthless news anchor with a beautiful wife Kim Nam Joo and a nineyearold son. But suddenly his successful life comes crashing down when his son gets kidnapped. In the next 44 days the parents continuously receive calls from the kidnapper with instructions and requests for ransom. The police are determined to find the kidnapper but he effortlessly eludes capture not only is he a step ahead at every turn he seems to enjoy toying with the police in this catandmouse chase. As the kidnapper keeps walking free Kyung Bae becomes increasingly desperate and frustrated with the police as he knows time is running out for his child. This is an uncomfortable subject but the acting from the two leads is quite astonishing. And given the title of the movie we know the outcome of the case from the start. But that doesn't detract from the grip the film has on the viewer. Not surprisingly this film has been the highest grossing Korean film of 2007 to date. And wait for the end credits to hear the actual voice of the murderer. That's really chilling.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the Yuan Dynasty the Mongolian Empire with the descendants of Genghis Kan rules China. In this environment the poor Jinha Shin HyunJune is raised by his uncle that teaches him the secret martial art of the Bichun. The daughter of a concubine of the powerful General Taruga Hakcheol Kim Sullie Heeseon Kim is raised with him and they have a crush on each other. When her mother dies Sullie's father brings her to the Taruga House and she tells Jinha that she would wait for him. But the general promises her to the powerful Chinese lord Namgung Junkwang Jinyeong Jeong to increase his power with the alliance. When Jinha's uncle is lethally wounded by warriors that want to know the secrets of Bichun he discloses the Korean royal origins of Jinha. While traveling to meet Sullie Jimha befriends Junkwang without knowing that he is the man that will marry Sullie. Sooner Jinha is betrayed and almost dies along the years he fights against the Mongolian Empire. When he meets Sullie again years later she discloses a family secret to him.Bichunmoo is a movie with a promising beginning and wonderful art direction costumes and soundtrack unfortunately it is also too long with a confused screenplay and melodramatic like a soap opera. In a certain moment the story becomes messy with many betrayals and confused situations and it is hard to the viewer to know who is who. In 2000 Bichunmoo was the most expensive Korean movie ever made. My vote is six.Title Brazil Bichunmoo A Saga de um Guerreiro Bichunmoo the Saga of a Warrior".

Every few minutes a character will run off and do something stupid just to make the viewer sad. There is a gap of about 15 years in the middle of the film during which important things happen but the film just continues without explaining them.

The plot is high melodrama and equal parts Count of Monte Cristo and Romeo and Juliet. Fallen nobleman once had it all then he loses it all and takes revenge to get back all he has lost. Lots of people die in the process. None of the intricacy and complexity or much less than in CTHD. There's more fights and they're dazzlingly choreographed though sometimes the hero uses a move that could have come out of a Mortal Kombat game. I felt like walking out of the cinema halfway through so be warned especially when the melodrama heaps on and on in one highly obvious plot twist after another. But by the end it gets back on its feet and delivers both a touching love story and a dazzling swordplay film with equal ease.I didn't think it measured up but it grows on you with repeated viewings. Unlike the purely Chinese nature of CTHD BCM is fusion cuisine that has a score with 80s speedmetal and classical piano an entire CGI passage of seasons sequence complete with morphing techniques and bullettime slomos in a Chinese setting.Daring to say the least but not always effective. Overall still a nice way to pass two hours. In terms of war films comparing CTHD and BCM is like comparing The Thin Red Line  and Enemy at the Gates.".

I've watched Zatoichi Musa the Warrior and Sword in the Moon...they are all fantastic movies but this one maybe because it was one of the first I've seen was always more appealing than many of it's pairs...The fighting scenes are intense fastpaced accompanied by great instrumental hard rock melodies that intensify even more the thrill of the action...the romantic story goes toe to toe against the most touching and sentimentalist love stories... All the actors are very good...If anyone out there missed this movie then give it a watch...you will love it...If you look for some other films with this kind of quality try Musa  The Warrior Sword in the Moon Warriors of Heaven and Earth Legend of Evil Lake Fighter in the Wind or even Gojoe and Zatoichi...Thank god there's more to movies than the crappy pictures that Hollywood delivers nowadays there are exceptions but globally...Give it a try...Asian MOVIES ROCK".

The movie is touching it has fantastic fights great soundtrack...resuming it's one of my favorite 5... I've watched Zatoichi Musa the Warrior and Sword in the Moon...they are all fantastic movies but this one maybe because it was one of the first I've seen was always more appealing than many of it's pairs...The fighting scenes are intense fastpaced accompanied by great instrumental hard rock melodies that intensify even more the thrill of the action...the romantic story goes toe to toe against the most touching and sentimentalist love stories... All the actors are very good...If anyone out there missed this movie then give it a watch...you will love it...If you look for some other films with this kind of quality try Musa  The Warrior Sword in the Moon Warriors of Heaven and Earth Legend of Evil Lake Fighter in the Wind or even Gojoe and Zatoichi...Thank god there's more to movies than the crappy pictures that Hollywood delivers nowadays there are exceptions but globally...Give it a try...Asian MOVIES ROCK";

Luckily for Jinha he and his 'uncle' have the only copy of the manual and they aren't sharing with anyone.Jinha is the only surviving member of the Yu family who were wiped out by the evil General Taruga and his men whilst searching for the book. He and his pretty childhood sweetheart Sullie want to get hitched but their plans go awry when Sullie is forced to leave the region by her father who just happens to be the same nasty warmongering general who slaughtered her boyfriend's mum and dad. She vows to meet Jinha every full moon but things go from bad to worse when Namgung Junkwang snigger! an influential aristocrat declares an interest in Sullie and gets the full backing of Taruga.When Jinha pitches up to meet Sullie he fights Junkwang but is shot down by Taruga's archers. He falls over a cliff into some water and is presumed dead. Of course he survives and after being nursed back to health by a friendly stranger he sets his sights on revenge.Bichunmoo is a Korean film with a distinctly Chinese feel to it. The fights utilise the wirefu techniques seen in many a Hong Kong and more recently Hollywood epic whilst the story does its best to capture the romantic melodrama seen in countless Wuxia Pian movies. However thanks to its complicated storyline overlong running time and difficult to follow fight scenes it is only a partially successful attempt. The look is right beautiful cinematography and a photogenic cast there are some nice gory moments arterial spray is always welcome in a film of this nature the music is great and the plot contains all of the necessary elements revenge death betrayal love but somehow it just doesn't quite gel as perfectly as one might hope.The MTVstyle editing during the action scenes is overdone resulting in a visual mess of flailing limbs blowing leaves and flapping cloth and the story meanders aimlessly at times making it hard to stay focused on events. But my major quibble is with Jinha's resurrection and subsequent reappearance as the leader of a team of mysterious assassins. Almost immediately after Jinha is pulled from the water and given a facepack! the story shoots forwards a decade Sullie has married Junkwang and has a son and Jinha is in charge of a small army of badass warriors. No explanation is given I believe that the film was edited heavily to reduce the running time from three hours to just under two but when the film suffers this much for it this is no excuse.With a tighter script and better handling of the action Bichunmoo could have been something special but as it stands I can only bring myself to give it 5 out of 10.".

Had I been in another mood when I saw it some of the love scenes might have been too much for me but I am not one to complain as they are well played. The whole thing about this movie is you know whats coming the doom is just hanging there but still you are in it for the ride and you love it nonetheless... But that is the lure of all great tragedies. The martial arts and swordplay are not the best I have seen but still top notch entertaining and kind of entrancing in dancelike way.

Kitsch stuff for kitsch people. Oh well. WoPing gave us the two Wong FeiHung with Jet Li that were at least visually outstanding so I may forgive the rest.Now since the success of bigbudget derivatives like Crouching tiger.. and Matrix a door was open and we have this invasion of mediocre and totally insipid asian fantasywireworks kungfu movies that neither have the comical appeal of some older stuff neither have the martial arts spirit nor have the visual gloss of stuff like CTHD or Matrix.With Bichunmoo we fall at the Sankukai level. How stupid can a movie get. Now if this childish disgusting style goes bigscreen with big budgets this means that there are people that actually buy this stuff. How appalling.

I went to see Bichunmoo yesterday with a friend and frankly it had been a long time since I last saw such bad moviemaking.Not a single good thing can be said about this film excluding the involuntarily laughable moments there are lots of these. Acting is terrible. Music is horrible I'm not sure but I think they even stole a piece from LOTR's soundtrack in one of the scenes it varies from very uninspired pretendedly romantic scores in the unbearable love scenes to absurd technotrash pieces during the fight scenes. As for the scenery some scenes take place so obviously in a stage that any remote chance of your getting involved in the plot is mercilessly crushed.However the directing is probably the worst single thing about this film. Not only actors are very poorly directed but from time to time you realize that the director is trying to build a classy scene. One example is a scene in which images of a bride getting dressed for her wedding are interposed with images of a mud cover being removed from the hero's face. The idea itself is not very brilliant but the way it's carried out specially the ludicrously fast pace of the scene makes you think the director was probably on drugs for the most part of the production. Not to talk about the transitions from scene to scene... very often the characters simply run into each other in the middle of a forest. I suppose it was a very small forest. One last example to close this chapter at one moment during the film there is a 10year leap forward in time. Well there's not even a small transition scene to hint this has happened and the characters keep looking the same... How do you know 10 years have passed then? You can certainly expect no help on the side of the director.Atrezzo and special effects also deserve a comment. Everything in this film looks very very fake from swords I was expecting Toys'r'us to be mentioned in the ending credits to specially blood. The way blood spurts out of some of the wounds in this film is something to be seen. And also funny how although the action is supposed to span along several years it's always midautumn and the ground is permanently covered with fallen leaves. Oh from time to time you can see the synthetic floor tiles under the leaves.I would like to comment on the plot a bit. The plot itself if you read a summary and although far from original is not too bad. A good production crew with good actors and a decent director could have made a neat movie out of it. But when you have an unoriginal soso base script it all comes down to the way you turn it into a film. And it's hard to imagine how it could have been done worse.All in all a very bad boring movie. If you like martial arts movies and think well at least the fighting might be entertaining abandon any hope. I do like martial arts movies and the fights in this one are so dull they only contribute to the general boredom. Run away from Bichunmoo you will only get a couple of laughs in scenes that are supposed to be dramatic and an unfair sense of hatred towards anything Korean.".

I think for a lot of WEsterners one martial arts movies looks like another and a lot of Westerners I know can't help but pretty much compare every period martial arts movie to CTHD now that CTHD has come out. It's like MTV kids comparing everything to THE MATRIX as if there had never been a movie made before THE MATRIX. Personally I don't see the resemblance. The movie is all right but confusing as heck. The villians pop up halfway through the movie without introduction and has nothing to do except scowl and look evil. Of course it doesn't help that the hero supposedly possesses incredible swords skills that he can literally explode bodies with a swipe. Now how the heck are you going to beat someone who can explode your body from a dozen yards away! The ending was well dumb and forced. Forget that the hero is invincible but the way they forced him to be weak just so the villian will have a chance I suppose is pretty stupid. Although I have to say the acting by the two leads were wonderful and they completely embodied their characters. The movie is very stylish and moody and the female lead makes me want to visit South Korea.Mind you that's not to say the movie isn't worth watching. The action scenes are very well done and as mentioned before it's a very stylish movie.".

I think for a lot of WEsterners one martial arts movies looks like another and a lot of Westerners I know can't help but pretty much compare every period martial arts movie to CTHD now that CTHD has come out. It's like MTV kids comparing everything to THE MATRIX as if there had never been a movie made before THE MATRIX. Personally I don't see the resemblance. The movie is all right but confusing as heck. The villians pop up halfway through the movie without introduction and has nothing to do except scowl and look evil. Of course it doesn't help that the hero supposedly possesses incredible swords skills that he can literally explode bodies with a swipe. Now how the heck are you going to beat someone who can explode your body from a dozen yards away! The ending was well dumb and forced. Forget that the hero is invincible but the way they forced him to be weak just so the villian will have a chance I suppose is pretty stupid. Although I have to say the acting by the two leads were wonderful and they completely embodied their characters. The movie is very stylish and moody and the female lead makes me want to visit South Korea.Mind you that's not to say the movie isn't worth watching. The action scenes are very well done and as mentioned before it's a very stylish movie.";

Bichunmoo may not have the same subtle undercurrent of emotion but it is still very well performed. The storyline is not the most original but with a few twists and turns that are Shakespearean to say the least. Some of the footage took my breath away and it continued to do so throughout the movie. In short it is definetly worth seeing should you have a penchant for swordplay and tragedy.".

As a whole though it has too many negative aspects to make it a truly entertaining movie.Director Kim Youngjun also helmed the later  and similarlythemed  LEGEND OF THE SHADOWLESS SWORD which I think has the edge over this film. Because the storyline in BICHUNMOO is just too muddled jumping all over the place with quick editing and failing to take the time to introduce all the new characters who keep appearing. Although it's a lengthy production it seems rushed throughout with frenzied action getting in the way of proper characterisation and depth to the narrative.The action isn't that great either. I didn't mind all the cool wirework and gravitydefying combat but what I did mind was the superfast editing which is almost as bad as shaky cam. The viewer has little time to register the cool death effects and awesome moves before it jumps to the next fight and the next after that. I think that action choreography and direction is a very fine art and it's easy to get it wrong sadly BICHUNMOO offers far from the best that the genre has to offer.

	schema:reviewBody "What kind of story would attract the acclaimed South Korean director Lee ChangDong's support and serving as a producer? So far he has only served as a producer of two films. He was even only an executive producer of his own work Secret Sunshine. I have to also mention that the film's French producer Laurent Lavol was the guest who I honorably hosted in the Taipei Film Festival in 2008. A Brand New Life is such a simple but moving film from the new French Korean filmmaker Ounie Lecomte. Based on her personal experience as a child she sincerely shares this poignant but very inspiring childhood memories to the audience around the world.Jinhee was taken out on a trip by her father. Her father bought a wide range of gifts they ate lots of delicious food and he even gave her a big cake but it all turned to a different direction once they set their feet into a children's monastery shelter. It turned out that Jinhee's life will never be the same ever since. This has a similar premise as the famous fairy tale The Little Princess by the British writer Frances Hodgson Burnett. Though we think that there would be another harsh supervisor and several kids who try to bully her here through Jinhee's eyes fortunately the reality is not entirely so tragic.The supervisor seems harsh but in fact she has a loving heart under her icy face the crippled sister who's the oldest among the children sadly took her fate after the unsuccessful struggle Sookhee is already an older child than most she seems capricious at first but she's very sympathetic underneath. She and Jinhee soon to become inseparable friends. But they still have total different perspectives toward the future. Sookhee who has watched many of the adopted children left wish that she would find a good home before she becomes too old so she tried her best to promote herself once she gets the chance. But Jinhee who's still waiting for her father to fulfill his promise and come back to pick her up but the wait seems to be increasingly long and increasingly remote.Lecomte showed her great talent in this film she wrote and directed for the first time. She presented the very personal story in a very modest and earthy way but it's even more effective and moving than letting the sentiments taking over. Take the part where Jinhee and Sookhee secretly took care of a dying bird after they found it as an example it simply conveys the profound meaning of the fine line between life and death. Kin Sae Ron who was casted as Jinhee successfully performed as the crucial key to make the film work whether it's the look when being helpless or the fake smile when she has learned to be sophisticated they are all hard to make the audience not be moved.After Sookhee was gone Jinhee who had hope once again in her heart had lost someone she could rely on. In the meantime she learned that her father and the family had moved to somewhere no one knows from the headmaster of the monastery. It was the first time in her life that she felt all alone and was left in helplessness and despair. but she eventually learned to face the difficulties of life with strengths. She quickly got a new hope that might become a turning point in her life with her adorable looks. When on her way towards the unknown destination the warmth when leaning on her father's back on the back seat of the bike suddenly appeared in her heart but it may only be deeply buried in the memory as the song she sang from her heart.".

Though we think that there would be another harsh supervisor and several kids who try to bully her here through Jinhee's eyes fortunately the reality is not entirely so tragic.The supervisor seems harsh but in fact she has a loving heart under her icy face the crippled sister who's the oldest among the children sadly took her fate after the unsuccessful struggle Sookhee is already an older child than most she seems capricious at first but she's very sympathetic underneath. She and Jinhee soon to become inseparable friends. But they still have total different perspectives toward the future. Sookhee who has watched many of the adopted children left wish that she would find a good home before she becomes too old so she tried her best to promote herself once she gets the chance. But Jinhee who's still waiting for her father to fulfill his promise and come back to pick her up but the wait seems to be increasingly long and increasingly remote.Lecomte showed her great talent in this film she wrote and directed for the first time. She presented the very personal story in a very modest and earthy way but it's even more effective and moving than letting the sentiments taking over. Take the part where Jinhee and Sookhee secretly took care of a dying bird after they found it as an example it simply conveys the profound meaning of the fine line between life and death. Kin Sae Ron who was casted as Jinhee successfully performed as the crucial key to make the film work whether it's the look when being helpless or the fake smile when she has learned to be sophisticated they are all hard to make the audience not be moved.After Sookhee was gone Jinhee who had hope once again in her heart had lost someone she could rely on. In the meantime she learned that her father and the family had moved to somewhere no one knows from the headmaster of the monastery. It was the first time in her life that she felt all alone and was left in helplessness and despair. but she eventually learned to face the difficulties of life with strengths. She quickly got a new hope that might become a turning point in her life with her adorable looks. When on her way towards the unknown destination the warmth when leaning on her father's back on the back seat of the bike suddenly appeared in her heart but it may only be deeply buried in the memory as the song she sang from her heart.";

	schema:reviewBody "Life can appear very strange when noone is there to explain it. Especially when you're a child and you have plenty of questions. This is a big question which started the day when a father with no explanations left his daughter at an orphanage. A Brand New Life takes its spectator to childhood  to a time when we asked many things and perhaps got no answers and no explanations why things happen exactly this way. Film is through and through seen from the eyes of a child but brought to it's richness with the help of a wonderful script and skillful camera allowing its spectator to put aside for a while his adult point of view and just observe and try to understand. This is the story of a little girl Jinhee played marvelously by Mademoiselle Sae Ron Kim. She poses questions but there never comes an honest answer why her life has turned out like this.A Brand New Life achieves a perfect harmony one element underlines the other one. The long takes allow the spectator to grasp how long the time in orphanage seemed for Jinhee the relatively small amounts of dialogs depicts the introvert child whose emotions break out through some furious actions. The gray tone palette which entours the setting of the orphanage shows very understandable the sadness of this place.Film touches not only an autobiographical story but the sad truth of life  we all know that there are thousands of places like this around the world. And there are thousands of children who perhaps have mastered this tragicomic show for the visitors the potential new families.In conclusion I'd like to say that this is a very daring film knowing that this was a true story and a true childhood perhaps lived through second by second as we see it on the screen. I must say that it's a brave choice to put a story like this on the screen. But its greatest value is the absence of a pathos and absence of a depiction the children as a victims of the cruelty of life. A Brand New Life is hope and search for the answers through and through it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Winner of the Best Asian Film Award at last year's Tokyo International Film Festival and screened out of competition at Cannes this year writerdirector Ounie Lecomte's debut feature film is a semiautobiographical tale of a young South Korean girl who got abandoned by her single dad to an orphanage where she yearns a life of normalcy still harbouring hopes that she'll be reunited with the only family she knows.One can imagine just how much reference from Lecomte's own life got written into the film. Being unable to speak Korean and has French as a first language herself Lecomte's tale follows the adventures of Jinhee Kim Sae Ron a precocious little girl who ends up in France which probably accounted for the director's own language skills or the lack thereof in her native tongue and throughout the story you'll find it pretty heartwrenching especially when Jinhee tries to resist blending into the scheme of things in the orphanage knowing that to go with the flow will mean to surrender all memory of her loved one and life as she knew to making herself appealing for a new foster family to pick her up for adoption.Thus beneath the exterior sweetness lies strong feelings of resentment and anger even being unable to fathom how her dad can give her up so that she can supposedly lead a better life in a foster home in the mid 70s Korea and likely one to be overseas given the kind of folks who drop by the orphanage to look for children to adopt. The story's episodic in nature as the orphanage serves as a temporary holding point in her life in between a giant leap of change and flits between how Jinhee finds every opportunity to resist change and how each time she embraces a little change through friendships forged her heart gets broken all over again.And having one's heart broken too many times probably doesn't bode well for a proper balanced development given that her trust with loved ones and friends got betrayed in the highest order. The gem and revelation of the film is the tour de force performance by Kim Sae Ron as Jinhee who almost singlehandedly lifts the film from start to finish giving an unbelievably strong performance for her age dealing with the range of positive and negative emotions like a seasoned veteran.You can't help but to fall in love with the little girl and share in her despair at being abandoned and weep a little with her when promises made become shattered. Casting Sae Ron is a stroke of brilliance as the actress' performance was key to make or break this film and thankfully she was the miracle to breathe life into what was a straightforward story dealing with human emotions nevermind the bleak landscape that spelt doom and gloom. This performance alone is well worth getting a ticket to the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest fears of childhood is being abandoned by your parents and left to face the world alone. In A Brand New Life winner of Best Asian Film Award at the Tokyo International Film Festival French director Ounie Lecomte recalls her childhood in South Korea with this sensitively rendered and touching story of a young girl who was left by her father in an allgirls Catholic orphanage to be placed for adoption. Set in Seoul in 1975 nineyearold Jinhee superbly performed by Kim Saerom does not suspect anything out of the ordinary after spending a day with her father Sol Kyunggu buying new clothes going out to dinner and taking a ride together on his bicycle.When Jinhee is suddenly dropped off the next day at an orphanage just after her father bought her a cake that she picked out she is bewildered but believes that her father will return to bring her home. Left to adjust to a strange new environment however she is full of anger. Though she is treated well by the nuns and the other children she refuses to comply with the rules and resists the requests of sister Bomo Park Myeongshin the woman who runs the orphanage. Refusing to speak eat or change clothes Jinhee pleads with the director Koo Oh Manseok to allow her to call her father but he is unable to find him. Planning to escape she spends the night outside in the cold.When she decides to return she begins to reluctantly accept that her father will not return and that she will sooner or later be placed for adoption perhaps with a family from another country. Fortunately she finds a friend in 11yearold Sookhee Park Doyeon a bright and outgoing girl who has learned to say the right things to prospective parents but often causes trouble with the nuns. The two girls practice English together play card games sneak extra pieces of cake for each other and care for a sick bird. Sookhee tells her that she has started to have her period but she must keep it a secret. They talk about another girl Yeshin Ko Ahsung who is depressed by a letter she receives from a boy Mun Hackjin that she has a crush on.Even though she is able to bond with Sookhee Jinhee remains distressed about the lies her father told her taking out her frustration by destroying Christmas dolls given to children as gifts and refusing to answer questions at a meeting with perspective parents. A Brand New Life involves the heart but refuses to pull out all the dramatic stops to ratchet up the tears. Though its theme is downbeat it is not a depressing film because the children are shown as having amazing strength and resilience. When each girl leaves with a new family and the remaining children sing Auld Lang Syne they are not just saying goodbye and lamenting the old times but designing a brand new life for their friend and voicing hope as well for their own future.".

And Son Rae Kim was just perfect for this role she is a very good actress for her age and is looking forward for her to make it in the movie business. The other children in the movie did a fine job as well. But I am just curious why a big time actor such as Kyunggu Sol played a very small part as Jinhee's father when anyone else could have done the role since it doesn't even show his face. This is the first movie I saw about children in the Korean orphanage and was well worth the time. It was sad watching the children in the movie struggling and doing there best to get adopted and to know the problem of many children ending up in the orphanages still goes on today.7.810".

It's the same old thing Two young friends are tragically split up because of an overly dominating father the girl goes through physicalmental hardships becoming a kisaeng while the boy trains to fight enemies and ultimately to meet back with his childhood friend. SPOILER END The first parts of the movie pathetically try to involve viewers emotionally by using children to enhance our pity for their tragic separation and grab the attentions of fightscene lovers by including a brutal battle scene. While these kept me interested in the shortterm I can't say the same about the rest of the film.Some good points What can I say about korean movie actors? Beautiful accurate and getstothepoint expressions. Although this film was Song HaeGyo's first movie she does an incredible job bringing up clear emotions according to the situation.The atmosphere was excellent almost throughout the whole film. Dark brutal and tense lighting keeps audiences suspenseful and wondering what terrible event will happen next. Very similar to Sympathy for Lady Vengeance The music is average as it doesn't include memorable scenemusic like Old Boy did but suited the situation alright.Overall in my opinion this movie used korean mustknow historic facts and famous actors to make people interested and to get them to watch it. This is not excellent but not a disaster either. You may enjoy it if you're a fan of tragic love stories but other than that nothing is special here. 510".

It's valuable for those who are interested in Korean culture and history.It is also good to know the story of the famous courtesan. Anyway apart from its visual values the film doesn't offer too much. The love story presented there isn't convincing at all actually it even sounds a bit illogical and therefore didn't move me at all. The story of their love was somehow neglected and not fully shown in the initial stage and then at the end the director focused on it and was apparently trying to make it touching and moving. The film seemed to have too many plot lines none of them fully developed so actually it was neither a good love story nor a proper biographical or historical film plus it was a bit boring. All in all it's not a bad idea to watch it just to admire traditional clothes music and beautiful actresses but if you are looking for something ambitious and really interesting you may be disappointed.".

I wanted to get a hold on the storyline and a feel for the character before seeing this movie so i watched the drama. it was absolutely brilliant. the main girl in there Ha Ji Won was excellent she had this proudness about her that was either endearing or dislikable but to me she was such a likable charactereven if she wasn't lovable and the dancing was so beautiful especially the sword dance and the calling for justice dance she did to save her lover.with that feeling i went into the movie i knew from the forgo that the movie would be different would have different feel and the character would be different too. but i never expected to not like Hwang Jin Yi or find her a bore.But i did she was so utterly boring and the director tried way to hard for the viewers to feel sorry for Hwang's situation that it really ruined it for me. one of the reason the drama was so good was that Hwang in the drama was never portrayed to be a sympathetic character the path she tread was the one she had chosen she had no one to blame but herself she never asked for our sympathy and we don't feel the need to give it to her.the movie's Hwang was the total opposite we see her as being forced into the situation taking crap from people and being betrayed by her best friend then abandoned by him. all the makings for a sympathetic character but although i did feel sorry for her as would anyone with a bit of compassion in them but felt like a cheap shot. and i was left feeling like I'm been forced into the feeling.what really did me in the most was the fact that Hwang was suppose to be renowned for her beauty intelligence and artistic nature in both drawing and dancing the movie only portrayed her as a beauty with some brains there was any particular scene that made us go 'wow she's so smart' and the most damming of them all no dancing.the worst thing this movie did was being unmemorable it was such a shame as i expected it to be much better.if anyone has the chance skip this movie and watch the series but if you want to watch both then watch the movie first there is no way you can stand this movie if you've already seen the drama. one of the stupidest thing i did was go watch the drama first.".

The events are traumatic to be sure and one is set to wonder about the plight of so many women even less fortunate than Oknyo. The overwhelming feeling is that a woman's emotional core has been gutted and spread out for all to see it's more wrenching than many a blood and guts actioner. It lacks the distance of his later masterpieces like Sopyonje and Festival  both equally tragic.".

Just as people have been judged for centuries by the color of their skin Gattaca predicts that in the future there will be a more subtle discrimination. It being a science fiction film helps make it more effective by allowing us to feel the emotions of the characters with little of our own history getting in the way. A haunting musical score goes well with the feeling of the film.Ethan Hawke as Vincent does a fine job showing the pain of someone whose life is limited before he even tries. But just as interesting were the supposedly superior characters Vincent's girlfriend brother and double who suffer from the lie that genetics can perfectly predict a person's life.The film that Gattaca most reminds me of is Blade Runner. They are both about genetic engineering gone very wrong but Gattaca takes a very different approach. The problems are more subtle in Gattaca involving our own desires for success for ourselves and through our children. Amazingly Gattaca is a good science fiction film with a small budget few special effects and mostly filmed in existing modern buildings.After seeing this film for a second time I liked it even better as the plot seemed more plausible. If you would like to see a scifi film that is based on interesting characters and situations and not explosions or special effects try Gattaca.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is no gene for the human spirit. This is the TAG line of the movie Gattaca a film that searches deep within the heart of man. This is one of Ethan Hawke's strongest performances as a man who refuses to trust the odds and relies on fate and sheer will to achieve his dreams. He borrows the body of a man without dreams played by Jude Law in his best performance to date as well. Law simply captures every scene with his sly intelligence and deeply darkened soul. He has no illusions about life or himself and he is the perfect counterpoint to Hawke's unrelenting dreamer.The performances only enhance however a wonderful script by first time writerdirector Andrew Niccol. It deals with science fiction and the future in the best way by exploring ideas. He quickly and easily presents a future not unimaginable and truly existing in a nottoodistant future. Genetic engineering is happening today all the time in areas outside the human species and sometimes within. How long will it take before the gloves are taken off and science truly starts to decide the type of people humanity will become? What issues will be addressed when that time comes? Niccol addresses many of them already mostly dealing with the discrimination that would probably take place in society. The most subtle and yet important question he asks though is whether a man is truly the sum of his genes or could his spirit somehow carry him beyond all expectations? Such thoughts are dealt with through intelligent characters given intelligent diolague and placed with intelligent situations. It is interesting how such a thoughtful picture can be at time a real thriller to watch as well.Gattaca is one of my favorite movies because it is not afraid to address important issues that are truly current in modern day society and do it with great thought and heart. It wisely stresses the subtle theological questions of whether man ought to tamper with God's work and whether the result would be a better society or a better humanity.".

The script is very multileveled and will not disappoint anyone unless they are looking for Hollywood style sex and violence scenes.Another great quality of this movie behind its thought provoking script is that it is very timeless. It could have been written for a century ago or for a couple centuries from now and it would still fit in with minor technological changes.This film was really an excellent film whether you look at the cast which was very well composed or the cinematography which was breathtaking. When the movie is finished the script leaves you thinking and your mind races on different tangents for a long while after the movie is over.

I've never been more inspired by any movie. This is an absolutely beautiful piece of art from the scenery the colours everything. Ethan Hawke is fast becoming one of my favourite actors. His performance always lift me up. I know he almost play similar roles every time i'll like him to play a different role actually but in every movies he starred in Dead poet's society Great Expectations etc i found that i always cared for his character and his performances never failed to touch me. Jude law is amazing as Jerome Morrow I thought Uma thurman's character should be more developed but she's perfect as irene. 8 out of 10. There's no gene for the human spirit.".

Stop reading this review right now go watch it and come back when you're done!It was after my first viewing of the film that several little details dawned on me1 The term borrowed ladder is a utterlybrilliantlyconceived bit of future slang that carries a double meaning. I'm still amazed that the producers didn't make more of this. Instead they were content to leave this gem to be discovered by the thinking and missed by the vast masses. I was very definitely impressed. 2 As I was explaining the film to my wife it occurred to me in midexplanation that this is really a film that has to do with what is properly called eugenics one of the things the Nazis were about. Then my mind wandered to word etymologies I recalled that the name Eugene  well born. And then I realized...!!!3 It's interesting the extent to which so many of the characters in the film didn't live up to their genetic destiny one way or another.4 Because I hadn't seen any previews I had no immediate reference for where the name Gattaca had come from. And then I suddenly realized...!!!5 It wasn't until I watched the movie the second time that I caught the effects with the title sequence letters...Now I had figured out by this time that there were likely to be other intriguing little details I've missed so I was fascinated to read from another reviewer here about the boy Vincent falling with a toy rocket in his hand. I wonder what else is in there?All in all this is a very well written tightly woven movie. Seen cold with no real prior knowledge of the film it came off as a tremendous sciencefiction SUSPENSE THRILLER. There were several scenes that just had me climbing the walls with tension. Fabulous job!And I'm not the only one who thinks so. When my WIFE says she wants to see a SCIENCE FICTION movie for the SECOND TIME... well I don't think THAT has EVER happened before!".

	schema:reviewBody "Gattaca 1997An interesting concept with terrific set design and some headliner talent. Overall the plot dragged and in a way once you got the idea it started to flatline as if the variables of what might happen were limited. In fact some of the outcomes were almost laughable because they were trying so hard to pull some heartstrings and wrap the thing up in a storytelling way. The parallels of the liftoff and the incineration so calmly done and the second swimming contest at night are both ludicrous if only because they are so heavyhanded.Not that there aren't interesting aspects all along. It's not a boring movie just stretched thin. It lacks atmosphere the way Solaris 2002 or 2001 1968 have atmosphere but it is paced in the same deliberate way almost. Not that it intends such weighty philosophical poetry. No Gattaca is a sort of reach for the stars movie out to remind us that humans are the best flaws are part of perfection and romance only goes so far. Ethan Hawkes is fine in this and so is Uma Thurman but since everyone is supposed to be a bit machinelike we can't expect highly emotional performances even when they are making love not shown. Alan Arkin certainly gets the postmodern detective award wearing a long coat and bowler inside at all times as all detectives should and he's clever but not quite clever enough to solve the crime. Other minor characters including Jude Law do their best to fill in the chinks of a very calculated effect.In a way this made me think of the LawPaltrow extravaganza Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow2004 not for any visual similarity but just for the sense of an artificial future and an awkward love affair in the midst of it and if neither movie is great exactly both are really interesting and fun. But Gattaca by comparison is so intent on dulling the comic book aspects that are a little bit at play in favor of the sterile future that may or may not ever happen it chills the whole experience. We can't quite take it all serious there will never be a number to our heartbeats before we die nor a way to know when that number would be counted so why not push it into something more fanciful surreal fun or just futuristic. Never mind reality.All that said scifi fans should love this overall if the idea is what counts most. DNA manipulation and screening our progeny before birth is presented as a weirdly normal activity a little cold for sure but nothing immoral. The idea of just having sex and being in love and letting it all fly take what the roll of the dice gives you is presented as a model of the perfect life which is what most of us do of course...until the end when it slips a little back into boyhood dreams come true for those who persist and cheat and are really really pretty and selfish.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a thinking person's film. Do not bother with it if you are looking for typical sci fi special effects action and fastpace.I would especially recommend Gattaca to anybody who has been turned off to the genre of science fiction by the plotheavy superficial trash Hollywood so frequently places under that label. This is a film which uses the power of the sci fi genre to great effect.Gattaca is one of those movies which is better read than viewed as a film. It is a very cleverly contrived work of dystopian fiction based on the simple premise of a future society where a person's entire life is basically assigned through their genetics. Though the future tense is implied in this film I prefer to see it as more of a speculation on what might have happened if real world imperialcolonial powers of the early to mid20th century had fully carried out their fledgling eugenics programs to a logical extreme. In the world of Gattaca what you are allowed to do where you are permitted to live and how are all determined by your genes which are sampled almost constantly  about as many times as we are asked to show some form of ID daily.Uma Thurmond Ethan Hawke and Jude Law lend powerful performances to this film and the love that grows between them  forged in Hawke's struggle to maintain the pretense of genetic perfection he requires to fulfill his career ambitions to become an astronaut  allows the human story behind the scifi to saturate the film. Hawke's character though genetically flawed has one thing that many of the genetic elite of gattaca lack  strong motivation. Ultimately the film offers some very subtle simple and profound messages about the evils and injustices of ANY form of discrimination. It's a little disturbing however that nearly all of the genetic elite of this film were cast with white actors. The story also carries compelling messages about love and ambition. This is a work which I am convinced Ayn Rand would have enjoyed.From a technical and artistic point of view this film is pretty close to perfection. The film is beautifully shot and almost devoid of special effects. I remember a total of three explosions in this film perhaps this is an alltime low for recent Hollywood sci fi?  all of which were normal parts of rocket launches. Since this is not by any stretch of the imagination an actionoriented film there is no need for the typical scifi gimmagery. Some of the artistic choices are a little overthetop with symbolism  such as the anachronistic use of 1960s and 1970s sports cars. I think I understand this choice  as it emphasizes the fact that had things gone differently in our own history we could easily be living in a nightmare world like Gattaca today.To sum up if you enjoy a thoughtful film with a positive message  and don't mind a little discomfort along the way to that message Gattaca is a film you will enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gattaca is written and directed by Andrew Niccol. It stars Ethan Hawke Uma Thurman Jude Law Gore Vidal Loren Dean Xander Berkeley and Alan Arkin. Music is by Michael Nyman and cinematography by Slawomir Idziak. It's the near future and eugenics dominate a society where children are either valids reproductive through eugenics or invalids naturally birthed with inherent genetic flaws. One such invalid is Vincent Anton Freeman Hawke who plots an intricate scheme to assume a valid person's identification so as to reach his dreams of being an astronaut. There is no gene for fate. Biopunk future meets technoir in this thought provoking and intelligent piece of scifi. There is a decent argument to suggest that Gattaca is more style over character substance especially given that visually Niccol's movie is stunning. It's a near future world of genetic engineering where although discrimination is illegal perfection rules the day and the invalids are passed over for high grade employment. Identity inferiority and bigotry are fused together to offer up moral quandaries and ethical conundrums all set to an oppressive technoir backdrop painted by Idziak's deft choice of colour filters. There's a striking difference between the look of the Gattaca corporation compared to the rest of the outside world this helps to keep the thematics at work rich and potent. As a thriller it barely raises the pulse but this is deliberate as is the pacing by Niccol. This is an emotionally stunted world and the ethereal atmosphere hovers continually over proceedings. There's a romance in the mix between Hawke and Thurman which on the surface seems a token subplot and devoid of passion but again this feels deliberate lack of passion is actually the order of the day. Cast performances are well up to scratch with Law stealing the film as a one time valid ironically invalidated by an incident. And while we could have done with more from top performers Arkin as a copper attired like a classical film noir gumshoe and Elias Koteas as Vincent's father it rounds out as an impressively constructed picture. Provocative and brainy with visual pleasures unbound Gattaca has many attributes that reward still further on repeat viewings. 810".

Cast performances are well up to scratch with Law stealing the film as a one time valid ironically invalidated by an incident. And while we could have done with more from top performers Arkin as a copper attired like a classical film noir gumshoe and Elias Koteas as Vincent's father it rounds out as an impressively constructed picture. Provocative and brainy with visual pleasures unbound Gattaca has many attributes that reward still further on repeat viewings. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Gattaca earlier when it came out but I was probably too young andor drunk to appreciate it at the time. So I got the bluray and watched it again.What a quality film this is. Nevermind that the budget wasn't big everything is handled with care. Cinematography is top notch the script is coherent and clever at the same time the music is absolutely beautiful actors do a fine job the directing of Niccol keeps everything in check. I can't find significant flaws in this movie.This is not what people usually expect from SciFi movies today. This is not an action film in space. Gattaca is a science fiction movie as much as it is a drama with a little detective story hidden inside. Almost nothing is in your face since this movie doesn't make a huge deal out of every meaningful scene. It's not trying to force you to feel or think anything so the emotional reaction I got was only after the movie had ended. Only then it hit me and it hit me hard. And the music I have to compliment the score once again played inside my head for quite some time.The above is the main reason I appreciate this film a lot. Many will dislike it for the same reason. If you want something huge something with immediate impact something which is trying to impress you there's a chance you won't love this movie. I too admit that I would've wanted the story to be more gripping and intense but then again that certain subtlety is one of the strengths of this film. Nevertheless I recommend Gattaca to everyone. When you're in a calm ponderous or thoughtful state of mind watch this.Gattaca asks you important questions without forcing an ambiguous open ending. Niccol wrote and directed a quality movie and he will be remembered for it. Ethan Hawke Uma Thurman Jude Law Xander Berkeley and Alan Arkin were convincing in their roles and every actor did a fine job.Gattaca is a thoughtful humane story and a genuinely wellmade film. It already survived the test of time this far and it will continue to do so. Even if it seems a bit underwhelming there's a lot of love in it.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps the greatest scifi film of the 90's. Kubrick may have liked this one.";
	schema:reviewBody "Andrew Niccol began his feature film career as a director and writer with Gattaca 1997 which is very surprising science fiction? movie with all its feelings and important subject matters. Stuff like this unfortunately don't come too often from Hollywood and I think that Gattaca too wasn't very successful at the box office because stupid mainstream couldn't find anything interesting in it. Gattaca is set in the near future where DNA technology has developed so hugely that it is possible and advisable to manipulate the developing fetus and make it become as the parents and society wants. No fat guys no diseases no bald heads nothing leaved for destiny. All manipulated and all persons to become the same.This may not sound too interesting written like this but as a movie with the theme mentioned above this is fantastic and has also a thriller elements in it and thus the film is also extremely exciting in its suspense. The film studies what it is to be an individual. The strong element is that people should not tamper with God's work and Nature's creations as the results are always the same disappointment and destruction because human beings shouldmust not do things they are not allowed to do and things that they don't know. Human being has feelings and emotions and no one should not disturb them by making some changes physically to others. There is also that larger than life question that what waits us once we leave this world we live in. That is the point because people who believe in God know also that there is no way we can tamper His work or try to change something we don't know or even understand. These things are very philosophic and the more the viewer likes to think and use brains the more this little film unfolds. Everyone sees it in hisher own way and they who don't see anything in it don't understand cinema and have no ability to interpret it as an art form. Gattaca is eternal movie and the answers the film asks we may get once we experience the same thing as JeromeEugene Jude Law experiences at the end..This film shows what it is to be man and what it must no become. We are individuals no one is exactly like some other excluding nature's own creations like identical twins and that is the rule of the Nature. If science makes all the people same and alike what is the point to live in that kind of world? There are so many others and they are like youme so let them live and go on by the rules of life. It is no use to do this since some other may do it. Those who think that person can be manipulated and to become as wantedrequired don't understand that no one can manipulate the complex and personal brains in which the real personality lives. Or does someone believe that science can create many ultra wise soontobecome presidents or persons who will make many important inventions in the future? I think that science is able to remove something from brainspersonality but not ADD something there.Gattaca is very wise and contemplative film and deals with important themes of personality privacy happiness of being a human and having a personality friendship and living in our world and after it. Gattaca is also incredibly effective piece of cinema and very beautiful piece of art as Michael Nyman'n music is again gorgeous and photography totally stunning. The colors and over all use of camera is among the greatest I've ever seen. The colors are close to Dario Argento although Gattaca and Argento's work are very different! and this is a film I think Stanley Kubrick would have liked very intelligent and provoking and cinematically stunning at the same time. Like 2001 A Space Odyssey in other words.The actors are also great and give their finest. Uma Thurman is so sensual and talented in her role Jude Law is fantastic as unhappy person who doesn't think he fits in the society he is born to. Ethan Hawke plays the lead part as JeromeVincent who is born invalid as he has not been manipulated to perfection before birth unlike his brother. The actors are fantastic and do nothing wrong. We can feel exactly the same feelings the characters do and that is a sign of their talent. Gattaca is the kind of film that after the first viewing the viewer may have the feeling that it has to be seen immediately again. And that was the case with me I viewed this immediately again after I'd watched it for the first time. And this magic will last for several viewing times and the film will unfold more and more. It would have been fantastic to see this on big screen but it worked on television too.10 stars out of ten for this unique and brilliant masterpiece and hopefully the director can continue his personal line and avoid commercial productions at any cost. As highly recommended as possible but only for the fans of intelligent cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Gattaca' the 1997 scifi film has definitely done its part in adding to the culture of cult films around the world. Whether it's the disturbingly familiar futuresociety that the film depicts the ethical and moral nightmare scenarios that it entails or something subliminally appealing this piece of film found its audience and cemented its place in history.In the 'nottoodistant future' the world of genetics has expanded to previously unimaginable proportions wherein a person's entire life story can be told with just a drop of blood or a strand of hair. In this postgenetics world science has perfected the art of life children are no longer born biologically but rather their parents give their sperm and eggs to laboratories and they deliver the best child that can be produced from these genes. Children who were not conceived this way are referred to as invalids and society deems them accordingly. It's a whole new type of discrimination but one that Vincent Freeman Ethan Hawke is not willing to accept.Vincent is an invalid who has always had the dream of going into space. Refusing to accept his predetermined life Vincent consequently adopts the identity of another man whose genes make him 'valid'. Jerome Morrow Jude Law agrees to let Vincent have his identity if he will provide Jerome with a place to live. Using samples from Jerome's body disguised as his own blood urine hair Vincent becomes employed in the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation as Jerome Morrow and after many years in the job he is finally given the opportunity to go up into space on one of Gattaca's frequent launches.When the director of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation is murdered however investigations into the crime put into question Vincent's true identity and he soon finds that his long deception could be unraveled and his lifelong dream could be shot down in flames. With only fellow colleague Irene Uma Thurman and Jerome on his side Vincent must race against the powers that are trying to put him back into the social hole he was supposedly born into and put an end to the life he has worked so hard to build.The film has a very sorrowful approach to what sounds initially like a very lame plot. It's cinematic and stylistic without being pretentious or overdone and the way it is shot and put together reflects very well the film's bland and sterilized society in pursuit of perfection. The chilling sense of realism that goes with the world of Gattaca makes everything within it become more than just a strange concept in a science fiction film. Not unlike Spielberg's 'A.I.' Gattaca very cleverly draws from horrors within our society today to suggest the terrifying prospect that our science will eventually render us as a natural species obsolete.Director Andrew Niccol has done a fine job in transforming this scifi flick into something much deeper and more interesting. The writing is not spectacular but is still better than most. Hawke's narration provides very good atmosphere for the film as he talks about the way of the world in this eerie future and the film's theme is very secure with events such as the murder being practically irrelevant. The thing that matters most is Vincent's dream and the social inequalities that prevent him from actualizing it and this is made very clear from beginning to end.The acting performances are all very adequate but the standout ones are Ethan Hawke and Jude Law who seem so comfortable in their characters and truth be told share more chemistry than Hawke and Thurman do. This was one of Jude Law's first feature films and it is a remarkably impressive debut.Basically this is a film that says what it means. Even in a world that has successfully bred perfection people still suffer the system is still unjust and lives still go to waste. Far from just being an unrealistic portrayal of what the future will hold 'Gattaca' questions the ideals of mankind the principles of civilization and leaves us to wonder what we as a society are truly striving for.".

	schema:headline " Timeless and poetic exploration of issues of identity.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie does a number of ingenious and remarkable things  1. It makes the extraordinary  space exploration  seem completely routine in a way not accomplished since 2001 A Space Odyssey. But in total contrast to the latter instead of achieving this effect through the vivid portrayal of technology with engineering exactitude it does it by showing almost no technology whatsoever. Rather scenes of the completely anodyne. The astronauts wear business suits and work in an office.2. It creates a sense of timelessness by using almost featureless sets reminiscent of a classical play and paraphernalia recycled from other times  such as the cars and the backprojection displays . The feel of the film is in a very positive way reminiscent of Alphaville.3. It employs completely impractical technical devices in such an effective theatrical way as to render their impracticality irrelevant. For example it is possible to identify someone by a genetic fingerprint generated from a hair follicle  but not in itself a hair  or skin but such traces would not facilitate a breakdown of the persons genetic character as pretended here. These are two different orders of measurement. Indeed urine which features centrally in the plot is of no use on either account not being a body tissue in any case. Only the blood tests would facilitate both identification and genetic analysis as shown in the story. Yet in spite of knowing these things the use of such devices as a plucked hair in the story is made so poetically as to become effectively a perfect metaphor and so beyond criticism on grounds of mere realism. To me this seems almost unique. To do the wrong obviously yet aptly.4. The plot is so contrived as to convene three parallel stories into convergence Vincents story of course. But also the directors story which is oddly similar  his life's ambition in the flight of the mission can only be fulfilled by killing the man who would have axed it . As is that of the son of the biologist mentioned at the end.5. The movie actually achieves what most dramatic art strives for but fails to do the story resonates far beyond the limited scope of the dramatic enactment. Vincents dream and the challenges posed by society's prejudices is a story that is eternal and universal. As are other issues brought up sibling rivalry the straight way to a mediocre life as against the crooked yet heroic path toward a greater truth. Most profound is the way in which the paralysed Jerome actually becomes an immortal historical spacefarer Vincent destroying his mortal self to do so leaving as his legacy the realisations by the other man of his dreams. This is both incredibly ingenious and thought provoking creating a mood that lingers long after the credits roll. I doubt that vicariousness has ever before been made so realistic a possibility.The atmosphere mood and languid tempo yet with a sense of inevitability is greatly aided by Michael Nyman's score.This is one of the very few movies in which a narrator is entirely apt and not a mere convenience.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie does a number of ingenious and remarkable things  1. It makes the extraordinary  space exploration  seem completely routine in a way not accomplished since 2001 A Space Odyssey. But in total contrast to the latter instead of achieving this effect through the vivid portrayal of technology with engineering exactitude it does it by showing almost no technology whatsoever. Rather scenes of the completely anodyne. The astronauts wear business suits and work in an office.2. It creates a sense of timelessness by using almost featureless sets reminiscent of a classical play and paraphernalia recycled from other times  such as the cars and the backprojection displays . The feel of the film is in a very positive way reminiscent of Alphaville.3. It employs completely impractical technical devices in such an effective theatrical way as to render their impracticality irrelevant. For example it is possible to identify someone by a genetic fingerprint generated from a hair follicle  but not in itself a hair  or skin but such traces would not facilitate a breakdown of the persons genetic character as pretended here. These are two different orders of measurement. Indeed urine which features centrally in the plot is of no use on either account not being a body tissue in any case. Only the blood tests would facilitate both identification and genetic analysis as shown in the story. Yet in spite of knowing these things the use of such devices as a plucked hair in the story is made so poetically as to become effectively a perfect metaphor and so beyond criticism on grounds of mere realism.

The quality of the film is not described in big action scenes or special effects but in philosophical questions of our society. It shows that the discrimination of inferiors is a big role in our society. It make the viewer think about the perfection and the individuality of the humans. At the end you can say that this movie is more than a typical action film because it has a critical meaning in view of our society!".

One of the underclass Vincent dreams of working within Gattaca and making it into space. He combines with Jerome who was disabled in an accident to take his identity and live his live. Vincent takes his idenity and daily eradicates all proof of his own genetic makeup. However a murder within Gattaca reveals the presence of an invalid and the police begin their search for Vincent.This is a very intelligent look into the future where racism etc has been replaced by a bias formed around one's genetic makeup. This builds a twotier story around Vincent trying to pass off as a valid and around the murder investigation of the space programme's director. However to say that this story is just that is to ignore the layers of humanity that are looked at in the film. The real Jerome shows how elitist the valids are and how they look down on those below but he also shows how they are only human and have the same feelings fears etc. Vincent is the character we associate with  being excluded from society because of his genes he is the vision of persistence that we all want to be. We see his father design a second son with his own name and the background he experiences. We also signs of humanity all round and it is as much a look at present day racism etc as it is a futuristic scifi. The story around the murder investigation concludes with several twists that tie the two strands together  this takes the story of Vincent to another level and it is quite moving to watch.Ethan Hawk is really good here as is Jude Law. I found Uma Thurman a bit cold to watch and she was without much character but I assume that this was how she was meant to be . Alan Arkin is excellent as the I assume natural born detective who has to call a much younger man Sir because of his genes. The supporting cast is well filled out with strong actors including Elias Koteas Gore Vidal Ernest Bourgine and er Blair Underwood.Overall a moving intelligent scifi that is clever throughout. How many modern films can you say that about?".

I'd even suggest that this film would be excellent viewing for a high school ethics or English class with the topics in the film giving plenty of fodder for class discussion. An obvious point of course is how the direction of today's genetic sciences could be leading us dangerously to the brink of a new form of discrimination a society of genetic have's and have not's.  Research in genetics has and will continue to yield invaluable tools in fields such as medicine and criminology all to the benefit of humanity.  Like any science however it can have a dark side when the potential outcome of its abuse is not carefully considered. Perhaps more importantly though there is another message in Gattaca that exists in the hereandnow of our lives and not in a potential future. It's a message of inspiration for the ordinary who believe they weren't gifted enough to achieve a goal and a warning to the gifted that even for them one can not rest easily and have achievement handed to them.  Like the fable of the turtle and the rabbit victory goes to the one with the determination and drive.  No musician worth listening to ever got to where they are without years of practice regardless of how naturally music may come to them.  This can apply to nearly anything and I think this is where Gattaca really shines.".

At 13 he decides that he needs to grow up fast so he can take care of his girlfriend and his child. His attitude is pretty much I've screwed up but I'm going to do my best to make things right. I can't help but think that if more young men reacted that way the world would be a better place.There are plenty of funny moments and no doubt more than a few comments on Korean society.In summary a funny and cute film about a serious subject.

I can't help but think that if more young men reacted that way the world would be a better place.There are plenty of funny moments and no doubt more than a few comments on Korean society.In summary a funny and cute film about a serious subject. If only real life were more like the movie. ";

	schema:reviewBody "Jenny Juno is a Corean romantic comedy released in 2005 that deals with teen pregnancy. Despite the rather serious subject matter the film actually manages to keep a very lighthearted primarily romantic tone which led to the ratings board to initially slap it with a 18 rating despite its otherwise innocent nature with the argument that the film trivializes teen pregnancy and makes it seem rather easy. Eventually the film ended up with a 15 rating.The story opens with Jenny Park Minji a highachieving middle schooler discovering that she's knocked up and quickly informing Juno Kim Hyesun her middleschool boyfriend. There is brief ensuing drama very similar to Apatow's Knocked Up where the two decide to keep the baby and raise it together. From there it's a matter of keeping the pregnancy thing secret from parents and further building their relationship.Something that immediately impressed me about Jenny Juno was how it was able to keep dramatic urgency despite the fact that the conflict remains rather light throughout the first half of the film. Instead we primarily see Jenny and Juno continuing their very sweet relationship and working to both help Jenny be a healthy mother and Juno be a responsible father. The trick to retaining drama it turns out is the unspoken threat of parental action should the parents find out about the baby. And it should be no spoiler to note that they eventually do. Overall the story kind of reminds me of femalecentric comic books popular in both Corea and Japan as the story progression action scenes from flashbacks have a very Asian comic book feel and some of the comedy draws from that sort of visualization. I also liked how it retained a light hearted cheerfulness throughout. When things are supposed to get serious they do but unfortunately the drama is more than a little hamstrung because of the film's continuing push to keep its very optimistic outlook intact. Ultimately though the end problem with the story lies in that we don't actually get to see any development in either Jenny and Juno or the people around them and it should be the parents that we see the most development in as Jenny and Juno both seem like a pair of magical characters who affect those around them. Also the film really is rather unrealistic throughout with little drama in the high school and setting up a rather pregnancy friendly situation for Jenny by giving her a wealthy family.The film is modern and composed adequately. I was very impressed by the two young actors both young teenagers themselves although the roles weren't all that challenging. The supporting cast was well done too although their characters were also more archetypal than complex. The music is understated with the exception of the theme song to the movie which is rather catchy but gets a little overplayed throughout.Honestly I have to say that I found this film rather refreshing despite its rather notable problems in both that it somehow manages to stay sunny throughout the first half and still retain its drama as well as enjoying the romance between the two kids. That doesn't absolve the film of its problems with being so lighthearted that it floats away from dramatic grounding or its toogoodtobetrue atmosphere. And yet somehow I found myself enjoying the film regardless. It's not great and is only arguably decent but I liked it. It was cute. 710.".

Second I imagined myself viewing this movie as if I were a teenager again. This is the message that I would have token away as a teenager boy gets girl pregnant boy and girl are both from well to do families miraculously through the magic of cinema the baby has no complications at birth nor does the pregnant mother ever put on any weight and overall parents will understand and eventually will live happily ever after. Now this to me is a horrible message as it doesnt lead anywhere.Even at the very end where I expected some sort of realization that this teenage mother in a caf surround by mature women discussing their baby woes may shed some sort of light but this then gets turned into through the magic of cinema another scene where somehow the whole family appears the Entire school supports the underage pregnancy marriage etc. of these two teens and that somehow everything will turn out alrightTo me this film sends the wrong message for any age viewer under 21. I say this because most maybe not all under this age have a limited or lack a concrete understanding of how horrible teenage pregnancy can be...the alarming statistics of these unwed sometimes improperly cared for babies who even if they do make it usually have far tougher stats if the teenage parents do decide to stay with the baby all the way through adulthood and for the majority do not end up in fairytale endings.Anyhow to conclude when I was a teenager I consider myself at least a bit more responsible and conjured up the courage to contact a place called Planned Parenthood before doing the deed and getting information before making such a halfhearted life changing decision.Im glad I never saw such a Movie growing up and if you have the choice to would suggest giving this Movie a watch before recommendingendorsingetc. etc. to someone you care about.".

The clan's leader happens to be a powerful sorcerer and promises revenge before being sealed away with a magical sword.

After he finally returns to arms royal guards attempt to assassinate his wife. While in her own defense she removes the magic sword from it's resting place thus unleashing the vengeful spirit and putting the entire empire in danger.The main plot is a little slim. The evil spirit is largely under developed and the human conflicts are passed over too quickly to generate much emotion. The cause of this is the short running time 92 minutes does not a lot much time to examine the intricate workings of an ancient Korean political system much less exploring the supernatural story line. As such both plots feel like side stories rather than either feeling like the core of the film.Fortunately the rest of the film makes up for the story's lacking. The budget is obviously not big but they do a good job of convincing you others wise. The actors are pretty good so far as the script allows and the cinematography is catching to the eye. There are some lowrent CG images but they brief enough so as not to intrude.The biggest success of the film is the fight scenes and being a historic war picture that makes up for a lot. Well shot and choreographed with buckets of blood with nearly every sword strike the fight scenes evoke a great sense of cathartic release.A fun actiondramahorrorwar picture that just needed a beefed up script to be really great.

Will Biharang be able to fight this evil without killing his loved one? Will he be able to battle the scheming advisors and a love struck queen?This might not be such an epic movie as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but it's still quite enjoyable. The story contains love drama and suspense the acting is more than ok the effects while not up to ILM standards gets the job done.Don't try and cram this movie into the standard Hollywood formula since most asian movies that are worth watching doesn't fit into this formula. Try to concentrate less on the evolution of the plot and more on the feeling of the movie and the in my opinion very well done camera work.Well worth watching if you can find it.".

Will Biharang be able to fight this evil without killing his loved one? Will he be able to battle the scheming advisors and a love struck queen?This might not be such an epic movie as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but it's still quite enjoyable. The story contains love drama and suspense the acting is more than ok the effects while not up to ILM standards gets the job done.Don't try and cram this movie into the standard Hollywood formula since most asian movies that are worth watching doesn't fit into this formula. Try to concentrate less on the evolution of the plot and more on the feeling of the movie and the in my opinion very well done camera work.Well worth watching if you can find it.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this movie I couldn't help but see some parallels with the Arthurian legend. Both visually and in the plot. Visually we've got this misty lake and some sword shots as I might call them that are quite obviously inspired from there. As for the plot the relation between the three main characters echoes somewhat the ArthurGuinevereLancelot threesome.Before going any further I might do a brief plot summary with MILD SPOILERS as it's basically just the beginning of the story not the outcome but you are warned The movie opens on a bloody moon at the end of the era of magic. The Emperor of the newly formed Shilla kingdom seals the power of an evil sorcerer in a lake by thrusting a magical sword into the ground. As long as the swords remain there the evil spirit shall be contained.A thousand years later as the Shilla kingdom is under great turmoil General Biharang is a great warrior that fights to protect the throne which is occupied by Queen Chinsong. She is deeply in love with him but he refuses her advances because he loves another woman a beautiful peasant girl named Jahunbie. At the palace nobody approves of this relationship thinking it might eventually turn the General against his Queen.So as Biharang is sent on a mission Jahunbie is attacked by assassins and while trying to escape she stumbles on the sword that was protecting the kingdom. And as she draws it from the ground to defend herself little does she know she just sealed her fate and is about to bring many things to their end. As she end up falling in the evil lake the spirit of the sorcerer takes control of her.Now Biharang having learned of her death is bent on finding who ordered to kill her and he has little doubt about who that person might be... But he comes face to face with Jahunbie the girl he thought dead who is now possessed. He then struggles to free her and save her but all odds are against him. END SPOILERS So the story is really about this impossible love triangle set on a medieval fantasy background story. The acting is quite good especially Junho Jeong who plays General Biharang.While the movie packs a good deal of action the focus really isn't on that. Visually the action compares to what we saw in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. If you can accept a person empowered with magic can fly you'll have no problem with the action here.As for the lighting it's sometimes a bit cheesy but we've seen the same kind of lighting in the Lord of the Rings and apparently it hasn't bothered many people so I guess it won't be the case either here. It succeeds in creating this great moody fantastic atmosphere that inhabits the movie.Cinematographically it is not revolutionary but quite good in my opinion. There are some really beautiful shots in that movie.So in the end would I recommend it ? Definitely. 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first king of the Silla kingdom united the various Korean tribes under his iron fist through the use of superior technology and tactics. One of those tribes was led by a sorcerous chief who was imprisoned within a lake by the Silla king after he had sworn vengeance against him for the destruction wreaked upon the tribe. A thousand years pass and stories become legends legends become myths yada yada. Now the Silla kingdom has stood for almost a millennia but once again it's threatened both from within and by outsiders.The biggest problem with this film is the fact that it doesn't invest its viewers. None of the characters are given proper personalities beyond their general archetypes for one. The main character is a skilled general and that's about it. His intended is the intended and that's about it. The lovelorn empress is the lovelorn empress. There are some additional touches like the fact that the main character is apparently of lower birth but they don't really add all that much to the story.The story is riddled with clichs and is also baffling in details. For example the title of the movie is The Legend of the Evil Lake. Emphasis on the word 'evil'. Yet the very first scene shows us the chief imprisoned within the lake simply because he had issues with his tribe being taken over by the Silla king. Don't know about the rest of you but I'm with the chief on this one. Down with the Silla kingdom! Which makes watching the movie a touch aggravating when it so clearly assumes we're on the Silla side of the conflict.Aside from all that it's not really a bad movie. The fight scenes are nice the locations are gorgeous the clothing makeup and all that stuff works really well and as a whole it's simply an okay Asian fantasyhorror film. If only the story had been even halfway decent this might have amounted to something.".

	schema:reviewBody "I get the feeling through reading the other comments here that many people miss or perhaps I am wrong about it the point of this film.  First let me point out that Man Bites Dog is a brilliant film a first rate production. However it is disturbing and cruel and meanspirited.  And it MUST be such. It is not a character sketch about a serial killer but instead and indictment of the viewer.  The main character makes us laugh at his gallows humor but then continually throws our laughter back in our faces.  We identify with him but then are repulsed by him.  Ultimately this film is a commentary on human beings and particularly their media driven obsession with violence.  That is what makes this a fantastic movie.This film is not simply about a serial killer but about a film crew who follows him around in order to get a story an indictment of journalistic detatchment.  The media is not simply a passive observer but an active participant in the crimes of the psychopath this should ring bells with us regarding the recent spate of school shootings and Time magazine's decision to have the Columbine kids on the cover.  However this is not a simplistic film that simply points its finger at an easy target like the mass media as happens in Scream but is much more complex.  The film goes to the next level and indicts the viewer himself as perpetuating this cycle.  We are entertained by the glib killer we identify with him he is a cool guy or at least a witty one.  This sort of reminds of the type of people who went to visit John Wayne Gacy or wrote love letters to Richard Ramirez but these are not the only people that this film is directed at it is directed at all of us... all of us who are fascinated by carnage who keep body counts of mass murderers who watch every special regarding serial killers on CNBC.  This film as indictment of our obsession with these murders and this indictment is so skillfully played out that this film becomes great.The movie works hard to cause the viewer to identify with the killer and then throws the horrors of what the killer actually does into our faces. The murder of the child in the house in the suburbs the horrifying rape scene at the end of the film.  These things are supposed to throw us back into our humanity out of the fiction of the romantic psychopath and they do so brilliantly.  I felt really dirty and uncomfortable after watching this film and I believe that this is precisely how I was supposed to feel.I think that the confusion regarding this film arises from these contradictions that the film sets itself up as a comedy but becomes something else quite quickly something complex and somewhat ugly.  The film does not allow itself to be easily pigeonholed.  Overall an excellent film... a doublefeature with Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer would be an interesting experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "If your a fan of cynical intelligent dark comedy then I urge you to see this film! It is the masterpiece of the dark violencecomedy genre.Man Bites Dog was way ahead of its time  before Pulp Fiction before reality TV before movies about the real lives of serial killers Dahmer Bundy etc.. there was Man Bites Dog. Simply this film is superb.Benoit is a charismatic upncoming serial killer working out of some Belgian suburbs. A scrappy filmmaker convinces Benoit to allow his crew to follow him around on his exploits documenting the madness. The setup is somewhat surreal  kind of making out like there is a serialkiller scene in Frenchspeaking Europe. Benoit a natural performer really gets into the idea working the camera beaming in the limelight. So eventually to increase the quality of the movie the film maker  crew go beyond merely documenting and start to become accessories to the crimes. Benoit's super egotistic demeanor starts to catch up with him with the repercussions of his crimes pulling him down.It is a multifaceted exploration of many ideas riffing on each within the episodes which make up the film the story really exists to bind the distinct scenes  its not so much a story in the traditional sense ie. the old fomulaic background  dramatic tension  climax  resolution routine.Many classic scenes like when one of Benoit's friends is taking a little too much of the attention at Benoit's birthday party. Nothing peeves Benoit more than not being the center of attention so as Benoit is playing with his birthday gift a new gun holster his gun accidentally discharges into his friends skull. All the other party members sit covered in bloodin shock from the accident. Benoit just sits back down and calmly resumes eating his birthday cake. Another great scene is when Benoit shows off to the film maker how he can save bullets by murdering an elderly woman with psychology Benoit suddenly screams Snuff! at the trembling woman inducing a heart attack.This movie is just paced so well. We see Benoit warm to the camera the film maker is slowly drawn into Benoit's world from mere documenter to full blown coconspirator. The scenes of Benoit's family are hilarious! Benoit's parent's are stereotypical adorably ignorant bumpkins who will always love their cherished son. Just great stuff.Be warned this is not a movie for kids as the violence is intense and graphic and without proper contextual understanding could be misconstrued as exploitive. Other than that this movie really hits that balance between violence and comedy cold intelligence and raving madness. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a piece of art shocking and disturbing while at the same time funny as  hell in a raw shouldIbelaughingorshouldIbeashamed kind of way. It gives an insight in the very realistically portrayed life of Ben a serial killer with an  impressionable charisma. Most people who commented on this film either love it or hate it. The division seems  mostly geographical though most Americans can't seem to understand the tonguein cheekness of this movie. Probably it has to do with the fakedocumentary nature of the movie which is clearly  westerneuropean. Anyone who has ever seen American documentaries knows they have  a different pace and way of treating images. Those who are used to belgianfrench dutchgerman documentaries will recognise the style of the socalled intimate  documentaries. The pivotal point is the moment a relationship develops beyond the documentary  relationship of the filmmakers and their subject they take Ben's money to finish the  movie. When watching this movie try to imagine that this could be a real movie documentaries about  terrorists drugdealers and even mercenaries the closest thing to an actual serial killer  have been made and some of them were very close to their subject.It is not a black comedy in the classical sense of the word more like a Clockwork  Orange for the nineties. Where A Clockwork Orange bathed in the design of the  seventies this movie bathes in  the largerthanlife invasiveness of modernday realitytvstyle television. Anyone  who has seen shows like cops or Big Brother will know what I'm talking about. It asks the big documentary question in how far does the observed change the observer? It makes a statement not about violence but about the observer of violence. The way it is portrayed shows the art of the very lowbudget crew it grips your guts  without fancy effects or gory protrayal of gore it shows fear despair and psychological  emptyness by showing emotions! This should be recommended viewing and debating  to anyone making documentary films.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is a piece of art shocking and disturbing while at the same time funny as  hell in a raw shouldIbelaughingorshouldIbeashamed kind of way. It gives an insight in the very realistically portrayed life of Ben a serial killer with an  impressionable charisma. Most people who commented on this film either love it or hate it. The division seems  mostly geographical though most Americans can't seem to understand the tonguein cheekness of this movie. Probably it has to do with the fakedocumentary nature of the movie which is clearly  westerneuropean. Anyone who has ever seen American documentaries knows they have  a different pace and way of treating images. Those who are used to belgianfrench dutchgerman documentaries will recognise the style of the socalled intimate  documentaries. The pivotal point is the moment a relationship develops beyond the documentary  relationship of the filmmakers and their subject they take Ben's money to finish the  movie. When watching this movie try to imagine that this could be a real movie documentaries about  terrorists drugdealers and even mercenaries the closest thing to an actual serial killer  have been made and some of them were very close to their subject.It is not a black comedy in the classical sense of the word more like a Clockwork  Orange for the nineties. Where A Clockwork Orange bathed in the design of the  seventies this movie bathes in  the largerthanlife invasiveness of modernday realitytvstyle television. Anyone  who has seen shows like cops or Big Brother will know what I'm talking about. It asks the big documentary question in how far does the observed change the observer?

	schema:reviewBody "Man Bites Dog C'est arriv prs de chez vous.To say this movie is disturbing would be an understatement. A massive gigantic understatement! But it is also a display of filmgenius.The movie is filmed in Black and White and is presented as a documentary of a serial killer. The film crew follows Benoit the killer around town as he recites poetry muses on welfare and housing reform ponders philosophy and ... well kills. Totally randomly.He explains to the film crew the lessons he has learned about killing how to stay low key who to go after and what potential victims are a waste of time. For Benoit killing is an art form but not one that should be undertaken frivolously.There are scenes when his lunacy are briefly pierced by humanity  he counsels one of the film crew not to kill because once you start it becomes a habit. In another scene he laments having killed a suburban family because they had nothing good to steal as it turned out. He proclaims that there should be a law against killing for no good reason.Those who shy from blood and killing  about the most graphical violence you'll ever see documented in a film  should shy from this movie. But anyone with an interest in a glimpse at the darkest side of human nature will appreciate this film not necessarily for its story or its darkness but for its ability to make us think and open our eyes to human behaviour we don't like to admit might exist.During the course of the movie you become totally numb to the act of killing or maming or torture or rape or any violent crime. It is no longer shocking when he kills yet another victim. It has become commonplace. You just sort of scratch your head and wonder  why this one? why now? why him? why her? This mental numbness is made possible by the way it is filmed  as though it were a documentary. Not long into the movie you begin to wonder if this is real or just a movie. I wonder if this is the kind of numbness that soldiers experienced in wars like WWI entrenched and under constant fire  to where the violence around become the norm. I read a book once called My War Gone By I Miss it So that's a whole 'nother review in which a warwriter kept returning to the front because after experiencing violence all around him day after day after day he could no longer live without it. In Man Bites Dog the killing is Benoit's addiction but we as viewers become complacent to it. We have been numbed to where it is no longer disturbing. Makes you scratch your head and wonder is such detachment from emotion and what's right really possible???To add to the realism all the actors play characters with their real names. The killer's mother and grandparents in the movie  are really the actor's mother and grandparents in real life. During most of the filming they were not told it was about serial killing just that they were in a movie with their son. So they just act normal around the son they love only to find out in later scenes that the whole film is about killing. Imagine the look of shock on their faces to find this out  to them the story then is no longer acting but real they've just discovered their songrandson made a film about brutal killings and the shock shows in their faces.Is it real? Is it a movie? What defines the difference?When I told him about this movie a friend mentioned that societyas a whole is already numb to brutal killing and violence. He's right about that. But this movie is so ridiculously brutal and violent it is more a mockery of our society's complacence to violence not an endorsement.".

Some of the demented killer's words are downright funny because of their absurdity. Perhaps that is why this is labeled by some as a black comedy but this is so dark it is difficult for me to rate this as a comedy even though it's there.Most of the killings are not gruesome but there are a few that qualify for that status. They don't dwell on the blood but they don't spare anything in here either. This film is so strange so bizarre that one has to see it believe it. That is not just a clich.

I was expecting nothing as I entered the cinema but it hit me right in the stomach.At first as absolutely hilarious I was just LMAO as the film crew followed this complete moron around town as he killed people. Nothing heroic at all about this killer. In fact I haven't seen any single character in any movie that was such an idiot and SOOOO full of himself. You can actually see how this guy enjoys his 15 minutes of fame and is quite pleased with the fact that someone is interested in what HE is doing.So there I was laughing all over the place we were only two out of the entire audience but we were rolling in our chairs to say the least. One of my favorite places in the film is where Ben explains how he cunningly has saved a bullet in the slaying of an old more or less helpless female. Like a detective showing his extraordinary skills to the humble bystanders the film crew and me. The Hercule Poirot of the killing industry.The movie kept me laughing as the camera crew got more involved with the killer and I was reaching my laughing climax as mentor Ben made the crew a Drunken Baby drink at the bar only to be on the verge of puking with laughter as Ben 5 minutes later was on the sidewalk fucking a black plastic bag with a Santa Claus beard on his face. SOOO funny.But then........just as I was enjoying myself the most I was stopped dead in my tracks and asked what I was laughing at as that horrific rape scene had played out and we found ourselves the crew Ben and myself lying on the kitchen floor with the two gutted people just sitting there on the kitchen table like dolls with their guts all over the place. Very unpleasing not to say unsettling and disturbing.I had become so engrossed in the fun and laughter that I had allowed myself to uncritically tag along without thinking about what was really taking place Murder Dehumanisation is that a word and arrogance. I had become like Ben for just a moment. I had crossed from viewing the horrific deeds to if not being an active part of it then at least condoning what was going on I had lost just an inch of my humanity which could never be retrieved.As far as I'm concerned the movie could have ended right there but it kept on going with me laughing along the way but my laughter was kind of hollow from that point on I had seen myself from the outside and could not go back.That is IMO what makes this film so powerful it poses the question of when are you a simple bystander and when are you actually part of the problem. YOU yes that's YOU have to takes sides. What is acceptable? What is not? It's all about values and taking a stand when you need to.In this sense this seemingly inhumane movie is in fact the opposite. A movie that beckons the viewer to make his voice heard in everyday life. You are never just a bystander! Take a stand!!! NOW!".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember renting 'Man Bites Dog' or 'C'est Arriv Prs De Chez Vous' which is its original title on a hunch in the midnineties because I found the title and the cover on the VHS cassette intriguing. I had no idea for what kind of ride I was in. At first I was taken aback a bit as I didn't expect the film to be in black and white. And then it simply blew me away. This mix of realism pitchblack comedy and shocking though not very graphic violence had me on the edge of my seat throughout and I simply hadn't seen anything like it before. The direction and the realistic performances in 'Man Bites Dog' are simply outstanding when I later watched it with a friend of mine he was visibly shaken at first because he had thought he had watched a real documentary which is obviously the film's intention. What must be mentioned above all else though is the standout tourdeforce performance by the charismatic and frequently hilarious lead Belgian actor Benot Poelvoorde who also cowrote and codirected the film. He IS the film and I have a hard time imagining the story working so well without his inspired genius turn.'Man Bites Dog' is perhaps one of the best and most original satires on sensationalist media since Sidney Lumet's seminal movie 'Network' it's certainly the meanest and not for the easily offended mind you. In my opinion it's a flatout masterpiece. Highly recommended. 10 stars out of 10.P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is great you should make a point of viewing the unedited NC17 version of this film if you can.  The whole movie loses its power and punch with the two controversial scenes removed.  With them this film plays in 3 parts.Part one has the film crew basically following along and observing as the killer makes his usual rounds.  Lots of violence and lots of black humor.Part two is where the crew starts joining in and helping out the killer in certain situations.  The humor hits its peak when they come across a rival crew videotaping a rival killer.Part three occurs at the rape scene.  This is where the humor takes an absolute and complete abrupt halt.  And you realize as the viewer the utter horror of whats taking place.  This is the part of the film where you feel like you need to take a shower for laughing at the first 23rds of the movie.As a whole this film is a classic.  Its commentary on violence is about as strong as you can get.".

	schema:headline " A mockumentary that mocks violence but in a disturbing way !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Consider a scenario where Travis Bickle after gaining hero status at the end of 'Taxi Driver' embarks on a rampaging killing spreeas is very likely for his character but this time a documentary crew follows him and his actions and with this you have the thematic equivalent of the mockumentary 'Man Bites Dog'. 'Man Bites Dog' follows a violent serial killer as he casually commits one murder after another with horrific brutality. This film is a brutal satire on how society and films from all around the world glamorise violence and heroworship the vigilanteswhich was also the point of the ending section of Taxi Driver. The way the documentary crew remain indifferent and downright casual about the murders until things start affecting them personally is a clear statement on the film viewers of that time and subsequent generations and their tendency to gravitate towards graphic and disturbing violence. Although the film has comedic sensibilities running through it but it does not compromise when it comes to depiction of violence.There are some chilling moments in the film that underline this like the moment where two kids are scene playing with toy guns and shooting at each other and the it suddenly jump cuts to Ben actually shooting real people. There are other scenes where Ben tries to emulate in real life murder scenes he has seen in films. This film is certainly not for everyone as it consistently flirts with the line dividing what is offensive and what's not and at times for some viewers it may seem to skew a little towards the offensive side. It does make you feel a bit contaminated by the nihilistic violence a bit like 'Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer' but I think that was intentional on the part of the directorial team.The tag line for 'Taxi Driver' was 'On every street in every city there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody.' This tag line is also very much fitting for 'Man Bites Dog'. The protagonist Ben isn't really plagued by loneliness like Travis was but what he shares with Travis is an intense yearning for attention. It is made very clear in the film that Ben loves the attention that the documentary crew give him. So much so that when the crew try to turn down his invitation to a meal one evening citing plans that they made earlier Ben gets antsy and feels offended. It is clear that like most serial killers and psychopaths the roots of his deranged behaviour and monstrosity lies in his want to be seen and celebrated. He is always putting on an act and pretending to be this angelic sharp individual with high intellect who just happens to be a serial killer. This pretension stands out as there comes certain scenes later in the film where Ben is forced to be his genuine actual self which is very different from the character he is pretending to be in the initial part of the film. Travis' story had the inescapable backdrop of postVietnam and postWatergate America I don't have enough knowledge to know whether the directorial team is making a statement about a state of disillusionment existing in Belgium at the time of its release but it very well could be the case. Another film that comes to mind is 'A Clockwork Orange'. Just like Kubrick's film 'Man Bites Dog' challenges us by making us follow a truly despicable deplorable and loathsome character. However just like Alex Ben also pays big time for his actions.Textually and technically this film reminded me a lot of the French New Wave from the late 50s and 60s. There is a lot of Godardesque jump cutting preponderance of long unbroken takes as is expected from a pseudo documentaryetc. There is a beautiful directorial moment of subtle imagery towards the end of the film where just before a shocking revelation there is a fleeting moment where we see a mirror in front of Ben with his reflection on it signifying that he is about to see the monstrosity of his own work reflected back at him he is about to get a dose of his own medicine and it will be painful. The directorial team does very well to juggle and balance the darkly comedic elements of the film along with the graphic and gruesome violence.The acting is good and believable from everyone but certainly Benot Poelvoorde deserves a special mention who drives the film forward and gives a layered performance. He plays a guy pretending to be a bad ass he doesn't go overthetop but manages to still capture a manic psychopathic demeanour in every scene. He also shines in the more quiet subtler moments when the character suffers loss and regret. 'Man Bites Dog' is the darkest that a black comedy can get. It is challenging shocking disturbing and maybe perceived by some to be at times offensive. But I think there is a justification for the shock value that the film makes use of. The film has something to say about society cinema and evil in general. If you can sit through a few moments of disturbing imagery I will recommend this film to you ever so strongly.".

So for what it's worth here's my viewing experience I heard about this film and was immediately hooked on the absurd idea of a serial killer on the loose as a willing documentary subject. I also heard that it was pitchblack comedy and a commentary on violence society media etc.  blurring the lines between observing and becoming an accomplice and whatnot.Well in the first two acts it certainly delivers on the absurdity and the black comedy. Both Ben and the filmmakers are as matteroffact about his prolific killing as if it were a documentary about urban architecture and even in the middle of his murderous acts he remains an engaging conversationalist with all sorts of attributes our culture values extroversion confidence charm a sense of humor and fairly informed views on diverse subjects. The juxtapositions are disturbingly hilarious. He laments that African immigrants like the one he just shot don't have equal opportunities in this racist society or that the color and layout of a certain housing project encourages violence and other social evils. He kills an entire family in their home then reflects on the waste of human life and how there should be a law against that sort of thing. He explains a lot of aspects of his trade like how to dispose of bodies and which victims are most likely to carry money but leaves other elements in the dark. He first seems like a murderous variety of the common robber but then plenty of killings seem to have no material motive at all while others are clashes with rival killers the absurdity reaches metalevels at some points. I was shocked by the violence and I was also laughing and I was feeling uneasy about that.Many reviews talk about how the documentary crew moves from observers to accomplices but any court of law would already consider them accomplices within one minute of the film starting so that development didn't register so much to me. Sure they started taking a more active part in the carnage but this wasn't something I considered an unexpected development.What did register to me was the shift somewhere in the third act. Suddenly I was no longer watching a dark comedy. The violence escalates to a nasty scene that I couldn't even watch and that left me disturbed and depressed for days. It's like the movie finally decided to show me what I was looking at and say well are you still laughing? Are you? And I realized what was there about Ben that was engaging? Even his charming ways among his friends and family were just socially acceptable methods of getting his way and remaining the center of attention just like killing people and starring in documentaries.So among the unexpected things I found in this film was a chillingly believable portrait of a textbook sociopath. The scary thing is that I know someone in my neighborhood who fits that profile as well.The film is brilliant and disturbing. Proceed at your own risk.".

He's a serial killer who makes a living by killing mailmen old and lonely people Let's call them the easy targets not just for the money but also because of the fun of it.

Well his philosophy is if you kill a wale Greenpeace and all other 'tree huggers' will condemn you but if you catch some sardines they will help you to put them in tins... At first the camera crew has a lot of difficulties to cope with all the violence but as longer as they stay with Ben they not only get immune for all the violence but become more violent themselves.This isn't just an excellent and ultradark satirical movie about a serial killer. If you look a bit closer you'll understand that the director gives us a more profound message with his film we all get more and more immune to violence and we don't seem to care about other people anymore. And to make things worse the media will do anything to give us the goriest pictures we all seem to want. The rape scene is a good example of that statement. Many people don't understand why it was in the movie but in the mean time they kept watching didn't they? In my opinion people who don't see this message haven't understood anything about the movie and I guess that's the main reason why so many people seem to hate it. Something else that might confuse the audience is the documentary style of filming. Don't be mistaken this isn't a documentary this is a fictive story that could have been based on actual events but that really isn't.What makes me proud is the fact that this is one of ours. I'm Belgian myself and I can tell you that despite the fact that many Belgian directors have filmed several movies almost none of them has been able to make such a great movie. Yes the violence in this movie is extreme but this is really a piece of art that will be understood by all people who are smart enough to see the entire picture. I give this movie an 810.".

He goes about his work in a competent but nonflamboyant manner much like an insurance auditor would. But you are acutely aware that if there was competition he wouldn't be the best hitman  just an average one. That he is not a meticulous serial killer is humorously evident when he finds that his body dumping ground is clearly visible from two hundred feet away with bones sticking out in every direction.Ben's only acknowledgement of society seems to be the egotistical need to ensure that the film is completed.

The crew perceive this weaknesses and proceed to exploit it in the opportunistic manner only the continental artsy type knows how Even goading him on to go beyond his usual modus operandi to rob a suburban home  only to find that rich suburbans only keep credit cards at home and no cash.The film works hard at at many levels to ensure that the viewer cannot distance himself from the movie. The documentary style is only one aspect of this. Discerning viewers cannot categorize Ben with any mental illness because unlike clinical conditions that describe lack of empathy Ben does maintain semifunctional family relationships and friendships He also has both appreciation and moderate skills for music and sport  Piano and Boxing. Conversely there is no opportunity to develop any sympathy for Ben either as he mercilessly smothers a ten year old boy.And that is the brilliance of the film  Adroitly manipulating the viewer's mind and shaking away any predilection to slot away Ben as an aberration. Forcing the viewer to accept Ben's existence as fact accept society's helplessness at ever reforming or redeeming Ben accept that for a turn of chance they might be the next random victims of Ben.Multiple sideplots efficiently explored give a depth to the narrative that goes beyond the 95 minutes of running time. The most interesting sideplot is his relationship with the crew. The crew through their meanness and pettiness create a temporary sense of sympathy for Ben. It is easier to relate to the lone misfit who is cruelly unaware that he is being mocked than to the snobbish crew with their disheveled artsy attire and unwashed hippy hair. Their own baseness is evident when they are willing partners in a bout of rape facilitated by Ben and his ever present gun. While Ben is the skilled panther fending for himself they are the hyenas of society feeding off the scraps. The situational and temporary power shifts are blindingly realistic.Eventually though there is no conceptualization of redemption for a man like Ben. Even when his girlfriend and mother are brutally killed  his remorse comes from a selfish loss of relationship not love. Revenge for such an act is simply a matter of professional courtesy for Ben and personal grief is only incidental.Benot Poelvoorde is outstanding as Ben  from every drunken facial tic to the professional manner of hunting down his victims. Benoit masterfully represents Ben as a human with all the petty pride and insecurities that go with it even while indulging in demonically violent acts.A disturbingly brilliant movie  with each scene worthy of expostulation  punctuated regularly with points of high black humor Man bites dog is an enduring cult classic.".

Those who love it like me tend to expound vocally at any opportunity how great it is while those who hate it As a quick skim of the 'hated it' reviews of IMDb confirmed REALLY hate it.And in many ways this is the exact intention of the film makers. I could bang on for an age about how 'violence should be disturbing' and all that cal but that is essentially too painfully obvious and insultingly plain a point to see that it need not be mentioned on a site like IMDb.Man Bites Dog is a film like Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Shining that totally invites audience participation I don't mean 'Big Lebowski' or 'Rocky Horror' participation and asks you to suspend belief and enter it's world. Once you submit to it's will and intentions you see more things if you are willing to and the more you think about what you've seen the more you absolutely hate yourself for enjoying it. It's odd to see a film made to be so polarising but I suppose in a way it's quite daring and deserves a bit of respect. Regardless I can absolutely see people's hatred for 'Man Bites Dog' it's crude it's very violent and it's quite disgustingly dark in points. Aside from that it's entertaining I'm sorry but it really is. Not in the conventional sense of course it simply exists in it's own cartoon world where violence rape and intellectual debates can rub shoulders comfortably  nay almost naturally. The dialogue is excellent I really wish I spoke French so I could watch it sans subtitle the acting is quite frighteningly believable it looks frankly beautiful in stark black and white and yet  it has been known as for years as some disgusting exercise to be steered clear of  only for the sadists.Is it a comment on the then burgeoning culture of sadistic video games and video nasty films? Quite probably. But more likely it's just some young film makers making a film they knew would really irk people  and loving it. It is not as some have suggested the humanisation and worship of a killer or indeed the rationalisation of murder just in the same way Hitchcock's 'Rope' is not.Benoit is the main character a bafflingly prolific serial killer from Belgium this synopsis alone is enough to illicit laughs and in fact it makes me really chuckle every time I think about it. Through the film which takes place in about a month of Benoit and the film crew's life he kills on camera about 40 people. In Belgium  just think about that. The film is an 18 and it is violent but this body count in such a neutral and unassuming country is in itself absolutely hilarious. A brilliant scene that shows Benoit's intellectual yet coldly dissociative personality perfectly is where he talks of killing an Arabian construction worker I buried him in that wall over there...Facing Mecca  of course.I like to see it as a companion piece to Reservoir Dogs. Yet some people who love Tarantino's classic absolutely hate this  and I ask why? It's essentially the same thing yet absolutely glorified in Reservoir Dogs. If you have a problem with both  then fine I can see why many would but the fact that people see Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers as cool and yet ultra violent yet see European films that deal with the same issues as to be condemned...Shame on you.".

	schema:reviewBody "As somewhat of an amalgamation of Trainspotting and A Clockwork Orange this film clearly isn't geared at mass audiences. However those who perk up at the idea of following a narcissistic pathetic bad poetryspouting sociopathic mass murderer around for 90 minutes will find this clever disturbing and unique altclassic well deserving of the Criterion Collection treatment it has received.There isn't much plot to be had here only a document of heinous deeds performed by a nonplussed killer who cares about motive about as much as he cares about human life. We are allowed here to tag along with him as he engages in a series of brutal killings for no apparent reason other than the opportunity to steal money from his random victims and to scratch our heads in befuddled wonder as he pauses between murders to introduce us to his parents orate poems about the leaves in springtime and expound on a variety of pressing issues such as the mating rituals of pigeons and the proper ratios for weighing down corpses before dumping them into the water old people's bones are porous therefore five times their body weight is optimal... good to know?.Benoit Poolverde offers us a character without a single positive attribute yet somehow provides enough incredulous spunk to make even his most mundane actions absolutely riveting. It is a magnificent performance and it would be ridiculous not to commend Poolverde for plunging himself so fully into the mind of a character so impossible to like. Further complicating Benoit's role is the absence of any sort of understanding about the monstrous life that this lonely and miserable human being inhabits. He'd much rather talk about obscure French films than psychological triggers but with the zest and childlike buoyancy he thrusts into his extroversion of the most mundane topics one could imagine a serial killer pondering we still want to hear the guy out.I'm realizing that none of this is making this film sound appealing. The truth is it's probably not. But it surely is engrossing and for those who were able to find the pitch black humor in the grim world of Trainspotting the tone here will tickle the most psychotic funny bone in your body.I'm also realizing that I've mentioned Trainspotting twice which may seem a bit odd since that film is about heroin addicts while this one is about sadistic execution. Perhaps it is effective here to break a unique film like Man Bites Dog down to it's component parts. The bond with Trainspotting is the ability of both films to conjure comedy amidst such bleak and souldarkening backdrops. The comparison to A Clockwork Orange at the head of this writeup is for the unabashedly devastating violence on display here. There are also shades of American Psycho if only for the callous and remorseless mindset of our central character. We also have to mention Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer which is referenced heavily in a scene where Benoit and his dehumanized camera crew break into a couple's apartment and take turns raping the wife before performing dissections on her so thorough they'd make Jack The Ripper blush. We can also compare this film to The Blair Witch Project because of the way the tiny budget complements the piece as the grainy black and white stock used to capture this catalog of carnage perfectly visualizes the stark documentary realism we're being presented.But all comparisons aside Man Bites Dog remains unlike anything you've ever seen. Simultaneously revolting and witty the film sets a tone that no other bit of cinema has ever dared. This is perhaps most suitably displayed in a scene where Benoit teaches us how to make a mixed drink called Dead Baby Boy a libation which actually duplicates what would happen to the body of the titular victim after being dumped. In fact your enjoyment of this film will likely depend solely on your reaction to the scene synopsis I've just offered.This is an unpleasant film to watch and it seems to be reaching for no significant message or theme but Man Bites Dog is an exhilarating road to nowhere and even Benoit's eventual comeuppance at the conclusion doesn't dilute the unsettling feeling this movie conjures. Fans of the bizarre can consider themselves incomplete until they've added this gem to their list. Also highly recommended for pigeon enthusiasts by the way.".

We are allowed here to tag along with him as he engages in a series of brutal killings for no apparent reason other than the opportunity to steal money from his random victims and to scratch our heads in befuddled wonder as he pauses between murders to introduce us to his parents orate poems about the leaves in springtime and expound on a variety of pressing issues such as the mating rituals of pigeons and the proper ratios for weighing down corpses before dumping them into the water old people's bones are porous therefore five times their body weight is optimal... good to know?.Benoit Poolverde offers us a character without a single positive attribute yet somehow provides enough incredulous spunk to make even his most mundane actions absolutely riveting. It is a magnificent performance and it would be ridiculous not to commend Poolverde for plunging himself so fully into the mind of a character so impossible to like. Further complicating Benoit's role is the absence of any sort of understanding about the monstrous life that this lonely and miserable human being inhabits. He'd much rather talk about obscure French films than psychological triggers but with the zest and childlike buoyancy he thrusts into his extroversion of the most mundane topics one could imagine a serial killer pondering we still want to hear the guy out.I'm realizing that none of this is making this film sound appealing. The truth is it's probably not. But it surely is engrossing and for those who were able to find the pitch black humor in the grim world of Trainspotting the tone here will tickle the most psychotic funny bone in your body.I'm also realizing that I've mentioned Trainspotting twice which may seem a bit odd since that film is about heroin addicts while this one is about sadistic execution. Perhaps it is effective here to break a unique film like Man Bites Dog down to it's component parts. The bond with Trainspotting is the ability of both films to conjure comedy amidst such bleak and souldarkening backdrops. The comparison to A Clockwork Orange at the head of this writeup is for the unabashedly devastating violence on display here. There are also shades of American Psycho if only for the callous and remorseless mindset of our central character. We also have to mention Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer which is referenced heavily in a scene where Benoit and his dehumanized camera crew break into a couple's apartment and take turns raping the wife before performing dissections on her so thorough they'd make Jack The Ripper blush. We can also compare this film to The Blair Witch Project because of the way the tiny budget complements the piece as the grainy black and white stock used to capture this catalog of carnage perfectly visualizes the stark documentary realism we're being presented.But all comparisons aside Man Bites Dog remains unlike anything you've ever seen. Simultaneously revolting and witty the film sets a tone that no other bit of cinema has ever dared. This is perhaps most suitably displayed in a scene where Benoit teaches us how to make a mixed drink called Dead Baby Boy a libation which actually duplicates what would happen to the body of the titular victim after being dumped. In fact your enjoyment of this film will likely depend solely on your reaction to the scene synopsis I've just offered.This is an unpleasant film to watch and it seems to be reaching for no significant message or theme but Man Bites Dog is an exhilarating road to nowhere and even Benoit's eventual comeuppance at the conclusion doesn't dilute the unsettling feeling this movie conjures. Fans of the bizarre can consider themselves incomplete until they've added this gem to their list. Also highly recommended for pigeon enthusiasts by the way.";

Because I paid money to see this film solely because of the reviews it got I resent then the implication that by doing so I am either a voyeur or a fellowtraveller in the violence and cruelty depicted. Had I got up and walked out no doubt I'd have been called a prude or my exit regarded as moral panic and by not having seen the whole film to the end it would be argued with reason that I would therefore be unqualified to comment... the nowin situation so beloved of those who have an answer for everything! Certainly there is no question of banning this film for adults in fact it is a useful artifact to show just how desensitized and decadent Western culture has become in part. And yet that same society in Britain at least bans the depiction on television of abortion procedures and carefully filters out graphic scenes of real carnage. But when it is claimed to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem then I have to dissent from the mainstream opinion regarding this movie and take issue with such arrogrance. What is funny about seeing a child murdered or a woman raped and then disembowelled? Isn't this reaction precisely the mindset that perpetrates so many war time atrocities? That rather than allow ourselves to be swamped with revulsion and selfloathing at our propensity for barbarism we have to transmogrify it into some sort of giggle  a lark a bit of fun or god help us sport? If this odious and squalid little piece of artistic pretension HADN'T revolted and nauseated me then I'd be truly worried. As it is it has a kind of schoolboyish feverishness about it like trying to see who can next come up with the most shocking anecdote or see who can pee the highest up the wall. Crude and cruel it at least parades its scabs with some sort of attitude. And possibly that's what worries me most. However just to try and be truly balanced maybe just maybe the filmmakers were in fact creating a double bluff just to test and examine how far a parade of unremittingly cruel images might find intellectual champions in today's society! Remember the film as auteur concept originated as a scam!".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2012 towards the end of July a Korean film with an ensemble cast called The Thieves was released. Around two weeks later another Korean ensemble film more focused on comedy came out titled The Grand Heist. While The Grand Heist is also about a robbery carried out by a group of professionals it is set in the late 18th century. During this time ice is a valuable commodity which is regulated by the government. However corrupt officials who the two main characters have beef against take over the business and form a monopoly. An avid reader Dukmoo Cha Taehyun along with his stern combatant partner Dong soo Oh Jiho come up with a plan and gather 11 members total to steal the ice blocks in the royal storage to distribute back to the people. It is an interesting story that unfortunately comes with a few weak plot points.Let's start with the diversity of characters. Because there are 11 heist members it's difficult to get to know all of them and care about them. In a couple of scenes some of the members are on the verge of getting killed. Even when Min Hyorin's character Baek Sooryun is in a dire situation it takes some effort to be concerned about whether or not she'll get out alive. This is probably because most of the characters lack a background story to show who they really are. You could say some of the characters in The Thieves suffer the same fate. However The Thieves makes up for it with lots of suspense. In The Grand Heist there's just nothing suspenseful about the dangerous scenes even if characters are close to drowning. The camera flows too well like the water being shown on screen rather than rapidly cutting back and forth to build up tension.Also the film has a couple of unlinked references that seem out of place when shown. Towards the end of the film when Dukmoo is about to fire a gun a book about guns and the posture to hold when aiming is shown to indicate Dukmoo's recollection of the stance. It wouldn't have been that strange if the film actually showed Dukmoo reading the book early on. The film sort of digs its own grave by putting so much emphasis on the gunshot when the outcome doesn't really lead to the ultimate victory for the protagonists. Perhaps it would have been better if throughout the film multiple short recollections of information from books pop up that aid Dukmoo in pinches since he's a book collector. Just having that one scene kind of throws the viewer off.The bonds between characters aren't addressed very well and the love stories all feel a bit forced. Even so once you let go of certain expectations the film can be funny and entertaining. You definitely shouldn't expect the level of humor of Cha Taehyun's big hit movies like My Sassy Girl and Speedy Scandal. There's an O.K. joke that gets a bit overused. However the film guarantees a few laughs disregarding the childish fart jokes and has a pretty satisfying ending. The Grand Heist should be viewed for the actors and their interactions with the historical Korea setting.The movie is... O.K. ".

	schema:headline " Buoyed by Lee Byung Hun's finest performance to date this period drama with humour poignancy and heart is one of the finest Korean movies in a long while";
	schema:reviewBody "This much is history  in the eighth year of King Gwanghae's reign during the 17th century Joseon dynasty there was a sudden reversal of policies that had favoured the aristocracy. Suddenly the wealthy were made to pay more taxes and the same burden lightened on both the peasants as well as the middleclass. The noble were also ordered not to exploit the poor as slaves lest they face the wrath of the King. Strangely enough it is during this period that the Annals contain fifteen missing days preceded by an intriguing entry that reads 'one must not record that which he wishes to hide'.Inspired by this fascinating set of events director and coscreenwriter Choo Changmin imagine a fantastical scenario along the lines of Mark Twain's seminal novel 'The Prince and the Pauper' and Ivan Reitman's political satire 'Dave' where a lookalike commoner swaps places with the King and thereby institutes badly needed groundup reforms. The excuse for such a body swap? The threat of assassination which in the opening minutes is shown leaving King Gwanghae spooked and doubting the trust of even those closest to him  the Queen and her brother Yoo Jong ho.Under his orders his loyal Chief Secretary Heo Gyun Ryoo Seungyong finds a doppelganger in Haseon a jester at a courtesan's place who impersonates the King for popular amusement. Barely after his audition Haseon is thrust onto the throne when the King is poisoned and falls unconscious leading the Chief Secretary to activate the former so that the country does not descend into chaos. What ensues is an enthralling mix of comedy and drama done with a lot of heart all three elements combining to render this one of the very best Korean films we have seen in a long while.Indeed the experience that Changmin invites his audience to partake is similar to Haseon's own transformation. Not used to the life of royalty Haseon initially struggles with its customary practices  most notably the lack of privacy  and like the awkward adjustments he has to make the first half of the film goes for a lighthearted tone with generous but genuine laughs. A particular laughoutloud sequence has him failing to understand the inordinate amount of attention paid to the daily movement of his bowels but most of the humour is more subtle but no less amusing  especially a running gag where his regular closeddoor meetings with the Chief Secretary are interrupted by the need to perform an abrupt switch of positions when his night snack is delivered.Even in these early moments it is clear that Haseon has more empathy than the real King ever had. This is portrayed in both the smaller moments  after learning that his leftovers go towards feeding the Royal servants Haseon specially eats only a basic bowl of bean gruel to leave the rest of the dishes to those who prepared it  as well as a more fully fleshed arc that sees him try to restore the rightful presence of the Queen Han Hyojoo in relation to the throne. It is also a perfect precursor for Haseon's subsequent transformation as he grows increasingly unwilling to be just a puppet for the Chief Secretary.Instead Haseon begins to rule by common sense putting in place badly needed reforms so swiftly that they stun the rest of his political circle. More importantly he ends up antagonising the very traitors who had masterminded the King's poisoning setting the stage for a gripping showdown where not just his identity but his very life is on the line. And yet even in the face of clear and present danger Haseon shows unexpected mettle choosing instead to stand firm for his beliefs and decisions rather than scuttle away to safety earning the admiration of the Chief Secretary and the Chief Eunuch Jang Gwang who realise that Haseon was an even better ruler of the people than the King himself.Though Changmin provides a steady directorial hand to the compelling tale what truly knocks it out of the park is Lee Byung Hun's bravura acting holding the screen with poise and charisma. As King Gwanghae he is arrogant petulant and utterly contemptible but as Haseon he is lively and charming at the beginning and affectionate and empathetic later on. One of the best  and most touching  scenes in the whole film has Haseon agreeing out of resignation to his advisers' proposal for 20000 men to be essentially sent to their death to help the Ming dynasty and then retracting it with a most forceful proclamation of his duties as a King of the people that very sequence a perfect illustration of Byung Hun's regal performance.Outstanding in their own right too are the various supporting acts including Seungyong's righteous Chief Secretary who eventually finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place and Jang Gwang's Chief Eunuch who begins to have a change of heart about the masquerade when he sees the goodness in Haseon's rule. Rare is the film that is wonderfully acted by every single cast and one supposes that this is testament to the power of Byung Hun's own leading anchor.The topnotch quality of the production is also evident in the sumptuous sets and lavish costumes which add class and pomp to a brilliantly acted cleverly scripted and confidently directed film. All the jokes and intrigue isn't just for entertainment indeed its message of justice benevolence and fairness is as true to the rule of governance today as it is four hundred years ago. That relevance gives it real heft and whether you are a fan of period dramas we urge you to see what we think is one of the finest Korean movies we have seen brilliant and beautiful in its humour poignancy and most of all heart.".

This is an example movie that is handled by professional cast and crew members. Changmin as director built a dazzling and powerful movie the cinematography is beautiful captured and solid frame by frame the makeup and costume design are also did their responsibility well. Cast member also had done an incredible part especially Byunghun as King Gwanghae and Haseon. His name has already known internationally as a tough fighter in 'G.I.

Byunghun acts really convincingly as two different character here a serious charismatic king and a naughty lazy comedian. Without the right guy who plays exceptionally in the main role this movie wouldn't be that great. Overall 'Masquerade' is a serious making movie with great storyline and strong performances although the ending is not so extraordinary.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Masquerade";
	schema:reviewBody "A critical and commercial success in South Korea and that's really no surprise. For a period drama Masquerade contains plenty in its formula that made it so from a premise that piqued curiosity an Alist cast and really solid production values with attention paid to detail recreating the Joseon period under the reign of the 15th emperor Gwanghae giving its interpretation to a missing 15 days in the documented Annals of the Joseon Dynasty journals which writer Hwang Joyoon took the liberty to introduce a tale similar to The King and the Pauper played out with full palace intrigue.King Gwanghae Lee Byunghun like most kings when being unpopular fears for his life and instructs his Chief Secretary Heo Gyun Ryoo Seungryong to find a doppelganger. After a search a bawdy comedian Hasun also played by Lee was found and brought to the palace to be groomed as a standin with this secret only made known to Heo Gyun and Chief Eunuch Jang Gwang only given that there are enemies of the state even in the courts and nobody can be trusted with the secret except for the inner circle. Sure enough King Gwanghae got poisoned and in his absence Hasun has got to step up into the regal role opening doors to light comedy and the raising of eyebrows amongst those intent on committing treason as they slow sense some characteristics in their king that didn't seem quite right.Director Choo Changmin had a solid hand at the helm of this production never scrimping on the opulence of how courts and palaces function with its legion of servants and court officials while drawing out excellent performances from the cast at his disposal. There's enough in the film to make anyone sit up and take note of the intricacies of political maneuvering especially when there are vultures swirling around and ever ready to swoop in to take advantage of any perceived weakness. The story here ranks up there with just about any palace drama anywhere in the world with loose ends opened during the narrative all neatly tied up with strong emotions to boot.Lee Byunghyun is possibly in his finest roles yet playing the two different characters of one having the highest office in the land while the other a poor nobody plucked from obscurity to assume a role he would have never dreamed of. As King Gwanghae he plays him ruthless and not very well liked but as Hasun Lee shows off his acting chops in varying his styles as the need and narrative called for it being goofy when required or with all regal pomp when in the open with many eyes and ears. He straddles the roles quite effortlessly which is a good dramatic break for the actor who is probably better known for his dumbed down Hollywood exploits that prefer his rock solid abs than to his acting ability which will convince naysayers that this man can truly act.The supporting cast also put in top notch performances to play off Lee especially when the narrative fleshes them out in three dimensions rather than to pass them off as caricatures. Top of the list goes to Heo Gyun as the main executer of the plot installing Hasun as the King while waiting for his real master to awaken from poisoned slumber and teaching his puppet to wise up only to be surprised by the man's humanity which set out to touch the lives of many others and with it came new found respect. Jang Gwang as the Chief Eunuch was excellent too in being one of two in the scheme of things and serves as Hasun's confidante and observer during nonofficial periods.And others in the story include Captain Do Kim Inkwon as the King's royal bodyguard who begins to suspect something's amiss the young food taster Sawol Shim Eunkyung who brings him his meals and the Queen Consort Joong Jun Han Hyojoo herself all who slowly benefit from what they thought was a profound change in heart of a man whom they never would have thought to change for the better with new found humanity and grace on display and each story arc contributing to the breadth of the story keeping it moving at fast pace as well as keeping audiences on their feet with each dangerously close shaves of potential exposure of plot and identity.It's been some time since I had last enjoyed a Korean period film so this came as a pleasant surprise. It's that kind of production that's big in scale and ambition and delivered on all counts. Masquerade deserves all the critical and commercial success gone its way and more and it qualifies itself into my shortlist as one of the best this year has to offer. A definite recommend!".

	schema:headline " Charming take on an old theme";
	schema:reviewBody "As has been pointed out by other reviewers this story is a new spin on The Prince and the Pauper. It actually reminded me however of the American movie Dave in that the protagonist is a naive pawn whose empathy allows him to rise to the occasion including finding love in the chaos.Byunghun Lee is simply an amazing actor. Having seen his dark side in movies like A Bittersweet Life and I Saw the Devil I was very pleased to see he could handle the role of HaSeon with such a light touch. It was a joy to see him effortlessly shift from hilarious toilet humor to inspiring leader. I was particularly struck with the scenes where he interacted with commoners in which I really felt the empathy HaSeon felt for them.This is the first of director Changmin Choo's movies I've seen and I was impressed at how he was able to seamlessly balance the light and serious scenes in the movies. To often one or the other seems forced but here Choo creates a character who grows and changes but still remains at heart the same good person he was at the beginning  the kind of person who by the end of the story could be happy and believable as a king or a pauper. I think Choo also gave the movie a more intimate feel by focusing on oneonone conversations and limiting the normal cast of thousands you often see in period pieces about kings.Overall the acting was top notch  particularly from Hyoju Han as the Queen and Hyoju Han as Minister Do  and the costumes and set design were beautiful.Masquerade is an engaging and charming period piece with humor action and romance.".

It actually reminded me however of the American movie Dave in that the protagonist is a naive pawn whose empathy allows him to rise to the occasion including finding love in the chaos.Byunghun Lee is simply an amazing actor. Having seen his dark side in movies like A Bittersweet Life and I Saw the Devil I was very pleased to see he could handle the role of HaSeon with such a light touch. It was a joy to see him effortlessly shift from hilarious toilet humor to inspiring leader.

A grandeur of a period drama pivots heavily on its art design set decoration makeup and costumes whether or not can conjure a believable world of that time as a result MASQUERADE is impeccable in all these aspects.

Hollywood should learn how to turn repellent vulgarity into some genuine laughter from it.

Acting with his mother tongue the constant changeover of manners and tones is a demanding task he successfully nail both the imperial majesty and the antic streetsmartness.

Seungyong Ryoo the helping hand Hyoju Han the queen and Gwang Jang the eunuch all offer a bit subtler presence pertains to their different functions. There is an elephant in the room since everyone knows the impostor cannot be spared at any rate so the film cunningly contrives a twist to lift the culmination which we cannot say is a mindblowing one at least it is a tenable one.

Now he is mostly regarded as a wise king unluckily stuck in the domestic political feuds which turned out to be the main cause of his undoing and many historians say Joseon would have not suffered two disastrous invasions by the Qing Dynasty if he had not been dethroned by a coup in 1623.We can witness many resemblances of Kagemusha1980 and Dave1993 in Masquerade.

The real king suddenly loses his consciousness due to poison situation becomes worse and Heo Gyun demands Haseon to disguise himself as the king for a while to deceive others at the court. Haseon is reluctant but he quickly accepts his plan because he is promised that he will be paid well.

This speculative fiction draws upon an episode in the eighth year of Gwanghaegun's reign when the court chronicles recorded his saying Do not put on record what is meant to be hidden followed by two weeks' worth of missing entries. The central conceit of the plot is that the king's loyal and able adviser Heo Gyun Ryoo SeungRyong forced Hasun to impersonate Gwanghaegun while he recovered a coma after an apparent poisoning attempt. While this contemptuous potentate starts out by micromanaging his puppet through his official court functions he soon develops an appreciation of Hasun's patriotic and humanitarian concerns for the kingdom and its subjects.

While not quite Kagemusha caliber being far more affected than Kurosawa's masterwork it makes for a compelling spectacle in its own right marred slightly by Hasun's tendency to emote by shedding tears on demand. The climactic confrontation between Captain Do and a band of assassins dispatched by the recovered king to retire his standin with extreme prejudice is especially notable as a vivid illustration of the vital difference between slashes and cuts in a swordfight. I recommend it to all fans of international costume drama.".

Lee Byung Hun really nail it as a KING and the pretending one. Which led you to think even if have already A King Do you really thing your subordinate think you as one? There is abit naivety behind it but it's very entertaining movie and worth a try to bring you joy for the first time on sageuk genre.".

It touches on the warm and beautiful side of the human heart. This film just kept on building and building and got better and better. Sure Lee Byunghun is a deceiver when it comes to girls and doesn't have integrity when it comes to marriage. But he is a actor playing a character. It even has those cute moments driven by integrity compassion and love which I thoroughly enjoyed. As the story kept building I got more interested. While so many Korean films focus on the bleak side of things it's nice to see a fictitious and yet realistic movie that focuses on the good of humanity. If that makes any sense. This movie is actually a Korean take on the The Prince and the Pauper story. Except I Am a King is a more close take on that story. However I liked this film a lot more than I Am a King. Most of the movie takes place in a palace and there is little to no action scenes. However because the director did such a good job of transcending from dark to bright it meshes together well enough that the a lot of action isn't necessary. It might actually have taken away from this movie. A movie like this shows that it's not by birth that paves the way to greatness as a human being but what you do.8.710".

But once you watch it with your heart you'll fall in love with it. The movie has some quite funny parts too. This movie is truly inspiring to any aspiring filmmaker . The acting is amazing. The story is brilliant. The direction is flawless. There were many scene which made me quite emotional. I just can't help it without praising Byunghun Lee's acting abilities. The music the acting the direction the story and especially the cinematography fits in perfectly in the movie like a fully completed puzzle board and boy what a beautiful puzzle board it is. I believe Hollywood should take notes watching this flick. I don't speak Korean. I don't even understand it. I watched this movie by using subtitles. Still i din't need to understand the language to feel their emotions. I'm surprised this film wasn't nominated for the Oscars in the foreign film category. The director Changmin Choo deserves a lot of praise for his work on this movie. This is the kind of movie everyone should watch atleast once before they die.".

Han Hyojoo is excellent and so are theother actors.The screenplay is executed with brilliance and so is the editing.

	schema:reviewBody "Dong Dong is the God of Toilets. He was born in a toilet he lives near a toilet and he understands life through toilets. The public toilet is a way of understanding world cultures whether it's his friends Chinese Japanese Italian Somali or around the world. The public toilet is unique to its surroundings which as a common and natural function is ultimately above judgment. Disdain and even disgust at other culture's public toilets can even be jingoistic.Public Toilet is a film by Fruit Chan who has taken his internal camera and externalized it audience be damned. The idea of the public toilet is the thread that goes from surface to subtext to depth and back. He's not interested in making a linear film and in the end has created something of a lofi epic. Using Digital Video with little or no concern to aesthetic quality or standard practices he has made something beautiful and not just because of it's projected realism. The footage is ugly as hell at times and the repetition of dirty footage becomes a style of it's own. Ultimately it becomes appealing in the way that Super 8 home movies have become beautiful. Chan is years ahead of his time.Shot on location at the Great Wall Hong Kong Beijing Korea Rome India the variety of images are blunt and fluctuate in the filth of DV. But this helps to tell the story. Hey it's a film called Public Toilet. Were you expecting Merchant  Ivory? Spanning three continents the film follows the lives of three different groups. The first is Dong Dong and his pals. His grandma is in a coma. His friend Tony's little brother is also in the hospital with no cure. The two set off in different directions to find cures. The trip leads them across three continents and finds only existential solutions. Tony travels in India where he finds two brothers who speak Cantonese. They're going to India for the first time to help their dying father and to bathe in the Ganji. Dong Dong goes to Korea where he seeks a number of solutions.This tangentially connects him with another story of a young Korean man who finds a woman living in his outdoor portatoilet. Taking her to a doctor he finds she has no bones. She claims to be a creature of the sea and therefore is like him and alien at the same time. For this he thinks she is from the North. His best friend is also ill and takes off on a trip to find his own cure. Knowing he only has about ten years to live he says a final goodbye to his friend not wanting to put that off for a decade.Dong Dong travels to New York to find his cure. In Times Square he is almost oblivious speaking on his cell phone and standing in a tunnel of snow that connects him to the snow in China outside of the public toilet. While there he meets a Chinese hitman on his last job. He's quitting at the request of his girlfriend. She is at the Great Wall looking for a healer to help her ill mother.Another story involves Dong Dong's friend who has returned to Italy but that story seems to have been cut short because of the tragic death of actor Pietero Dilleti.Terminal illness is a theme that Fruit Chan has visited before and it represents Hong Kong and China's future. Not based around Hong Kong in this film it takes the form of new China searching out its identity and future. Pusan is false histories. Manhattan is violent death for cash. India is the possibility of rebirth. But none dominate and the answer isn't provided or even supposed by the filmmaker.".

But this helps to tell the story. Hey it's a film called Public Toilet. Were you expecting Merchant  Ivory? Spanning three continents the film follows the lives of three different groups. The first is Dong Dong and his pals. His grandma is in a coma. His friend Tony's little brother is also in the hospital with no cure. The two set off in different directions to find cures. The trip leads them across three continents and finds only existential solutions. Tony travels in India where he finds two brothers who speak Cantonese. They're going to India for the first time to help their dying father and to bathe in the Ganji. Dong Dong goes to Korea where he seeks a number of solutions.This tangentially connects him with another story of a young Korean man who finds a woman living in his outdoor portatoilet. Taking her to a doctor he finds she has no bones. She claims to be a creature of the sea and therefore is like him and alien at the same time. For this he thinks she is from the North. His best friend is also ill and takes off on a trip to find his own cure. Knowing he only has about ten years to live he says a final goodbye to his friend not wanting to put that off for a decade.Dong Dong travels to New York to find his cure. In Times Square he is almost oblivious speaking on his cell phone and standing in a tunnel of snow that connects him to the snow in China outside of the public toilet. While there he meets a Chinese hitman on his last job. He's quitting at the request of his girlfriend. She is at the Great Wall looking for a healer to help her ill mother.Another story involves Dong Dong's friend who has returned to Italy but that story seems to have been cut short because of the tragic death of actor Pietero Dilleti.Terminal illness is a theme that Fruit Chan has visited before and it represents Hong Kong and China's future. Not based around Hong Kong in this film it takes the form of new China searching out its identity and future. Pusan is false histories. Manhattan is violent death for cash. India is the possibility of rebirth. But none dominate and the answer isn't provided or even supposed by the filmmaker.";

	schema:reviewBody "Written directed and produced by the improbably named Fruit Chan Public Toilet is a freewheeling  vastly entertaining travelogue shot all over the world on digital video. Coming across as a cheaper funnier and more scatological version of Wim Wenders' Until the end of the world we follow various young people around the planet in amusing vignettes that cross over via telephone calls and chance meetings. Dong dong is nicknamed god of the toilet as he was delivered in a public convenience in Beijing and abandoned there where twenty years later he still hangs out with his friends and muses about bodily functions. As he points out his foreign friends are shocked by toilets like this where there aren't any cubicles just holes in the ground and people sit  squat next to each other. But while you initially suspect the film will just be about this when we follow him to his summer house and an encounter with a boneless mermaid we begin to suspect the film will be stranger and more enchanting than its original limited starting point. From here we visit a hapless assassin in New York who wants the tape of his last kill to be sent to his girlfriend in Hong Kong and join a quest to find a miracle cure that takes us from the great wall of China to the river Ganges in India. A film that manages to be low budget and somewhat improvised but yet a minor epic with more far flung locations than an average Bond film must be considered quite an achievement and certainly a cult film in the making. Some of the stories get resolved while others don't but always the cinematography is somewhat magical and part of the delight of the film is that we never know where we're going to go next. The film focuses on bizarre little events  a boy with leukemia hides his water pistol in a toilet cistern and a pet octopus has a fight with crabs in a fish tank and epic sweeps of the landscape  goat herders in the Himalayas and cranes on New York's liberty island. Even if you have seen the aforementioned Wenders film it is safe to say you still haven't seen anything like this before. Humorous dialogue wacky yet charming characters and a real eye for elegant camera framing combine to make another great film from modern Korea. Although a little flabby at just under two hours this is quirky and innovative filmmaking that may inspire a new generation to pick up their cameras and start shooting movies..".

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't really successful cinematically in the conventional sense. Usually one thinks that the cinematic values of the thing have to be stronger than the narrative values. That's so the body of what we get has blood. But sometimes the fractionated nature of how the thing is stitched together cinematically helps the narrative being. In other words if the thing is broken in some areas it becomes a stronger whole in others. I think that's what happens here.Regular readers of my comments know I harp on and on about narrative folding techniques which are the basic tools of enriching narrative in general. I'm particularly interested when this is done in ways that can only be done in film like certain ways that identities can be blended or that the images that denote certain narrative milestones can be overlapped visually.What strikes me about this project is how formal it is. Oh it looks sloppy and accidental. And the apparent subject matter is literally the discarded parts of life. But the ideas behind it are pretty cerebral indeed. When the French did this  made philosophical essays about the nature of life and perception  and coded it in narrative it got pretty tiresome. And I suppose the ideas in this would be too if I saw them again. But this seems fresh. In my mind I think of it as Tampopo but without the humor any humor at all and dealing with the other end of food.The ideas are those of quantum narrative. Nothing we see has clear edges bones. Everything we see has already had the nourishment taken from it and is given to us as a sort of residue of life instead of life.There's the literal notion of excrement of course. And of health not as wholeness but as a sort of moving the incomplete parts to the right places. Also of trails of cause. The literal stream is that the cast off the residue of one life being that which nourishes even heals another in various ways. This is given to us here as ambiguity about matters of life and death. The metaphors themselves aren't sophisticated and I suppose the crudeness of them in matter and form is something of the point a bodily version of beautiful violence we see in other films.I'd like to point your attention to the most clever thing what I'll call the Quantum Mechanics of the story. Actions are often accomplished by doing the opposite of what is intended. Identities overlap and scintillate. Matters of time jump reverse and overlap. There are huge shifts that occur when you observe and there is one segment the core where we watch a video of someone making a video and then watching it. The video becomes residue a turd and is flushed away only to be recovered in the way that and because of the way? Hindu dead are flushed into a river in a manner that the water becomes cleansing. This video of an event which is one of several lifedeath scenarios set in public toilets... using one of several gunlike things associated with toilets... and referencing the JesusMoses story in a few ways too...This video is presented to us in an amazing compendium of ways. Focus on that if you have trouble getting a foothold here. The quantum mechanical idea is that things shift they jump and the key driver is how and when you look at it or if you do and how you sneak up on that barrier between being in the story literally in the toilet or outside or using it or casting it off. And even that QM idea jumps about itself before you can apply it.So look at the video here something that appears as found in ordinary commercial videos and as made. Look at how we see it the actual footage of a murder where the murderer is murdered. Where the eye jumps from one camera to the next in the most inexplicable ways but which makes sense afterward. This isn't just clever editing of the type that different perspectives encircle the story. It uses the same vocabulary but the jumping about is more arbitrary broken. And so becomes stronger. The octopusmermaid jumps tanks. The casting off becomes the eating.You'll like this you will.The ending is one of the most striking images you will see in any film ever. A driving Andean flute over a pulsing spacemusic guitar line. A terrain that incongruously is beach desert and fertile plain. Is that water or sky? Is this where mountains start or where land ends? Is that forest or cloud on the left there where we desperately grasp for something to anchor our eye and give us permission to be here.Sheep  I suppose  occupying the entire frame then moving to left with growing but calm urgency. Why? An endless line of men appears from the right. Then we shift to align with them horizontal instead of diagonal. Instead of men in a place we have men arrayed defining a place. Wait. Are they men? No they are walking like children aren't they arms swinging as if striding into life.Its worthy of Herzog but so much more deftly set up and may be the most engaging single image you will see all year. Years. The gentle way we leave it is almost as precious. This my friends is what you come to see and the hour and forty minutes beforehand is mere stretching for the race.Please see it. Perhaps we have a new KarWai Wong entering our lives.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Fittingly the scenes of violence are presented suddenly and starkly with minimal cues in the soundtrack which makes them all the more shocking yet realistic.While not exactly a masterpiece this movie is a wellthought out and wellexecuted production much superior to the kind of titillating fluff it is made out to be by some.

They behave like the people living during the Joseon dynasty but as far as I know there was not any incident during that period which can possibly inspire the lurid story of the film and I have never heard about the king's mother presiding over the copulation ritual of her son and daughterinlaw in the next room.But despite its fictional world the ruthless pursuit of power in the palace is a familiar story you have encountered in other stories. The king is dead due to an unidentified cause and the king's motherPark Jiyeong who is actually his stepmother now holds the power to decide who will be the next king. She quickly puts her own son Prince Seong wonKim Dongwuk on the throne and she also swiftly eliminates her opponents including the previous king's fatherinlaw.In such a circumstance like that the previous king's wife HwayeonCho Yeojeong naturally has lots of worry about not only her future and but also her young son's future. He is just a child at present but this innocent kid is already deemed as a potential threat to the kingship and he can be killed at any time if the king's mother and her followers have a chance to get a good reason for that. Some of South Korean audiences have never heard of Lady MacBeth or Richard III but they will be reminded of several bloody incidents during the Joseon dynasty or other dynasties preceding that. King Danjong of the Joseon dynasty was dethroned by his uncle who became the next king and then this young boy was killed later when he was thought to be too much of troublebelieve or not it was said that this horrific decision was strongly supported by his great uncle. In case of Prince YoungChang he was murdered by King Gwanghaegun of the Joseon dynasty just because he was a more legitimate heir to the throne than the king himself. Anything could be committed for absolute power in those days you know.Unlike his ruthless mother Prince Seongwon has other thoughts about his sisterinlaw and we know why. While he was merely a prince he met her in her father's house and he has been obsessed with her since then. His mother already sets him up with the other woman as his queen when he becomes the king but he still wants Hwayeon in spite of his mother's warning. It may be not that bad to sleep with the deceased brother's wifewell he is the king isn't he? but it can be fatal to sleep with someone who can threaten the power.The situation becomes more complicated after another player of this dangerous game of palace intrigue appears in the palace. His name is KwonyooKim Dongwuk who was Hwayeon's former lover in the past. When he tried to elope with Hwayeon before she was sent to the place as the previous king's new wife he was captured and castrated by Hwa yeon's father and now he enters the palace as one of new eunuchs. While he is quickly promoted enough to be near the king he becomes also a little closer to Hwayeon though he lacks a certain body part crucial for rekindling their feelings in the past. Can she trust him as a close ally? And does she really have some feelings for him as he guesses?You never can be sure about them because of the understated but competent performances by Jo Yeojeong and Kim Minjoon. Revealing real feelings in the palace can be a fatal blow to your fate and they must hide their emotions and thoughts as much as possible to survive. Jo Yeo jeong is good as a woman who gradually becomes as ruthless and cunning as her enemies through her need to survive. When she comes to know that the king wants her she see it as an opportunity to win the game and she is determined to manipulate him to turn against her devious mother inlaw.Meanwhile clueless and reckless GuemOKCho Eunji a maid who has served for Hwayeon finds herself in a serious situation way over her head. She is forced to copulate with the king when he is very frustrated over his desire toward Hwayeon and we can say that she is virtually raped but what do you know she feels a lot better to see her changed position as one of the king's concubines. Unfortunately while intoxicated with her newly gained power she does not have the slightest idea about how dangerous the power game can be between the women in the palace.The king's mother is the most powerful and dangerous player in this perilous game and Park Jiyoung gives a juicy villainous performance which ably supplies grand gestures whenever they are required. The king's mother has probably done many terrible things for protecting his son and making the throne ready for him but it is not easy for her to resist the power behind the throne  and now her dear son is becoming one of the major blocks in her grand plan.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with this movie is that it goes in a complex and jumbled direction and some parts of it lead to hardly anything all that effective. The cinematography and acting is good and some parts are just cruel which leaves a bit of a impression on how things worked during the Joseon Dynasty. When it comes to males their manhood means just about everything to themwell for most men at least and their pride comes from the length of it all. Even when they compete it comes down to their ego which is basically a penis measuring competition. The plot contrived of something more than what it is. And when it comes down to it the moral of this movie is to never mess with a man's penis or you will face the consequences. As comedic as that sounds that is basically the message of this movie although everything is a bit jumbled. Besides the penis aspect of it all it sort of reminded me of the 2010 Korean movie The Servant which Jo YeoJeong who is the lead actress in this was part of. Because both movies are erotic and sexual while dealing with the distance a man would go for their love or the person they lust over. While also dealing with a person that is constantly getting in the way of if all. So the plot in this is basically about a woman that tries to save his lover's life when they decided to run away together and get caught. And thus she volunteers to become a concubine for the king in order to save her lover's life. But soon a bunch of conspiracies happen in the palace when the king passes away and the prince is in love well in lust over the concubine way before she became a concubine and finds her in the palace before the king's death. And during the conspiracy the queen who is very cruel and cold gets involved as well. And there is constant arguing and conflict between the selfish prince and the tyrant queen because of the concubine. And later the concubine finds her previous lover but is shocked to know he has become a eunuch. So yeah this movie is quite a plot but besides few slightly shocking and erotic scenes nothing really makes this movie stand out. After the movie is finished nothing much about is memorable and the plot just doesn't stick. The plot isn't bad in fact some parts of it is actually quite well written but there really isn't anything special about it and is unfocused as times. When it comes down to the core of it all besides the whole penis thing is that just about all the characters in this act for their own self interest...I guess somethings never change. I give this movie a 6 because the climax slightly upgraded this movie.610".

	schema:reviewBody "The producers of the Korean disaster movie Haeundae probably had enough of water and massive flooding in their blockbuster film that they had turned their sights and efforts into making an action adventure that's just the opposite this time playing with fire and bombs in an action comedy that at first glance looked very much like Jan de Bont's Speed starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. But save for some slight narrative references Quick is very much its own film with impressive bike and vehicular stunts in addition to the typical Korean sprawling narrative that expands it beyond a simplistic chase film.Quick begins with a prologue about a love triangle gone awry. Super cool biker KiSoo Lee MinKi is seen leading a pack of mean bikers down a road during the Independence Day holiday and is nonchalant to the pursuit of ChoonSim Kang HyeWon his girlfriend whom he's trying to dump who in turn is being chased on a bike by another suitor MyungSik Kim InKwon. The scene ends with one big mess of an accident and pile up that leave things unresolved and the events here will have its repercussions some six years later where the film proper picks up.KiSoo has become a bike courier putting his skills to legitimate use in order to earn a living. ChoonSim is now one part of a massive Korean Kpop all girls group like so many out there and unknowingly hires KiSoo's services to get her from one location to another. However a switch of a helmet was made one that contains a bomb and soon both KiSoo and Choon Sim find themselves held ransom by an anonymous bomber who communicates with them through a mobile device  that they are to deliver bombs to designated spots within 30 minutes each mission and should they fail or alert the cops or remove the helmet or do anything that's detrimental to their mission they'll get blown up. So begins a madcap race around town to perform the dastardly deeds and for MyungSik now a traffic cop sort of engaged as well to bring them to justice.Narratively this may seem like Speed with its bomber dictating the terms that the couple have got to go through and wielding tremendous power over his hostages to do his bidding. And the final act was really quite like the Hollywood film with it taking place on a train and ChoonSim vested up with an improvised explosive device. But what you have to tip your hat to is the story writers having to tie up all the loose ends in order not to make the selection of victims quite random as well as managing an all out gang land rivalry that's taking place beneath all the bombings leaving you guessing just who the perpetrator might really be.And in true Korean movie style as previously discussed with screenwriter Lee ShinHo Quick has its plate full of bumbling police officers who get outwitted and snooked almost every step of the way right down to lean and mean SWAT members being anything but capable of addressing the simplest of threats and orders leaving it open to plenty of slapstick comedy situations. And the genuinely funny moments in the film don't even have to try too hard to bring on the laughs with most of the cast being adapt to perfecting their respective comic timing for maximum effect.But what truly stood out are the countless of motorcycle and vehicle stunts that pepper the film landscape since this is after all touted as an action film first and foremost and has enough meticulously designed sequences to thrill. The outtakes provide a glimpse at what was practical stunts involving daring stuntpeople who risked life and limb to make the death defying stunts believable leaving the rest of the more hokey aspects to computer generated images. Unfortunately for the filmmakers with experience in dealing with spectacular special effects it seemed their touch of experience got lost here with efforts drawing too much attention to themselves with a constant overexposure of scenes that betrayed a probable studio or soundstage setting coupled with some CGI that were left quite unrefined that they stood out quite obviously like a sore thumb.Quick despite its flaws still had enough in its tank to entertaining an audience out for a light hearted action adventure spectacle that don't cometo our screens too often these days and story and funnier bits to thank for making the film that way.".

The outtakes provide a glimpse at what was practical stunts involving daring stuntpeople who risked life and limb to make the death defying stunts believable leaving the rest of the more hokey aspects to computer generated images. Unfortunately for the filmmakers with experience in dealing with spectacular special effects it seemed their touch of experience got lost here with efforts drawing too much attention to themselves with a constant overexposure of scenes that betrayed a probable studio or soundstage setting coupled with some CGI that were left quite unrefined that they stood out quite obviously like a sore thumb.Quick despite its flaws still had enough in its tank to entertaining an audience out for a light hearted action adventure spectacle that don't cometo our screens too often these days and story and funnier bits to thank for making the film that way.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie from South Korea is easily one of the best movies of the year 2011 and I hope it gets further attention and a world wide release in the rest of the world within the next month. It's sure that I will try anything to purchase a copy of this stunning movie that I saw by pure coincidence on a plane flight a few days ago.The movie tells the story of a motorcycle courier that gets in a dangerous situation when a madman forces him to deliver a couple of bombs to several addresses. If he refuses he risks the life of his old love that wears a motorcycle helmet that will explode if the courier arrives to late menaces the madman or gets involved with the police. The whole scenario leads to a stunning rat race with a furious and emotional showdown involving philosophical topics such as life death love friendship forgiveness truth and lies.This entertaining movie offers many different styles. First of all it has some great slapstick humour that made me laugh really hard a couple of times. It's rather hard to make me laugh but I really appreciate this kind of humour thanks to many amusing characters and a very good acting.As a next point this movie has some spectacular motorcycle action scenes reminding me of The fast and the furious Speed or Twelve rounds. This movie doesn't give you a break and is an exciting high speed adventure.This film even has more to offer as there are some great suspense scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat and the story offers a couple of interesting elements and introduces some interesting connections between the different characters of the movie.In the end let's note that the movie is filmed in a very modern way and is a true high quality product that might please to a large audience in the world. Anybody that likes spectacular action movies has found his or her new bible with this movie.On a personal note I fell once again in love with the charming and cute female actors from South Korea in this movie and the authentic male characters.If you're able to get your hands on a copy of this movie pay the price you need to pay and you surely won't disappointed. The movie is energizing fresh and highly entertaining. South Korea proves once again that they actually make the best movies in the whole world and they do succeed in any genre as they prove with this outstanding action flick.".

But this is one of those movies where it surpasses the trailer and goes beyond. The comedic elements are done right and the right moments to the point I couldn't help but have a grin on my face while watching and some parts got me laughing. Sure this movie is absurd and over the top but that is the direction it's trying to go and it knows which direction it wants to head and it works. The actress Kang HyeWon is not just a pretty face but she is a good actress that can pull off comedic roles such as the one in this. Even the action sequences are done very well for a movie that is made outside of Hollywood and I was impressed especially with the CGI scenes. This movie reminded me of a comedic and over the top version of the movies Speed and Transporter 3. So this movie is almost a perfect blend of action and slapstick comedy that is so very entertaining from start to finish.8.210".

	schema:reviewBody "This pleasant yet dated little 1960 family movie arrives is part of Columbia TriStar's Ray Harryhausen Signature Collection. However unlike Jason and the Argonauts First Men in the Moon The 7th Voyage of Sinbad The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and 20 Million Miles to Earth there's not much here to thrill the average Harryhausen fan. Other than a quick battle with a giant alligator and a dinosized squirrel that's more mirthful than menacing The 3 Worlds of Gulliver doesn't depend on Harryhausen's famed stopmotion monsters to menace our hero. Instead it features cinematic effects that make seafarer Dr. Lemuel Gulliver 7th Voyage's Sinbad Kerwin Mathews a skyscrapertall behemoth on the isle of Lilliput and a dollsized castaway witch in the court of Brobdingnag. The script is just a wire hanger for the gianttiny effects scenes but the story moves briskly even a pair of treacly songbreaks don't get much in the way and it should particularly appeal to the under10 set who haven't yet become jaundiced to anything predating modern CGI gloss. Mathews is plenty wholeseome and likable in a role first offered to Danny Kaye and no kidding Jack Lemmon. And Gulliver's fiancwife June Thorburn is perfunctory but not too much of a drip. Look for Peter Bull Dr. Strangelove's Russian ambassador in a small role. Of course the script is loosely based on the first half of Jonathan Swift's ribald 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels. While the book remains one of the hardestbiting social satires ever to draw blood from the pompous and the political few of those teeth remain in this truncated adaptation. Nonetheless the Lilliputian social order and its Emperor's singleminded war against a neighboring island  fought over an absurdly trivial matter inflated to genocidal levels by unbending ideological fervor  are still recognizable targets. Visually Harryhausen's tallsmall effects are well done though a viewer accustomed to more recent breakthroughs should expect to see the seams showing and hear the floorboards creaking. For a good number of fans Bernard Herrmann's fine score is the chief appeal here.".

	schema:reviewBody "The special effects that let Gulliver be a giant in Lilliput and a mite in Brobdingnag are by the reigning genius of the day Ray Harryhausen but writerdirector Jack Sher's 1960 film wisely uses them only in the service of the story.  They have held up quite well in part because they were used with restraint to begin with and they do nothing to interrupt or distract from the story and its points.  A minor exception could be the fight with a giant animated crocodile that must have been damn fun for the effects team but even it is kept within reason.Is this a film for children or a film for adults?  The tooeasy answer is that it is obviously a children's version There is none of the trumpedup insanity element that the drearybutgreatlooking 1996 TV movie shoehorned in for cheap drama.  Neither is there the despair or genuine misanthropy of the book.Only Lilliput and Brobdingnag are visited.  No Laputa Balnibari Luggnag Glubbdubdrib Japan or Houyhnhnms.  The third world is Gulliver's own normalsized world.  Gulliver puts out the fire in Lilliput by spitting wine.  In the book the wine has been processed by Gulliver's bladder before he douses the fire with it.  Many characters though not all are all done in a cartoonish way clearly aimed at children.  The travels are framed within the addedon love story of Gulliver and his fiance Elizabeth.These are good choices.  Children are inherently interested in the size contrasts.  It must add something to the experience that first they identify with the Lilliputians but later identify with Gulliver. Spitting the wine is good enough.  The cartoonishness makes the characters less threatening than they could have been.  The love story is light and easy to follow and promotes marriage.There are even a couple of musical numbers one a love song that Gulliver sings.  The Bernard Herrmann score is a fine complement to the film as you would expect from the composer of music for the original Psycho Citizen Kane Magnificent Ambersons Ghost and Mrs. Muir Day the Earth Stood Still Alfred Hitchcock Presents tv Have Gun Will Travel tv Perry Mason tv Twilight Zone Cape Fear 1962 Taxi Driver and on and on and on.But Sher's script and direction have preserved some important points and spirit from the book The gratitude of princes is shortlived.  The causes of war can be shockingly petty.  Vanity and unreason among the powerful make truth an early casualty in the pursuit of power.  The various unpleasant characters and the few nice ones actually reflect things inside all of us. If it's okay for an adult to be reminded of these things in a playful way certainly more playful than the original then this film will amuse and inform that adult.And what are Gulliver and Elizabeth doing when their ballfield sized marriage license falls over them like a tent and King Brob peeking under it is moved to say You're right dear.  I'd better marry them at once.Ultimately it has to go down in the books as a children's film but surely an uncommon one an intelligent adaptation if abridged and lighthearted of a great classic that stands on its own for entertainment and if you like can whet your child's appetite for the book when that time arrives.Like the tackedon love story there is a tackedon ending that suggests that the whole thing might have been a dream.  I originally found this annoying.These days watching with my little girl I find that I'm glad for the admittedly sorethumb reminder that the value of the story is not in whether those characters do or don't exist but in what the story says about what is within us.  As with all such points in the film you'll have to talk with your child a bit to be sure that it comes across but what a pleasure  to find a film that sparks such a discussion with your child.

	schema:reviewBody "The 3 Worlds of Gulliver could easily have been made into an adult satire as Jonathan Swift originally intended but I daresay Columbia Pictures would not have realized too much box office had they gone that route.I saw it as a 13 year old back in the day in theater which is really the only way to appreciate the special effects of Ray Harryhausen. It's a wonderful film for a juvenile but later in reading about the times one can appreciate what Swift was trying to say and the humorous way he said it.At the time Gulliver's Travels was originally written the age of the religious wars of the 17th century was coming to an end. Swift was a member of the Tory Party who sought to put an end to the War of Spanish Succession which the Whigs in power seemed to drag on and on. For the Whig view of the conflict I suggest strongly reading Winston Churchill's Life of Marlborough which equates the Tories of the day with the BaldwinChamberlain led Tories of the Thirties. Swift looked about and just saw a lot of carnage with power politics and religion all jumbled together so that you could not tell where one left off and the other began. Gulliver's Travels is how Swift saw the world of his day religious intolerance and a budding imperialism. Swift was in fact an ordained minister who apparently had a vision that HIS way of worship was not necessarily THE way of worship for all. A novel idea back then expressed in the war the Lilliputians and Blefescuans wage over which end of the egg to break. The Brobdingnag tale where Gulliver once a giant in Lilliput is now a small wee creature in a land of giants. And these giants think that because they're bigger and mightier they can rule over all. They see Gulliver and his bride as pets to kept as long as they amuse. It's a classic commentary against imperialism unusual in its day and made Swift most unpopular in high places.These issues aren't for kids of the Saturday matine crowd and Kerwin Matthews as Gulliver is playing for them. Matthews had a great career doing these fantasy things and he was real good in them. Maybe because he played the roles absolutely straight and we believed because he believed the part.Ray Harryhausen is at the top of his game and the film holds up very well. Even better in fact when you know the background from which the material came from.".

Sher  Arthur Ross adapt for the screen with a loose reworking of the 18thcentury English novel Gulliver's Travels written by Jonathan Swift. And music maestro Bernard Herrmann provides the score.Swift's biting satirical novel has been watered down and given a romantic edge for the family market. That said as the kids are enjoying the froth and tickle the adults will note that there's just enough caustic comment in the piece to get the message across. This adaptation has slimmed down the four parts of Swift's work to just the two Lilliput land of the little people and Brobdingnag land of the giants. With our intrepid normal sized hero Gulliver and his stowaway fiance Elizabeth under threat either way.While the script has its pleasing moments it is still only serving as a bridging work for Harryhausen's effects to be shown. Be it the giant and tiny people sequences or the perils that come to our undersized protagonists courtesy of a Gator and a Squirrel it's these that the children will find beguiling. This however can not be said for Harryhausen aficionados or adults more accustomed to more modern advancements. For this is bottom rung for Harryhausen not bad at all yet although there's a charm here and no one should ever dismiss the painstaking amount of time it took him to weave it together the work is creaky and lacking the dynamism so befitting his best work.Major bonus' come with the swirling and pounding score from Herrmann and the vibrant performance of Matthews. The role of Gulliver was first offered to Danny Kaye which naturally makes sense given Kaye's previous work on Hans Christian Andersen some years earlier. That it was also offered to Jack Lemmon tho makes no sense at all. Anyway Matthews got the gig and following on from his fine work in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad he laid down a marker in the fantasy adventure genre that secured him fondness from legions of fans throughout the years. A safe colourful and pleasant enough piece if ultimately not one for most fantasy adventure fans to revisit often. 610".

	schema:headline " Fun family tale with special effects by the great Ray Harryhausen and utterly shot in Spain";
	schema:reviewBody "A poor Englishman doctor called Gulliver Kerwin Matthews has adventurer plans  so nothing keeps him in the little town he lives  not even his girlfriend Elisabeth June Thornburn who wishes to marry him . He signs on to a ship to India in spite of objections his beautiful fiance . But in a storm he's washed ashore and discovers a fantasy land of small inhabitants called Lilliput in the East Indies where everyone is about two inches tall . Later on  he managed to convince them he's harmless and is accepted as one of their villagers  but their king wants to utilize him in war against his enemies . After that  Gulliver goes to land of Bobdingnag where inhabits giant people . This is an amusing adventure movie  a colorful family rendition of Jonathan Swift's classic as well as satiric novel written in 1726 . Many scenarios have been constructed in miniature  others have been made by special techniques and remaining are staged by natural outdoors from Spain such as Alczar de Segovia Segovia vila Palacio de La Granja De San Ildefonso palace La Granja San Ildefonso Segovia Castilla y Len and Paltja d'Aro Girona Catalonia . Flavorful performance from Kerwin Matthews  Jo Morrow  Lee Patterson  Gregoire Aslan  Basil Sydney  Martin Benson  among others . Adequate and spectacular art direction by Gil Parrondo who subsequently would achieve Academy Award for Patton . Rousing and evocative score of Bernard Herrmann  Hitchcock's regular . Glimmer and glamorous scenarios well photographed by Wilkie Cooper . Professional though uneven direction by filmmaker Jack SherThe highlights of the movie are the great visual effects by craftsman Ray Harryhausen  including his ordinary monsters using his customary system Dynamation . After three scifi monster films such as The Beast from 20000 Fathoms  20 Million Miles to Earth  It Came from Beneath the Sea and work with Willis O'Brien in Mighty Joe Young and on an Irwin Allen documentary titled  The animal world  Harryhausen did the effects work for The 7th Voyage of Sinbad or Sinbad and the princess 1958 also starred by Kerwin Matthews  his first splitscreen film shot entirely in color which was highlighted by Harryhausen's mythological monsters interacting with actors .

	onyx:emotionText "A poor Englishman doctor called Gulliver Kerwin Matthews has adventurer plans  so nothing keeps him in the little town he lives  not even his girlfriend Elisabeth June Thornburn who wishes to marry him . He signs on to a ship to India in spite of objections his beautiful fiance . But in a storm he's washed ashore and discovers a fantasy land of small inhabitants called Lilliput in the East Indies where everyone is about two inches tall . Later on  he managed to convince them he's harmless and is accepted as one of their villagers  but their king wants to utilize him in war against his enemies . After that  Gulliver goes to land of Bobdingnag where inhabits giant people . This is an amusing adventure movie  a colorful family rendition of Jonathan Swift's classic as well as satiric novel written in 1726 . Many scenarios have been constructed in miniature  others have been made by special techniques and remaining are staged by natural outdoors from Spain such as Alczar de Segovia Segovia vila Palacio de La Granja De San Ildefonso palace La Granja San Ildefonso Segovia Castilla y Len and Paltja d'Aro Girona Catalonia . Flavorful performance from Kerwin Matthews  Jo Morrow  Lee Patterson  Gregoire Aslan  Basil Sydney  Martin Benson  among others . Adequate and spectacular art direction by Gil Parrondo who subsequently would achieve Academy Award for Patton . Rousing and evocative score of Bernard Herrmann  Hitchcock's regular . Glimmer and glamorous scenarios well photographed by Wilkie Cooper . Professional though uneven direction by filmmaker Jack SherThe highlights of the movie are the great visual effects by craftsman Ray Harryhausen  including his ordinary monsters using his customary system Dynamation . After three scifi monster films such as The Beast from 20000 Fathoms  20 Million Miles to Earth  It Came from Beneath the Sea and work with Willis O'Brien in Mighty Joe Young and on an Irwin Allen documentary titled  The animal world  Harryhausen did the effects work for The 7th Voyage of Sinbad or Sinbad and the princess 1958 also starred by Kerwin Matthews  his first splitscreen film shot entirely in color which was highlighted by Harryhausen's mythological monsters interacting with actors . Because Harryhausen worked alone on his stopmotion animation sequences the filming of these could often take as long as two years the most famous example of the kind of patience required being the exciting skeleton sword fight sequence in his most popular film Jason and the Argonauts 1963 in which Harryhausen often shot no more than 13 frames of film onehalf second of elapsed time per day .

	schema:reviewBody "The 3 Worlds Of Gulliver I first saw on the big screen and in color and later saw it a few times on television but not for a quarter century or so. So I had to rewatch the 100 minute film. Kerwin Matthews from The Seven Voyages Of Sinbad does a surprisingly good job as the semizomboid but buff Dr. Lemuel Gulliver. He plays Gulliver as a real guy his genuineness makes up for his sometimes wooden reactions. June Thorburn plays his fiance then wife Elizabeth. She's sufficient eye candy and that alone is reason enough to justify her sweet insertion into the tale she is not in Swift's novel. Gotta love her silly 'Don't ever wanna lay eyes on you again moment' after Gulliver objects to her navete regarding the purchase of an old shack. None of the other actors who play any of the other characters leaves that great an impression although the girl who plays Glumdalclitch Sherry Alberoni a child star on the original The Mickey Mouse Club on television does a solid job with the little she's given. Her petulance and warmth make her the only semirealistic character in all of Lilliput land of the tint people or Brobdingnag land of the giants.This film features less of the stop motion photography Harryhausen was noted for and more visual tricks involving split screens and traveling mattes to make use of forced perspective in portraying Gulliver against his smaller and larger costars. Cinematographer Wilkie Cooper is credited in the film but realistically he was in effect just a cameraman for Harryhausen.The story is a simplified version of the Swift novel. Gulliver reluctantly aids the King of Lilliput in his war against the rival state of Blefescu. The war is over which is the proper end of an egg to be opened. After Gulliver steals the Blefescuan Navy ships the King is still not satisfied and orders Gulliver to commit genocide on Blefescu. As a doctor and man of honor he refuses and is accused of treason. He then flees and washes up on the shores of Brobdingnag where Glumdalclitch finds him. The King of Brobdingnag offers to barter for him then accepts the girl as his protector. Fortuitously Elizabeth ended up there when she stowed aboard Gulliver's ship. He had been washed overboard to Lilliput and the ship later destroyed. She seems to have been the lone survivor. The King's doctor accuses Gulliver of witchcraft after he saves the Queen's life with modern medicine and the two lovers married by the King are persecuted. While the Lilliputians and Blefescuans are small in mind regarding politics the Brobdingnagians are backwards regarding science and medicine. Glumdalclitch therefore rescues the couple tosses them into a basket and throws them down a river which washes out to the sea where the two end up back in England at film's fade. Yes there's some petty philosophizing by Gulliver but it works in a campy way. Even the ending which questions whether or not the adventures were all a dream while trite is not too big a deal because the film handles everything in a lighthearted way. Had the film been more sober in its claims and portrayal such an ending would have bombed especially since it veers so far from the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reteaming of Kerwin Mathews Bernard Herrman and Ray Harryhausen after the success of THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD may not be the classic we were hoping for but instead is a kiddieorientated version of the classic Jonathan Swift tale GULLIVER'S TRAVELS with enough ingredients to make it enjoyable for adults too. Sure at times the film is sentimental and goes overboard in promoting a strong moral message but this is never offensive as in recent productions. In retrospect it all seems rather charming and a little dated but that's what makes it unique. This is a colourful and lively romp which is fun for adults and children alike.I'm sure the classic tale is familiar to most readers so I won't bother readdressing it other than that this film concerns solely on the two kingdoms of Lilliput and Brobdingnan ignoring the other minor lands of Swift's tale and concentrating on the most wellremembered ones. The first half of the film concerns Lilliput and is boosted by some fine effects from Harryhausen which involve lots and lots of back and forward projection which is never less than convincing. Indeed the classic scene of Gulliver being tied down by the little people is present and as realistic as you could ever want it. The characters are interesting the story good and bolstered by the likable presence of Kerwin Mathews one of the most naturally charming of fantasy actors from the period who always lifted any movie he appeared in another good one is JACK THE GIANT KILLER.The second half of the film concerning the land of the giants isn't quite as good but again the special effects of the miniature Mathews and Thorburn are better than average. Although it drags a little at times the characters are interesting if not likable and thankfully some stopmotion animation is interested by Harryhausen to enliven the proceedings. The creations include a brieflyseen but genuinely impressive giant squirrel which abducts Mathews miniature animals kept in cages and a miniature crocodile which then proceeds to battle Mathews in a fight to the death a classic action moment which comes as a reward to those looking for Sinbadstyle monster action.THE 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVER is a film worth watching for the talent involved alone. As well as Mathews the quality cast includes the lovely June Thorburn as the love interest and a whole host of familiar British character actors  including Charles Lloyd Pack in a meaty role for a change as an evil wizard  playing the miniature people and the giants. Bernard Herrman's score is also lively and always entertaining whilst Harryhausen seamlessly integrates the large and small people so that you never for a moment doubt the quality of his effects. Not a classic but a fine friendly oldfashioned adventure as heartwarming and cliffhanging in equal measure as you could want. A TVmovie adaptation with lots of unnecessarilyadded extraneous scenes with Ted Danson followed in the mid 90's.".

Taking a position as a ship's physician Gulliver hopes to earn enough money to pay for a cottage but he doesn't realise that Elizabeth has stowed aboard the vessel to be with him.During a storm Gulliver is washed overboard and finds himself in the land of Lilliput where he is a giant compared to the inhabitants. After failing to solve a conflict between the Lilliputians and the neighbouring Blefuscudians who are at war over which end of an egg should be cracked before eating he escapes only to end up in Brobdingnag where he is the tiny one along with Elizabeth with whom he is reunited. Treated as toys by the Brobdingnagian king Grgoire Aslan and accused of witchcraft by royal sorcerer Makovan Charles Lloyd Pack Gulliver and Elizabeth escape back to England with the help of a young Brobdingnagian girl Glumdalclitch Sherri Alberoni.Fantasy film legend Ray Harryhausen delivers a whole host of excellent special effects in The 3 World's of Gulliver utilising hundreds of travelling mattes and some very convincing forced perspective to achieve marvellous results. However those looking for lots of Harryhausen's trademark stop motion work might well be a little disappointed there's a cool animated crocodile with which Gulliver battles a mini menagerie and a rather motheaten looking squirrel which is far from the man's finest work. But that's it.Still with such a timeless tale performed by a wonderful cast it's hard not to have a good time with this charming fantasy which not only astounds with its stunning visuals but also acts as a satire about politics and imperialism and as an indictment of human nature illustrating man's many weaknesses vanity pride ignorance jealousy stubbornness etc. as per Jonathan Swift's novel or so I believecan't say I've ever read it.6.510 rounded up to 7 for IMDb.".

After failing to solve a conflict between the Lilliputians and the neighbouring Blefuscudians who are at war over which end of an egg should be cracked before eating he escapes only to end up in Brobdingnag where he is the tiny one along with Elizabeth with whom he is reunited. Treated as toys by the Brobdingnagian king Grgoire Aslan and accused of witchcraft by royal sorcerer Makovan Charles Lloyd Pack Gulliver and Elizabeth escape back to England with the help of a young Brobdingnagian girl Glumdalclitch Sherri Alberoni.Fantasy film legend Ray Harryhausen delivers a whole host of excellent special effects in The 3 World's of Gulliver utilising hundreds of travelling mattes and some very convincing forced perspective to achieve marvellous results. However those looking for lots of Harryhausen's trademark stop motion work might well be a little disappointed there's a cool animated crocodile with which Gulliver battles a mini menagerie and a rather motheaten looking squirrel which is far from the man's finest work. But that's it.Still with such a timeless tale performed by a wonderful cast it's hard not to have a good time with this charming fantasy which not only astounds with its stunning visuals but also acts as a satire about politics and imperialism and as an indictment of human nature illustrating man's many weaknesses vanity pride ignorance jealousy stubbornness etc. as per Jonathan Swift's novel or so I believecan't say I've ever read it.6.510 rounded up to 7 for IMDb.";

At the time to me it was very slow reading and I quickly lost interest. I knew the story from abbreviated versions of the novel and did not pick up on the political ramifications of the story. Almost 35 years later the book remains a far off memory. However in studying cinema and watching this fetching looking version the things that I missed are now as clear as crystal. Difference in appearances being more popular than royal leaders and the ability to solve issues easier than those in charge makes him enemy of the state. He is Gulliver a friendly giants from England visit who has landed on the island of Lilliput of little people the size of his finger. They first think that he is some sort of monster but his abilities to do things for them it which they couldn't imagine being done making popular for the moment. The underlying meanings hidden inside the plot are still very potent today and even if you don't pick those up on your initial reading or viewing of any of the Gulliver's Travels movies you can still enjoy the movie for the fun fantasy that it is.As with several other Ray Harryhausen movies the special effects use the best of stop motion. Kerwin Mathews is an excellent hero. Some tidbits of minor characters make you think that there will be a few subplots but they pretty much disappear with the rainstorm that Gulliver blows away. The film switched gears half way through when Gulliver finds himself in a world full of giants which gives the reminder that we are all small fish on a large planet and our differences are not meant that I divide us but make us closer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels is a classic satire from 1726. I once managed to get around to reading his A Modest Proposal in which  apparently in all sincerity  he suggests that the problem of overpopulation and malnutrition in his native Ireland can be cured simply by having the Irish eat their own children.Well that's what satire is I guess. A send up of current social issues with an element of viciousness that's usually absent from a mere parody. Swift must have found the mores of his time easy targets just by reducing their characteristics to the absurd. Are the Irish causing you problems? Get rid of them.In The 3 Worlds of Gulliver the problems dealt with are 1 the causes of war among the tiny Lilliputians and 2 science versus religion among the giant Brobdingnagians. I think some other adventures were deleted. I seem to remember Yahoos and Houyhnhnms and maybe one or two others. But the elisions are okay. Just two of the strange worlds Gulliver visits are enough for one movie. The third world of the title is his home in England. I don't know that this story has the same impact as it originally did. Maybe you need some kind of Skeleton Key to pick up the more arcane references as with Finnegans Wake Alice in Wonderland or The Master and Margarita. However the broader points of the satire should be clear enough to everyone except the kids who will be tickled by it because it's such a colorful fairy tale.Kerwin Mathews is an idealistic English doctor Lemuel Gulliver who is washed overboard at sea and finds himself on an island inhabited by tiny people the vaguely Arabic Lilliputians. Once the little people get over their astonishment  because compared to them Gulliver is really HUGE  they try to talk him into using his immense strength to destroy their enemies on a neighboring island. Man are the Lilliputians petty especially the sputtering king. I have abiding faith in the trustworthiness and reliability of any man that I can kill he announces. He's dying to go to war and kill his enemies because they open their eggs from the big side rather than the small side as civilized Lilliputians do. The perceptive adults in the audience are at this point permitted to explain to the children that sometimes wars are fought for silly reasons. He wants a warmonger for a Prime Minister although I don't need a Prime Minister to fight a war. I need one to blame if it goes wrong. Here please explain to the children the meaning of the phrase The buck stops there. Gulliver promises to end the war and he does by stealing the enemy's fleet so they can never attack Lilliput. This doesn't satisfy the king because it wasn't a proper war. How can you have a war without sacrifice and heroism? And besides since Gulliver robbed the enemy of their fleet we now have no need for Admirals and everybody in the Navy is now out of a job.A disgusted Gulliver finally manages to get off Lilliput but then lands on Brobdingnagia a land of superstitious giants living a Medieval life style. J. B. S. Haldane once wrote a famous essay explaining why giant humans were physically impossible. At first they treat him well an amusing toy for one of their gentle children a pretty young girl named Glumdalclitch. But soon after he beats the selfimportant king in a game of chess and exposes the court magician as an ignoramus he falls out of favor. He's smarter than they are. After all he's a doctor and knows chemistry and science. The Brobdingnagians believe in witches and some of the stunts pulled by Gulliver  treating the Queen's upset stomach with a mixture of opium and paragoric  smack not just of elitism but of witchcraft. Besides there is still that damme chess game. Who but a witch could check mate the King? So the Royal Court tries to burn him. Glumdalclitch makes it possible for him to escape.Gulliver barely makes it back to England. We see him on the beach with his bride who was swept up in his adventures. It's not a happy ending. Nobody finds satisfaction right in his own back yard like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. His wife asks what will happen to the Lilliputians and the benighted Brobdingnagians. They'll always be with us he admits with chagrin. And what of Glumdalclitch the truly benign and compassionate kid who looked after them? Waiting to be born answers Gulliver solemnly. I don't think Dean Swift would have been surprised to find that 280 years later she's still waiting. Maybe as I age my emotional apparatus is becoming more primitive or something but I found that final exchange rather moving.There are many special visual effects but only two instances of Ray Harryhausen's stopmotion animals one a squirrel and the other a crocodile. This isn't a monster movie. Bernard Hermann's score doesn't sound much like that of a monster movie either  no galumphing BROOP broop BROOP broop. It echoes the lighthearted quality of the story itself and the composer only rarely lapses into his usual effects. I think it's the best score Hermann wrote for any of his fantasies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Growing up in the sixties I was one of those early fans of Ray Harryhausen films. I remember the first one I saw was JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS followed by MYTERIOUS ISLAND. I found the special effects in both to be fascinating and read what I could on how they were done. They were movies that captured my imagination and spurred me on to learn about Jules Verne and Greek mythology. Somehow THE THREE WORLDS OF GULLIVER eluded me and I looked forward to finally getting the chance to watch it.Based on the GULLIVER'S TRAVELS by Jonathan Swift the film uses only a portion of the novel here the visits to Lilliput and Brobdingnag. Those familiar with the book will know that it was a political satire of the time that has been watered down over the years via first a cartoon version and lastly by a terrible Jack Black film. I'm sad to say this film doesn't do it much better.Gulliver is a doctor who wants to marry his girlfriend Elizabeth. But he refuses to do so until he can financially support her. With this in mind he leaves England for the high seas. To his chagrin Elizabeth has snuck on board as well. During a storm Gulliver is washed overboard and comes to on the shores of a country called Lilliput.This may not seem odd except that the people of Lilliput stand about 6 inches tall compared to Gulliver. Mistaking him for an enemy they tie him down to the beach. He soon wins their favor and in return for help building a boat aids them when he can. But problems arise when they want him to defeat their enemies the inhabitants of Blefuscu. It seems the two islands are at war over which end of an egg should be broken before it is eaten the small or large end. Gulliver tows away the navy of Blefuscu thinking that will end things but the Lilliputian king wants them destroyed. Before leaving Gulliver must find a way to bring peace to the two countries.He does eventually leave and ends up washed ashore once again this time on the island of Brobdingnag. This time the reverse is true Gulliver is now 6 inches tall compared to the inhabitants here. Fortunately Elizabeth was stranded here and the pair are reunited. But an envious court alchemist warns the king that Gulliver must be a witch. Gulliver is pitted in battle against a crocodile that seems giant to him. Their idyllic life threatened Gulliver and Elizabeth must find a way off the island before they are tossed aside or killed for witchcraft.In watching the film the story of Gulliver as told in the novel is obviously too intricate to bring forth from the written word to the screen. The subtle nuance of the story is lost in the over the top production values given the costuming and acting among the characters of both islands. It just doesn't work. Kerwin Matthews who had appeared in the earlier Harryhausen film THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD seems more bored than anything here.But the most disappointing thing is the special effects used here. I realize that CGI was far in the future when this film was made but the matting process used makes one image seem slightly soft and out of focus while the other is clear. And the most loved thing that Harryhausen did the stop motion animation of his films is used sparingly here with just a short sequence of a squirrel that wanders off with Gulliver and the aforementioned crocodile.In reading the background on the film in the enclosed booklet the reason for these problems is apparent. Columbia had been working on the film prior to Harryhausen and his team being brought in rather than this being a project he worked on start to finish. It may not have been a case of his heart not being completely in it but the difference between this film and those classics he left behind is obvious.The best part of this package from Twilight Time is the extras something they don't normally include much of. This time around we get an isolated score and effects track an audio commentary track featuring film historians Randall Cook C. Courtney Joyner and Steven C. Smith THE MAKING OF THE 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVER short THE HARRYHAUSEN CHRONICLES a short documentary on Harryhausen THIS IS DYNAMATION! a short describing the process of stop motion animation Harryhausen used and the original theatrical trailer. The quality of the picture here is the usual top notch for any and all Twilight Time releases and once again is limited to just 3000 copies. If you must have every Harryhausen film in your collection then you should make sure one of those copies is yours.".

But adults had better beware. They might find themselves losing interest after the first halfhour.";

And I could have lived with that perfectly. Unfortunately The 3 Worlds of Gulliver does not achieve this level of entertainment.First of all the actor playing Gulliver is a bore. Well he probably would have gotten away with it hadn't his part been so badly written. The Gulliver character is not discovering anything in this movie  he is a patronizing and moralistic missionary man basically just out there to explain the achievements of his 'modern' culture to the primitives. So don't expect adventure expect sermons.Secondly the jokes aren't funny. They are all about how stupid foreign cultures are and how much they need a lesson in democracy. The only really funny character is a young gothic girl who has a short appearance towards the end of the movie and the actress is not even credited!.Thirdly the production values are poor. Ray Harryhausen worked on this  and it hardly shows. The cheesy special effects are OK with me but the whole doesn't even look attractive in a nostalgic sort of way.Check this out if you must maybe your kids will like it. But if you have respect for your children show them the Max Fleischer cartoon. It's ten times funnier and far less pretentious.".

It's no denying we'd generally like to look better and weigh lesser and these are ready made premises that allows a comedy to be built upon clearly taking a swipe at these flimsy wants. Japan had a restaurateur don a Handsome Suit in order to gain model good looks while Korea played on the weight and plastic surgery issues with 200 Pounds Beauty. Here we deal with poor hygiene and the lack of etiquette conditions found acceptable by the slothlike Detective Cha Chulsoo Kang Jihwan.From the get go Kang Jihwan's titular character is primed for physical comedy with excuses painted to explain why any man would degenerate into a helpless situation like his being the ridicule of fellow policemen. His clothes stink as much as his mouth and his ultimate weapon in interrogations torture is his socks. Be warned though even though you're seated in front of the screen these sequences are shot in such vivid terms you'll probably be feeling just as nauseous as the unfortunate characters caught in Detective Cha's gunsights.An undercover mission to pose as a male model will change all that and job requirements meant transforming himself with great pain into a sculpted Greek god unbelievable of course given the timeline but this is movie fantasy after all. Given intel that the drug cartel had infiltrated the fashion industry the cops enlist the help of rookie designer Ko Youngjae singer Sung Yuri to turn their only 180cm tall hope into a believable model for infiltration and investigations with the latter using her launch showcase as a front for this purpose. And to add some value on the romantic front both Cha and Ko turn out to be onetime classmates.The movie is what you would call an inconsistent screwball comedy where everything goes be it smaller nonsensical moments being played out to fine effect or larger scaled comedic sequences that felt overly long losing its intended impact and effect on the audience. Director Shin Taera seemed to have yet to find the knack to craft punchy scenes and the middle section somewhat sagged due to unnecessary repetition of audition scenes and the fishoutofwater moments.If compared to films like 200 Pounds Beauty and Handsome Suit Kang Jihwan's character began as quite the lout and didn't possess as much pathos as the lead characters in the other films which makes him lose out in terms of getting the audience to sympathize with his predicament. More so as the challenge at hand didn't stem from deep personal reasons but more from a professional one. Johwan did well as the sloppy looking detective but didn't have much of a personality shine through when spending more time in the film as the slimmed down male model relying on supporting caricatures to help lift the film through its limp stages. Yuri was equally culpable as the lead actress that wasn't really the best of roles being average and generic for the most parts.Runway Cop has an interesting premise and sets itself up for a riproaring fun time in the cinema but ultimately got undone by sticking to a formula that allowed it to go all over the place narratively. It's understood that the nonsensical comedy style is a draw but this requires skill to craft that director Shin hasn't manage to possess yet.".

They have a good chemistry but its such a waste. They use a pair of big star but fail to make it success. Well its a fresh story I guess about a filthy cop who must do undercover as a model to investigate about drugs trafficking around model. He suddenly bumped with his old classmate now as his fashion designer Miss Go. Its sure have big potential but with a lot of nonsensical comedy and unnecessary action we feel uneasy and fail to laugh. They surely can use the love story between Ji Hwan and Yu Ri to attract all audiences but they just make it very simple and unattractive. By the way I try to love this movie but I cant. Just can give it 5 because its so average and common korean comedy. What's fun from this movie is the car chasing scene which is different from other conventional car chasing that we always saw in a movie. If you want to know just watch it!".

It's got its problems but it is workable  you'll likely keep watching it unless you're too squeamish for this sort of thing.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story A band of smugglers reluctantly gets back together to do what they do best and what makes them the most money which is extracting and selling human organs on the Asian black market. They accomplish this task via their preferred method of arranging for an unsuspecting organ donor to take a cruise ship from Korea to China. During the journey the gang harvests what they need from the unlucky target disposes of the evidence sell the goods in China then return home for the payday. Things don't always go as planned though and this trip will clearly not be without serious repercussions for many of those on board.The movie begins with a short flashback scene that somewhat explains why these smugglers got out of this nasty business in the first place. Then the rest of the movie takes place in the present where the main characters are slowly introduced  expounded upon through the first part of the film. The story does its best to make you identify with these people and those around them as best it can and it does this fairly well actually although at the end of the day it is awfully hard to root for people who are killing other people in order to slice  dice them up for profit. For better or worse though the ship has soon set sail and we're underway towards the business end of this flick.I guess you could say this film is somewhat graphic but you'll seeprobably have seen far worse. There are no explicit scenes of organs being ripped out but the blood does occasionally flow and there are a couple of boobs  perversion shots here and there. This is not a horrorgore film though as it squarely has its sights on belonging to the suspense genre of films. It also contains a number of twists and turns as it goes along some of which are predictable and some unexpected until and long after it reaches is climax. And SUPER SPOILERS in typical Korean movie making fashion for a film of this nature things probably aren't going to end very well for most of the characters involved with this story when all is said and done. This whole endeavor is helped considerably by the main cast members there's a good deal of recognizable talent in front of the camera and they all put in the solid work you would expect. The story is not half bad either and this movie is indeed entertaining and does quite a number of things well. Somewhere in all of this is a really really good flick to be had. Alas there's ultimately just too much emphasis placed on playing up every conceivable story angle possible to make this a streamlined MUST SEE film. If they had cut that stuff down by 50 or so though and this thing would have been near awesome. Nevertheless I often love me some suspenseful melodramatic brutality Korean style and this movie certainly delivers on that front.Bottom Line While clearly not without flaws I found this movie to be a worthwhile diversion if you're into this sort of thing. I feel it's in the 67 star range when taken as a whole. I'll give it 7 stars because I am kind and drunk again. Anybody want my liver  kidneys after and NOT before I die?".

	schema:reviewBody "What if your own free will was nothing of the sort. Every move you made was in accordance with a master plan any kinks or imperfections adjusted by persons unknown constantly on hand to ensure you stayed on track.Many people might assume that their lives are quite the reverse with all the bad decisions they have made anything resembling a master plan is unlikely.David Norris Matt Damon is a rising New York Congressman with his heart set on becoming a young Senator everything is going according to plan until he meets the beautiful quirky ballerina Elise Emily Blunt in a mens restroom.Elise inspires him in ways that he could not have imagined but any longer term relationship is not part of the plan the Men in Grey have mapped out. They do not like their careful plans messed with ever. Although they do get to wear Trilby's which not only look cool but are also a necessary tool for their profession.The many scenes between Blunt and Damon are very believable and natural real chemistry in action and is fun to watch. Blunt is a breath of fresh air in the congressman's driven life living more in the moment than he possibly ever did before.Just when you think the film will descend into a smorgasbord of special effects the story goes into the opposite direction. A thoughtful and character driven piece about choices and the ripple effect each path taken or not taken has on your own and other peoples lives.Terence Stamp still with one of the best voices in the business together with Anthony Mackie  John Slattery do good work as the agents attempting to get everything back on track.There are some good lines and Damon can play an aspiring politician with ease no doubt he could be one in real life if he chose to move in that direction.The central question of defining who we are by the choices we make is explored and it is good to see another movie messing with our heads if only just a little. If we have no free will are we still the people we thought we were very deep but don't panic the film does not get too caught up in this existentialism.The action is limited there are no cars exploding and the body count is non existent a refreshing change from most modern films. A film that could have been made in the 50's from a story point of view although actually based on a short story by Phillip K Dick of Do Androids dream of electric sheep fame the inspiration for Blade Runner.Production values are good although not of the highest flight. The costumes worn by the adjustment police are rather dodgy and look like guys with spare motorcycle helmets sprayed black. Not what you would expect in a big budget Hollywood movie a small point but quite noticeable.Similar to many films of this genre the movie has to decide how to wrap everything up neatly. The final reel is perhaps a little disappointing but that depends on how you would want the film to end somehow it feels that the easier option was taken.Summary A well made and more thoughtful film than you might be expecting.Well acted with a believable romance a light dusting of SciFi and a great story. Inception lite perhaps which is certainly recommendation enough for any film.httpjulesmoviereviews.blogspot.com".

Emily Blunt was delightful and mysterious..... There were quite a few laughs as well as some gasps from our audience a packed house too. Most importantly the STORY is intriguing. Yes that's what makes the film unforgettable is simply the story. It's imaginative and very wellwritten.It's a familyfriendly film as best I remember maybe PG13 because of some almostnudity but no swearing no gore no bad scares and no drugs or alcohol. It's all suspense charm intrigue action and romance!If you are not a fan of The Matrix Inception Moon Memento or other fantasy type mindbenders then you may not enjoy this film. We loved it though.

I'm down with the premise that mankind is safeguarded by an invisible shadow organization that dictates the paths we follow and the decisions we make what baffles me is that they achieve these means through spoiler alert? magic hats. I wish I were joking. The single biggest misstep in this bungled Philip K. Dick adaptation is that the mystique of our antagonists is dispelled almost instantaneously. We get to know our aggressors who as it turns out are anything but aggressive. To compare genres there's never been a great thriller where the detective in pursuit of a killer is 'just doing their job.' Passion breeds compelling cinema and the paper pushers at the heart of The Adjustment Bureau are supremely uninteresting.And despite the fact that they are explicitly not human a very human error sets the plot in motion. An Adjustment Bureau agent oversleeps these guys sleep? thus congressman and senate hopeful David Norris Matt Damon catches an early bus bumping into a familiar comely Englishwoman Emily Blunt whom he was never supposed to see again. The film's saving grace is the pair's believable rapport but after the forces that be repeatedly pull them apart with sometimes years lapsing between meetings it gets harder and harder to believe either is still carrying the other's torch.Then you get into the contradictions and lapses in logic so heady a concept lends itself to. The law that governs the Adjustment Bureau is foggy at best and though they evidently think nothing of freezing time to manually alter the opinion of Norris' political adviser they seem incapable of preventing the divergences Norris himself so frequently propagates. Why not squelch Norris' irksome infatuation through similar tactics? Elsewhere the Bureau threatens him with a memory wipe but repeatedly chooses to reason with him rather than to take more effective action. For as much as they make of their supposedly infallible planwhich looks a lot like the animated Marauder's Map from Harry Potterand the omniscience it grants these celestial shepherds are about as dumb as sheepdogs.In the belated final act Norris races toward the mother of all movie climax clichsthe eleventh hour wedding intervention. With his unrequited love set to marry another dude Norris exploits The Adjustment Bureau's two most ridiculous plot devices in order to intervene. First he scores a magic hat enabling him to access the subspace network that provides a series of shortcuts throughout New York. Second he cloaks himself in a rainstorm which like all water inexplicably clouds the Bureau's ability to chart movement.It's a shame that The Adjustment Bureau hangs its own proverbial hat on so many ludicrous details. The big questions it poses while far from new are well suited for a love story and the directorial debut of screenwriter George Nolfi shows some promise. Unfortunately it's the writing that's at fault here and while I can't speak to the source material Nolfi's adaptation is rife with questionable choices. Potential squandered The Adjustment Bureau is cast adrift in scifi no man's land between good intentions and their eyerolling realization.Trust no one with a hat Norris is melodramatically advised. A Yankees cap even a yarmulke. No joke if you can swallow a line like thathat's off.".

I had seen the preview during the commercial break from one of my TV shows that I follow and it seemed promising.In a movie world today where everything released just seems to be sequel after sequel and remake after remake I found this movie original and thought provoking. With a combination of elements that included thriller and science fiction themes and then adding in a spiritual and romance side of things as well this movie had it all.I thought Matt Damon was excellent in his role and I was captivated for the whole movie in its concept it was drawing onto between fate and free will.It is my hope many people will show up to see this movie. I loved it and know that I will definitely buy it when it's released on DVD in the future.Oh and the theater I saw it in had a couple of hundred people watching it and they erupted into applause at the end. How often does that happen these days at the end of movies? Hopefully that tells you how great this movie was!".

	onyx:emotionText "I was invited today to see an Advance Screening of this movie by a a friend and was excited to find out it was this movie. I had seen the preview during the commercial break from one of my TV shows that I follow and it seemed promising.In a movie world today where everything released just seems to be sequel after sequel and remake after remake I found this movie original and thought provoking. With a combination of elements that included thriller and science fiction themes and then adding in a spiritual and romance side of things as well this movie had it all.I thought Matt Damon was excellent in his role and I was captivated for the whole movie in its concept it was drawing onto between fate and free will.It is my hope many people will show up to see this movie. I loved it and know that I will definitely buy it when it's released on DVD in the future.Oh and the theater I saw it in had a couple of hundred people watching it and they erupted into applause at the end. How often does that happen these days at the end of movies? Hopefully that tells you how great this movie was!";

	schema:reviewBody "The Adjustment Bureau written and directed by George Nolfi based on a  short story by the name of Adjustment Team by Philip K. Dick is about  how much one would be willing to sacrifice in the name of love. Matt  Damon plays David Norris a young ambitious idealistic Congressman  seeking election for a seat in the Senate. However upon a short  encounter with Elise Emily Blunt when they share a brief but  meaningful kiss David realizes his true love lies with Elise not at  the hands of registered voters of New York City. The adjustment bureau  quickly notices the spark and was determined to separate the two  lovers because according to the plan their love was never meant to  be. David however refuses to back down and fights against his fate  to be with the one he loves.  What makes The Adjustment Bureau a truly great movie is that it sends a  powerful message don't be afraid to go after what you want. Even if it  means going against the will of a powerful if not divine being. The  movie makes it no secret that the chairman is a symbolism for God  and the people of the adjustment bureau are His angels we've been  called that angels says Harry Mitchell a member of the adjustment  bureau in one scene. However in the film even God is not all  powerful as He only has limited enforcers in the adjustment bureau so  if a nuclear warfare were to break out even He could not prevent the  catastrophe that would follow.  The film also makes a strong case that free will does take its toll. As  Thomson another adjustment bureau member reminds us in another scene  that although the chairman has blessed us with the gifts of intellect  and reason it was those same gifts that caused the world to be on the  brink of destruction during the Cuban missile crisis. To add additional  pressure for David to keep away from Elise Thomson informs David that  if he chooses to be with her not only will it ruin his dream but will  also ruin her dream she is fated to be a famous dancer and then a  famous choreographer. As if to add insult to injury Thomson flexes  his muscle causing Elise to sprain her ankle then telling David that  he is the one to blame for her injury.  After a few twists and turns the film reaches its climax with a  showdown between David and the Thomson which was very exciting and  kept me on the edge of my seat as did all other parts of the movie I  have to admit that the resolution was a bit of a cop out I won't ruin  it for you. In fact if the movie had a resolution that was as epic as  the rest of the storyline I would not hesitate to give it 1010 stars.  Unfortunately the ending did disappoint me a great deal so as it  stands I'm giving it a 910.  As a final note I would like to say that you were planning on watching  this movie at all you almost certainly should see it in the theater.  Director George Nolfi FYI this is his first movie as director  incorporates beautiful cinematography as well as great sound mixing  or is it sound editing? I'm not sure. I especially loved the clicking  noise of the dressing shoes of Thomson and his enforcers against the  tile floor as they chase down David to set him on his correct path.  The noise was complimented by their perfect formation as they all send  a clear message we are the ones in charge and we WILL hunt you down.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review will contain a few spoilers. Here's the first one it's mediocre at best.Philip K. Dick shorts could fuel Hollywood for years. They're nice well thought out premises that aren't so complicated that they leave viewers confused  movies like Minority Report and Total Recall. However when you put a good short in the hands of someone like George Nolfi the clown responsible for penning Timeline and Ocean's Twelve you get The Adjustment Bureau.The movie starts out as a quirky romcom with lead man Matt Damon losing a Senatorial election and find comfort in the arms of a flirty girl hiding in the men's room. Such stuff as dreams are made on. He has a chance meeting with her again some time later but the big twist occurs when he's confronted by the partners of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce told it's just not meant to be and angels will kneecap him if he spills the beans about their big operation. Years later we get a replay of the situation and it all goes to heck in a knapsack when The Adjustment Bureau says it must not be.There are a few big problems with how this movie handles the thriller aspects. First you have to care about characters for any chase or conflict to even matter. We get a slew of sappy Notebookesque lines with little character development. As far as I'm concerned David Norris is a childish flake and Elise Sellas doesn't give two craps about anybody's feelings but her own. Not very likable but I guess they do deserve each other. Second a thriller won't be thrilling if there is no danger. The biggest dangers are Norris not being a great politician and Sellas not becoming famous in modern dance circles. No threat of bodily harm and the bad guys are completely befuddled when water is in the picture. I've ranted in the past about this Hollywood notion that unless you get the girl AND the money fame and good looks it's not worth it. For most of us finding true love would be enough  we wouldn't have to be President on top of all that. Last all throughout the movie the plucky buddy comedy music doesn't give the a sense of impending doom. If Richard Widmark's brutal wheelchair down the stairs scene from Kiss of Death had been accompanied by bongos and a symbol hit at the end I don't think it would carry the same weight.Maybe we've seen too many Matrixtype movies to be impressed by mind bending scifi chases but this dime tour of NYC did not impress or entertain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fate coincidence and free will come at odds with one another in this scifi romance reimagined by George Nolfi from the short story Adjustment Team by scifi legend Philip K. Dick. Nolfi's plot can go from interesting and intriguing to downright silly at times but the main attraction is not the narrative. It is the pulsating chemistry between lead stars Matt Damon and the sensually beguiling Emily Blunt set in all the famous spots of Manhattan and NYC.Having been to New York City recently I find the sets nostalgic and I am defenseless to the charms of Emily Blunt.Young Senate candidate for New York City David Norris Damon is rehearsing his speech in the men's restroom when a beautiful stranger Blunt right with Damon emerges from one of the stalls and starts chatting with him. Before she leaves  in quite a hurry  they have an impulsive passionate kiss and he is smitten. Their next encounter in a city bus has to be by chance  and he learns that her name is Elise. He is determined to call her. To court her...And then David comes across a bunch of Men in Black suits and hats led by a Mr Richardson John Slattery who says bluntly We are the people who make sure things go according to plan. David's relationship with the freespirited Elise is NOT part of their plan and he must not see her again  for both his and her own good! The rest of the movie is of course the tussle between Love and Fate for David. After being charmed by Elise a rising star ballerina we can understand why David is bent on seeing her. We can also understand how their relationship would possibly wreck their careers  and why David would want to take a chance on that. David and Elise seem so perfect for each other that we root for them.It is good that Nolfi has written such a romantic angle into this Dick tale instead of turning it into another action flick like Total Recall Paycheck and Screamers. He could have polished up a bit more on the second half to keep it from becoming childish though. Still the notion of Fates personified could not be taken too seriously  and it would be better to just go along with the flow of the love story so charmingly portrayed by Damon and Blunt  and supported by a sympathetic Anthony Mackie and menacing Terence Stamp as members of the Adjustment Bureau. Emily Blunt has such captivating eyes that look into your soul and make you weep.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those who have seen the trailer will think that this is a cool exciting action film about men who control the destinies of others and the man who says I will not stand for this! but sadly that is not the story of the film. The concept is great and there are moments where I thought the film was going to get better because the story sounds interesting. I'll start with the good. As I have mentioned before the film sounds interesting and as these mysterious men enter the film you are interested to see what they can do. Anthony Mackie and John Slattery were well cast and Matt Damon's performance while not perfect because of the script is good and keeps the film together. Apart from the above I can't think of anything else because the script is dull and the characters feel onedimensional. Emily Blunt has little to do in the film and Terrence Stamp is completely misused. We hear how his character is cold and will do anything to get the job done but the film never shows this. What could have saved the film would have been some kind of emotional pull if we felt that the two leads were meant to be together because that would have kept the film interesting. Instead there is little reason to care what happens by the end. Themes including free will and predestination are mentioned and are interesting when they are brought up but the script doesn't do anything with it. Without spoiling anything Matt Damon does make a discovery halfway through the film and it could have been a major plot point but the way film deals with it feels unnatural and outofcharacter.The film also lacks a sense of energy but maybe that is due to my initial expectations as the film is completely missmarketed as an action thriller. However the film could have played up the villains in the film if you can call them that because you learn what they have done and what they are capable of doing. In the hands of another director this would have been an enjoyable film to watch. The idea is there but something went wrong along the way and this is the result. This isn't essential viewing but if you are interested rent it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jan 11 I was invited to see and rate this movie at a free audience screening. While biting the hand that feeds you is incredibly bad form this film is not worth paying a full price admission. DO see it on the big screen but go to the matine instead. Caveat I'm not the target audience and hadn't read the short story source first so for you to calibrate I rated Jumper at 7 Avatar at 6 bumped up to an 8 for CGI and Last Airbender at 3. This film has all the individual elements for a great time The opening draws you into the story Blunt is engaging and sensual Stamp is villainous DamonBlunt have fabulous chemistry including a great meet initial mystery sophisticated humor snappy repartee wonderful score and superb scenery. The supporting characters are well cast and acted. However the thin plot doesn't sustain the whole movie and it takes too long for the minimal plot to unfold even though there are myriad chase scenes to divert you at first. The movie was seemingly created for chase scenes with a poorly contrived reason for the boy meets girl boy loses girl but continues to search for her storyline tossed in to justify all the chasing. In attempting to make everything mysterious the audience is kept as ignorant as the characters to the point where it became THATS the reason he's been chasing after her? How DISAPPOINTING! when the cause for separation is unveiled. The secret meetings which presumably either advance or reveal the mystery were annoying instead. Finally in the last portion of the movie the opening doors and running become so repetitive you can feel like the Blunt character who has her hands over her head and is screaming. The ending is abrupt contrived and disappointing a veritable deus ex machina version. Conversely my companion who loves everything scifi or scifantasy and reads Phillip K Dick including the short story on which this was based rated the movie excellent as opposed to my ok. Even though the movie diverges from the short story he suffered no confusion or disappointment with the story line big reveals or ending. He also thought the cast romance and humor were great.We both agreedo see the movie on the big screen as it certainly enhances the suspense and startling moments political crowd scene adjustment scene car crashes action scenes and finale and shows off the great NYC locations. He says go ahead and pay full pricethe movie is worth it".

This film has all the individual elements for a great time The opening draws you into the story Blunt is engaging and sensual Stamp is villainous DamonBlunt have fabulous chemistry including a great meet initial mystery sophisticated humor snappy repartee wonderful score and superb scenery. The supporting characters are well cast and acted. However the thin plot doesn't sustain the whole movie and it takes too long for the minimal plot to unfold even though there are myriad chase scenes to divert you at first. The movie was seemingly created for chase scenes with a poorly contrived reason for the boy meets girl boy loses girl but continues to search for her storyline tossed in to justify all the chasing. In attempting to make everything mysterious the audience is kept as ignorant as the characters to the point where it became THATS the reason he's been chasing after her? How DISAPPOINTING! when the cause for separation is unveiled. The secret meetings which presumably either advance or reveal the mystery were annoying instead. Finally in the last portion of the movie the opening doors and running become so repetitive you can feel like the Blunt character who has her hands over her head and is screaming. The ending is abrupt contrived and disappointing a veritable deus ex machina version. Conversely my companion who loves everything scifi or scifantasy and reads Phillip K Dick including the short story on which this was based rated the movie excellent as opposed to my ok. Even though the movie diverges from the short story he suffered no confusion or disappointment with the story line big reveals or ending. He also thought the cast romance and humor were great.We both agreedo see the movie on the big screen as it certainly enhances the suspense and startling moments political crowd scene adjustment scene car crashes action scenes and finale and shows off the great NYC locations. He says go ahead and pay full pricethe movie is worth it";

Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are so convincing together making their romance very believable. Once again Emily Blunt puts on a particularly stellar performance showing her impressive range of acting skills and on screen charm.

In my opinion it should have been about how The Bureau was controlling everyones moves and actions uncovering their every single move into their lives. Unfortunately the movie zeroed in on a love story and fate which in my opinion made this SciFi Action movie turn into a SciFi Drama Chick Flick!Like I previously stated the trailer lead me to believe that the plot was going to be a SciFi conspiracy movie about how the government or The Bureau controls the world USA and someone found out about them and tried to stop them to tell the world but end up being killed for treason! Something along those lines in my opinion. Anyways overall I give this movie a 4 out of 10 because the plot could have been so much better for a SciFi Thriller! Instead of turning it into a love story which by the way there are way too many of those around already so why did they do this to the movie? I have no idea. But it was a bad idea.Final Note SPOILER Folks if you love movies like 'Vantage Point' or 'The Bourne Supremacy'  stay away from this movie because you will too be sorely disappointed as was I. This was nothing close to what I was expecting from what the movie trailer of The Adjustment Bureau portrayed at all! Good luck folks I hope you too have a different opinion than mine. Because I am just one person who has seen hundreds of thousands of amazing great stupendous and kickass movies! So I know what I'm talking about when I wrote this review.

All of the characters are shallow clich and the acting is near awful. The plot is terrible. This is a really bad romantic drama which premise is off the charts of ridicule. It is seriously hard for me to describe the worst parts as there are endless amounts.What I've learned from this movie is  Don't run for president if you want love  God is a prick and hates love  God is not a prick heshe just make crappy plans which need fixing and remodeling all time  God is maybe a prick but is definitely incompetent  Humans easily outsmart God and a great bunch of angels  Don't do what God wants you to do unless you really want to and then God is alright with it  Everything is a test. God just loves to play around and bruise your ankles if necessary to test your love heshe will even make a car crash happen and bruise innocent people just to test your love. Or maybe is it not god who did that maybe it was the incompetent angels. Well then you can conclude that god has some serious administration issues and a 'bureau' running wild.Basically this is one terrible movie. It is a clich 'romantic drama' which tells you to follow your instinct on love no matter what. If you do so the woman of your life will automatically love you only after being with you 4 times over a period of 4 years. She will dump her fiance just for you because you made her laugh a few times and told her 'deep' stories about your dead father who was a great man or so we were told as he is not introduced nor 'treated' in the movie at all only spoken about.This is religious propaganda a terrible movie with a terrible plot which wasted millions of dollars on something which should have never been produced.I advice you to watch this movie as it is a textbook example of how not to produce a movie and to laugh at religious clichs. It is not boring... Its just really bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many movies with impossible plots that are entertaining because you are carried along by the story. You don't notice the holes in the plot until the next day. In this case the plot is not merely preposterous it is transparent. As such it is impossible to enjoy the movie because you are sitting in the theatre analyzing its faults. Let's begin with the idea that Matt Damon looks for his true love for 3 years after their chance meeting. O.K. so I didn't realize until the next day that his true love had crashed a wedding and that she was last seen being chased by security people much faster than she was. Matt could simply have checked back at the hotel to learn her identity. But even while I was watching the movie it was obvious that he plays a wellknown public figure. So why didn't she just call him up? Once you realize this is all she would have to do the premise of the movie collapses. In addition as other reviewers have noted the human hero is outwitting God. How believable is that? The angels suggest that God just doesn't have the resources to monitor everybody so He focuses on important people. That's simply annoying. This is a God who rather than knowing when any sparrow falls apparently only knows when a condor falls. And then you have the angel who violates God's orders to help our hero find his true love by loaning him his cheesy hat. I could only think of the Red Hat Ladies. Where do they end up when they go though a door? I've never read or heard of the scifi novel from the 50's that this is based on but I recognized the genre when it was postulated that all the large events of Western Civilization could be explained by times that God intervened and times when God took a handsoff approach God was onduty up to the Fall of Rome but took the day off during the Dark Ages etc. Other reviewers quibble that this ignores other cultures but 1950's scifi was into sweeping concepts like this. Frankly it is kinda neat and as a teenager I would have been intrigued. But the problem here is that Hollywood has taken what was probably a pretty good idea from the 50's and trashed it. I'd bet that the author made a much more credible case for his premise and tied up the loose ends in a way that was internally consistent. Not so here. I give three stars because of the scenes of New York and because smoking was not prominently featured. Even Big Tobacco passed on this turkey.".

He doesn't expect to see her again but some time later he bumps into her on a New York bus this time he gets her name Elise and number. He doesn't get chance to call her though as things suddenly get very strange for him he gets to work and finds everybody frozen and strange men capture him and explain that it is their job to make sure that everything that is meant to happen does happen and he was not meant to meet Elise! They take her number but he is determined to find her and one day three years later he does their problems are only just beginning however as The Adjustment Bureau haven't given up their plans to keep them apart.I really enjoyed this Matt Damon but in a fine performance as David Norris and Emily Blunt was suitably beguiling as Elise. Other notable performances include Anthony Mackie as the Bureau man responsible for Norris and Terrance Stamp for played one of his superiors. There was enough excitement without having the action swamp the plot and character development. It also made a nice change for there to be no real bad guys in a film like this The Bureau may have been against the protagonist's plans but their motivation was never sinister. I also liked that no attempt was made to explain how things worked we were told the Bureau men's hats enabled then to use doors to travel across the city but no time was wasted giving reasons it just had to be accepted.

Then one day he is attacked by a couple of muggers and Bullock saves his life by getting him to the hospital. Naturally Gallagher is in a comatose state after the attack. A true misunderstanding makes it appear that Bullock is Gallagher's fiance and typical confusion ensues. Now Gallagher's family all believe that Bullock really is his woman. Gallagher's brother Bill Pullman is suspicious though but slowly starts to believe Bullock as well. He then starts to fall in love with her and vice versa. A great romantic comedy that is so pure and wellmade that it is near impossible to say anything negative about it. It is not a perfect film but it is a very likeable movie that delivers what it promises. 4 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "A sweet and gentle romantic film about how love sometimes slips in through the window rather than coming straight in through the front door it's the one that put star Sandra Bullock into contention with Meg Ryan for the crown of America's Sweetheart.  And with good reason because in While You Were Sleeping' directed by Jon Turteltaub Bullock emerges as the epitome of the modern day girl next door' in the best and most sincere sense.  This is a film that explores one of the basic tenets of the human condition the need to love and be loved and makes no bones about what it's trying to accomplish along the way.  Clearly the filmmakers want to make you feel good and entertain you at the same time.  And they succeed on both fronts.Lucy Moderatz Bullock lives alone in Chicago where she has an apartment a cat and a job with the CTA as a token taker for the train.  Her life is fairly uncomplicated and uneventful read  Dull and the one thing she looks forward to in her daily grind is seeing a certain young gentleman who rides the train everyday and always passes through her toll booth.  She's doesn't even know his name and they've never exchanged so much as a Good morning' but in her mind he's become the Prince Charming she's always dreamed about.Then on Christmas morning he passes through but while waiting on the platform for the train he gets mugged and falls onto the tracks unconscious.  And a train is coming.  Lucy runs to his aid and saves his life but the severe head trauma he's sustained has put him in a coma.  At the hospital they refuse to let her in to see him as that is a privilege reserved for family members only so in desperation she tells them that she is his fiancee which does the trick.  But when his family his rather large' family shows up her ruse creates something of a sticky wicket. Everything is moving so fast and becoming so emotional that Lucy simply can't get in a word of explanation.  The next thing she knows to the family she is their beloved Peter's Peter Gallagher intended even though he's never said a word to them about her and because the situation is so frantic and there's such concern about Peter besides which it's Christmas Lucy can't bring herself to tell them the truth.  So in an instant her life is suddenly changed she's surrounded by family' and she's engaged' to her Prince Charming.  Even if he is well...in a coma.Turteltaub has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engaging film in the tradition of Nora Ephron's You've Got Mail' the second best romantic comedy ever made and Sleepless In Seattle.'  He sets a perfect pace and presents his endearingly eclectic assemblage of characters in the best possible way he makes you feel at home with them.  Most importantly though Turteltaub manages to make this a sweet' film without being saccharin' about it which would have sunk it quicker than a deflated rubber raft in an undertow.  Instead he pulls out all the right stops to make his film entirely Ephronesque and entertaining and it works beautifully.  The humor is warm and as the story moves along he builds upon that strong sense of need' that is universal then triumphs by satisfying that need in the end.Sandra Bullock has never been more winning or winsome than she is here there's a special quality about her Lucy that makes you want to reach out to her.  She is without question the most vulnerable character Bullock has ever played.  There is very little of Annie Speed' or Gracie Miss Congeniality' for example about her the closest to Lucy of any of her characters in fact would be Birdee in Hope Floats.'  That is not to say there is anything weak' about Lucy at all quite the contrary in fact. There is a decided strength in the very benevolence of Lucy's nature even in the way she wears her heart on her sleeve and especially inasmuch as she is not afraid to admit to herself what she really wants and needs.  This is an independent woman who accepts and meets any and all challenges of life but keeps an open mind and above all an open heart.  And that is what makes Lucy so endearing she's the one who brings a cake to the office to share with her coworkers for no other reason than the fact that it makes the world and everybody in it a little bit better.  That's what Bullock brings to her performance here and it's what makes Lucy one of her most enduring and memorable characters.As for sliding in through the window rather than coming through the front door that's exactly what Bill Pullman does with his portrayal of Peter's brother Jack Callaghan.  He's the one who shows up after the fact as it were but very quickly makes a connection and ingratiates himself with the audience.  Initially Jack seems to be playing the role of devil's advocate his suspicions aroused by the fact that Peter has never mentioned Lucy to him but that begins to change with some very subtle undertones that prove to be extremely effective.  And Pullman does a terrific job of developing his character in real time which makes Jack convincing and a piece of the puzzle that fits in perfectly.  A character actor' type leading man Pullman has a resume filled with varied and colorful characters but Jack is his most engaging role ever and he succeeds entirely with it.The wonderful supporting cast includes Jack Warden Saul Peter Boyle Ox Micole Mercurio Midge Michael Rispoli Joey and the wonderful Glynis Johns as beautiful and charming as ever as Elsie.  Warm and poignant While You Were Sleeping' is one to savor this one's a keeper.  BTW the 1 romantic comedy?  Bonnie Hunt's Return To Me'.  1010.".

She has no family and is usually stuck doing holiday shifts in the Chicago transit system as a toll booth clerk on the elevated railway. She has noted one man who uses the station all the time Peter Gallagher and rescues him when he is thrown onto the train tracks just before a train comes into the station. Gallagher is in a coma and due to a wellintentioned nurse Bullock is introduced to the family of Gallagher as his fianc. She tries to tell them the truth but when she learns his grandmother Glynis Johns has a heart problem she hesitates. Soon she is treated as a member of this nice family as a member well she did save Gallagher and she is thought to be his fianc. Only his brother Bill Pullman has real doubts and keeps mentioning them and keeps apologizing for them. Bullock and Pullman find that they are also growing more attracted to each other. The film shows how these problems are resolved. And it is all done in a most charming manner.This is one of those films that would take only a few minutes to quickly resolve in the real world where Bullock would have told the truth early on. But the audience is allowed to suspend it's disbelief because the characters are uniformly likable. Although Jack Pullman is constantly questioning Bullock's story each time she gives a plausible explanation of what is going on and Pullman likes her enough to accept these explanations. The only one who knows the truth is the family friend Sam Jack Warden and he too feels that the news has to be broken carefully he loves the family and doesn't want them hurt. Oddly enough his one effort at meddling almost screws up the situation in the film for Bullock Pullman and Gallagher. Pullman also faces the truth and explains to his father Peter Boyle that he doesn't want to continue in the family business. Boyle's reaction becomes important too.The performances are flawless and one finds oneself rooting for most of the cast the sole exception is the actress playing Ashley Peter Galagher's actual girl friend. Her opposite number Joe Jr. is too comic a figure to dislike in fact at one point he thinks Pullman is annoying Bullock and offers to take care of him  not the act of a rat at all. For a sweet lovable love tale WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is hard to top. In the last decade only WHEN HARRY MET SALLY WORKING GIRL PRETTY WOMAN NOTTING HILL SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and YOU'VE GOT MAIL are on par with it but the family becomes so important to Bullock in the plot this has a special warmth in it that is quite is different from most of the others.".

	schema:reviewBody " but I am in love with the movie.I'm kicking myself for watching this movie just recently. I was quite young when this movie was first released but that is not an excuse for overseeing this movie for so long. I am so glad I watched it. And I'm going to keep watching it over and over...I am a sucker for romantic comedies and a lot of them are disappointing. It's very rare to fall in love with a movie and 'while you were sleeping' has that effect on me. The key to the Lucy and Jack's romance is chemistry and boy did they have chemistry. The element to a great story whether it is reading or watching is to show not tell. And that's what exactly what it was. The looks that you see Jack and Lucy give each other their body language the deep conversations they have the way he describes her and how she's head over heels for him. The tension they create when put together wasn't anything sexual it was something much much deeper. Something that will last a lifetime. The other key factors to this movie are the Callaghans and Saul and everyone else. They bring out the comedy side to the movie. They are a hilarious bunch and are not a tad annoying not even the real fiance or Peter just really really funny and fun to be with.Put two and two together and they have formulated an almost perfect Romantic Comedy. I am going to say almost because nothing in this world is perfectNow Bill Pullmanthat's a different topic!".

I was quite young when this movie was first released but that is not an excuse for overseeing this movie for so long. I am so glad I watched it. And I'm going to keep watching it over and over...I am a sucker for romantic comedies and a lot of them are disappointing. It's very rare to fall in love with a movie and 'while you were sleeping' has that effect on me. The key to the Lucy and Jack's romance is chemistry and boy did they have chemistry. The element to a great story whether it is reading or watching is to show not tell. And that's what exactly what it was. The looks that you see Jack and Lucy give each other their body language the deep conversations they have the way he describes her and how she's head over heels for him. The tension they create when put together wasn't anything sexual it was something much much deeper. Something that will last a lifetime. The other key factors to this movie are the Callaghans and Saul and everyone else. They bring out the comedy side to the movie. They are a hilarious bunch and are not a tad annoying not even the real fiance or Peter just really really funny and fun to be with.Put two and two together and they have formulated an almost perfect Romantic Comedy. I am going to say almost because nothing in this world is perfectNow Bill Pullmanthat's a different topic!";

Bullock obsesses about a man she sees briefly every day when he is knocked unconscious she claims to be his fiance. Then sparks begin to fly with the brother. Wonderful turns by Boyle and Warden as older family members. There's a great line by Boyle in this movie something like you always imagine you'll have these long golden moments in life and then when you get there it lasts about a minute. I think Bullock was never better than in this movie in later productions her shy modesty seems a little artificial. She and Pullman have just enough chemistry together to pull this through.".

She is much more appealing in this film which I have watched repeatedly.The plot is somewhat thin underfoot but the cast overcomes this with some of the greatest efforts I have ever seen. Sandra is luminous as Lucy Moderatz a woman who has suffered a great deal of loss in her life and seems doomed to a lonely life alone. Lucy eases her heartache by dreaming about wedding the handsome man who buys a token at her booth every weekday morning.When an improbable collection of circumstances result in Lucy being accepted as the fiance of her dream man who is in a coma and in no condition to refute her claim she gains the warm loving family she has so long desired. Lucy makes such an instantly positive impression on the family of her supposed fiance they are delighted to make her part of the family. When her 'fiancee' wakes from his coma and fails to recognize Lucy the family covers the gap by presuming amnesia rather than suspecting some subterfuge on the part of Lucy.I enjoyed many parts of this film. The best part was where the family gathered to exchange Christmas presents. Lucy had her name on a stocking and a present from Santa. The look on Lucy's face as she savored these moments was priceless. The next morning Lucy meets Jack her 'fiancee's' brother and sparks immediately fly.This film really illustrated how deprived Lucy has been. When she needs personal advice she has to rely on her boss at work. Basically her fellow workers and her wouldbe boyfriend at her apartment complex are her only human contact. It would seem logical that Lucy would join a church or find some other social outlet.All the supporting cast is great here. The performers fit into their roles perfectly. Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock really bring their characters to life. You find yourself rooting for the inevitable victory of true love over circumstances.This is movie entertains without the need to appeal to the baser instincts. It was grand to see an intact functional family for once. We need more efforts like this to show that a great movie can be made using wholesome themes.".

So if you're going to watch this movie watch it around Christmas time NovemberDecember should do. I watched it just now and it's October but still it's a great movie anytime of the year It will make you laugh cry and sigh as you see her life and the magical events that happen evolve into a beautiful heartwarming story. If you are an ol' romantic and enjoy innocent humour then this is the movie for you It's just amazing. I'm so glad my Mum introduced me to it. I can't wait to have a family and introduce them.

It's why I find it hard to imagine that Demi Moore was originally slotted to play this character  she has a toughness of heart that I cannot imagine for this character.This movie was written so well that I looked to see what else the screenwriters had done  nothing is listed!

	schema:reviewBody "Miss Marple joins the board of senior trustees for a youth reformation committee which prides itself on reforming troublesome teenagers by means of naval cadet training on board a ship called The Battledore. But when one of her fellow trustees is murdered by his snuff being laced with poison Miss Marple learns that he had just returned from a routine visit to The Battledore and she suspects that the motive for his murder must lie on the ship. Using her position as senior trustee Miss Marple pays a visit to the ship much to the chagrin of the eccentric Captain Rhumstone Lionel Jeffries who seems anxious to get rid of her. With the help of her loyal friend Mr Stringer Stringer Davis she soon learns that the shore leave patrol has been committing a series of jewel thefts from the high society. But the question is which one? Meanwhile Lieutenant Compton Francis Matthews has been run through with a sword and hung from the ship's yardarm and suspicion immediately falls on Sub Lieutenant Humbert Derek Nimmo whom didn't get along with Compton because they both fancied the same girl Nurse Shirley Norma Foster. As usual Chief Inspector Craddock Charles Tingwell thinks he's got an open and shut case but Miss Marple isn't convinced of Humbert's guilt even though the jewel robberies were all committed after high society parties all of which he and Shirley had both attended. In her usual shrewd way Miss Marple sets a trap for the killer and uncovers a big swindle attached to the higher ranks among the committee but not before Shirley is murdered by a poisoned spike primed to a mousetrap...Murder Ahoy was the fourth and final entry in the series of comedy whodunits starring Rutherford as Miss Marple. The series was doing well at the box office but the producers were unable to get the rights to any more of Christie's works. In addition this is the only one that wasn't adapted from a Christie novel and the film was produced in 1964 but released at the end of 1965 in order to space out the series. Following the end of the Miss Marple franchise director Pollock would make one more feature before he more or less vanished from the scene. Another Christie Ten Little Indians see my review for Fu Manchu producer Harry Alan Towers.All in all Murder Ahoy is fantastic light hearted fun with Rutherford on fine form as usual as the spinster detective. She gets good support from Lionel Jeffries as the Captain and Stringer Davis offers his touching portrayal as the local librarian Mr Stringer who is Miss Marple's closest friend and is always concerned that her meddling may result in her getting bumped off but its never any use as she is determined to unravel the mystery and she does in her own inimitable fashion. Moments to savour here include her sword fight with the killer at the climax when she assures her assailant I must warn you that in 1931 I was the winner of the ladies fencing championship. Screenwriters David Pursall and Jack Seddon came up with quite a good storyline of their own and the identity of the killer is well concealed until the end but I felt that the script could of been a little tighter. Nevertheless its all good fun and Rutherford has no trouble in dominating the film with her uniquely individual performance as Miss Marple George Pollock's direction is smooth and the atmospheric black and white camerawork of Desmond Dickinson is an added bonus.".

This time out Miss Marple must solve a mysterious death concerning a trustee and a snuff box which eventually lands her on board a ship as an observing trustee.  Once aboard Miss Marple  and her presence seemingly invite murder after murder.  Margaret Rutherford furls her sails and lends the film her gargantuan aplomb.  She is a battleship on screen.  The cast also includes Stringer Davisreallife husband and Charles TingwellInspector Craddock reprising earlier roles.

This time out Miss Marple must solve a mysterious death concerning a trustee and a snuff box which eventually lands her on board a ship as an observing trustee.  Once aboard Miss Marple  and her presence seemingly invite murder after murder.  Margaret Rutherford furls her sails and lends the film her gargantuan aplomb.  She is a battleship on screen.  The cast also includes Stringer Davisreallife husband and Charles TingwellInspector Craddock reprising earlier roles.  Lionel Jeffries is the ship's captain and he is simply marvelous as he bemoans Marple's presence and even calling her a Jonah and an ill wind blowing.

	schema:reviewBody "Whilst visiting the monthly meeting of a naval trust set up long ago one of her relatives Miss Marple is surprised by the rudeness of Follie Hardwick who demands to speak outside of the agenda. Hardwick insists that his news will drop the rest of the agenda as irrelevant and taking a pinch of snuff he stands to speak. Seconds later he is dead from a heart attack and the police are called. Marple notices later that someone has stolen the dead man's snuff but left the snuffbox. Believing the death was murder by way of poisoned snuff Miss Marple insists on investigating much to the chagrin of Detective Inspector Craddock.For many viewers myself included this is not really a Miss Marple film as we think of it. For most of us this should be a film with Joan Hickson that is very slow and very English however this is not to say that the Rutherford versions are not any good because they are actually pretty enjoyable. Less of a Miss Marple film this is more a Margaret Rutherford film because she does her usual performance of huff puff and sheer bloodyminded persistence. The plot is written around this well and is lively and fun with a surprise amount of comedy for a mystery film. The actual development of the case is not that strong but the whole thing is entertaining enough to avoid having to rely too heavily on just this aspect.The cast make it work as well as it does. Rutherford could be accused of doing what comes naturally but so what if it works? Real life partner Stringer Davis is good value as always in his small role as is Tingwell in the typically cynical Detective Inspector. The crew of the ship are great fun Jeffries is nearly always funny and he is well supported by Nimmo Parsons Mervyn and Benham. Nobody is brilliant and the film belongs to Rutherford but the presence of some great comedians helps matters.Overall this is an entertaining and enjoyable film that is driven by the force of Rutherford's presence. She may not be a great Miss Marple but she does what she does well. The rest of the cast are fun as well and they manage to cover the fact that the mystery side of things could have been stronger and more interesting. Light fun though.".

	schema:headline " She was always HERSELF...";
	schema:reviewBody "A crucial moment for the trustees' meeting at the Cape of Good Hope Youth Reclamation Centre. The well tailored niece of late Sir Hubert Marple modest about the 'achievement of her illustrious family' is indeed touched by the warmth of their welcome. On the minds of all the participants is the significant ship Battledore the place which 'provides a safe haven for those who are in peril on the sea of life' aimed at socializing young hooligans. The bishop's pompous speech seems to break any word and time limit and yet...fellow Cecil Ffolly Hardwicke having visited the Battledore insists on speaking up. Indeed something urgent occupies his mind something of utmost importance. However just before he seems to be allowed to pass on whatever is on his mind he unexpectedly passes away. The shock is the feeling of every witness of this tragic death yet suspicion fills the mind of only one person  the distinguished niece Miss Marple Margaret Rutherford who is in no way temporarily 'unhinged' but proves to be always...HERSELF.Miss Marple discovers that dead Hardwicke's snuff its considerable amount has been stolen just while he was being taken away and she draws some breathtaking conclusion while experimenting on its little amount that has remained. The powerful sleuth 'damns the torpedoes' with 'full speed ahead' to pursue the investigation on board a ship. With a delightful and insightful view on the ship where all are anxious to get rid of this unwelcome 'Neptune's mother' it soon occurs that indeed there is something going on aboard the Battledore something far more than hankypanky between the sexes...The fourth film with Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple is not based on any of Agatha Christie's novels but is entirely based on the interpretation of Miss Jane Marple by David Pursall and Jack Seddon. That is one of the reasons why MURDER AHOY has met lots of critical views. Some critics perceive it as 'somewhat heavy combination of homicide and hankypanky' while others see it as a considerably cheap entertainment. Unfortunately many of the critical views are quite unfair to the movie which in my opinion contributes to the whole series of the films and also has plenty offer.It is naturally MARGARET RUTHERFORD who makes even the less clever lines executed unforgettably. She 'creeps about' to uncover what is unavailable for others. She beautifully blends detective features with comedy undertones and does it powerfully in all scenes her gestures her moves her splendid way of executing her lines. The climactic manifestation of skills on the screen occurs to be the scene when she is fencing with the villain. Nevertheless there are many more scenes worth attention including her experiment with the snuff her entrance on board a ship the library scene as well as the encounters with chief Inspector Craddock Charles Tingwell and Mr Jim Stringer Stringer Davis her real life husband. Like in the preceding films there are similar touches and cutting remarks between Miss Marple a real sleuth and the policeman convinced solely by proved fact. This time Mr Stringer does not give Miss Marple 'a leg up' but propels her in the library where a significant book is being discovered.The whole naval atmosphere is provided funnily on board the Battledore particularly by Lionel Jeffries who portrays an amusing 'outmaneuvered' captain a bigoted patriot who owns a blade allegedly granted to his great grandfather by Admiral Nelson himself.

	onyx:emotionText "A crucial moment for the trustees' meeting at the Cape of Good Hope Youth Reclamation Centre. The well tailored niece of late Sir Hubert Marple modest about the 'achievement of her illustrious family' is indeed touched by the warmth of their welcome. On the minds of all the participants is the significant ship Battledore the place which 'provides a safe haven for those who are in peril on the sea of life' aimed at socializing young hooligans. The bishop's pompous speech seems to break any word and time limit and yet...fellow Cecil Ffolly Hardwicke having visited the Battledore insists on speaking up. Indeed something urgent occupies his mind something of utmost importance. However just before he seems to be allowed to pass on whatever is on his mind he unexpectedly passes away. The shock is the feeling of every witness of this tragic death yet suspicion fills the mind of only one person  the distinguished niece Miss Marple Margaret Rutherford who is in no way temporarily 'unhinged' but proves to be always...HERSELF.Miss Marple discovers that dead Hardwicke's snuff its considerable amount has been stolen just while he was being taken away and she draws some breathtaking conclusion while experimenting on its little amount that has remained. The powerful sleuth 'damns the torpedoes' with 'full speed ahead' to pursue the investigation on board a ship. With a delightful and insightful view on the ship where all are anxious to get rid of this unwelcome 'Neptune's mother' it soon occurs that indeed there is something going on aboard the Battledore something far more than hankypanky between the sexes...The fourth film with Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple is not based on any of Agatha Christie's novels but is entirely based on the interpretation of Miss Jane Marple by David Pursall and Jack Seddon. That is one of the reasons why MURDER AHOY has met lots of critical views. Some critics perceive it as 'somewhat heavy combination of homicide and hankypanky' while others see it as a considerably cheap entertainment. Unfortunately many of the critical views are quite unfair to the movie which in my opinion contributes to the whole series of the films and also has plenty offer.It is naturally MARGARET RUTHERFORD who makes even the less clever lines executed unforgettably. She 'creeps about' to uncover what is unavailable for others. She beautifully blends detective features with comedy undertones and does it powerfully in all scenes her gestures her moves her splendid way of executing her lines. The climactic manifestation of skills on the screen occurs to be the scene when she is fencing with the villain. Nevertheless there are many more scenes worth attention including her experiment with the snuff her entrance on board a ship the library scene as well as the encounters with chief Inspector Craddock Charles Tingwell and Mr Jim Stringer Stringer Davis her real life husband. Like in the preceding films there are similar touches and cutting remarks between Miss Marple a real sleuth and the policeman convinced solely by proved fact. This time Mr Stringer does not give Miss Marple 'a leg up' but propels her in the library where a significant book is being discovered.The whole naval atmosphere is provided funnily on board the Battledore particularly by Lionel Jeffries who portrays an amusing 'outmaneuvered' captain a bigoted patriot who owns a blade allegedly granted to his great grandfather by Admiral Nelson himself. He indeed cannot ignore the death of Nelson but what about his attitude towards more recent deaths around him? Yes some wit may appear old fashioned or artificial in certain context but the hilarious scene of broken bottle which he considers a 'diabolical waste' and the finale when at last a woman will be at the helm of the ship constitute the best moments of humor handled by Lionel Jeffries. William Mervyn as Connington Joan Benham as funny Matron Alice Fanbraid Norma Foster as delicious Shirley and Miles Malleson as eloquent bishop give adequate performances.Thanks to the direction of George Pollock the cinematography by Desmond Dickinson and music score by Ron Goodwin the film is supplied with similar charm as all the other preceding parts MURDER SHE SAID MURDER AT THE GALLOP and MURDER MOST FOUL.

When one of the trustees dies of a heart attack while at a board meeting while trying to tell in a most dramatic fashion that something is afoul at the ship Rutherford finds the cause of his death. His snuff box had been laced with strychnine. Does she go to the police with such information she does not.

No wonder this man wants to strangle her she is withholding evidence in point of fact.That bit of business puts Murder Ahoy a bit over the line. It's a maxim in detective fiction that the private eye no matter how much the amateur always shows up the professional.

Two murders later of ship's officers and we do find the real culprit.What was interesting about Murder Ahoy is that there are two separate criminal enterprises going on at the same time on the good ship Battledore. The first murder sets off a chain of events among the villains in which the group involved in one enterprise comes across the second conspiracy and the motives do get tangled up for the police. But of course not for Margaret Rutherford.Fittingly the whole thing is resolved on Trafalgar Day. It was quite a scheme that the murderer's fear of discovery caused the individual to become so homicidal.Margaret Rutherford is of course wonderful as Ms. Marple and she and Lionel Jeffries have some great scenes. Years ago I could have seen the master of the slow burn Edgar Kennedy playing the part as Jeffries plays it.I don't think it's as good as some Christie stories but her fans shouldn't mind at all.".

The characters of the suspects apart from the mostly comicrelief captain of the ship where most of the action takes place on are not distinct enough to make you care whodunit as much as you should though there is one great red herring near the end. Nevertheless Rutherford is still great fun to watch as Miss Marple with some memorable lines Softly softly catchee monkey! and she looks smashing in her naval uniform.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the third entry in MGM's quintet of Miss Marple whodunits starring Rutherford as the eccentric yet highly intelligent spinster detective who time and time again has proved herself more competent than the investigating police even though she is only armed with her knowledge of crime detective novels.In this feature Miss Marple is on jury service at the trial of a young man called Howard Taylor whom is accused of killing his landlady Mrs McGinty for her savings. All members of the jury are convinced of Taylor's guilt except Miss Marple. As a result they are unable to say if Taylor is guilty or not guilty and the trial has to be postponed until a later date. This gives Miss Marple the breathing space she needs to find the real killer.

Director George Pollock who by now had proved that he was a very efficient craftsman effortlessly blends the humor with mystery and one isn't allowed to overlap the other  something that has ruined mystery films in the past. In fact I would say that this was his best ever film as a director. Rutherford plays Miss Marple with a great deal of authority and as always she steals the show. But Ron Moody as Cosgood Tingwell as Craddock and Stringer Davies Rutherford's real life husband as her trusty sidekick Mr Stringer all deserve good notices as does composer Ron Goodwin director Pollock and cinematographer Desmond Dickinson whose black and white camerawork lends the production a considerable atmosphere of the mysterious.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is the third entry in MGM's quintet of Miss Marple whodunits starring Rutherford as the eccentric yet highly intelligent spinster detective who time and time again has proved herself more competent than the investigating police even though she is only armed with her knowledge of crime detective novels.In this feature Miss Marple is on jury service at the trial of a young man called Howard Taylor whom is accused of killing his landlady Mrs McGinty for her savings. All members of the jury are convinced of Taylor's guilt except Miss Marple. As a result they are unable to say if Taylor is guilty or not guilty and the trial has to be postponed until a later date. This gives Miss Marple the breathing space she needs to find the real killer.

Yet four of his Miss Marple films as best remembered for Ron Goodwin's music and the wonderful Dame Margaret Rutherford and real life husband Stringer Davis.The four films of Pollock combined mystery with comedy in a way that it entertains even after 40 years after the films were made. The elements that hold up these four films were great casting good screenplay crisp editing and charming music and sound effects. Pollock is not a David Lean or a philosopherdirector. He is merely making cinema that is gripping and entertaining and how well he accomplishes this.This film is the second only to Murder Ahoy among the four. And since Murder Ahoy followed Murder Most Foul it would be only too clear that Pollock was gaining in confidence and elegance with each film. In each of his Murder films Pollock cast a major British actor. In this one it is the talented Ron Moody Fagin of Oliver!. In each of the four films the chosen British actor provides a counterpoint and balance to Dame Rutherford's major role. One tends to remember Miss Marple and not the other meaty roles Lionel Jeffries Robert Morley James Robertson Justicein each of the Murder films. All the four were memorable but Moody and Jeffries were truly remarkable. I found this a major work of Moody though not as memorable as his interpretation of Fagin and Uriah Heep in other films.The juxtaposition of crime and comedy looks natural thanks to Pollock and imaginative casting. Pollock is probably a quiet achiever deserving more attention by critics and historians of British cinema.".

This is an adaptation of the Poirot novel 'Mrs McGinty's Dead' with Miss M inserted instead. I was expecting a very loose connection with the novel but actually this is a very clever reworking of the story indeed. All the basic elements are there and the writers manage to make the shift from 'residents in an English village' to theatrical boarding house very convincing. I love the mixing up of names from the novel eg Sheila Rendell and Mrs Upward combine into young Sheila Upward and the deliberate pacing as details are revealed we only come to know about the important character of Rose Eva Kane towards the end.Margaret Rutherford continues to delight as a Miss M who is nothing like Christie's creation. The supporting players are all perfectly adequate though noone is really outstanding except maybe Megs Jenkins in the tiny role of a widow ready to snatch up poor Mr Stringer. Its the cleverness of the adaptation that delights here the atmospheric filming the broad comedy and Rutherford's bold performance are the other winning features. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite my later comments below I very much like this film and indeed all the Margaret RutherfordMiss Marple canon. They are well acted and directed and time has certainly lent a nostalgic black and white enchantment to the view with their depiction of a cosy tea and cakes England which never actually existed but which we like to imagine did. And the murders while hardly cosy are interesting too. Indeed and if one forgets such inconveniences as Agatha Christie's 'real' Miss Marple on their own merits all four films while hardly classics of the cinema are most enjoyable and an excellent way of passing the famous wet Sunday afternoon.However although none include the words 'Miss Marple' in their titles they are all marketed as featuring her presumably for fairly obvious commercial reasons and thus I think there is a case for invoking the Trades Descriptions Act as they bear precious little resemblance to the Marple world of the books viz 1. Margaret Rutherford was a brilliant actress and good in this role but she was physically so unlike Agatha Christie's description of Miss Marple that it is difficult to take her characterisation seriously. Miss Marple is variously described in the books as fluffy delicate and I believe like Dresden porcelain and those words ungallant though it must sound cannot possibly be applied to Miss Rutherford. I believe that Mrs Christie shared this view.2. Only one of the films is based on a true Marple story Murder She Said  4.50 from Paddington. Two are actually Poirot stories and the other has no Christie connection at all. The ITV Marple is guilty of much the same.3. Miss Marple has been moved from St. Mary Mead to Milchester. If there is a point to this it escapes me.4. The famous Marple method of solving cases by comparing them with past events and characters from her village has unforgivably been ditched completely.5. Jim Stringer appears in all four films but in none of Christie's stories. Of course the reason for this was to provide a role for Miss Rutherford's husband Stringer Davis who she insisted must be cast in any film she was in. To digress slightly while I much admire and respect the couple's devotion to each other I feel that this was wrong. Although it probably does not apply in the Marple films the character having been created specifically to provide a role for him alone if Mr Davis was the best available for a particular part he would have got it anyway  if not it unfairly deprived another actor. His part here is in any case not really essential being largely confined to fetching and carrying and acting as a sounding board for Miss Marple's thoughts all of which could have been accomplished by other means.6. Perhaps slightly irrelevant but it still irritates me  despite all the help he receives from Miss Marple even gaining promotion on the strength of it at one point Inspector Craddock persists in regarding her as an interfering old busybody who should stop bothering him. With that kind of stupidity he should be back on the beat at least.This is of course all a matter of opinion and I have already seen the view that any story is open to interpretation in any way. I agree with this to an extent but it dependsIMHO on how far it can go before it makes a nonsense of the piece in question. For example Shakespeare in modern dress can be quite valid except in the historical plays they simply did not wear suits jeans and T shirts in 1483. And if Miss Marple can solve a Poirot case how long before we see Iago whispering in Hamlet's ear? Or Dr Watson chronicling the adventures of Sexton Blake? Just one more comment of no relevance whatever to the above. Did you know that Margaret Rutherford is an anagram of Target for Murder? Well almost. There's a rogue AH and R which I can't fit in anywhere. Any printable suggestions?".

	schema:reviewBody "Margaret Rutherford is a delight as an inquisitive defiant dogged analytical and impressively able to think on her feet as an elderly murder mystery enthusiast that can be both a source of misery and information for her local police. When Murder Most Foul begins she is on a jury that gets hung because she doesn't believe the person on trial is guilty.George Pollock the director of this film really sets up a hysterical opening where a cobblestone cop interrupts he believes but Rutherford's Miss Marple later proves wrong a man as he seems to be ropehanging his wife in a diabolical means to make her death appear to be a suicide after a manual strangulation. With money and a rose near the scene Marple starts to deduce that there's more to this than meets the eye. The victim might have been blackmailing someone associated with a theatrical company run by an autocratic eyesontheprize grandiose thespian played to the hilt by Ron Moody. When a second person tied to the company is murdered on the very day Marple is rehearsing for a part with the company's potentially latest play she's sure the man currently jailed is innocent and that one of the current actorsactresses is truly responsible. When an attempt on her own life is narrowly diverted another actress happened to be in the kitchen at the wrong time to turn off an iron as toxic cyanide poison fumes were smoking from a pot on a stove meant for Marple with a letter purposely planted outside her room to get her into the kitchen is also killed Marple seems to be closing in on the identity of the killer. When she learns from an agent Dennis Price Kind Hearts and Coronets  Venus in Furs about the first murdered woman and that a supposed new play by Moody's Cosgood was actually performed eleven years ago with her in it the learned development regarding a child naked Evelyn is the catalyst in an amusing conclusion where Marple proves to the killer that her prop gun has more bang than blanks would provide. Accidental mishaps in the back stage as all that carries out leads to hospital stays in slapstick fashion. Coming to Marple's rescue or a trap door that shouldn't have been open on the stage floor prove to be quite a raucous followup to the killer's confession and downfall.Marple's getting to the truth is what makes this a mustsee for whodunit fans that love their murder mysteries gradually shedding of light events that as a collective bring us through all the dirt and secrets that unveils a murderer. A character named Eva Alison Seebohm is one of the more intriguing characters in the cast she is almost like a harbinger of doom speaking of dreams involving Marple and Death also admitting to being in love with the second victim. She sleepwalks and eventually believes for whatever reason that Marple was responsible for her love's murder. The company has its share of divas and dilettantes mostly catering to whatever butts will sit in their theater's lowly seats. That is what truly amused me about Moody's Cosgood. He really thinks his work is important and that the building will be packed with admirers applauding every nuance and uttered word. Rutherford has a showstopping rendition of The Shooting of Dan McGrew which leaves the three in the building slackjawed. The partnership with Stringer Davis her husband in life as the two work in concert to solve the case he pretty much assists and does as told haha and the anxious but respectable alliance with Inspector Craddock Charles Tingwell offer plenty of charm and appeal. I particularly enjoyed how Marple respectfully corrects Craddock and leads him away from the usual mindset of a cop who follows clues no matter how deliberate they might be in a way which has him reconsidering generalities in favor of key particulars. Without Marple Craddock's chances of solving the crimes committed in Murder Most Foul would have been slim to none. But it is Rutherford's unwillingness to step aside and let an innocent man pay for a crime he didn't commit that is the heart and soul of this series of Marple films. Stunning black and white lensing from Desmond Dickinson especially at the beginning of the film which shows the silhouette of the strangling victim from a window while the cop outside is taking a swig of whiskey near a pub! How Marple is presented as a monkey wrench that halts the criminal justice system from operating in a status quo fashion makes her quite a heroine to root for. No one can pleasantly call a cop naive and gullible quite like Miss Marple and not make him feel like a total fool.".

When she learns from an agent Dennis Price Kind Hearts and Coronets  Venus in Furs about the first murdered woman and that a supposed new play by Moody's Cosgood was actually performed eleven years ago with her in it the learned development regarding a child naked Evelyn is the catalyst in an amusing conclusion where Marple proves to the killer that her prop gun has more bang than blanks would provide. Accidental mishaps in the back stage as all that carries out leads to hospital stays in slapstick fashion. Coming to Marple's rescue or a trap door that shouldn't have been open on the stage floor prove to be quite a raucous followup to the killer's confession and downfall.Marple's getting to the truth is what makes this a mustsee for whodunit fans that love their murder mysteries gradually shedding of light events that as a collective bring us through all the dirt and secrets that unveils a murderer. A character named Eva Alison Seebohm is one of the more intriguing characters in the cast she is almost like a harbinger of doom speaking of dreams involving Marple and Death also admitting to being in love with the second victim. She sleepwalks and eventually believes for whatever reason that Marple was responsible for her love's murder. The company has its share of divas and dilettantes mostly catering to whatever butts will sit in their theater's lowly seats. That is what truly amused me about Moody's Cosgood. He really thinks his work is important and that the building will be packed with admirers applauding every nuance and uttered word. Rutherford has a showstopping rendition of The Shooting of Dan McGrew which leaves the three in the building slackjawed. The partnership with Stringer Davis her husband in life as the two work in concert to solve the case he pretty much assists and does as told haha and the anxious but respectable alliance with Inspector Craddock Charles Tingwell offer plenty of charm and appeal. I particularly enjoyed how Marple respectfully corrects Craddock and leads him away from the usual mindset of a cop who follows clues no matter how deliberate they might be in a way which has him reconsidering generalities in favor of key particulars. Without Marple Craddock's chances of solving the crimes committed in Murder Most Foul would have been slim to none. But it is Rutherford's unwillingness to step aside and let an innocent man pay for a crime he didn't commit that is the heart and soul of this series of Marple films. Stunning black and white lensing from Desmond Dickinson especially at the beginning of the film which shows the silhouette of the strangling victim from a window while the cop outside is taking a swig of whiskey near a pub! How Marple is presented as a monkey wrench that halts the criminal justice system from operating in a status quo fashion makes her quite a heroine to root for. No one can pleasantly call a cop naive and gullible quite like Miss Marple and not make him feel like a total fool.";

As with all her outings as Miss Marple it seems not to matter. Of her four outings this one to me seems the best produced the filming is really slick. The music as always is really good it seems to mirror Rutherford's character.The highlight of the film has to be her audition scene in front of Driffold Cosgood Moody it is a scene of out and out brilliance she shows just how good she was. I like the sequence of Dorothy's death too it's really well produced it's all there dark corridors shadows tense music lightning what more could you wish for?Rutherford as always is a joy to watch wonderfully supported by the excellent cast Ron Moody is wonderful so theatrical James Bolam is great too.

	schema:headline " Spice up your life with some love";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved this film. It made me think if I'm dreaming enough? Or am I just living life by its face value? Don Juan DeMarco is about dreams about fantasies and about love. It raises the important question how much of imagination is enough to spice up your life and not turn you into a delusional freak. Everybody knows and accepts the fact that one can not have everything one desires one can become everything one wants to be. so what do you do? Give up and live the dull and routine life you have or have 2 different worlds one for yourself and one for everybody around you. But while doing that how do you make sure you don't end up severing your link with the real world and end up in a mental asylum. Its this tight rope that Don Juan DeMarco played brilliantly by Johny Depp has to walk on. His real life leaves lot to be desired for. Rejected by his one and only true love he drifts away in his fantasy world where he is the greatest lover of all. By doing that though he is able to transform himself into a real charmer he distances himself from the real world and his real identity. So he ends up in a clinic for delusional patients under the care of weary and dreary pshychatrist Dr Jack played by charming Marlyn Brando. And this is the beginning of the delightful exchange of ideas and vision between the 2 completely different personas. In the process both of them tend to gain and make their lives a little better. Don Juan gets back his identity so that he doesn't have to live in the mental hospital while Jack gets his grove back  Coming back to the technical aspects of the film I don't think there's anything lacking there. Good screenplay solid acting and soothing original score. The script comes up with jewels every now and then which makes you rexamine your own beliefs in life and love. A highly enjoyable film.".

Don Juan DeMarco I don't remember hearing much about it when it was released I think it was one of those small success films. But the thing that was interesting is that so many people who compared Johnny Depp to Marlon Brando on his diverse roles and character acting methods they finally got to work together in this movie and bonus they had great chemistry on screen. Don Juan DeMarco isn't by any means my favorite Johnny Depp film or a great film but it's a good one that I think had a decent story and is very watchable at least one time. Johnny and Marlon just deliver the story so well and were so charismatic on screen. Johnny truly became Don Juan DeMarco.Dr. Jack Mickler is a psychiatrist who is on his last few days before his big retirement. He meets a suicidal man who is claiming that he is the legendary Don Juan DeMarco he is put into the hospital. He begs Jack to take the time to tell him his story and that if he can convince him that he is Don Juan that Jack will let him go. He agrees and Don tells him his story. But Don's grandmother tells Jack a different story is Don really Don or just some crazy guy who is desperately in love with a woman? But Jack believes him and even becomes a Don Juan at home with his wife.Don Juan DeMarco is a cute film and is definitely worth a look. There's nothing wrong with the film I just wasn't into it as much as I am usually thrilled with Johnny or Marlon. But I think this was one of those films they could be more relaxed with and they were already very much established as great actors so they could do a movie like this. It didn't matter that it wasn't a box office success it's just a cute movie that I'm sure you'll enjoy. It definitely leaves a smile on your face and makes you feel good so I would recommend it for a fun little comedy.710".

	schema:headline " Exceptional Romance spiced by witty comedic dialog worth its 10";
	schema:reviewBody "Every movie reflects its times. This one is certainly no exception. The mysteries of courtship have reduced to awkward teenage comedies or sexual romps where the sex has little or no relevance and even less lust.So much of the wonder of this film is derived from its fantasy. As long as we think its fantasy we do not have to ask how accurate it may represent our reality. In other words this film wisely avoids what is and focuses on what should be. Or maybe what was.The movie opens with Don Juan DeMarco Johnny Depp walking with purpose and in the full costume of an 18th century cavalier complete with a cape. He goes into a restaurant. There he finds a beautiful young woman waiting for her dinner companion who is late. Don Juan begins to talk to her. He takes her hand and noticing her knuckles a word of cacophony if ever there was one and delivers an ode which celebrates the perfection of that part of her hand. His words are smooth and his delivery flawless. His sincerity cannot be questioned. She succumbs to his charm. After a seduction he would not have been concerned if he had failed he announces that he is now ready to kill himself! Talk about tongue in cheek.He is set to do it when Marlon Brando enters as the wonderful Dr. Mickler Don Octavio De Flores who is hoisted up to where Don Juan is by a Cherry Picker that he has trouble getting into. Don Octavio immediately talks Don Juan down by accepting whom Juan thinks they both are. That's the wonderful beginning.In the next 10 days Don Juan tells Don Octavio a series of tales that reminds one of Scherezade. In the meantime every woman and one of the men besides Don Octavio a really tall muscular masculine type named Rocco come completely under his spell and they all listen to their hidden romantic side.Don't confuse Don Juan DeMarco with the Decameron. The movie is not really about sex seduction or relationships between men and woman.I may be wrong but I think it is a yearning. It is a cry for something better that we all want for ourselves. What woman would not want to have notice taken of the effort she has gone to make herself as good looking as she can? What man would not like to have the skill to make a woman believe what he says about her? What man does not secretly wish he was so deeply committed to something women in this case that his words would convey his deep feelings effortlessly? Furthermore that his commitment was pure and truthful? That it was not a line? We cannot look at these questions in a movie without covering them with something like fantasy. The ideal is so unappealing. We want instant gratification.I have thought about this for a considerable time and have come to the conclusion that a woman could never accept what I have written without thinking it was masculine crap. If cornered I would agree. But before I did I would point out that Don Juan was a poet whose verses are life. He believes what he says it is his ultimate truth. Seduction and sex are really quite secondary. Finding perfection and conveying it is primary.Don Juan is well worth your twohour investment. Perhaps it will connect you to what you yearn for and the truth everyone seeks.".

His descriptions of sex that many men would turn into vulgar vocabulary lessons nobody ever wanted to hear instead are romantic and sweet. Really we know that we can't expect all guys to live up to a written character that was actually designed to be the greatest lover the world has ever seen... but who's concerned with reality when they're watching Johnny?How this got by with a PG13 rating I do NOT know but who's complaining! I definitely have a feeling this movie was geared towards female audiences and for once the sex scenes highlight the guy! That's where the sex on a stick part comes in. Yummy!I love movies that answer everything and the end to this movie is perfect. It's too good to be true but that's ok. It's unbelievable but that's alright. If you're cynical or if you're well a straight male... then this movie probably isn't the best for you.

Don Juan's exuberant spirit and ability to discern what is truly important is readily contagious.  Marlon Brando is also a joy to watch as Dr. Mickler indeed it's the most he's given himself over to a role in decades. His transformation from bitter tired old man to vibrant wide eyed optimist open to life's gifts is thoroughly engaging. Rounding off the cast is Faye Dunaway as Dr. Mickler's devoted.  She successfully conveys the stunned amazement and joy at discovering an unknown side of a partner she has lived with for decades.

	schema:reviewBody "DON JUAN DEMARCO lives in the comedy section at my local Blockbuster.  I suppose that is the best place for it it does not suffer under the weight of its psychiatricevaluation plot device is exultant and exhilarating and includes some truly laugh out loud funny lines.For the most part though DJDM is a romantic fable with lessons not just for men about how to seduce a woman touching nothing but her hand for example but for women as well about how romance can exist in our everyday lives even if we never encounter Don Juan.Johnny Depp plays Don Juan DeMarco the world's greatest lover  a 21 year old man in Queens NY when we meet him.  He has nothing left to live for and climbs to the top of a billboard to await a worthy adversary who will endhis life.  Instead he gets a somnambulistic psychiatrist on the verge of retirement Marlon Brando who convinces him to come down and promptly commits him for observation.In tone the film is similar to CHOCOLAT which also stats Depp and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE its environment of a psychiatric hospital where the young Don Juan must prove his sanity reminds me of the grandfather in A PRINCESS BRIDE.  It gives us a point of reference in our own world and prevents the unbridled romanticism of Don Juan's monologues from getting out of hand.No man other than Depp could sit squarely in this modernworld fishbowl and deliver the lines of Don Juan.  He insisted on working with Brando on the film but he outshines the cinema icon in every shared shot.  His physical beauty is less important than his utter sincerity  a sincerity so convincing that even my I hate chick flicks husband can watch with a straight face and come away in a better mood.As Don Juan says there are only four questions of value in life What is sacred?  Of what is the spirit made?  What is worth living for?  What is worth dying for?  By the end of the film he has proven his point the answer to each is the same  only love.  Not that the story answers all of its own questions...Is Don Juan a pathological liar and a schizophrenic?  Is he troubled but sincere?  Does Brando's Dr. Mickler really get conflicting evidence from Don Juan's family or has he slipped into a daydream fueled by his desire to recapture the part of himself Don Juan represents?  No matter how many times I see the film I end up believing in Don Juan even if I do not believe him.DJDM gets a 7 in spite of being one of my favorite films. The reason Brando can be nearly intolerable at times but Depp picks up his slack.  Highly recommended to romantics of all ages  one of the sexiest movies in my collection despite its PG rating.".

I suppose that is the best place for it it does not suffer under the weight of its psychiatricevaluation plot device is exultant and exhilarating and includes some truly laugh out loud funny lines.For the most part though DJDM is a romantic fable with lessons not just for men about how to seduce a woman touching nothing but her hand for example but for women as well about how romance can exist in our everyday lives even if we never encounter Don Juan.Johnny Depp plays Don Juan DeMarco the world's greatest lover  a 21 year old man in Queens NY when we meet him.  He has nothing left to live for and climbs to the top of a billboard to await a worthy adversary who will endhis life.  Instead he gets a somnambulistic psychiatrist on the verge of retirement Marlon Brando who convinces him to come down and promptly commits him for observation.In tone the film is similar to CHOCOLAT which also stats Depp and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE its environment of a psychiatric hospital where the young Don Juan must prove his sanity reminds me of the grandfather in A PRINCESS BRIDE.

So why should one care for this movie's weaknesses if they can just enjoy its biggest strength? Well yes Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge takes inspiration from numerous famous films it may be annoying but it works as a film thanks to its comedy which provides quite a few laughs its light presentation music and star cast. Salman and Karisma are the lead pair and they are good looking funny and charismatic. Karisma is just sizzling every time she appears onscreen. Salman is very good in a role that is actually what he is most used to playing. Three of my favourite actors Om Puri Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal play Karisma's loving uncles. All three are fantastic but the one who delivers the most entertaining performance is Anupam Kher with his gay act. He's hilarious. Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge is nothing exceptional but it's enjoyable. It flows very well with the songs and the laughs and is ultimately a great watch for the entire family.".

Anupam Kher is here again!!! Okay so he's gay but he's here again! 7. Boy is so sure he will get the girl in the end. Just to mention a few! The worst scene was when Raja Salman Khan slapped Sapna Karishma Kapoor and her response is to break out in song apologising to him for her UnIndianwomanlike behaviour. Um okay! I take it it's very Indian for a man to land tight slaps on a woman's face at will and expect her to sit there and take it. It might work for India but it doesn't for the rest of the world. The two stars I managed to give it are for Karishma Kapoor's presence and great styledance in the film.".

This movie has realism but it's just mostly compact with people constantly using profanity cheating manipulating and hurting one another. In another words it's the complete opposite of a feelgood movie. And when it's finished it just seems overlong tiresome and not very satisfying. I don't like the moral of this movie either which seemed to me is be a complete utter scumbag and you will win in the end or something like it.3.910".

The build up to this movie is very good and had my interest throughout the whole movie. In fact I was glued to the screen really wanting to know what is going on and it was very entertaining as the pieces of the puzzle started getting put together piece by piece. Even the characters constantly leads you to believe what is going on is something mind blowing. And although everything about this movie is very well done the main disappointing part of this movie is the conclusion. Jeong JaeYeong is very good in this role and so is Heo JunHo who is perfect for this role. YooSun's acting wasn't amazing or anything but I liked her presence in this. The plot about this movie is about a son visiting a village since his father died and finds strange things going on in the village a certain mystery. And the more he digs into what is going on the more dangerous the situation becomes for him. Like I said this movie was way longer than I expected but I don't have any complaints about that since I found the story to keep getting intriguing as it progressed. This film is based on a Korean internet comic and although I haven't read the comic I can tell it stayed faithful to the comic or probably even better than the comic itself. The flashbacks and switching between timelines is done in a clever and fluid manner and doesn't get annoying or irritating while watching. This is a very good Korean mysterythriller that should be seen at least once. Despite knowing the twist I wouldn't mind seeing it again.8.110".

OldBoy Chaser i saw the devil change the way i looked at Korean cinema and thrillers in particularly. this one is no different if not better. everything about it is great the suspense music acting story buildup and even... the final scene. yes its a bit long but worth every second as you cant get bored with t its just getting better and better. i had to go back to the movie thread to understand some of the details i missed  or deliberately left out to the viewers to decide... normally i don't like the directors do that to us poor viewers but here i didn't mind really. all good. very good indeed.";

	schema:reviewBody "Just to sum up how awesome this film was I watched 3 other films on the same day as this one and there were moments where I started to nod off in each of those. Not in Moss and that was at least an hour longer than the 3 other films. It's a testament to the strong writing and complex plot just how well I was emerged in the drama and tension. Moss takes place in a small town which has been specifically built for criminals that really want to rehabilitate. After one of the founders dies his son comes and suspects foul play. He outstays his welcome and soon starts uncovering secrets of the town. Moss works due to its length. Where other thrillers try and condense the twists and turns and action into 2 hours they often leave out humanity. Moss has some wonderful examples of humanity and some great characters. Corrupt detectives suspicious townsfolk etc. All living in the name of justice but their levels of hypocrisy are the secrets. The film holds up due to a wonderful subplot in which Ryu the son must team up with a prosecutor he has disgraced in order to get to the bottom of everything. This relationship is fun to watch unravel as they hate each other but don't resort to annoying childish petty mind games. He may have been banished from the city but the prosecutor is still interested in doing his job. Like many Korean thrillers there is a sense of humor even at the darkest of times. It's shot beautifully capturing the calming power of nature and the eerie reclusive feel that comes with it. The exposition scenes can be long and tiring but they are intercut with flashbacks that remind us of the brilliant makeup work on show. A great reliable genre piece.".

There is nothing novel to the story about 2 guys in love with the same girlJuhi Chawla in this case and how they try to outdo each other. What makes the movie so enjoyable is the treatment and the terrific sense of comedy by both Govinda and Anil Kapoor. Johny Lever is also very good and he gets a lot of scope to perform and does well! Some of the most hilarious moments in the movie are when Satish Kaushik comes in as Pappu Pager and boy that is what people talk about after coming out of the cinema hall! His dialogues had become quite a rage amongst the youth back when the movie release in 1997.Govinda shows what he can do when it comes to comedy and his baby steps baby steps is just superb! Anil Kapoor matches Govinda step to step in this David Dhawan comedy which not many other actors could do it easily in a David Dhawan flick. Juhi Chawla is good at comedy as always and looks great!I wonder how many times I have seen this movie.".

Johnny Lever won an award for his performance in this movie but I felt it wasn't up to his usual standard. Kapoor does a well enough job but isn't a strong enough comedian to play opposite Govinda.

Little does Min Soo know how she would soon become an unwilling witness and a key player in a hunt for a vicious serial killer with her life and those around her on the line.Blind is a merge of a personal drama with action and horror elements and that's maybe the reason I liked this film. Unlike the western productions this brings you closer to the characters and allows you to identify with them. Also Blind confirms a fact that psychopaths are not always some freaks living in forsaken haunted houses laughing hysterically into the mirror and dancing around in grandma's underpants but people who disguise in a fairly normal daily life routine. That makes them harder to spot out and therefore more dangerous.I wouldn't say Blind is the best film of the gene I've seen but it certainly is in the top 10. It's a good material for all fans of Asian cinematography for sure. And another thing... Asian women are simply amazing D".

Living with loss of sight she bumps into a hit and run case and becomes the witness and Police requires help from her in order to catch the madcap out for a killing spree. The investigation continues and as we find that she engulfed herself badly with one more eyewitness Seung Ho Yoo and the chase begins. The plot is strong but execution is little timid however the character development is not up to the mark. The tension evolves from start to end. But sometimes lags behind in the script with the appearance of many characters which have less to do and a bit of melodrama.It is not a balanced and perfect thriller like the chaser Memories of Murder Mother I Saw the Devil etc. but still manages to hold your attention by all means.

	onyx:emotionText "Blind is about a woman Kim HaNeul a former student at the police academy lost her eyes and only brother in an accident. Living with loss of sight she bumps into a hit and run case and becomes the witness and Police requires help from her in order to catch the madcap out for a killing spree. The investigation continues and as we find that she engulfed herself badly with one more eyewitness Seung Ho Yoo and the chase begins. The plot is strong but execution is little timid however the character development is not up to the mark. The tension evolves from start to end. But sometimes lags behind in the script with the appearance of many characters which have less to do and a bit of melodrama.It is not a balanced and perfect thriller like the chaser Memories of Murder Mother I Saw the Devil etc. but still manages to hold your attention by all means. The cinematography is fin and HaNeul Kim is simply awesome.Still recommended for every THRILLER lover because it has all the ingredients of a decent  creepy Korean thriller.710";

As times passes she tries to cope with the accident and simply move forward in life as best as possible.Meanwhile there is a lunatic at large that is killing and torturing young women. The police are baffled and have very few valid leads until fate intervenes one rainy night and the blind woman comes face to face with the killer himself while he's committing a crime. She's called in for police questioning afterwards as more or less a matter of procedure. She's mostly disregarded at first until it becomes more and more clear to the detective interviewing her that she can provide valuable clues and insight to the case despite her disability.A short time later a young punk is also called in as a witness to the same crime that the blind woman experienced. He can see and his recollection of events of the crime contradicts that of the blind woman. As a result of his differing opinion of what occurred the police have no choice to consider this another potentially invalid lead and leave the one detective in charge of sorting it out while they utilize their man power to focus on other leads.Now as should be obvious at this point both the blind woman and the young punk actually did witness the killer committing a crime they just each saw it a little differently. And the killer knows who both of them are and knows they must be silenced so the game of cat  mouse is on between the parties.There's a bonding with the young punk and blind woman as they are chased by the killer this is driven by their instincts to simply survive but it's also augmented by the back story of them getting to know and appreciate  need each other on a more personal level i.e. blind woman starts to look upon young punk as another younger brother she should take care of and help find direction in life and the young punk looks upon the blind woman as a person he should look up to and help protect and cherish as the older sister he never had.This film is not without its faults but I think it works fairly well enough overall. It does what it's supposed to for the most part and is complimented by enough suspenseful scenes throughout to keep you watching...I found the subway chase scene in particular to be highly entertaining and quite unique.I feel this movie is definitely a worthwhile watch...so 7 out of 10 stars for me.".

Potentially most well known for her role in My Girlfriend is an Agent Ms. HaNeul is absolutely outstanding in her role. Ten minutes into the film the audience cannot help but feel immense sympathy for the struggles she is forced to endure on a daily basis.Her character doesn't just look real but equally feels real too Ms. HaNeul ceasing to be herself becoming totally immersed in the role. There wasn't a single moment in the film where I didn't believe she was visually impaired.Moreover the film excels at showcasing the stigma she is forced to suffer from those she meets the film ensuring that viewers are not blind to the abusive opinions of disrespectful individuals who see those afflicted with a disability not as human beings but as hindrances to society.The feature does not attempt to empower the blind instead through SooAh revealing them to be regular people attempting to live a normal life. We witness the existence SooAh has been forced to adopt because of her condition how she is treated by her nearest family and the affection she has for her loyal canine companion SeulGi.For SooAh however this desire to live normally becomes even more complicated when she is witness to a hit and run a case that is linked to a missing person the police are desperate to find.Jo HeeBong portrays Detective Jo an officer who has no interest in investigating a case where the only witness is visually impaired. When a reward is posted for a witness who actually saw the hit and run to make themselves available for questioning Kwon KiSub Yoo SeungHo comes forward contradicting everything that SooAh admitted to hearing which calls her statement into questioning. Can the statement of a blind witness efficaciously lead to the apprehension of a murderer? Although SooAh and the Detective originally appear awkward on screen the chemistry between them as the Detective investigates her side of the story draws the viewer further into the story. Although initially unsure of her capabilities the Detective comes to admire SooAh's strength the working relationship between these characters being as well executed as it is engaging.Despite originally appearing as a rather unlikable character even KiSub proves to be an individual the audience can invest their respect in. Although his character and the Detective's are well portrayed alongside having considerable screen time they each have a limited backstory. Although we can presume to know their history from the limited information we receive it is seldom enough to satisfy our appetite to explore two of the lead characters in the plot.Furthermore greater depth could have being provided to the antagonist. The audience are never granted sufficient information regarding the motivations behind why he kidnaps and murders women nor do we discover what he acquires from these horrific crimes. Is it satisfaction power the Godlike ability to dictate who lives or is there something else in play? As the investigation begins to draw closer to finding a suspect the villain behind it all realizes he is been pursued putting the lives of those who witnessed the hit and run in jeopardy. The tension exhibited during the cat and mouse style sequences that occupy this feature is terrific and one particular chase scene which is beyond expectational is sure to leave audiences riveted.The score assists in accentuating even the most suspenseful moments and the emotional depth provided by not only the script but the actors themselves alongside the beautiful conclusion makes Blind one of those rare films that will keep audiences continuously enthralled.Although every year sees the manufacture of additional films in this genre Blind is one sophisticated thriller that no one should consider missing.".

Other than that it was an enough movie enough action enough mystery enough thriller and enough horror to make it interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "Just about everything about this movie seem formulaic and fake. A lot of people seem to like the actress Kim Haneul but she never really stood out to be. She ain't a bad actress but she pretty much plays the exact same character in every movie. But she plays a blind character well so she isn't distracting or anything like that in this. Although when it comes to her acting it seems to fit more for Korean dramas than movies. The acting from most of the cast was just awful and comedic in a negative way. This one just really lacked originality and most of it is predictable. A woman being blind and is running away from a serial should be frightening because of how defenseless she is. But it isn't frightening cause it's all so fake looking when it comes to all the characters emotions it just looks forced. The cinematography is good for a Asian movie. They did however made a psychotic sexual predator killer really despicable even if that isn't much of a difficult task. This tries to blend a bit of comedy into this thriller but it just doesn't blend very well. Mainly because the comedic elements are not funny with character just exaggerating everything. Didn't feel invested in this flick because the development was just so darn weak with the characters. None of them stood out and the script is weak as well it felt like watching a rehash. This movie probably did alright in Korea because of the cast Kim Haneul for one and Yoo Seungho. Yoo Seungho didn't mean much for this movie to me despite some fan girls he has. I never critic a actor depending on how popular that actor might be with female audiences. But I just find him annoying to watch in every movie and drama he is in. He usually plays a bratty annoying character that is always cocky for no apparent reason. So this has no tension nothing that makes this thriller stand out from the others. This movie just comes off so darn cheesy it gets rid of everything it tries to accomplish. If your blind your other senses increase and this movie did a good job of doing that though although I don't know how realistic it is. The heroes in this movie is just regular bystanders that has no intentions of being heroic and audiences will get why watching this movie.3.510".

	schema:headline " Blind thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Blind is a interesting enough thriller with an idea that is not used to its full potential and that loses too much time on non important things.Min Sooah wants to become a policewoman but one day when taking his foster brother back home they have an accident he dies and she goes blind. Cue three years later and after a fight with her foster mother she gets into a taxi to go home with so bad luck that the driver is actually a serial killer. She doesn't know it and before he can get her to his dungeon they have an accident the car hitting a woman. They fight because she wants to call the police. Min Sooah leaves the car the man takes the hit woman and puts her in the trunk running away. The police puts a very bitter detective to help Min Sooah with finding the taxi driver without knowing that he is also the women abductor they have been searching for a while.So Blind doesn't go very far away from your typical thriller with the exception that the story is centered on a blind woman more than on the detectives. Sadly the movie doesn't offer anything different apart from that so it isn't very original. On top of that the bad guy played with very little flair by Yang Yeongjo is just your typical serial killer. He gets women he kills them. End. He is kind of immortal when the plot asks for it and the police is kind of stupid in their work trying to stop him. Quite sloppy actually.On top of that Blind has some of the traits that all Korean thriller have. Violence is one even though here we don't have much. A lot of swearing is another. And the cheesy moments too. HaNeul Kim is OK as the blind woman but probably the one that steals the show is the dog way more expressive than some of the actors.If you like Korean thrillers Blind is a good enough example but it's not original and falls on the same trappings than other Korean movies. Probably some other movie Memories of Murder A Bittersweet Life A Dirty Carnival... would be a better option.".
