	schema:reviewBody "'To the Fhrer of the German people. Chancellor Adolf Hitler. My Fhrer. As a loyal party member and upstanding German. I turn to you in a time of great need. The Japanese Imperial troops conquered the city of Nanking on December 12 1937. Since then I have witnessed atrocious crimes against civilians. Please help to end this catastrophe and make an appeal to our Japanese allies in the name of humanity. With a German salute John Rabe ' This is an actual letter unheeded that along with the diaries of John Rabe provide the story for this deeply moving film about the Japanese destruction of Nanking as gathered in the book John Rabe Der Gute Deutsche von Nanking edited by Erwin Wickert and adapted for the screen and directed by the immensely gifted Florian Gallenberger. Having just seen Chuan Lu's 'City of Life and Death' a brilliant black and white Chinese epic film about this same period of history it is doubly troubling to view this shameful piece of history. JOHN RABE is after all a biography of the man the Chinese still regard as a saint for providing shelter of thousands of victims of the rape of Nanking and as such we learn much more about the German machinations in the event than in Chuan's film. Burt there is a similarity of distinction in both films the writerdirector shows that both sides of the atrocity had heroes and champions. The film shares the writing of the diary kept by John Rabe during this time frame and follows his diary as the story line. Rabe Ulrich Tukur in a brilliant performance was living with his wife Dora Dagmar Manzell in Nanking for 27 years as the head of the Siemens Factory a German resource for construction in China. They were loyal to Germany were members of the Nazi party but lived the good life in the city Rabe was a compassionate but focused director of the Chinese employees. He is to be retired by the Germans and replaced by a rigid seemingly evil Werner Fliess Mathias Herrmann. On the night of his tender farewell party the Japanese attack and it soon becomes apparent that Prince Asaka Yasuhiko Teruyuki Kagawa plans to decimate the city. There are others from other nations who are working Nanking  in the university Valrie Dupres Anne Consigny in the hospital Dr. Robert Wilson Steve Buscemi and in the German Embassy the Jewish lawyer Dr. Georg Rosen Daniel Brhl  as well as Chinese aligned with Rabe Langshu Jingchu Zhang. When it becomes obvious that the Japanese will slaughter all the populace of the city John Rabe gathers as many Chinese as he can into a Safety Zone where no soldiers or weapons are allowed only the support with food and medical attention and beneficence Rabe is able to gather. The atrocities and bombings continue until the very existence of the Safety Zone is vulnerable. Rabe's gathering of the forces around him to protect as many citizens as he can despite his own gradual physical failure due to his diabetes and lack of insulin gains him the respect and admiration and love of the people of Nanking. The film spares no images of the mass executions the beheadings and the sexual abuse and torture of the people of Nanking by the Japanese. Much of the film is difficult to watch. But even more tragic is the discovery of the information after the film is complete that John Rabe as well as Dr. Georg Rosen returned to Germany as undesirables in 1938 and died in poverty and abandonment by the Germans. The cast is exemplary many fine cameo roles played by fine actors make this film as touching than the main story. This is a very fine cinematic achievement and deserves a global audience.

The movie itself and that's really unfortunate is partially too declamatory and rather kitschy in some parts. Some scenes actually reminded me of sad experiences such as the movie 'Pearl Harbor'. This critique may sound a little harsh because on the whole the movie isn't too bad but I still think it should be mentioned.Now if you are able to take some kitschy love scenes and some heroic moments you might actually enjoy this movie and be able to discover a very interesting and less known story about the Second World War...".

The women were gang raped and if they did not die as a result sexually mutilated to ensure their deaths. The appalling behaviour of the Japanese troops in Nanjing is not sufficiently well known.

	schema:reviewBody "... essentially all has been said but some reviews criticize the diversions from the original story. These would seem to have something to do with Chinese censorship following concerns about economic cooperation with Japan. That may explain the sometimes disjointed story structure and the inclusion of a 'good' Japanese officer warning the Germans about imminent danger to the safety zone while there is still ample display of Japanese brutality  even though if you ever visited the memorial in Nanjing itself you'll find these rather tame in comparison to the photos there.At the time of its release in Germany reviews were largely negative because Rabe's Nazi Party membership was downplayed in the film. His naivety in regard to Hitler is portrayed writing him letters urging Hitler to intervene on behalf of the safety zone but this was seen as way too ambivalent. Gallenberger was criticized for making a 'big' film with Hollywood clichs. And instead of a competition slot at the Berlinale the film was screened as a 'Special' because the festival apparently shied away from controversy. Having only seen it now for these reasons I must say that these complaints are exaggerated. There's nothing wrong with a German director trying to make a real cinematic feature instead of an overblown TV production as it is usually the case. And Gallenberger was certainly the right man for the job given his previous endeavor of a German Bollywood film. Sadly the entirely justified vilification of the Nazi regime still clouds the perception of individuals living in that era and there's some sort of German instinct to snap at everything that could be even remotely interpreted as euphemism  which isn't the case here.What I really liked about the film was that it clarifies that the safety zone was an international 'joint venture' so to speak instead of being due to the efforts of Rabe alone. Buscemi played all the right keys with his character and still restrained his presence to allow Ulrich Tukur to take central stage. And his performance is definitely worth the BlueRay. He is one of the very few German actors with aura Daniel Brhl in my opinion isn't but he's pretty good here as his scenes with Tukur are balanced very well.If you found John Rabe's story amazing you might be interested in the even more controversial Johannes Lepsius who was the principal witness of the Armenian Genocide during World War I  under similar circumstances as Germany and Turkey were allies as with the Japanese at the time of the Nanjing Massacre. I couldn't help but think of that while watching 'John Rabe'  that a film based on Lepsius would be far more controversial than this one since Turkey denies the Armenian genocide to this day even more vehemently than Japan denies Nanjing.I give 'John Rabe' 810 because I feel this film has been treated a little harshly but 7.5 sounds just about right.".

Now this is the German version of that story. There is another side to that coin. And that other side is called City of Life and Death and is made from the Chinese perspective. So I guess the truth is somewhere inbetween.But this fairly good made and has a strong character actor in the midst of it all. The story is really touching and involves a lot of bad things happening.

Now this is the German version of that story. There is another side to that coin. And that other side is called City of Life and Death and is made from the Chinese perspective. So I guess the truth is somewhere inbetween.But this fairly good made and has a strong character actor in the midst of it all. The story is really touching and involves a lot of bad things happening.

John Rabe was a member of the Nazi party and had worked in Nanking as the senior executive for Siemens for many years. In the eponymous film it's suggested that he is about to return to Germany but his departure is prevented by the sudden attack with overpowering military force by the Japanese.Rabe stays and heads a committee that sets up a safety zone around the Siemens works and the main embassies. When the Japanese take Nanking and embark on wholesale rape and slaughter this zone keeps more than 200000 Chinese in greater safety that elsewhere in the city.The story is seen through Rabe's eyes mainly and focuses more on Westerners than the Japanese although the dire impact of a member of the Imperial Family on the decisions made by the Japanese to execute unarmed soldiers is highlighted .Some beheadings are shown but the wide scale practice of rape and enforced prostitution is skirted around. Nevertheless the atmosphere of menace instant arbitrary death and fanaticism is established effectively.The film grips and in its own way inspires. It is interesting to see this film and the more symbolic approach taken by Chuan Lu in 'City of Life and Death'. Both cover the same time period. Both are films that leave you pondering on human nature its heights and its gross distortions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prior to watching this file I have read John Rabe's diary as well as Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking. I have also watched many documentaries and movies made about the subject from China as well as from the US. I found this film to be one of better film on this subject than most of the other ones in existence today.The film is based primarily on the actual diary of John Rabe. Certain details were filledin by the excellent and exhaustive work of Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking. The importance of John Rabe's diary as opposed to the other accounts of what happened during the massacred is the fact that John Rabe was a German Nazi Party member that was working for Siemen in China. Germany was an allied of Japan at the time and there would have been no reason for John Rabe to have lied about atrocities committed by the Japanese if it did not actually happened. Also since John was mainly writing this as a personal diary for himself there does not seem to be any reason for him to have exaggerated his description of the event. As a result his diary is probably the credible historical account of the what actually happened in Nanking.I found some the Chinese version of the film on the subject seemed a little removed from the complex character interactions between most of these reluctant heroes of war. As a result those movies does not seem quite as genuine and touching as this film.Most the events from this film seems very accurate or at least true to the overall sense of John Rabe's diary. Obviously some of the atrocities had to be consolidated to be able to fit those events into a slightly over two hour film. But one of the most puzzling inaccuracy of the film was the fictional character Valrie Dupres at the International Girls College. Why was it necessary for the film to use a fictional character's name instead of the actual courageous heroine Minnie Vaultrin from the Ginling Girls College. She had done so much during the massacred that it seems unfair to not use her real name in the film. This is my primary reason for not giving this film a perfect 10. If anyone can provide an explanation as to why Minnie Vaultrin name was not used in this film I really would appreciate it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most American have either never heard about the Rape of Nanking or certainly know very little about it. Probably almost nobody in this country has heard of John Rabe. This German film tells the true story this man who felt he was a loyal Nazi working for Hitler and his government in Nanking as the Director the German Industrial Siemens factory when the Japanese decided to invade China in 1937. This ultimately brings the Japanese forces led by a relative of the Emperor to Nanking. Rabe found himself having to take actions and make decisions which would effect the lives of over 200000 Chinese. This is a personal drama a war story with thousands of extras an accurate history lesson founded on diaries and the book The Good Man of Nanking as well as an extremely well done movie which will keep you on the edge of your seat for more than two hours. There is a seamless blend of brutal scenes with touching human moments interspersed with black and white authentic newsreels which reminds you although this is a fascinating story it is reflecting all too true events. Usually when we see a World War II movie showing the murder of prisoners and civilians it is the Germans who are doing the killing. However this time it is the Japanese who are murdering the Chinese. In one unforgettable ironic scene Rabe is outraged at acts of the Japanese who are of course allies of the Germans. Therefore he sends a fruitless telegram to Hitler asking and expecting him to insist that the Japanese stop murdering innocent people. Ulrich Tukur plays Rabe and won the equivalent of the German Academy Award as did the movie. American actor Steve Buscemi superbly plays Dr. Robert Wilson the American doctor who actually founded the hospital in Nanking and worked very closely with Rabe. The screenwriter and Director is Florian Gallenberger who took a couple of years researching and writing the movie. He told us of the conflicts that he had with the Chinese government during the preparatory phase of the movie. You should see this movie in your local theater if you can. However if you end up watching it on Netflix hopefully there will be a director's narrative or interviews with Florian Gallenberger. Despite his relative young age he was a major player in this very large endeavor. He is extremely articulate in English his second language and relates a fascinating account of the making of this movie.".

In other words while the film DID show some of the Japanese atrocities it didn't do muchprobably because it would nauseate most viewers. BUT by doing so it minimized the evil that was perpetrated heremaking the Japanese troops seem almost normal. It's rare but I would have included much more blood and talked much more about the rapes and murder of children.

For a character like Rabe you cannot just call him a benevolent Buddha and expect all the viewers to just know the details. I actually enjoyed Buscemi as Dr. Wilson though I doubt Rabe would've sat still for the Hitler song even while drinking! Wilson wore himself out almost to death in the hospitalwhere he would've found a moment for such a scene is a question. The one BIG issue that is appallingly inaccurate to the point of being offensive is the fictive character of Ms. Dupre. As one who has studied this period and read biographies on the main players I kept wondering WHERE was Minnie Vautrin the principal of Jinling Women's College and WHO was this French woman?? How in the world did the creators of this movie go to such lengths to dramatize Rabe's life in Nanjing yet make up this silly female character to replace an actual real wonderful and strong character like Vautrin? It just made NO sense to me at all. The Chinese called Rabe The Living Buddha for the immense efforts he made to save them and as I said more of this needed to be shown and Minnie Vautrin an American educator who loved China was called the Goddess of Mercy there was no romance between them but only an immense respect and need to help the Chinese. A romance seems to be implied between Rabe and this Miss Dupre character which is a ridiculous development especially leaving out the REAL Vautrin and her work. Also some of the plots seemed superfluous such as the development with Rabe's wife and the emotional level was more shallow than I expected for a film about such a man as Rabe. Not a bad film but just lacking in so many ways. I almost shut it off half way through out of sheer frustration with the lack of fact and the madeup characters but stuck it out. There were glaring errors and a disconnectedness to the story that were too distracting for me personally however I do recommend it in the end if only to those who want to know more about such a great man as John Rabethough even for a movie hound like m'self I think READING about him is better than anything this movie offers.".

There have only been a few films about good Nazis that I know of although I'm sure there are others I'm missing this film Seven Years in Tibet and the 49th Parallel. This alone makes this film interesting.But John Rabe the film is also about the Rape of Nanking the atrocities committed by the Japanese military to the Chinese people in the city of Nanking. This also would be enough to make this movie interesting.So we have a movie with two interesting topics but ultimately fails as a compelling work. Why? The director pulled far too many punches in regards to the violence of Nanking. Maybe I'm a little hardened by watching films but there was nothing about this movie that jumped out at me and drove home the lawlessness and violence of the Japanese occupation of Nanking. There is no way to show this and be discreet. The middle of the film was crying for a lurid montage of gang rapes flies on corpses and the worst depravities you can think of. John Rabe's own diaries describe many of these you wouldn't have even had to think up any of your own and you could have had his character narrated the whole thing.The film fails in depicting the Rape of Nanking but it also fails in depicting the good Nazi too. The movie needed a moment several years later with John Rabe confronting the Nazi atrocities in WWII and comparing them with the Japanese atrocities in Nanking. We need to see him understand what his own people have done and what his membership in the Nazi party truly means as a stain on his character. We needed to see him understand that and tear up his membership card or something. We however do not and the movie is much the poorer because of it.Despite this the movie is still beautifully shot with good production value limited but effective CGI and wonderfully acted. The movie is ultimately frustratingly incomplete and is not the best that could have been done with the material but it was enjoyable while it lasted.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Rabe the title of this film is a name that not really that many people have heard of so far so this is already one perspective from which it made sense that Florian Gallenberger made this movie. He is an Academy Award winner and this is one of the reasons why he is still among Germany's most known filmmakers these days. Here he adapted the book by Erwin Wickert and directed as well. I read somewhere that Ulrich Mhe was supposed to play the main character which also would have been an interesting choice but Mhe's illfated health got in the way and the consequence was Ulrich Tukur taking over in what can be considered a careerdefining performance. I believe he was very convincing as the title character. And he also looks quite different physically compared to other roles from his career. The best supporting performance here comes from Steve Buscemi and he is an actor that you would not really expect in a film like this with France China and Germany being the countries who are listed under producing. This came out shortly before Buscemi appeared on Boardwalk Empire.After watching this film I must say that it's nice that Rabe got his own film finally. But I also believe this movie is probably more relevant to Chinese maybe even Japanese audiences because of the historic impact depicted in here. Pretty much the entire film is set in China of the 1930s before World War II when bloody conflicts between Japanese and Chinese with the former being the aggressor happened way too frequently sadly. I read somewhere that the character of John Rabe has some parallels to Oskar Schindler and I would agree but just partially. The context is really entirely different and the location where it all takes place is reason enough already to be careful with such a comparison even if both men had saved many many innocent lives. This movie here was a huge success at the German Film Awards back then and won the big prize among others. It was another example of Gallenberger combining Germany with an entirely different country far far away in terms of plot and storytelling and it is one of his biggest successes so far.This was not the first time Gallenberger worked with actor Daniel Brhl but I must say I found Brhl very forgettable here. It is a very stereotypical performance and I have seen pretty much the exact performance by Brhl in many films in terms of mannerisms and approach to the character. He has two or three films where he is pretty great but he is basically very much the same in everything else. But back to this film here. I think the biggest strength is that it never only relies on the Rabe plot but brings in several side stories such as the one with the girl who is about to get raped and her brother saving her. I also don't think it takes away any relevance from Rabe as the main character as Tukur immediately has audiences glued to the screen when he is in the center of attention. I do believe this was a convincing film overall and the good outweighs the bad. It did not make as much of an emotional impact for me as I hoped but there are still a handful fairly great and memorable scenes and moments. Go see it.".

And even if it was exactly thus it is a scarcely defensible narrative for such a movie in 2009.In the final analysis JOHN RABE seems to have been made as crowdpleasing awardbait and judging by the German Film Awards it has racked up it can already be judged as success in those terms.

Some atrocities are depicted and it is graphic but not excessively. The language is a mixture of English and with subtitles in English for the dialog that is in German and Chinese and Japanese. The acting is very good  the title character is convincing because he isn't some major movie star that you would think of as just acting. Supporting cast are top notch including Steve Buscemi portrays an American doctor working in a hospital and Daniel Bruhl plays a German who helps organize the Safe Zone.Very telling is the portrayal of the leader of the Japanese forces who was a member of the Japanese Royal family and who escaped punishment after the War.

His credentials as a German citizen a formal ally of Japan is one of his most important contributions to the task.

Some of the living were used as bayonet practice targets. How does a culture that promotes such delicate arts as bonsai and origami that is so terribly polite manage to tolerate such brutality in its military? Nobody knows. The anthropologist Ruth Benedict tried to explain it in terms of the difference between shame and guilt. At any rate the cast varies in the way it fits the characters. John Rabe is played by Ulrich Tukur the nominal hero and he couldn't be a better choice  distant formal and yet as mousy as Donald Pleasance with a mustache would have been. Anne Consigny as the French school mistress is strikingly beautiful and gives a fine performance. Steve Buscemi is at first the undiplomatically brash American doctor who hates Rabe for his Teutonic background but eventually learns to respect and admire him. Buscemi doesn't seem to belong. With his pale face bulging eyeballs and sharklike incisors he looks more like Dracula than a doctor and he sounds as if he just ran away from a Quentin Tarantino set.In a way it's a formula movie rather like Schindler's List the kind of movie that wins awards. For the most part the good guys are attractive and the bad guys are ugly. A handful of highstatus types band together at the risk of their own lives to save several thousand Chinese.

The whole reason the Safety Zone was going to be razed and the reason it was eventually taken over by the Japanese was that the school was harboring Chinese prisoners of the Japanese i.e. Chinese soldiers who if caught by the Japanese would have been massacred. But at the end of the film the Japanese do take over the Safety Zone so it seems unlikely that they would not have discovered the prisoners. Consequently again a huge risk was taken by Rabe and the others not to mention the Chinese defenders for a futile purpose.".

Victor Salva was a fan of those movies and it shows when he wrote Jeepers Creepers a fun horror film with a great new movie villain. Not to mention it was a nice break from all the crazy CGI films of late this was an old fashioned make up horror movie. With two good lead actors and their silly clichs that are guilty pleasures this was a fun road trip movie with the great creeps.Trish and her brother Darry are coming home from college. As they drive through the countryside a mysterious driver in a rusty old delivery truck tries to run them off the road. After letting the vehicle pass them they later see the same truck in the distance off the side of the road with a hulking man sliding what looks to be bodies covered with blood stained sheets into a large pipe sticking out of the ground next to an old abandoned church. Darry insists they go back and investigate. At the bottom of the pipe he finds hundreds of bodies sewn together covering the walls of a massive cavern beneath the church. They go to a restaurant and call the cops they are phoned by a local psychic Jezelle who warns them that they are in terrible danger. She plays the song Jeepers Creepers on the phone and tells them that when they hear that song they will be in extreme danger.There may be clich moments with why these two smart adults go back to find the dead bodies the psychic lady who everyone think is a psycho and never listens to her and the chase scenes are a bit predictable. But I absolutely loved this movie and the risks it took. The creeper is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time. His make up effects and the way he hunted down his pray was just terrifying and gross at the same time. He sniffs his victims their items and when they have something that he wants he won't stop until he has it.Justin Long and Gina Philips did a good job and had great chemistry. One of the things I loved about the film that instead of a clich boyfriendgirlfriend story they're brother and sister. Their relationship seemed genuine the way they played off each other was perfect. My only complaint is that sometimes Gina did play the role a little dead though I can get past it since her character seems to have a tougher edge probably from a tough break up before we meet them on the road trip. I also like that the film reminded me a little bit of Steve Spielberg's first film Duel and I wouldn't doubt that Victor got some inspiration from that film. The cars are also play a major role as a villain and what a haunting honk the creeper's truck made. I really liked Jeepers Creepers it's scary funny and clever and people need to lighten up because this is one of the better horror movies to come out in years.810".

Jeepers has several things going for it suspense developed characters aboveaverage acting and visual style.  That's not to say it's great or even very good.  The movie is wildly uneven a problem bound to disappoint anyone grabbed by its beguiling opening.About that opening like the lowbudget filmmaker he most resembles George Romero Salva has built his story upon simple elemental horror.  Kids witness what look like bodies being dumped down a sewer pipe next to a rotted church their curiosity must be satisfied.  What he accomplishes in the first act is a quite masterful bogeyman setup disturbing yet inviting and for a moment we may think we hear Tobe Hooper's chainsaws. Especially good is Salva's patience in developing his sibling protagonists their dialogue and reading good enough to establish what most genre work can't even dream of  plausible characters.  But where Romero is famous for exploring the dimensions of his deceptively simple premises Salva retreats from them into mannered predictability.Narrowing his scope to a cat and mouse game the writerdirector fritters away too many possibilities even before the second act is out and the third act is plainly bad.  Why bother subverting expectations early on if you're only going to resort to clich later?  The clairvoyant character is lifted from The Shining the police station siege is a  Terminator retread. And why establish an aesthetepredator at all if you're only going to have him jump out periodically and kill like any Freddy Krueger?  Salva has complained about lastminute budgetary restrictions yet so much has gone wrong by the final half hour dissipating tension squandering sympathy indulging in camp and the worst misstep calling in his deus ex machina voodoo chile that it's hard to see what more money could have done.Salva's imagery however is always striking.  The production design is shoestring brilliance helping make his highway and sewer pipe sequences genuinely spooky.  And there's subtext aplenty.  The current of fetishistic erotic violence invites all sorts of interpretation in fact fairly or not this may be the first horror film for which knowledge of the director's wellpublicized past seems likely to make some parts scarier.".

Good frankly I needed a break from the masked kitchenknife wielding stalker psycho. Now that's not to say it's the best horror film far from it but an entertaining one. There's still that horrormovie logic from time to time like actually trying to sneak into a possible serial killer's body dumping site. You would think they would've of kept going and never come back like I know sure as hell I would have. But overall the film is a breath of fresh air to me considering the terrors of I Know What You Did Last Summer and so on.Victor Salva brings a different feel to this film then what we normally see which is a teenage blond or brunette screaming at the top of her lungs while running at a moderate speed. The atmosphere of dread he sets up is great. Most of the cast is rather secondary if important at all but that's just fine with me because Gina Phillips and Justin Long portray genuine terror and it just really shows that is an above average horror movie. The first few times I saw it I was pretty damn scared so the film accomplished what it set out to do.".

Although the brother and sister's rivalry was played up just a bit too much their characters were still a lot more believable than most modern scare films.  Their dialogue was especially natural and didn't contain a single oh my god like did I just totally see like an undead demon or is it just me? which I praise the writers for there's only so many times Buffy the Vampire Slayer can say lines like that before I start doing a little slaying of my own.  Despite the constant squabbling the kids do you can still warm up to them enough to feel empathic about their plight.  The cinematography was excellent my favourite scene being the long pan up the side of the church.  The music and sound were cued perfectly and conveyed a true sense of fear anxiety and isolation.Unfortunately the second half of the movie really suffers.  Like so many other movies once the killermonster is revealed the whole thing goes down hill.  It goes from relying on Xfileslike suspense to bland gore and a clich monster suit.  Top it off with some overacting we're not taking any crap police officers and a poorly acted psychic lady and you turn what could have been a gem of a scary movie into a second rate dud.  The biggest disappointment was the end.  It was horribly tacked on in a desperate attempt at being a shocker.Other then the whole second half the only other complaint I have is regarding the DVD.  The menus show clips from the movie which essentially run in sequence and if you pay attention to them they spoil just about everything.  Where they are what the monster looks like etc.  I haven't bothered to watch the menus all the way through but with any luck they spoil the ending too but that's not really so bad in this case.".

It's got enough ambiance suspense and general all around creepiness going for it to make it worth a viewing for genre fans.A brother and sister named Darry and Trish Justin Long and Gina Philips are driving home during Spring Break and are taking the long scenic route through the country. Unfortunately they soon begin to be victimized  over and over and over again  by a mysterious entity that simply won't go away and has been doing some nasty things to various human victims for a long time.Now granted some fans can  and do  take issue with the way some of the movie is scripted  but God knows horror movies have had plenty of instances of dumb characters doing dumb things over the years and what goes on in this movie is far from unique. Also it's true enough that this movie works best in its first half when Salva is stressing a mystery element and we don't know just who or what is stalking these kids. Once the nature of the monster is revealed it is hard for the movie to not start falling into the clichs of the genre. For one thing this monster just keeps coming and coming no matter what is done to it.Still one has to love some of the odder WTF moments in Jeepers Creepers  including a tongue being pulled out of a severed head  and appreciate the horrific imagery of one of the movie's major set pieces when Darry is investigating the monster's lair where it has been arranging dead bodies in what he describes as a psycho version of the Sistine Chapel. The monster design by Brian Penikas is effective once we see it even if it's not terribly imaginative. The rural location work is excellent the atmosphere is strong the music by Bennett Salvay is good and there's a steadily building amount of tension throughout the whole thing. Salva does have this thing hit the ground running as the first major scares  action scenes occur within the first five minutes.The acting is pretty good Philips and Long are likable and make a pretty convincing pair of siblings Jonathan Breck is suitably spooky as the monster and also has a small secondary role as a cop in the police station Eileen Brennan contributes a memorable turn as a stereotypically nutty cat lover and Patricia Belcher is fine as our exposition provider a psychic lady whose head just happens to be filled with details on how the monster operates. Some viewers take issue with the presence of the character but she didn't really bother me personally. One element that becomes a character in its own right is the ugly demonic truck that the Creeper drives that thing is pretty bad ass.All things being considered this is a good if not great movie whose concept at least has shown some durability one sequel came along two years later and fans are hoping that a proposed third movie sees the light of day.Seven out of 10.".

So how come an hour into the movie I found myself really enjoying it? The story was actually going good it also was actually scary scary like Halloween not Scream. Which is a good change. Remember don't listen to what other people say if you like scary movies and no not to take them seriously go see this it's worth the money.";

	schema:headline " Still a teen horror when you get down to it but one that is better than the majority of the genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Trish and Darry Jenner are brother and sister coming back home via the back roads for the holiday break. Their journey is uneventful until they are terrorised by 'some jerk' in a beat up old truck  an event they get over until they later see the driver unloading what looks like bodies into a hole as they drive past. Escaping the ensuing chase Darry insists they go back to see what he was doing  something he deeply regrets doing when he finds mutilated and preserved bodies all over the inside of the pit. They escape the truck again but their attempts to get help lead to nothing and they find themselves battling much more than the psycho driver that they first feared.This film was overly praised on its release because it was refreshingly free of the selfawareness and irony that many modern horrors had been full of since Scream. For my money though the lack of irony didn't mean it would be a good horror movie and not being good with the scary stuff at the best of times I decided to give it a miss. When it came on TV I decided to give it a go even though I'm not really a fan of the teen horror genre. However this film is actually a lot better than the normal teen horrors because like the critics said it isn't full of the usual clichs and so on. Instead the plot is a pretty tense and simple affair where we are only given two teens rather than a group that will slowly be picked off. The film is not terrifying but it is pretty creepy and has a good consistent tone to it that is quite unnerving.The strength of the film is that it doesn't lose momentum when the creature is revealed usually modern creature features lose a lot of their tension when the usually CGI beast is fully seen. Here we have several stages truckshadowmancreepy manbeast and they all are effective. Salva directs well and injects a good sense of tension into the film but he also knows how to frame a shot  his use of darkness and the tunnel spotlight effect both being pretty effective. Of course it is still just a horror movie and is not perfect but I must admit that I was drawn into it easily early on even if it did tend to flag a bit as it progresses.Even though it is not strictly a teen horror we still have to put up with two rather annoying teenagers in the lead role but I suppose that is to be expected from Salva  according to the courts he has worked with minors before! In fairness to both the actors in the lead roles they do pretty well managing to come across real when required as opposed to fodder filler but also seeming genuinely afraid. Both Phillips and Long were better than I expected and did well acting as the core of the film. The creature itself is also a good presence even if it does lose a little bit of its creepiness when the wings come out.Overall this was a surprisingly enjoyable horror movie but of course it is still a teen horror of sorts so don't assume that it will be perfect  it still does pretty much what you expect it to. Like the critics though I enjoyed its lack of knowing cynicism and it did have a good sense of pace and tension even if it wasn't really 'horrifying'. Still a teen horror then but one that is better than the norm and worth seeing if you like the genre.".

Seriously I did  look at the character interaction between Trish and Darry  theyre supposed to be brother and sister but their dialogue seems to consist of slanging matches . In fact I was expecting the dialogue to degenerate into  Hey big sister must be a novel experience being in someones car with your clothes on  or  Stop whispering  I love you  to your hand little brother  . I dont know if Im reading too much into the script here but theres something very sleazy about this sisterbrother relationship  it almost has incestious overtones . Slightly disgusting and its not heped by the fact that Gina Philips and Justin Long play their roles in much he same manner as Christina Applegate and David Faustino played Kelly and BudHappily however this is all forgotten as the script descends into grade Z territory . Normally this would have ruined a potentially good story but if it keeps my mind away from the creepy relationship between Trish and Darry then this is possibly a good thing . Sorry Im lying because this script insults its audience like no other movie Ive ever seen . Lets see now1  A monster demon drives around in a truck . Think about that for a moment. A big bloody monster demon drives around in a truck and no one notices . Did the monster order it through the mail ? I thought perhaps a salesman would have noticed hes sold a truck to a monster at the showroom . And wouldnt someone with a truck  monster or otherwise have to stop at a gas station to get it serviced and filled with gas ? And wouldnt have the pump attendant have noticed the customer is a monster ?2  If the monster can fly while holding a body why does it need a truck in the first place ?3  If a monster appears for a few days to go on a killing spree every 20 odd years then how come no one in the locale seems to know about this legend except for a psychic ?4  Dozens of bodies lie piled up in a derelict building . How come the police havent had any reports of missing persons ?5  The monster is after Darry so come the monster waits until the end of the film to snatch him when hes had plenty of opportunity to do so before ?So you see this is a really poor script  The directing isnt much better by the way  lacking in internal continuity  logic and intelligence . There are one or two scenes with potential but they have been totally ripped off from DUEL  THE TERMINATOR and the works of Clive Barker . Its absolutely ridiculous a film like this got funding without anyone noticing the massive plot holes  just about anyone reading this page could have written a better screenplay . Even worse someone in Hollywood thought this junk deserved a sequel . No Im not making his up  theres going to be a JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 coming out in late Summer . Seeing as the makers of this crap treated the audience with such contempt the least we can do is to give the sequel a wide berth . If you havent seen the original then take my advice and dont bother to see it because you wont be missing anything worthwhile".

But the driver isn't just an ordinary psycho or a madman it's a demon that has to feed on humans every 23 years during 23 days... If you want something scary and creepy this movie is the thing you are looking for. People who don't like blood dead bodies heads being chopped off... better choose something else to watch. I liked it and I would have given it a very high score if it hadn't annoyed me a little too often. Now I give it a 610 which is still not bad.".

She deserved to die as much as they did.  I was cheering for them to die.  I was absolutely ped that only the brother died.  I was waiting for the sister andor the psychic to join Darry.  This movie sucked.  Dont waste your money.  Out of 10 it gets a 1.";

He shoves his opponent to the pavement suggests that he'd look particularly good dead then notices that everyone is standing around agape smiles reassuringly pats the guy on the shoulder and hands him a good deal of money to buy and bring back  Some chicken ribs stuff like that. He calls out Keep the change to the grateful survivor of this encounter. All of Freeman's violence comes as a surprise particularly when Chris Reeves tries to cool him down and Freeman whips around and holds a broken bottle before Reeves' face with the steady sure hand of a surgeon. Almost invariably these episodes are followed by big friendly grins pats on the back assurances that things are back to normal generous offers of food drink or money. The change takes place in less than a second. Freeman is smarter than anyone else in the movie too. The main figure in a celebrated journalistic effort he and his girl are invited to the publisher's party where everyone showers them with attention while they chat about the Hamptons. Afterward Punchy exults over the attention but Freeman sees through it all. He knows condescension when he sees it and he is filled with resentment. Trying to put something over on Freeman is like trying to slip sunrise past a rooster.But Kathy Baker as the used Punchy deserves credit as well although her part isn't nearly as showy and dramatic as Freeman's. She's just beyond the bloom of youth rather used looking and heavily made up and her figure while ripely pleasant wouldn't draw stares in a supermarket. She's very appealing indeed in her vulnerability and aloneness.Chris Reeve is usually ignored in reviews. I don't know why. He's rarely anything but bland but this is by far his best performance and he invests his character with ambition confusion fear and compassion  not an easy role. The scene in the hotel bedroom with Kathy Baker in which she seduces him knowing that behind that facade of journalistic objectivity lies a man who would just love to get it on with her whether or not he realizes it. She demonstrates how she made it with her first john and makes Reeve play the partner. The silly madeup dialog fades and is replaced by Natural Woman on the sound track. The two have a relaxed enjoyablelooking mutually appreciative little love scene. It's a pretty good movie and involves us emotionally in several different ways. Alas as I say the end is almost an embarrassment. The bumbling Reeve character turns into a genius and other characters into the fools they never were. Don't let that stop you from watching this.".

	schema:headline " Morgan Freeman Is Great As Always But Story Lacks Crucial Plot Points";
	schema:reviewBody "Street Smart is a movie not a lot of people appear to remember from the 1980's. What attracted me to the movie was the fact that Morgan Freeman received his first ever Academy Award nomination for his role as a pimp in this film. Freeman hasn't played a role like this before or since and his best known roles to come after this including Oscar nominated roles have consisted of more positive characters with effective leadership skills. Although Freeman doesn't play the type of positive AfricanAmerican role model here that he is now best known for playinghe gives the character of Leo Smalls Jr. a.k.a. Fast Black a threedimensional performance that few other actors black or white would have been able to pull off. He's not just an intimidating presence or a guy who wears flashy clothes. In fact the scenes where he goes back to his apartment and a poster of Martin Luther King Jr. can be seen in the background says volumes about his character.Without a doubt Freeman's performance is the best thing about this movie. The rest of the movie is indeed intriguing but has a few weaknesses which makes it feel a little halfbaked. With a running time of 94 minutes at least 20 minutes of footage could have been added to account for these skimmedover plot details without throwing off the pace of the film.The late Christopher Reeve is Jonathan Fisher a Harvard educated print journalist who is under pressure to write a magazine article in a weekend. He submits an idea to his publisher seemingly off the top of his head about 24 hours in the life of a pimp. The story is supposed to be true but Fisher feeling intense encumbrance to get a story to his editor fabricates one instead. To his surprise the story makes the front page Fisher becomes a celebrity overnight and moves up to his own TV news segment.The trouble comes in when some readers believe the article is about one particular real pimp Freeman who happens to be on trial for murder. Among those wary readers is the leading prosecutor for that case. Although the fictional article depicts no murder of any kind Fisher is still ordered to give the court his notes in the trial or be subject to a jail sentence.With the trouble comes a story that keeps the viewers' interests high for what comes next but plot holes that accompany the story remain unexplained throughout. For instance we have some of an idea what Reeve's character wrote in the article but no idea what in the article would be considered circumstantial evidence in a murder trial. Having a series of imaginary montages with Reeve's idea of a pimp as he's writing the story would have cleared that unexplained plot point up easily. Plus although Reeve's character is Harvard educated that's all we know about his character. How did he come up with the idea to write about a pimp in the first place? Since we never see him in the inner city until after he submitted the story proposal that occurrence remains unexplained also. Reeve did a great job playing a guy who tries to maintain control of his life and career only to have both be in jeopardy as his situation goes over his head. It would have been more helpful to establish some real roots for his character though not to mention a moral compass of some kind.There were some other times where the story felt shaky but the film had other great qualities. For instance the inner city in the film looked far more real than other gritty urban dramas I've seen over the last few years where the movie sets looked like movie sets and the houses looked too polished. Overall though the film is worth checking out for Freeman's performance and probably should be remembered better in Reeve's career than Superman IV The Quest For Peace. If anything this movie showed that Reeve can play a character who has everything under control Superman just as well as one who does not.".

To his surprise the story makes the front page Fisher becomes a celebrity overnight and moves up to his own TV news segment.The trouble comes in when some readers believe the article is about one particular real pimp Freeman who happens to be on trial for murder. Among those wary readers is the leading prosecutor for that case. Although the fictional article depicts no murder of any kind Fisher is still ordered to give the court his notes in the trial or be subject to a jail sentence.With the trouble comes a story that keeps the viewers' interests high for what comes next but plot holes that accompany the story remain unexplained throughout. For instance we have some of an idea what Reeve's character wrote in the article but no idea what in the article would be considered circumstantial evidence in a murder trial. Having a series of imaginary montages with Reeve's idea of a pimp as he's writing the story would have cleared that unexplained plot point up easily. Plus although Reeve's character is Harvard educated that's all we know about his character. How did he come up with the idea to write about a pimp in the first place? Since we never see him in the inner city until after he submitted the story proposal that occurrence remains unexplained also. Reeve did a great job playing a guy who tries to maintain control of his life and career only to have both be in jeopardy as his situation goes over his head. It would have been more helpful to establish some real roots for his character though not to mention a moral compass of some kind.There were some other times where the story felt shaky but the film had other great qualities. For instance the inner city in the film looked far more real than other gritty urban dramas I've seen over the last few years where the movie sets looked like movie sets and the houses looked too polished. Overall though the film is worth checking out for Freeman's performance and probably should be remembered better in Reeve's career than Superman IV The Quest For Peace. If anything this movie showed that Reeve can play a character who has everything under control Superman just as well as one who does not.";

I agree with previous reviewers that the late Chris Reeve's performances in other movies and at times this one could be seen as wooden. That being said I think he played his role extremely well because it was able to work with Morgan Freeman's outbursts and explosions. Because of the problems encountered by his fabricated story Reeve's performance was handled well being outside of his environment as much as he was. He was unsure and understated and being a reporter being unemotional was in his well being. On the other end Morgan Freeman was fantastic! Seeing him in a role like this makes you want to see him take on a role where he can be the loose cannon. This movie can show what happens when you create a story and you do it TOO well.

Most of the characters that Freeman plays especially of late are good hearted good natured and easy going that make him a likable character viewers come to expect that type of character but this one reminds me of the one Denzel Washington played in Training Day. Hard mean and ruthless totally opposite from what we're used to seeing from either actor but a refreshing change. The fact that it's the complete opposite from their usual rolls give them that much more impact.And while movie ad excerpt quotes praising performances are almost always the sign of a stinker damning with faint praise in this case I think Morgan Freeman's performance is worth this movie alone. It's nuanced and a perfect study of a sociopathic personality. Freeman plays a total predator who will brutalize without conscience but will pour on immense charm in the next second as a way of manipulating others. No one had ever heard of Morgan Freeman before this movie...but he was nominated for an Oscar for this performance. He should have won it! The energy level on screen goes down infinitely when Freeman is not present. Kathy Baker also does a decent job as one of Fast Black's prostitutes. All in all the movie was enjoyable had a good storyline and is a mustsee for Morgan Freeman fans and Christopher Reeve fans.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

Near it's climax especially is where the story wasn't handled well where that part was is over too quickly despite an climactic moment an unforeseen fate for one that did make sense from the other party that wrapped the film up. I really thought that section was weak and there are a couple of other forgettably weak moments that don't spark. Many actors playing pimps put on the macho what have you act. With Frreman it was vet natural and much more realistic I really wanted to know more about as he's not your usual pimp but boy he radiates some real menace. Supposedly based on a true article well you know journalist Reeve average here pressed for a deadline resorts to making up a story of a pimp as researching parties aren't that cooperative and Reeve doesn't want to be out of a job either. When his faux article on a fictional pimp conflicts with another pimp being charged for manslaughter I mean what are the chances really? Reeve finds himself in hot water playing hardball with prosecutors all so ready to take pimp Leo Small aka Fast Eddy Freeman down. There's a great dilemmasituation of story here as in Reeve's impasse which intensifies some. Manslaughter is a son of bitch where an early scene has Freeman trying to stop a perverted sicko beating up on a ho where one swift kick puts the old's guys ticker out so really Eddy has copped a bad serve. But manslaughter is manslaughter and like the rough dangerously and manipulative pimp with a charming facade Eddy is he's as that prosecutor describes better off the street and behind bars. In short he's menace. Reeve in his own mind eventually comes around to that analysis as well. I kind of had the feeling the story was losing it's way or a bit too vague in it's telling of this tale as though not enough discipline was given to it. Again though as it has done many times before I really found it hard to believe the chances of this coincidence happening as it just rides on too thin ice. Besides Freeman Kathy Baker as the hot battered prostitute was a notable standout too where Mimi Rodgers an actress in demand a lot and always delivers was very strong as Reeve's girlfriend. It was a pity Reeve couldn't of carried his weight as well.

This smoky dramatic thriller doesn't exploit the glamorous nature but gets dirty as things spiral out of control and circumstances are manipulated to suit one's own favour. This leads to some dangerous consequences for both sides. The interplay between Freeman and Reeves' characters are always gripping and at times quite intense and spontaneous. The rigid narrative does have some questionable details but remains digestible and cleverly explosive up until its sudden ending of street justice that the courts couldn't supply.

	schema:headline " one of the best 80's films";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of 80's movies glorified the American Dream of becoming a millionaire. It was the age of Reagan and greed was good. The Secret of My Success is the ultimate cultural artifact of this era  MJ Fox starts out in the mail room cons his way into the upper ranks and gets it all without any serious repercussions. Although it is all played for laughs the movie asks you to root for this guy who is basically unprincipled and greedy.Almost as a rebuke in early 1987 Street Smart arrived. It is the flip side of Secret of My Success. Christopher Reeve plays a journalist who fabricates a story about a pimp and he becomes the toast of the town. But there are very serious consequences to his actions. The dream of attaining success by any means necessary is really a nightmare.I disagree with a lot of posters who say that the ending doesn't work. In fact I think it is brilliant. Reeve's character has attained notoriety by exploiting Fast Black and by extension the whole subculture that keeps Fast Black in business. In the end Reeve manipulates events so that Fast Black gets killed and one of Fast Black's minions gets busted. Reeve uses all of this carnage as fodder for his Street Smart TV segments. Once again he uses a lie to gain the upper hand  he has gone from print journalism to tabloid TV.Reeve originally entered the world of Fast Black out of desperation to keep his job at a magazine. One lie begets another and another until there is plenty of collateral damage  the prostitute gets killed Reeve's wife gets stabbed Fast Black ends up dead. None of these events would have occurred if Reeve hadn't told that first lie.There is also the parallel between journalism and prostitution. Reeve is just as bad as Fast Black but he covers his tracks better and he has a reputable facade. Reeve's journalistic exploits not only have ruined lives but ended them.If you look at Reeve's character objectively he is not really the good guy.

	onyx:emotionText "A lot of 80's movies glorified the American Dream of becoming a millionaire. It was the age of Reagan and greed was good. The Secret of My Success is the ultimate cultural artifact of this era  MJ Fox starts out in the mail room cons his way into the upper ranks and gets it all without any serious repercussions. Although it is all played for laughs the movie asks you to root for this guy who is basically unprincipled and greedy.Almost as a rebuke in early 1987 Street Smart arrived. It is the flip side of Secret of My Success. Christopher Reeve plays a journalist who fabricates a story about a pimp and he becomes the toast of the town. But there are very serious consequences to his actions. The dream of attaining success by any means necessary is really a nightmare.I disagree with a lot of posters who say that the ending doesn't work. In fact I think it is brilliant. Reeve's character has attained notoriety by exploiting Fast Black and by extension the whole subculture that keeps Fast Black in business. In the end Reeve manipulates events so that Fast Black gets killed and one of Fast Black's minions gets busted. Reeve uses all of this carnage as fodder for his Street Smart TV segments. Once again he uses a lie to gain the upper hand  he has gone from print journalism to tabloid TV.Reeve originally entered the world of Fast Black out of desperation to keep his job at a magazine. One lie begets another and another until there is plenty of collateral damage  the prostitute gets killed Reeve's wife gets stabbed Fast Black ends up dead. None of these events would have occurred if Reeve hadn't told that first lie.There is also the parallel between journalism and prostitution. Reeve is just as bad as Fast Black but he covers his tracks better and he has a reputable facade. Reeve's journalistic exploits not only have ruined lives but ended them.If you look at Reeve's character objectively he is not really the good guy. He has broken the law and not only gotten away with it but he's profited from it as well. Rather than a prison term he gets promoted.Reeve's image as a nice guy makes the character even creepier  after all he sleeps with a prostitute and exposes his wife to danger at a predominantly black bar. Reeve's character seems like a cleancut yuppie but deep down he is corrupt and devoid of morals.";

Fast Black is one juicy character and Morgan brings life into it. Christopher Reeve god bless his sole is a pretty bad actor. I only seen him in his Superman roles which I wasn't much a fan of. But here his character gets a lot of screen time and Reeve just can't live up to it. He makes the movie boring. Kathy Baker excels in her role. Mimi Rogers does her part well. The film has an amazing storyline here but screenplay is 5050. If Morgan had more scenes the movie would have been way better. Yes there are some really strong scenes but all of them involved Freeman. The direction wasn't great if this movie was handled by a better director it would of been memorable. Many people probably don't even know about this movie and that's a shame because Freeman's performance must be watched. Freeman's outburst scene where he puts a bottle up to Reeve's face and gives him a 20 second stare is WOW. And not to forget the scissor scene where he threatens to poke Kathy's eye out...MARVELLOUS. What disappoints me the most regardless of the many flaws in direction is that Freeman didn't have a last scene in the climax. In a movie where Morgan kept everyone in their seats the directorscreenwriter didn't hook him up with a proper climax scene. I was expecting something huge but instead the ending was the same old same old. Overall the movie is OK but Freeman's performance is great.".

The ending of Street Smart was a bit contrived in how the street Smart Reggie fell for Fisher's obvious trick that he could have easily explained to Fast Black. Still that didn't really take that much away from the films hard hitting approach on prostitution and pimping in the big city. The only thing that didn't make any sense is why Fisher was still able to keep his job after being exposed as a complete fraud as a top news reporter on his top rated news show Street Smart.

New York has changed so much and so fast it's really great to see the street scenes I forgot especially when SOHO was still somewhat not overcrowded. And many interior shots of the run down buildings are just great. What they missed was fitting in a few landmarks and the fulton fish market of course.

	schema:reviewBody "Most viewers give their applause to Morgan Freeman for his performance as a Manhattan street pimp named Fast Black. But the main note of interest to me in this film is the performance of Kathy Baker as a sympathetic hooker named Punchy. The story is set entirely in Manhattan and the main character is a magazine writer named Jonathan Christopher Reeve. He unwittingly gets involved in a court case involving Fast Black when he writes a fictional story that everyone assumes to be true.Except for Punchy none of the characters are particularly interesting. They seem twodimensional and rather shallow. The plot's pace by today's standards is somewhat slow. Scenes involve long camera takes and the script is heavy on dialogue. Color cinematography is adequate.With its grimy dirty urban setting its tawdry characters and its slow pace Street Smart reminds me a little of The Panic In Needle Park 1971 not really surprising since both films were directed by the same man Jerry Schatzberg.To its credit the story in Street Smart does address a legal issue faced by contemporary writers. How does a writer convince a court that the writer's notes about an article don't exist when in fact they don't? I guess the writer needs to be aware of all contingencies especially a highprofile writer like Jonathan who invents characters and stories and then tries to pass them off as nonfiction.While this film may be entertaining andor informative to some viewers it just doesn't work for me aside from the performance of Kathy Baker mostly because I just couldn't get interested in the film's characters or their tawdry drama.".

Morgan Freeman about the most respected and sophisticated polite afroAmerican actor you can think off in the role of a stereotypical mean and foul mouthed street pimp. Oh well we all have to start our careers somewhere and at some point the same goes for Morgan Freeman. This sounds like it's being worth the admission price alone but of course there is more to this movie which unfortunately just isn't must good or interesting.This movie was quite a ridicules and silly one. This is obviously due to its story that is severely lacking. There isn't a real point or conflict in this movie and it's just some reporter played by a mobile Christopher Reeve hanging out with a pimp on the streets until the last half hour or so when the filmmakers suddenly seemed to realize that they started out originally with an idea and story that needed to get resolved by the end. But this story is really quite thin and doesn't work out that well because it's hanging together from its coincidences and is just far from ever a likely one.It also is being a real formulaic movie. About every clich you can think off that a movie featuring a pimp can have in it gets featured in this movie. It just doesn't matter that the pimp gets played by Morgan Freeman. When you have a bad story you have a bad story and when you have a bad story you have a bad movie or in the very least a very uninteresting and pointless one to watch.Yes the movie is still for most part quite watchable and it does definitely has some good moments in it but then again it also does have some very silly and bad moments in it that often center around it's unlikely main plot line.

	schema:reviewBody "Diary of a Hitman is something more than the average entry into the neonoir genre of many such films produced in the 80s90s. They usually hold a similar trashy appeal more style than substance and not too much in the way of quality performances. Forest Whitaker helps to make this an exception from the mold. Here playing a variant of his later role in Ghost Dog he lets you into the mind of a conflicted controlling somewhat neurotic hitman.This film was adapted from a play by Kenneth Pressman and the middle act pays testament to that. A series of scenes in a small apartment capture a real depth of emotion both from Whitaker and his target played by Sherilyn Fenn. It seems almost claustrophobic but there's a power to it. Roy London doesn't show a lot of experience in his direction but he does express a good deal of humanity. This is a grounded film personal. There's no cheap exploitation feel nor is there any sense of big budget Hollywood.The acting is the real reason to watch Diary of a Hitman. Even the small roles have something to offer. I particularly liked the two doctors one a psychiatrist John Bedford Lloyd the other an optometrist Ken Lerner. James Belushi and Sharon Stone show up briefly but aren't given a whole lot to do. This isn't an overly complicated or particularly farreaching film but the narration lets you under its skin and there's no terrible overacting or delusions of grandeur. The title might seem cheap but Diary of a Hitman has a lot more to offer.".

	onyx:emotionText "Diary of a Hitman is something more than the average entry into the neonoir genre of many such films produced in the 80s90s. They usually hold a similar trashy appeal more style than substance and not too much in the way of quality performances. Forest Whitaker helps to make this an exception from the mold. Here playing a variant of his later role in Ghost Dog he lets you into the mind of a conflicted controlling somewhat neurotic hitman.This film was adapted from a play by Kenneth Pressman and the middle act pays testament to that. A series of scenes in a small apartment capture a real depth of emotion both from Whitaker and his target played by Sherilyn Fenn. It seems almost claustrophobic but there's a power to it. Roy London doesn't show a lot of experience in his direction but he does express a good deal of humanity. This is a grounded film personal. There's no cheap exploitation feel nor is there any sense of big budget Hollywood.The acting is the real reason to watch Diary of a Hitman. Even the small roles have something to offer. I particularly liked the two doctors one a psychiatrist John Bedford Lloyd the other an optometrist Ken Lerner. James Belushi and Sharon Stone show up briefly but aren't given a whole lot to do.

	schema:reviewBody "I have trouble believing this movie has so many good user reviews here because for me it was rather poor. I understand that it's from a play Insider's Price and its origins show. I usually like Forest Whitaker the hitman but I think he was badly directed here. He overacts a lot and his narration was atrocious as in exaggerated and almost ludicrous. It wasn't even a real diary it was a phone conversation and as such it worked even less. I get our hitman isn't the sharpest tool in the block but the writing seemed weak with some lousy lines. The target Sherilyn Fenn's although looking fine was arguably worse actingwise because her reactions often weren't believable or seemed emotionally fake. You see James Belushi and Sharon Stone in the credits but they only have 5minute cameos. Belushi's part could have easily been cut. Sharon Stone's was a bit more interesting but any actress could have done it.The main part of the film was a confrontation between the hitman and the target in her apartment. From the way it was shot the confined space and the acting it really felt theatrical there but not in a good way. I suppose some scenes would have elicited laughter in front of a audience such as the pulling back and forth of the curtains or the cake scene but here they seemed out of place. I was more often puzzled by reactions than gripped by tension as to her fate and that of the baby. Also very little action here it was all very talkative. This film seemed very forgettable fare to me.Rating 3 out of 10 poor".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this miniseries while in 5th grade history class as part of our studies on the Civil War and I thought it was excellent.  Many years later I watched it again after finding a copy of the unabridged version all 6 hours of it!.  I wasn't sure how it would stand the test of time both as a 16 year old production and my own view of it being 16 years older now and braced myself for disappointment however I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie is as well done as I remembered it.It's an engrossing movie that gives an honest frank look at the inherent moral ambiguity of war as well as the additional consequences of the Civil War where brother fought brother.  Although the movie certainly takes dramatic license the main character a young Southerner who relocates to the north after becoming disillusioned with the cruel treatment of slaves ends up stumbling across his staunchly proConfederate siblings as if they're all wandering around in the same town instead of an entire country! you can see that the film makers took great pains to portray as many perspectives as possible to show that each and every person involved in the war was human with their own thoughts and feelings.  I'm certainly no Civil War expert but I thought it was a very balanced portrait.  What's more amazing is that the mini rarely drags despite sometimes taking a leisurely pace during its 6 hour runtime.  Although we all know how the movie with ultimately end it keeps you interested in the lives of all the characters it introduces.  I thought Stacy Keach did a particularly good job despite a few hammy lines.  This miniseries should definitely be on any mustsee list of war films.".

It is related from the point of view of a 'neutral' war correspondent who's talent is for drawing sketches of what he has seen on various battle fields from Bull Run to Appomattox Ct. House. There is considerable 'time jumping' from one period of the war to another which inhibits continuity to some extent. For me the best part of the miniseries was watching Gregory Peck as Abraham Lincoln deliver the Gettysburg address. However we are thrown into that scene without adequate preamble so even this is diminished from what it could have been.I am quite an avid amateur Civil War historian having read many books and watched many TV series including the excellent PBS series by Ken Burns and the complete 3 volume set of books on the Civil War by historian Shelby Foote on the subject. If you are looking for historical accuracy you will be disappointed. If you on the other hand are simply looking for a decent dramatization ala Gone With the Wind you will enjoy this series.The acting by the cast was in general C with the exception of a few of the notables Gregory Peck for one. As my summary states this is a dramatic romp so if you keep that in mind and set your sites correspondingly on the low side you will not be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Brother Against Brother";
	schema:reviewBody "Back in the early Sixties there was a short lived television series called The Americans about two brothers who after their father was killed decided to fight on opposite sides in the Civil War. The whole business about brother against brother was no exaggeration. Right up to the very top with Mary Todd Lincoln having relatives who fought for the Confederacy families were torn apart. The Blue And The Gray brings that aspect of the Civil War better than any other film made for the big or small screen since The Americans.The families are the Geysers and the Hales related by the mothers Diane Baker and Colleen Dewhurst being sisters. The Hales are from Gettysburg Pennsylvania and the Geysers from what would now be West Virginia in and around Harper's Ferry and that's not even 100 miles distance. But the families are true to the sectional divide. With the exception of John Geyser played by John Hammond who has made a black friend a free man played by Paul Winfield who gets lynched for helping runaway slaves. He won't fight for a section that espouses slavery as a cause but won't enlist in the Northern Armies either. A passing acquaintance played by Stacy Keach who gets himself involved in a lot of the major events of the war and married into the Hale family with Julia Duffy persuades Hammond to become a war correspondent and put his artistic talents to good use. Hammond becomes a pictorial chronicler of the seminal event of his generation.Without ever losing control of the main story lines what happens to the various Geyser and Hale family members The Blue And The Gray captures the sweep and pageantry of the Civil War. Such real characters as Abraham Lincoln played by Gregory Peck and John Brown played by Sterling Hayden in what was his farewell performance do take a life of their own. With Peck we see a public and a private Lincoln which is true to the Lincoln mythology and yet quite a human character.If I had to single out one performance that was especially touching it would be that of David W. Harper as one of the Hale brothers. The young man was eager to be the first to enlist in his town of Gettysburg but he never made it to the battle that town became famous for. A not well covered portion of the war was the lack of sanitary facilities in army camps. Young Harper falls victim to dysentery and his performance will move you.A few years later North and South covered a lot of the same ground that this particular miniseries did and it was as well done as The Blue And The Gray. I would recommend them both highly especially for young audiences to gain a real understanding of what the Civil War meant to the average individual".

The human drama both on the home front before the war and during the various battles is portrayed very realistically as are the graphic battle scenes.The cast assembled does a wonderful job with characters that come alive. GREGORY PECK does well as Abraham Lincoln although his makeup is a bit disconcerting and he was a bit too mature to play the role in the first place. But STACY KEACH and JOHN HAMMOND carry much of the film as the two leading characters who witness various aspects of the Civil War seen through their eyes and experiences and they are excellent.The supporting cast includes vivid performances from LLOYD BRIDGES COLLEEN DEWHURST RORY CALHOUN GERALDINE PAGE RIP TORN STERLING HAYDEN DIANE BAKER. BRIAN KERWIN is excellent as the Hale brother facing battle for the first time and the sequence with the balloon to observe the enemy from the air is full of tight suspense.It may not be a perfect history lesson but it is photographed beautifully in color all of it filmed in Arkansas has a fine musical score and is well worth the time it takes to unwind a very compelling story with characters any viewer can relate to.I consider it one of the finest madeforTV miniseries ever made.".

I only wish that the Blue and the Grey could have been more realistic like Gettysburg. The uniforms used in this film are just too generic and too Hollywood unlike Gettysburg where the uniforms look authentic. I also dislike the over dubbing of the rifles and cannon that was so common until the last 15 years or so that seems so fake in comparison to Gettysburg. The battle scenes have a lot of action but there just seems to be too few people fighting the battle. Gettysburg on the other hand had plenty of extras almost all of them Civil War reenactors making the battle scenes more realistic. Perhaps if the producers of The Blue and the Grey had used reenactors they could have had better battle scenes and the mini series would have been more realistic.".

Yes I agree with many of the decent critics about this film. That was the 1982 and yes if you compare The Blues  The Gray with mighty grandeur of Glory Gettysburg or Gods  Generals you will have to admit that the serial suffers all the typical problems. True the lack of budget is obvious and it is obvious that there had to be more soldiers on both sides in all shown battle scenes same may be said about scenes depicting camps or cities. True some lines of actors are hammy and some actors simply played not well enough. Yes sometimes you pay attention to obvious goofs and anachronisms concerning rifles uniforms or other minutiae. But still good impressions remain. Stacey Keach great late Gregory Peck John Hammomd Cooper Huckabee and many many others did a very decent job. The serial captivates and holds you all 7 hours. The love line is of great success and some mild humor in scenes with John and Kathy make it more valuable. Both sides of the war are shown with certain warmth and sympathy there are heroes cowards villains traitors real giants on both sides. My personal grade goes to Gregory Peck as Lincoln Lloyd Bridges Cooper Huckabee Sterling Hayden excellent part of the film! Rip Torn Royce Applegate who will shine soon in Gettysburg and Julius Harris. To my mind there are several powerful scened in the serial but one which is Truly outstanding and mighty is the conversation between John Geyser and a group of black runaways. This scene is a huge success and a moving tribute to those who fought for Liberation. I highly recommend this film".

	schema:headline " Quality madeforTV overview of the Civil War";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1982 and directed by Andrew V. McLaglen The Blue and the Gray covers the Civil War era from 18591865 focusing on two related families The Geysers farmers from Charlottesville Virginia and the Hales from Gettysburg Pennsylvania who own a newspaper. John Geyser John Hammond leaves Virginia to get a job as a sketch artist at the Hale's newspaper in Gettysburg. When war breaks out after the Southern states secede from the Union John covers the war for Harper's Weekly.MAIN CAST includes Stacy Keach as a PinkertonturnedUnionofficer who romances John's cousin Julia Duffy Gregory Peck as Lincoln Kathleen Beller as an aristocratturnednurse Dan Shor  Michael Horton as John's brother Rip Torn as General Grant and Lloyd Bridges  Colleen Dewhurst as Mr. and Mrs. Geyser. These are just the principle characters there are scores of others Robert Vaughn Geraldine Page Warren Oates Robert Symonds etc..I prefer The Blue and the Gray to the similar North and South Books I  II 198586 because it's more streamlined and less soap operay. Director McLaglen had decades of experience by this this time with both TV shows and films including a few notable Westerns like Bandolero! 1968 and Chisum 1970 in fact his Shenandoah 1965 was a Civil War 'Western.' The first half is great but the second half flounders a bit and includes some cheesy plot gimmicks like the mad slasher Confederate officer and John mistaking his babe the nurse supposedly making out with the Union stud Keach. The 'floundering' includes some abrupt shifts like from the Battle of Vicksburg July 1863 to the Battle of the Wilderness May 1864 which can likely be explained by cuts from the original miniseries. If you watch the longer version you probably won't encounter this problem. What I like best about this miniseries i.e. long movie is that despite some elements of TVproduction cheese e.g. the two Union  Confederate deserters' almost goofy meeting in the woods the film takes you back in time to the Civil War era and provides a quality picture of what it was like.Some of the notable events covered include The Battle of Bull Run Army camp life dysentery in the camps cowards in battle and the branding thereof balloon reconnaissance fraternizing with the enemy after hours brother vs. brother the Gettysburg Address the siege of Vicksburg and the desperation thereof e.g. the Caves prisonerofwar camps Elmira Lee's surrender and Lincoln's death. Yes some key events are offscreen e.g. the Battle of Gettysburg and Lincoln getting shot but that's the nature of the beast with a TVbudget and an overviewstyled story. Lastly Keach shines as one of the main protagonists easily one of his best rolls and Duffy is a delight.The film runs 296 minutes 4 minutes shy of 5 hours with the original 3part miniseries running 381 minutes. It was shot entirely in Arkansas Fort Smith Eureka Springs Fayetteville Van Buren  Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park. The script was written by John Leekley  Ian McLellan Hunter based on Bruce Catton's material.GRADE B".

What's really a shame is that there is some very good talent in the mini series that is completely wasted. Even the scene when the Gettysburg Address is given is vastly overblown and forced. That scene is indicative of the series taken as a whole. Instead of being understated as the original speech was it and the series take on the tone of Edward Everett the speaker who was just before Lincoln. Edward Everett's saving grace is that his speech was only some 2 12 hours long. The miniseries is 7 12 hours in length though it seems much much longer. Lincoln's famous 300 words than didn't even take 3 minutes to recite.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Blue  the Gray is truly a portrait of an age. Unfortunately that portrait is not the American Civil War of the 1860s but the Miniseries boom of the 1980s. Starting in the late 1970s  with David L. Wolper's that guy was everywhere Roots based on Alex Haley's book. He actually followed it up about two years later with Roots The Next Generation. Not too many people remember that latter one. In their day they sparked a huge national discussion and garnered impressive ratings.  Having recently seen them again I can say that they don't really stand the test of time. Most of the Miniseries' of the those days don't I'm sorry to say. The Thorn Birds Marco Polo Centennial  The Winds of War and the biggest budgeted one of them all Shogun. They really were not very good and The Blue  the Gray is no exception. It had all the formulaic makings of an 80's mini romance intrigue comical capers battles etc. The story is truly awful and claimed at the time to be based on the writings of Historian Bruce Catton. This was meant to lend an air of dignity to what was otherwise junk. I wouldn't even call it loosley based.The budget for tBtG was obviously not very much. I can't even say they did allot with a little. They did a little with a little is more like it. Try as they did to bring their sweeping story to the screen they ended up giving the impression that the civil war was fought by 50 men 25 per side. I will concede that this was an era that preceded a special effects explosion and today a screen can be populated by thousands of digitally animated clones. Not so in 1982. The horrors of war are not exactly horrible in tBtG save for the occasional trickle of blood on the forehead of an extra. Speaking of extras tBtG is interesting in that it was one of the last productions to make use of extras wearing classic Hollywood Civil War costumes I can't rightly call them uniforms. There was some fanfare at the time that the production had made limited use of Civil War Reenactors. These guys are all over movies today but in 1982 they and their hobby were oddities. Ironically because the production made limited use of reenactors they were able to focus on relatively young and trim extras. Funny how the guys with the right age and build ended up wearing the cheesey costumes and the fat old guys wore the authentic stuff!!! tBtG also featured the classic remote controlled fibre glass cannons of the John Wayne era and very uncivil war breechloading rifles. I say all this because authenticity standards were soon to go through a massive overhaul. Even a couple of years later with the equally awful North   South Mini things were changing. By 1989 7 years laterone could see that Glory was such a far cry from all previous Civil War movies. So as a curious example of 'Hollywood in transition' tBtG is an interesting and anomalisitc piece of work. I should mention that in most cases the acting is quite bad. Did that John Hammond guy ever work again??? Stacy Keach's 19th century James Bond act was annoying . I really hate the fact that he and his little war correspondent buddy seem to be present at every historical and pivotal moment of the war regardless of the fact that some of these incidents occurd hundereds or thousands of miles apart jet powered horses I suppose. The affected southern accents by all those supporting actors are truly laughable. The cast featured some great actors doing mediocre workSterling Heyden Coleen Dewhurst Geraldine Page Rip Torn and Gregory Peck. Gregory Peck as Lincoln was the only bright spot in the cast. A PBS series on Lincoln staring Peck would have been great!!! It's a shame such a good performance was wasted on such a stupid story.".

	schema:reviewBody "America's existence as a beacon for freedom and democracy around the world has often seemed to be and frequently is in reality a work in progress. Nowhere is that better illustrated in the event that is oftentimes known as the War Between The States North and South but generally known as the Civil War. A bitter war fought largely over the question of whether it was right to keep anyone especially those of African descent as slaves the war almost eviscerated the country during four long bloody year from 1861 to 1865. It was only when the 13th Amendment and the Emancipation Proclamation became law that the war ended as too did slavery and the long march toward full civil rights had really begun. This was the subject for the epic 3part miniseries THE BLUE AND THE GRAY which aired on CBS on November 14 16 and 17 1982.The principal focus is on two families the Geysers a farm family from Charlottesville Virginia who have no prurient interest in the issue of slavery that is essentially fueling the war but are sympathetic to the South and the Hales who are owners of a small newspaper in Gettysburg Pennsylvania and antislaveryproUnion. They become a microcosm of this long costly bloody war that nearly destroyed America before it could even reach its 90th year of existence as a country and even in the Geyser family there is a schism. Both families though do reunite after the end of the war but not before the war more or less claims its last victim in President Abraham Lincoln when John Wilkes Booth guns him down at Ford's Theatre.In the meantime the Civil War is reenacted under the bounds of what could be shown on television with a fair amount of pain and horror without an overreliance of melodrama but with solid acting by a huge cast of great people including Stacy Keach Colleen Dewhurst Lloyd Bridges Warren Oates in one of his last roles as Major Welles Sterling Hayden as John Brown Rip Torn as General Ulysses S. Grant Robert Vaughn Paul Winfield Julius Harris Diane Baker Rory Calhoun and last but not least Gregory Peck in his firstever dramatic TV appearance as Lincoln. All of this is brilliantly bought together by veteran director Andrew V. McLaglen who had done the Civil War in fictional form prior to this in the form of 1969's THE UNDEFEATED with John Wayne and 1965's SHENANDOAH with James Stewart.Even in the restrictive confines of TV and even when compared to later films on the subject like GETTYSBURG and LINCOLN THE BLUE AND THE GRAY does very little skimping over what war in general and this singular war in particular does to people not only on both sides of the battle lines but also to those innocents caught in the middle. And despite its extreme length of close to six and a half hours this is still one of the best miniseries ever produced in TV history. It should be watched by anyone serious in understanding our nation's history in general and the Civil War in particular and is essential just for anyone still interested in historically based storytelling small screen or otherwise.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Blue and The Gray was a TV miniseries that premiered on CBS in late 1982.Allegedly inspired by the works of famed Civil War historian Bruce Catton The Blue and The Gray follows the fates of two related families the Geysers of Virginia and the Hales of Pennsylvania during the American Civil War. The story starts in the aftermath of John Brown's Sterling Hayden failed slave uprising and ends with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln Gregory Peck. In between we see various members of the Geyser and Hale families experience army life battles death privation and prisonerofwar camps.The main focus is on the third of four Geyser brothers John John Hammond a budding artist who finds a career as a combat illustrator for a northern paper. Despite his three brothers eagerly joining the Confederate Army John views himself as a neutral observer and refuses to join the fight leading to considerable friction with his family. As a neutral observer John acts as a sort of Zelig for the rest of the series romancing a senator's daughter witnessing the battles of Bull Run Vicksburg and the Wilderness and hobnobbing with the political elites such as President Lincoln due to his being the cousininlaw of one of Lincoln's military aides Stacy Keach.The Blue and the Gray was unfortunately directed by Andrew V. McLaglen who owed his career to nepotism rather than any talent. He's the son of Oscar wining actor Victor McLaglen. McLaglen's paintbythenumbers style does little to help this miniseries. The best thing one can say about McLaglen is that he was competent but he was more of a plodding mediocrity whose career ended when his father's connections and friends diedoff or retired John Ford John Wayne Jimmy Stewart Lee Marvin...McLaglen also wasn't helped by the awful casting of John Hammond as John Geyser. Mr. Hammond was not much of an actor and that is very evident by his performance here. It also didn't help that he was simply overwhelmed by the very talented supporting actors that surrounded him. He's bad by himself but he's just plain awful when seen next to Hayden Peck Bridges Keach Colleen Dewhurst and Geraldine Page. Hammond is on better ground when he's sharing screen time with his character's romantic interest Kathy Reynolds Kathleen Beller because she was just as untalented as he was. It's no surprise that both Hammond's and Beller's careers fizzledout by the early 90's. They were both good looking but neither had any business being given large roles in this miniseries.People interested in Civil War combat should avoid The Blue and The Gray. The uniforms and military equipment appeared to have been recycled from McLaglen's soapy 1965 Civil War melodrama Shenandoah which had its Rebs and Yanks deckedout in uniforms that look like a 1960's Halloween costuming company's idea of Civil War uniforms. Plus the combat scenes look like something out of the 1960's WWII TV show Combat lots of indirect artillery fire goingoff and the sarge leading his squad. The people behind this miniseries had little or no interest in trying to recreate any resemblance to actual Civil War combat.Overall The Blue and the Gray has some interesting story lines and nice acting by some of the supporting actors but it is done in by pedestrian direction atrocious acting by its two leads and a failure to adhere to any sort of historical reality when it comes to its battle scenes.".

As a neutral observer John acts as a sort of Zelig for the rest of the series romancing a senator's daughter witnessing the battles of Bull Run Vicksburg and the Wilderness and hobnobbing with the political elites such as President Lincoln due to his being the cousininlaw of one of Lincoln's military aides Stacy Keach.The Blue and the Gray was unfortunately directed by Andrew V. McLaglen who owed his career to nepotism rather than any talent. He's the son of Oscar wining actor Victor McLaglen. McLaglen's paintbythenumbers style does little to help this miniseries. The best thing one can say about McLaglen is that he was competent but he was more of a plodding mediocrity whose career ended when his father's connections and friends diedoff or retired John Ford John Wayne Jimmy Stewart Lee Marvin...McLaglen also wasn't helped by the awful casting of John Hammond as John Geyser. Mr. Hammond was not much of an actor and that is very evident by his performance here. It also didn't help that he was simply overwhelmed by the very talented supporting actors that surrounded him. He's bad by himself but he's just plain awful when seen next to Hayden Peck Bridges Keach Colleen Dewhurst and Geraldine Page. Hammond is on better ground when he's sharing screen time with his character's romantic interest Kathy Reynolds Kathleen Beller because she was just as untalented as he was. It's no surprise that both Hammond's and Beller's careers fizzledout by the early 90's. They were both good looking but neither had any business being given large roles in this miniseries.People interested in Civil War combat should avoid The Blue and The Gray. The uniforms and military equipment appeared to have been recycled from McLaglen's soapy 1965 Civil War melodrama Shenandoah which had its Rebs and Yanks deckedout in uniforms that look like a 1960's Halloween costuming company's idea of Civil War uniforms. Plus the combat scenes look like something out of the 1960's WWII TV show Combat lots of indirect artillery fire goingoff and the sarge leading his squad. The people behind this miniseries had little or no interest in trying to recreate any resemblance to actual Civil War combat.Overall The Blue and the Gray has some interesting story lines and nice acting by some of the supporting actors but it is done in by pedestrian direction atrocious acting by its two leads and a failure to adhere to any sort of historical reality when it comes to its battle scenes.";

I tried it on a hangover while shut in on a gloomy Saturday with the missus out of town and it was the ideal choice  Brainless adventure with an intelligent dog the high rockies a Jack London family friendly storyline and the now late Jack Palance chewing the scenery albeit gently since this is a PG rated affair as a local bigwig corrupt crime boss kingpin who nonetheless knows talent when he sees it.That talent is of course the real star of the movie Buck the Wonder Shepard. This is one of a string of SchnitzelSpaghetti Westerns inspired by Call of the Wild aimed right at 8  12 year old boys If anyone else gets anything out of it that's just fine but entertaining jaded adult audiences wasn't the idea. The idea of a Jack London derived adventure yarn is to have a plucky young tyke befriend and bond with a supposedly ferocious wolf doggie who then saves the day for the rest of the movie just like Clint Eastwood would in a Sergio Leone film. He comes running in at the last minute leaping onto the bar and bearing down snarling on the bad guys. Film buffs with an eye for the absurd will be overjoyed.Animal rights activists may not The film has some now questionable scenes of dog vs dog action that are rather fierce and as an actor dogs are hardly concerned about script issues or character motivations. They are dogs and must be manipulated by an offcamera handler to do things on screen that are edited in a way to make them appear to be heroic intentional actions by the dog. One cringe inducing scene has Buck win a wager for his dogooder owners by leaping off a second story balcony don't worry they faked it and watching it all I could think of was what the HELL were these people thinking? The film also features the traditional Jack London adventure character types The bearded plaid wool wearing father played by Spaghetti Western regular Attilio Dottesio the cleancut handsome hero Fred Romer the plucky kid his somewhat jailbaitish teenaged sister pretty Elisabetta Virgili the worldly saloon harlot with a heart of gold Joan Collins looking even more out of place than she did on Star Trek the corrupt town boss Mr. Palance probably drunk he looks like he didn't give a damn the friendly rotund bearded innkeeper veteran character actor Ricardo Palacios and various legions of local Injuns prospectors hunters card sharks and lots  lots of anonymous sled dogs who were doubtlessly envious of Buck's more prominent role. Genre film buffs can look for the familiar faces of Jos Canalejas Remo De Angelis and Manuel de Blas and enjoy another Stelvio Cipriani musical score that transcends the material There is actually some respectable talent on display here.But I mean come on it's not a blockbuster event film these were made cheaply and quickly to be watched on rainy Saturday afternoons decades ago by young chaps with nothing better to do  If the leads find romance in each other's arms that's fine but what's more important is that Buck gets to do lots of cool stuff have some neat adventures and in the end run off into the woods until the next installment. If you can live with that and love Spaghetti Cinema as much as I do this is a fine film that you can even watch with the whole family though the dog might get a bit jealous watching Buck have all the fun.610 I'm feeling generous And thanks for all the great films Mr. Palance You may not remember them very fondly but they made a difference and at least this movie was better than CITY SLICKERS 2.

The Great Adventure does have enough to make it watchable.The scenery and sets are absolutely beautiful the scenery in the first thirty minutes is enough to take one's breath away and the film is attractively if simply photographed the costumes are good too. Also very good was the music with a stirring score that synchronises with and enhances what's happening on screen and is the most exciting The Great Adventure ever getsagain the first thirty minutes especially. The nostalgic title song Song of the Wild beautifully sung by Joseph Allegro is one so good that it stands as a great song on its own without being part of a film. A few performances are decent too the best two being Jack Palance and the dog Buck. Palance is methodically intimidating without being overthetop or phoningin while Buck is adorable and performs spiritedly. Joan Collins is a touch out of place but plays her tramp with a heart of gold role very charmingly.However the rest of the acting did seem unenthusiastic and goingthroughthemotionslike and disadvantaged further by some very obvious sloppily synced and odd dubbingPalance and Collins excepted. The Great Adventure is very staidly directed to the point it becomes plodding while the writing is what really sinks the film. The script ranges between dreary and cornball and never gets better than that while the very rambling and also rather predictable story is a little pedestrian in pace and has too many disconnected scenes that lead to very little if there was any tension or emotional connection intended neither of them registered well to me. The dog attacks do lack tension and excitement and the choreography can be silly and awkward while none of the characters engage. Instead they are colourless cardboard clichs despite Palance giving the film's best performance he is also saddled with the most clichd character the kind that has been done so many times on film and more interestingly written.Overall The Great Adventure is a long way from unwatchable it looks good has great music and has a few decent performances but it is let down by the odd dubbing dreary script plodding direction and dull story. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Set during the American Gold Rush era  this is an unforgettable tale of two orphaned children called Jim Chambers Fernando Romero and Mary Chambers Elizabeth Virgil . When en route to the Yukon being killed their father by Indians  they then become involved into multiple adventures and dangers . Luck changes when the kiddies meet two prospectors  John McKenzie Manuel De Blas  and Hank McKenzie Remo De Angelis  stunt coordinator too headed for the Yukn and who help them go to Dawson City  next to river Yukn . Meanwhile  Jim meets a wild dog  that is part wolf and they must battle against the Yukon wilderness and human greed to help save a frontier town . As they stood together and changed the destiny of an Entire Frontier . But in Dawson City they meet an arrogant  wealthy owner  William Bates Jack Palance  and the beautiful saloon girl Sonia Kendall Joan Collins who falls in love for John McKenzie Manuel De Blas. The prospector John and his faithful mate  the wolfdog attempt to stop the evildoer  an ambitious snarling businessman called Bates who formerly killed his brother .It is a tepid and lighthearted adventure  freely based about known and classic novel by Jack London The Call of the Wild . Lumpy blend of adventures action  villainy  though needlessly violent and aimed to young people . The film is loosely based on the novel by Jack London  though differs significantly from the book but this is an invented version  however remains the essential elements as the youngdog friendship  the gold rush  spectacular outdoors and locations and several moving scenes . The talent of diverse and wasting casting is redeemed in part for the spectacular outdoors filmed on Spanish landscapes . It's a passableaverage rendition that maintains the charm and adventure style of the previous films but still makes for decent juvenile amusement . Weak screenplay from Juan Logar  Fonseca and Jess Rodrguez .

	onyx:emotionText "Set during the American Gold Rush era  this is an unforgettable tale of two orphaned children called Jim Chambers Fernando Romero and Mary Chambers Elizabeth Virgil . When en route to the Yukon being killed their father by Indians  they then become involved into multiple adventures and dangers . Luck changes when the kiddies meet two prospectors  John McKenzie Manuel De Blas  and Hank McKenzie Remo De Angelis  stunt coordinator too headed for the Yukn and who help them go to Dawson City  next to river Yukn . Meanwhile  Jim meets a wild dog  that is part wolf and they must battle against the Yukon wilderness and human greed to help save a frontier town . As they stood together and changed the destiny of an Entire Frontier . But in Dawson City they meet an arrogant  wealthy owner  William Bates Jack Palance  and the beautiful saloon girl Sonia Kendall Joan Collins who falls in love for John McKenzie Manuel De Blas. The prospector John and his faithful mate  the wolfdog attempt to stop the evildoer  an ambitious snarling businessman called Bates who formerly killed his brother .It is a tepid and lighthearted adventure  freely based about known and classic novel by Jack London The Call of the Wild . Lumpy blend of adventures action  villainy  though needlessly violent and aimed to young people . The film is loosely based on the novel by Jack London  though differs significantly from the book but this is an invented version  however remains the essential elements as the youngdog friendship  the gold rush  spectacular outdoors and locations and several moving scenes . The talent of diverse and wasting casting is redeemed in part for the spectacular outdoors filmed on Spanish landscapes . It's a passableaverage rendition that maintains the charm and adventure style of the previous films but still makes for decent juvenile amusement . Weak screenplay from Juan Logar  Fonseca and Jess Rodrguez .

	schema:reviewBody "The makers of this bilge should be ashamed. I'll wager Jack Palance's face still turns red when this turkey is brought up in his presence. I would say the same of Joan Collins but this movie could well be the high point of her pathetic career. The budget couldn't have gone much over a few grand and most of that was very likely spent on dog food. Come to think of it dog chow is all any of the cast and crew deserved. The film was constructed entirely of jerky disconnected scenes chock full of some of the most cornball juvenile dialogue I've ever had the bad luck of viewing. And the wolf attacks! Why do these adventure shows always have those stupid wolf attacks? At least there were no stupid bear attacks. The story was a familiar one in which an evil scumbag gains control of Dawson City Alaska during the gold rush days. He hires a gang of toughs to strike fear in the gutless townsfolk by stomping or murdering anyone dumb enough to question his authority. Why didn't some enterprising soul with a good rifle simply pop the ornery tinhorn's chops from a dark alley one night? The sorry creep has a good setup going until a handsome stranger who fell in love with the bad guy's tramp with a heart of gold saloon girl in about 4 seconds flat and a couple of kids with a wild German Shepherd whose bark was strangely like that of a Pomeranian came to town and upset his apple cart. This bomb opens up whole vistas of opportunity to give new meaning to the term not worth a tinker's damn. Ten year olds may like this junk but I have to wonder about even that.".

Luckily for the kids two kind hearted gold prospectors turn up and everyone heads to Dawson city to avoid the Indians one of which Buck kills proving that he's not to be messed with. Unluckily for these prospectors Jack Palance is the crooked businessman who is in charge of the town and one dodgy card game later the older of the two brothers gets the life jabbed out of him.On the good side of Dawson city we have the other brother John who also gets the green light from singer Joan Collins her singing is the scariest thing about this film Irish Barman Charlie the two kids who start up a newspaper and some lawyer guy the film forgets about. On the bad side is ugly bastard Jack Palance and his never ending parade of hired killers. I have realised from this film that Joan Collins in young form at least resembles my wife as does Barbara Steele.

There's the kid who bonds with White Fang I mean Buck who hilariously ditches the kid at the end! the crooked businessman who tries to destroy all the good guys and the macho hero who doesn't really do much at all until the end.".

Young Jim Chambers Fernando Romer meets cute with Buck the Wonder Wolf who saves his life when a pack of less friendly wolves attack the lad somewhere in the snowy wastelands of the Yukon. Jim's father Attilio Dottesio wants to put the wounded creature down but young Jim makes with the mopey face and Dad relents. Soon Dad is dead and Jim and Buck are off on a cross country trek with sister Mary Elisabetta Virgili and assorted grownups. Joan Collins and Jack Palance show up in the third reel both thankfully undubbed and the film features the motliest imaginable tribe of Native Americans as villainous 'red devils'. Good photography by Jose Aguayo and an excellent Stelvio Cipriani score move The Great Adventure from 'unwatchable' into 'harmless and mildly diverting' territory.".

So it was maybe in 1987. The game was incredible funny to play as the goal was similar to the movie amass as much money as you can as a bad cop! To do that you used a sort of Google map limited the Paris district called the golden triangle. There you met crooks that you had to make talk by choosing lines of dialogs. Maybe the graphics were static but the gameplay was really stunning!Next it's Paris in the eighties and this city in that period is really like a magnet to me since my childhood. But beware the Paris depicted here isn't the city of lights but rather of darkness as this triangle is a highly deprived area with dense immigrated poor population. As you can see in the movie it's looks old and derelict and now in 2013 as urban renovation is inexistent in Paris to give way to gentrification it's even worst!As for the story i think it's a accurate piece of French culture We are really down to earth people happy with a good meal not really motivated at work very lenient with rules at least for the ones that are civil servants like me or those policemen. So France is really this mix between old USSR and a banana republic. The originality of this movie is to expose this truth in a comedy and i admit it's funny Lhermitte is a good choice to play the naive by the book blue cop as much as Noiret is perfect to play the voluble sympathetic veteran. While watching it i was thinking to the American buddy cop movie and how this subject of corrupt cops is a bit leftover to prefer big guns big fights... here our two bad apples are really rotten to the core and we finally like them a paradox !".

Then something went horribly wrong I'm not sure what but as the movie began it's last half it began to remind me of a spoof film I saw once called Night of the Living Bread which is genius by the way...and I'm pretty sure despite what some have said that the movie was NOT meant to be a spoof. The lighting crew must've gone home because you can't see a damn thing for the last 20 minutes except various facial features. The story became very confusing as it couldn't focus on one of two villains...a deformed crazyman living in a tomb or an evil black fungus...hmmm.

The acting is surprisingly good and convincing and all characters are pretty lively. The old neglected house surrounded by graveyard seems to be really spooky. Problems begin during the second half of the film when the film tries to be more brutal and extreme. This part is certainly undeveloped and pretentious as the origin of a black fungus has never been explained. Besides characters behave in a stupid illogical way which really hurts in this pic. As far as technical side of the film is concerned the cinematography and makeup of zombies are good. However terrible CGI effects completely ruin the end of the movie.

The plot is stupid and drowning in clichs the dialogs are awful the acting performances disastrous and the gory moments not even that many mind you look even cheesier than those in zerobudget 80's slashers. And then still the old school embalming sequences look brilliant compared to the downright horrible CGI effect that are used near the end of the film. Add to all this a total lack of tension humor or distracting nudity and we've got ourselves one of the worst horror movies of the year 2005. Mortuary makes no sense from the first second already and it gradually gets worse with every plot twist or new character that is introduced. A young widow drags her two children to a godforsaken village where she hopes to take a fresh start as  the local mortician! Okay here we have a woman who clearly never worked with dead bodies before in her life and living in a slum surrounded by eerie gravestones is supposed to help her kids get over the trauma of losing their father? The mortuary has a dubious history naturally and bizarre fungus grows from every hole in the walls turning a bunch of insufferable teenagers into slavering zombies.

Also having worked with Tobe I know that he always saw himself as a director of comedy but he just fell into the horror genre. This movie should be characterized as a horrorcomedy combo horredy. It's meant to be more entertaining than scary complete with cheesy dialog. If you rewatch the film with this in mind you may have a different opinion of it.".

Also having worked with Tobe I know that he always saw himself as a director of comedy but he just fell into the horror genre. This movie should be characterized as a horrorcomedy combo horredy. It's meant to be more entertaining than scary complete with cheesy dialog. If you rewatch the film with this in mind you may have a different opinion of it.";

The plot line doesn't confuse the viewer it confuses itself. As to previous comments that this was supposed to be a comedy parody of the genre...uh no. Undead is an example of that type of film.

	schema:reviewBody "This was just so much fun not perfect but a lot of fun. People are still expecting Tobe Hooper to direct another Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is too bad because this is a really enjoyable horror movie. It has a lot of great Bmovie atmosphere hot chicks small town punks and some original gore concepts. The idea of a conscious fungus colony is pretty creepy gross and scary! It is definitely a Lovecraftiantheme and some parts of the small town backstory resemble The Colour Out of Space The Dunwich Horror and a littlebit of The Outsider. It also has some similarities with Lucio Fulci's The House By the Cemetery a film I love. I even noticed a few nods to Hooper's Poltergeist and Eaten Alive and 1998's Phantoms. This is really just a very funny and creepy ride. It doesn't have any great statements to make and a lot of it isn't new but the combinations are new. Sometimes it's just good to have some fun with the genre.Denise Crosby was really great as the singlemom who moves her family to a small California town as the new mortician. They find a really rundown old mortuary that rests on an island of muck which lets us know we're in for some grim dirty horror. Greg Travis returns from Toolbox Murders as a shady localbusinessman who rents the accursed property to unsuspecting tenants and his foppish gimpcharacter laughs all the time. Hilarious! All the characters are welldrawn and likable with a few notableexceptions so those characters die earlyon. They all seem and act as real people do like Dan Byrd's character as the son he's very believable. While the film is a lighthorror with lots of humor the plot line is actually very grim. Many onlinereviewers have expressed anger at the ending of this film calling it a cheapending but I don't see this at all. Did I mention the girl with the koolaid hair looked pretty hot? But honestly could the ending be any more unexpected? Not many American horrordirectors allow sympathetic characters to dieoff completely or have their identities takenover or destroyed. It's in the indieproductions or Asian and European horror that it occurs in the story if it does at all. We remember John Carpenter's The Thing 1982 because he breaks this rule even to the veryend of the film. Knowing the rules helps! At the time many people were angered by this but it's part of the original short story by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1938. There is aboveground horror and there is undergroundhorror like Campbell and Lovecraft Bloch Derleth etc. We know there are some things that you just don't do in a mainstreamfilm which is exactly why they should be done in horror. To do horror well you have to betray the audience.The only way for horror to progress is by a violation of taboos and a knowledge of what works. Killing the heroes certainly works but it's toobad for those who feel emotionally betrayed. The ending of Mortuary was just a fun fakeout. There were two other scenes that stoodout the infected mother serving the kids dinner in a parody of domesticity and the scene at the subterraneanwell. The infected were just completely mechanical and insane I loved it. The latterscene was a nod to parts of Invaders from Mars 1986 Hooper's remake of the 1953 classic. If you hadn't noticed many of Hooper's films center on a family unit in some way. He makes some pretty interesting comments on the family in his films and not all of them are sympathetic. This film just supports his counterculturalbackground and people get irritated by his jabs or when they don't get it.The only major complaint I have with Mortuary is that some of the CGI could have been better. It drew too much attention to itself but some of it was pretty good. As much as it costs why not do a few mattes and miniatures in the realworld? There was also a scene in the mortuary where some accident victims reanimate that should have been staged better but this is a lowbudget horror el cheapo. I would wager this movie cost under 1 million which is impressive considering the results. I doubt Uwe Boll or Paul Thomas Anderson could even paythemselves on this but their films basically suck at 3040 million. The cinematography is great with some looming lowshots and very interesting nightphotography and composition.The house and its setting are very realistic and bleakit makes one wonder exactly what is possible in some of our mostpolluted quarters of America. Nearly every small town has a local boogeyman story like the Bobby Fowler character and the mortuary house was welldrawn a place of death where nothing grows but something there feasts on the dead and the living. After the biggest rain in 50years it something has reawakened to feast morethanever. The behavior of the infected is pretty unsettling and machinelike keeping with Hooper's fear of a mechanicalhorror. He seems to enjoy portraying people in socialroles cop mother punker moviereviewer skater girlfriend employee sibling goth metalhead authoritarian homosexual judge manager wife husband etc. as a form of livingdeath but who can complain when this is our lives? Allinall it was justentertaining I know the end of the world! with a few jolts and some effectively disgusting makeup. The tone gets moreandmore hysterical and bizarre and that's what I expect from Tobe Hooper. This is the same level of filmmaking he was at when he did Eaten Alive and it's lowbudget but very solid. The origins of the zombification were pretty original and there were some moments of greatness in the imagery. I'm a sucker for graveyards. This is a greataddition to the works of Tobe Hooper he has nothing to be ashamedof here.That's all if ever claimed to be. A decent Bmovie horror with a some shocks.".

It just does not live up to its potential as it makes mistakes that turn it from a really good horror movie to a watered down horror movie that has you thinking what might have been. The story mother moves herself and two children to a little town to start a new career as a mortician. Granted this in itself is a bit hard to believe a father may have been a more realistic choice to lead the film but whatever I can role with it. The older teenage son is against this move and is the typical teen in that he voices his opinion against the house and everything about what his mom is doing...I usually don't care for that type but here I have to agree with him. Why she bought the place is beyond me as I do believe the house was made a bit to rundown to be realistic. I doubt anyone with any lick of sense would want to move in having seen that house beforehand. Well there are mysterious things going on and there is talk of a person who lives in the cemetery in the front lawn and all that and it could have been really good however it is so far fetched in some areas it moves so slowly at first and then it doesn't want to end. The deaths are not all that gory a bit of gore here and there but not all that much. At times the movie seems to be trying to be a horror comedy and this hurts the movie as well. I like horror comedies a bit I really enjoyed the flick Slither but don't halfheartedly go about it. Either be a horror comedy or go straight horror. Some scenes are a bit out of place thanks to this bizarre shift at times. The actors are the typical bmovie types and so they are okay. Then there is the use of cgi...I am against it in areas in this movie why they felt they needed it for the last thing is beyond me. You could have made a realistic whatever it was with minimal effort and money and it would have looked a lot more real. And the ending had me going Huh? Don't show what you showed in the previous scene and then hit me with that typical 80's horror ending...by the way if you have seen two horror movies with this type of ending you will know what is going to happen. Still though if they had developed the story better stayed away from the comedy bits and explained the thing and Bobby better this movie could have been a pretty decent horror flick as it is it has good and bad and is really just a mediocre flick.".

The place is abandoned brokendown and has a leaking septic tank full of toxic embalming chemicals. On top of that the place figures large in local legend since the Fowler clan was wiped out when deformed abused young Bobby Fowler went on a brutal killing spree and disappeared into the night.

It's not long before all these monster plot lines are crashing into one another fighting for screen time. All these beasties are ostensibly connected Bobby serves the Slug who makes the Fungus which creates the Zombies but it's really way too much for the film's 90 minute run time which means that setup scenes get truncated and by the end of the film plot points seem to appear out of thin air. For instance Bobby's obsession with little Jaime Doyle which is used to kick off the climactic underground sequence would have been far better served if there had been some room to show more of him stalking her early on.There are a lot of good moments in Mortuary. Production values are high makeup and effects are quite good and unlike many other horror films centered around a family unit several good punches go unpulled and mothers and small children are fair game. But as a whole it feels like three different films were smashed together to produce this one. On top of that I had to deduct a point from my rating because the shock it'snotoveryet ending was lame even by the usual standards.

There's a spooky myth attached to the mortuary regarding local boogeyman Bobby FowlerPrice Carsonwhose parents once run the outfit that he butchered them and still lives within the area. It turns out that Bobby does indeed exist and that he often feeds victims to the well their blood giving whatever it is nourishment. Oftentimes the black goo from the well turns humans into loony zombies such as a trio of misfits two goofy punk gals Tina  SaraCourtney Peldon  Tara Paige and their brutish and rude male lovetoy CalBug Hallwho have a bad habit of starting trouble such as picking an altercation with Jonathan or mistreating the graveyard nearby the mortuary.The film as typical with Hooper's oeuvre has an array of eccentric supporting characters such as a stuttering nervous sheriff and an alwayslaughing realestate agent a bit too cheery with offthewall remarks which produce most of the dark humor on display. I think the setting a creepy mortuary with evil lurking within works exceptionally well and the graveyard is quite spooky but the computer graphics are simply abysmal ruining what could've been an impressive followup to Hooper's The Toolbox Murders. The well isn't defined enough and is sloppily created not looking the least bit realistic. Bobby goes from grotesque villain to heroic savior way too fast and seems integrated into the film way too late. The corpses in Leslie's morgue which are given life thanks to the black goo are certainly effective enough resembling the Romero signature zombies. The computer graphicsfor how they are destroyed through the use of saltare dreadful. And the grim twist at the end doesn't make sense in regards as to what happens to Jonathan. Most of the murders that take place are handled specifically through the use of CGI..even when the hand of a zombie bursts through the chest of a victimwhich removes the effectiveness of the horror..The Toolbox Murders on the other hand is much more effective due to it's use of practical goreeffects. And I for one felt the film was hampered by the decision to turn Leslie into a zombie because the strength of the family was an important ingredient in the overall story..and I just enjoyed the chemistry of the three leads as a family absent a father trying to start over. Perhaps Hooper and company wanted to turn Leslie so that the terror heightens towards Jonathan and Jamie a hopeless situation where they must depend on themselves to survive. Those also facing the zombie crisis are Jonathan's gravelvoiced love interest LizAlexandra Adi and her potsmoking homosexual pal GradyRocky Marquette. Lee Garlington has a nice supporting turn as a foulmouthed diner owner Rita often mentioning her frequent drugtrips in the past..she also serves as a mentor to Liz and gives Jonathan a jobinforming Jonathan of Bobby Fowler. The dialogue as usual in a Hooper film can be quite profane and darkly humorous. As typical in a Tobe Hooper horror film corpses have collected by certain victims within Fowler's lair and the theme of innocence facing destruction is everpresent.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1974 Tobe Hooper struck lucky with the low budget horror 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. This has lead to the director getting himself on many a list of horror fans' favourite directors  but for me he was only ever really average and his filmography since his debut does nothing but prove that. Mortuary only serves in proving it further as while my opinion of the film isn't quite as low as the average review it's clear that this is a terrible movie and certainly not the work of a director with as much experience in the genre as Tobe Hooper. The basic plot sees a mother her son and her daughter go to live in an old funeral home so the mother can take up a position as the town mortician despite having no experience in such a job. This base leads to a whole load of other plots that spring from it. For a start we've got the son's developing friendship with some of the locals the story of the deformed boy who lives in the bowels of the funeral home and also some strange fungus that attacks people and turns them into zombies...It's clear that this is not going to be any good right from the word go but in fairness to it the first half of the movie actually isn't all that bad. There's nothing special about it but Hooper introduces his characters well and sets the scene for the horror. It's not long however before the film descends into complete messy stupidity and by then it's better to sit back and laugh at the proceedings. Hooper has got his cast all wrong here too. I don't want to sound mean but a film like this really needs a pretty lead actress to keep concentration up and Denise Crosby doesn't really suit that role and also fails to put any effort into her performance. The son character is obviously meant to be cool but Dan Byrd is too dorky to carry it off and the fact that he's so young looking doesn't give him any credibility. Child actress Stephanie Patton is not bad the best performer of the three central ones and Alexandra Adi is the best thing about the film. Despite all its flaws Mortuary is at least not completely boring there are a few amusing moments mostly for the wrong reasons and certain set pieces work well. But this is not the work of a 'master' and in that respect it is disappointing.".

	schema:headline " Terrible horror comedy from Tobe Hooper.";
	schema:reviewBody "Mortuary starts as recently widowed Leslie Doyle Denise Crosby  her two young children Jonathan Dan Byrd  Janie Stephanie Patton arrive at a small town in California where they hope to rebuild their lives having taken over the local mortuary. There Jonathan quickly gets a job at a local diner  as the bodies pile up Leslie is kept busy however there are strange local legends surrounding the mortuary  the previous occupants. Then a black fungus starts to grow around the mortuary  infect the dead which brings them back to life as zombies it also infects the living  turns them into killers who do the evil fungi's bidding...This deeply unfunny  unscary horror comedy was directed by the one time great Tobe Hooper whose career has been a literal rollercoaster  uneven to say the least from his first film the classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 to his second the darkly grim  macabre Eaten Alive 1976 to the Salem's Lot 1979 film to The Funhouse 1981 to Poltergeist 1982 he had some cracking films to his credit  a good reputation in the horror genre. Then things began to fall apart he went through a phase of making entertainingly bad films like Lifeforce 1985 the Invaders from Mars 1986 remake  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 1986 all of which I love but flopped both critically  commercially. Unfortunately since then Hooper has made nothing but bad film after bad film even going as low as to direct the lousy straighttovideoDVD SciFi Channel style creature feature Crocodile 2000  then there's this Mortuary. The script by Jace Anderson  Adam Gierasch who also wrote the awful aforementioned Tobe Hooper directed Cocodile  his Toolbox Murders 2003 remake really tries to be some sort of amusing teen comedy horror but fails spectacularly I honestly don't think I even smiled let alone laughed at one single moment in Mortuary. All the gags really miss the mark for me from supposedly funny scenes of zombies being sick on people to a seedy Mayor to a Sheriff with a stutter to a sarcastic caf owner this is as funny as filling out tax returns. The horror side of things are no better it's takes an absolute age for anything to happen  when it does it's nothing more than scenes of teenagers screaming  running from a few zombies. The script  plot are atrocious  nothing has any sort of explanation behind it. For instance we never find out what the fungus is where it came from or why it suddenly appeared. We never find out why there's some guy living under the graveyard or what he motivations are or why noone has ever seen him before. We never find out why salt kills the fungus or why at the end the film totally contradicts itself  has all the fungus survive even though we just saw it destroyed. We never find out what the fungus wants or why it controls people or what their purpose is. Basically Mortuary feels like lots of totally unconnected ideas thrown together without any sort of reason.Director Hooper turns in a reasonable looking flick I'll give him that much but overall the film still sucks. The character's are awful you will not care for any of them  by the end you will be rooting for the fungus  zombies. So what could save such a poorly conceived  written film like Mortuary? That's right lots of blood gore  zombie action. Unfortunately Hooper lets us down big time in this department too there's a severed arm  zombie punches it's hand through someone's neck  that really is all the gore there is. For a film that goes on for over 90 minutes  is so bad that just isn't good enough. There's no nudity either in case you were wondering which you probably weren't. The film is competently made but there's no real atmosphere it's not scary there's no impending sense of doom or gloom  the whole thing feels very flat  not too dissimilar to a cheap TV flick.Technically the film has reasonable production values cinematography  special makeup effects although some of the CGI computer effects at the end are terrible. Filmed in Los Angeles. The acting isn't anything to get excited about  you know your in trouble when a little twelve year old girl gives the best performance.Mortuary is a poor attempt at a horror comedy that is neither horrific or funny  the plot feels like it had no thought put into it at all this is disappointing by anybodies standard but with the once great Tobe Hooper's name attached it's even worse. Funnily enough there were two films made in the same year during 1983 called Mortuary  then none until 2005 when another two were made during the same year called Mortuary as well!".

Then things began to fall apart he went through a phase of making entertainingly bad films like Lifeforce 1985 the Invaders from Mars 1986 remake  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 1986 all of which I love but flopped both critically  commercially. Unfortunately since then Hooper has made nothing but bad film after bad film even going as low as to direct the lousy straighttovideoDVD SciFi Channel style creature feature Crocodile 2000  then there's this Mortuary. The script by Jace Anderson  Adam Gierasch who also wrote the awful aforementioned Tobe Hooper directed Cocodile  his Toolbox Murders 2003 remake really tries to be some sort of amusing teen comedy horror but fails spectacularly I honestly don't think I even smiled let alone laughed at one single moment in Mortuary. All the gags really miss the mark for me from supposedly funny scenes of zombies being sick on people to a seedy Mayor to a Sheriff with a stutter to a sarcastic caf owner this is as funny as filling out tax returns. The horror side of things are no better it's takes an absolute age for anything to happen  when it does it's nothing more than scenes of teenagers screaming  running from a few zombies. The script  plot are atrocious  nothing has any sort of explanation behind it. For instance we never find out what the fungus is where it came from or why it suddenly appeared. We never find out why there's some guy living under the graveyard or what he motivations are or why noone has ever seen him before. We never find out why salt kills the fungus or why at the end the film totally contradicts itself  has all the fungus survive even though we just saw it destroyed. We never find out what the fungus wants or why it controls people or what their purpose is. Basically Mortuary feels like lots of totally unconnected ideas thrown together without any sort of reason.Director Hooper turns in a reasonable looking flick I'll give him that much but overall the film still sucks. The character's are awful you will not care for any of them  by the end you will be rooting for the fungus  zombies. So what could save such a poorly conceived  written film like Mortuary? That's right lots of blood gore  zombie action. Unfortunately Hooper lets us down big time in this department too there's a severed arm  zombie punches it's hand through someone's neck  that really is all the gore there is. For a film that goes on for over 90 minutes  is so bad that just isn't good enough. There's no nudity either in case you were wondering which you probably weren't. The film is competently made but there's no real atmosphere it's not scary there's no impending sense of doom or gloom  the whole thing feels very flat  not too dissimilar to a cheap TV flick.Technically the film has reasonable production values cinematography  special makeup effects although some of the CGI computer effects at the end are terrible. Filmed in Los Angeles. The acting isn't anything to get excited about  you know your in trouble when a little twelve year old girl gives the best performance.Mortuary is a poor attempt at a horror comedy that is neither horrific or funny  the plot feels like it had no thought put into it at all this is disappointing by anybodies standard but with the once great Tobe Hooper's name attached it's even worse. Funnily enough there were two films made in the same year during 1983 called Mortuary  then none until 2005 when another two were made during the same year called Mortuary as well!";

I'll admit to never thinking of it and with the shortage of originality today in the genre this was sorely needed. Even the method to get rid of the zombies was pretty clever and the reasoning behind it sounded valid for once. That could actually happen in real life and it gave a small touch of realism to it that was also needed in the film.

The zombies themselves when they are onscreen are pretty gruesome looking and several have the customary rotting and decayed look to them. I was even surprised to find a bit of humor in here as well. I laughed at it a couple times so it earns points for that as well.The Bad News The film is really slow and it takes forever for something to happen. The first twenty minutes features no real action at all and even the zombies don't appear until well into the movie. The beginning is just maddeningly slow and those wanting an allout zombie film are gonna be really disappointed with this one as it's hardly got any of the tradition zombie film parts. Its taken up instead with a teendrama story that really doesn't do much even though it occupies most of the time. It has a potentially great story but the weak beginning is a real problem.The Final Verdict Overcoming a slow beginning is key to enjoying this one. Let it play out it gets far better. There is a bit more to this some may think so give it a shot. Zombie fans should be more patient than others though as it's pretty long into the film before they come out into the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I was really surprised when I hopped on here and saw this rated so low. I for one had a good time watching it. It's sort of bordering on a kidfriendly scary movie with just enough bad stuff in it to make it like a 15 and up flick. I'm sure it'd be best for adolescent boys with some of it's downright stupid lines and minuscule sexploitation.I see one of the biggest problems is that people don't think this movie is scary. To that I say what movies are ever scary? I haven't been scared by a movie aside from cheap shocks for a long time.That aside this is still a good movie it's interesting it has a lot of good stuff going for it.

It's sort of bordering on a kidfriendly scary movie with just enough bad stuff in it to make it like a 15 and up flick. I'm sure it'd be best for adolescent boys with some of it's downright stupid lines and minuscule sexploitation.I see one of the biggest problems is that people don't think this movie is scary. To that I say what movies are ever scary? I haven't been scared by a movie aside from cheap shocks for a long time.That aside this is still a good movie it's interesting it has a lot of good stuff going for it.

Love's acting ability has never been a question but this performance is one of her best while it is not Oscar worthy she embraces the character and took a simple role and owned it. Marley Shelton gets throw in the mix as the eye candy her role as Brooke has been done before. Although she is a good actress this part could be played by anyone. The same has to be said for Eric Balfour who is supposed to be the Big man on campus. There is nothing great about his performance. To add some comic spice Danny Masterson and Jason Marsden play two strange teenagers trying to find that one special girl. Kathy Griffin has a small but funny role. All of the acting is good. It could be worse example Drive Me Crazy. The music only adds to the movie. All of the songs in some way find their place in the movie. TROJAN WAR is a fun film with laughs and even some touching moments. It's a story about wanting more but not seeing what's right in front of you. Like the tagline say's she has 24 hours to convince the guy of her dreams that she's the girl of his. It's a story for anyone who has been in love a story about growing up and a story about finding yourself and losing your head along the way. All in all it gets 3.5 stars out of 4.".

Or will Leah's dream come true? Trojan War 1997 is a great teen movie with terrific actors.Will Friedle is amazing in the lead.He's blessed with comedic skills.That you could notice in this great teen show called Boy Meets World 19932000 where he played Eric Matthews.Jennifer Love Hewitt is both beautiful and talented gal who has been in many things including Party of Five 19942000 where Jen played Sarah Reeves.There's also Danny Masterson from That 70's Show playing Seth and Will Friedle's real life best friend Jason Marsden as Josh.Lee Majors as Officer Austin and Anthony Michael Hall as Bus Driver are also pretty darn great in their roles. This movie isn't the most usual teen movie even though the plot may sound like it.The word kafkaesque is mentioned in the plot keywords which describes the movie pretty well.The journey Brad goes through is pretty surrealistic like in a bad dream.That's what makes this movie pretty interesting.This movie can be enjoyed not only by teens but also those who feel like ones like me.I turn 23 today and I liked this movie pretty much probably more than I should admit.So why don't you give it a shot.".

Or will Leah's dream come true? Trojan War 1997 is a great teen movie with terrific actors.Will Friedle is amazing in the lead.He's blessed with comedic skills.That you could notice in this great teen show called Boy Meets World 19932000 where he played Eric Matthews.Jennifer Love Hewitt is both beautiful and talented gal who has been in many things including Party of Five 19942000 where Jen played Sarah Reeves.There's also Danny Masterson from That 70's Show playing Seth and Will Friedle's real life best friend Jason Marsden as Josh.Lee Majors as Officer Austin and Anthony Michael Hall as Bus Driver are also pretty darn great in their roles. This movie isn't the most usual teen movie even though the plot may sound like it.The word kafkaesque is mentioned in the plot keywords which describes the movie pretty well.The journey Brad goes through is pretty surrealistic like in a bad dream.That's what makes this movie pretty interesting.This movie can be enjoyed not only by teens but also those who feel like ones like me.I turn 23 today and I liked this movie pretty much probably more than I should admit.So why don't you give it a shot.";

Semigeek virgin desperately in love with the schools unattainable beauty who has become disillusioned with popular guy she has been dating. Protagonist's gorgeous anywhere but in this school tomboyish best friend is secretly in love with him? Cut to climatic party scene at which all this is sorted out. Unfortunately they stole only the premise and not the actual script or the cast with the exception of Marley Shelton who makes a fine dream girl replacement for Hewitt so the production falls far short of its predecessor. It also falls far short of its 1998 successor Can't Hardly Wait also featuring Jennifer Love Hewittthis time as the unattainable beauty. In fact the writers of that film appear to have taken the script from The Trojan War and re written it for an audience with IQ's about 30 points higher. So my advice unless you are a mega JLH fan would be to stick with the predecessor and the successor and leave The Trojan War for its intended audience of wiggers and drones. The soundtrack is much better in those two films as well.The Trojan War was pulled from its scheduled 1997 theatrical release because of poor projected audience numbers and filed away in the hope that Jennifer Love Hewitt's skyrocketing popularity insert Can't Hardly Wait Party of Five and I Know What You Did Last Summer here would change the equation and justify the promotional expense of releasing the movie. Even that was not enough for distributors to take a chance on the film and after a year of deliberation it went direct to video. And even with Hewitt's continued success in Ghost Whisperer the sales projections for a DVD release of The Trojan War has not excited anyone in the industry. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

The small problems become major problems the funny bad guy or girl in this case becomes reoccurring the girl he's after turns out to not be the girl he truly wants and the bad guy gets taken out by the good guy doing barely anything. What really bothered me about the final climatic scene was that the dog that he's had a problem with since leaving Brooke's house obeyed him in attacking Brooke's boyfriend instead of attacking Brad. There was absolutely NO logic behind that.The movie then ends with him realizing that the entire quest was pointless as his prize has been right there in front of him the whole time.

We don't know what happens to the gang members he befriended we don't know what his parents do after finding out what happened especially him losing their car we don't know if Brooke and Kyle get back together nothing is solved in the end except Leah's want for Brad.There was a few solid laughs but with it's 85 minute run time a few isn't anywhere close to cutting it. I stared at the screen with a blank face for most of the jokes that were seemingly written by 10 year olds that try too hard to be funny. It wasn't very entertaining but it did keep a I still wanna see how this ends type of vibe on me the entire time.

	schema:reviewBody "This unambitious well executed teen comedy got a little lost amongst the other teen films that came out around this time. While Scream and its various clones and crude teen comedies like American Pie were big hits and ensemble pieces like Empire Records and Can't Hardly Wait developed cult followings this inoffensive little charmer was widely ignored which is a bit of a shame as it is far from a bad movie.Trojan War stars Will Freidle as Brad Kimble a sex starved teenager who is completely oblivious to the feelings of his best friend Leah Jones Jennifer Love Hewitt due to his obsession with scoring with Brooke Kingston Marley Shelton. Right when it looks like he is finally going to get his chance he has Brooke on the bed ready to go when suddenly he realizes he doesn't have a condom. So now he has to leave her lying there so he can go and buy a packet of Trojan condoms. Not highbrow stuff by any means but the journey Will takes on his Trojan War is reasonably engaging with some good spontaneous laughs and the obvious love story between he and Leah developing in the background.Jennifer Love Hewitt was known by this stage as she had been in Part of Five for a couple of years and in this one she really shows her credentials as a teen love interest. Freidle is great in several scenes while most of the rest of the cast fade into the background. This is Hewitt and Freidle's film and they are a likable duo.While hardly one of the great movies of the 90s this one was OK.

	onyx:emotionText "This unambitious well executed teen comedy got a little lost amongst the other teen films that came out around this time. While Scream and its various clones and crude teen comedies like American Pie were big hits and ensemble pieces like Empire Records and Can't Hardly Wait developed cult followings this inoffensive little charmer was widely ignored which is a bit of a shame as it is far from a bad movie.Trojan War stars Will Freidle as Brad Kimble a sex starved teenager who is completely oblivious to the feelings of his best friend Leah Jones Jennifer Love Hewitt due to his obsession with scoring with Brooke Kingston Marley Shelton. Right when it looks like he is finally going to get his chance he has Brooke on the bed ready to go when suddenly he realizes he doesn't have a condom. So now he has to leave her lying there so he can go and buy a packet of Trojan condoms. Not highbrow stuff by any means but the journey Will takes on his Trojan War is reasonably engaging with some good spontaneous laughs and the obvious love story between he and Leah developing in the background.Jennifer Love Hewitt was known by this stage as she had been in Part of Five for a couple of years and in this one she really shows her credentials as a teen love interest. Freidle is great in several scenes while most of the rest of the cast fade into the background. This is Hewitt and Freidle's film and they are a likable duo.While hardly one of the great movies of the 90s this one was OK. And if you happen to be sitting down and see it coming up on cable give it a go. It's quite a fun little film. Hardly a classic but still worthwhile.";

	schema:headline " The First Worst Summer Movie I've seen";
	schema:reviewBody "During my summer vacations over the years of seeing and reviewing movies I was always happy and delighted to some movies that I'll always remember that particular summer vacation. Well recently during my summer vacation this year I have to say that I've seen my first worst movie during the summer. And it was not the last one I thought was terrible. In August of this year I've seen another horrible movie. That movie was Harlem Nights with Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor. At the end of my summer vacation I had to ask myself one question What movie would I not want to see again? My answer? Trojan War. And if you're asking what's Trojan War is about let me tell you what exactly Trojan War means in this movie. A highschool senior played by Will Friedle wants to woo the girl of his dreams. The girl in his dreams is a beautiful blonde who's also friends with a highschool jerk. One night he sees his chance to make out with her. One problem stands in his way he doesn't have protection. In other words he doesn't have a condom. So he goes to a convenience store and buys the condoms all right. But once he's outside the store his parents' car is stolen by a group of Hispanic thugs. Movie stereotyping being seen here. Throughout this whole movie the poor kid tries to get one condom and in the midst of the madness he embarks on a series of misadventures. Those misadventures includes walking into a nightclub and having to be forced to dance with a voluptuous Hispanic woman having to take a wild ride in a city bus driven by a insane bus driver who doesn't like it when the riders don't pay for their ride on the bus and we see the young man being taken hostage by the same Hispanic thugs that took his parents' car. Now that I explain to you what's the movie about you can see that the title of this movie is misleading. People might think this movie is about the legendary story of the Trojan War that was fought in the B.C. era. Wrong. To me this story is ridiculous. Why do we care about this young kid who want to love this blonde? The only thing I have to say before I forget again is the supporting character played Jennifer Love Hewitt. What is she doing in a movie like this? She's a young actress who has the talent to express to the audience. Here her character goes nowhere fast. The movie is also predictable and the elements of this story are burrowed from other teenage romances. We have the kid who's in love with the blonde in the movie. He should love the brunette. I mean if I was this kid I would've went with Jennifer Love Hewitt. I'm again ready to forget this movie once again. But just because I've seen my first and worst summer movie I didn't miss out other good or great movies as well. If I had to pick the worst summer movie of 2013 Trojan War would be my choice. I would leave this one in the heat for good.  12 1 12 star.".

To top it all off the script if very well written. It's funny involving and unpredictable. Of course if you're looking for a serious contemplative film or something that takes a deep and profound look at modern society then you're out of luck.

	schema:reviewBody "Trojan War is the typical fluffy teen fare with as much subtlety as an ice cream cone.  And worse off it's not funny!  Silly yes.  Stupid very. Funny seldom.  Original scarcely.Come on this is a funny premise!  A great premise with great potential! Booty Call wasn't the smartest comedy but it had enough charm originality and wit to pull it off.  It used the condomchasing premise wisely for the most part.  Trojan War is simply a cartoonish farce that flings one goofy situation after another all of which is overthetopsometimes obnoxiousbut rarely funny.  Wow I'm surprised it went direct to video!Will Friedle is not a bad actor but he's resorted to bumbling around like an ape.  Let's face it he has little comic talent.  With his previous experience in the biz mainly being the lamebrain sitcom Boy Meets World what do you expect?  Who can pick up a great sense of timing and delivery on a sitcom aimed at preteens?  All his dialogue delivery seems forced and artificial.  Bad writing and halfassed acting?  Not a good combo.  Of course we have the beautiful Jennifer Love Hewitt to keep our eyes open. I liked how she performed a few songs for the soundtrack.  I think I'm about the only one who bought her CDs so I'm probably the only one who recognized her singing in the background in two scenes.  One of which she's driving in her jeep and listening to her own song on the radio!  That I found hilariously ironic.  She's a good actress and has a really good voice. You go girl!  The few funny moments are mostly thanks to the adult cameos. Lee Majors plays the local officer.  You can't get much cooler than Lee Majors!  Anthony MichaelHall plays a psychotic bus driver who REALLY makes sure his customers pay exact change only!  Kathy Griffin has a brief cameo as a convenience store clerk.  In a juvenile teen flick like this you just want to applaud and applaud when grownup actors like these make their appearances.  It almost adds a touch of class.As for the plot faggedaboudit!  You can't get any more predictable!  One thing that always bugs me out about these movies  The girl who the guy is chasing is always a lot less prettier than the girl usually his best friend like in this case who had the hots for him all along.  Marley Shelton is a pretty actress but that dumb blonde floozie facade should've turned him off from the getgo.  Meanwhile we have the extremely beautiful JLH who has known this guy Friedle all his life and he didn't once consider hooking up with her?  Yeah right!  It's just another cheap cinematic conceit that filmmakers abuse to the bone.  And the Shelton character is so unappealing while JLH's very likeable that you wonder why he went on this whole condomchasing journey in the first place!  It makes no sense.The disappointing thing is George Huang directed this piece of crap!  This is the guy who wrote and directed the underrated dark satire Swimming with Sharks featuring one of Kevin Spacey's best performances.  How did he make the transition from hilarious biting satire to utter garbage?  I think the two films bare no similarity whatsoever and it's almost impossible to believe they were made by the same director.If your day consists of sitting on the couch watching marathons of Saved By the Bell and California Dreams this is the film for you!My score  3 out of 10".

Each and every one of their characters is played memorably making for far more than an extended acting stunt on their part you actually feel for and connect with each and every one of their incarnations forgetting completely that they are played by the same actors you are drawn into their characters' sometime painful sometime painfully funny dilemmas which all get resolved since all the possibilities are shown.This is a UFO to me a hilarious touching comedy with absolutely no flaws even though some have said the running times were a little selfindulging an experimental film that works and never feels forced a triumph of acting... I suppose some will find it overbearing but actors directors and screenwriters alike should make this one of their necessary albeit hardtocomeby viewings because if you're caught by the magic on screen you won't be turning back. Although the films can be seen in any order i would recommend you start with No Smoking as it offers a more supple introduction to the films' method and characters and also because Smoking is probably the better of the two and thus you've got a dramatic crescendo going for yourself.For people who don't necessarily like French cinema or who don't understand the British watch thesethey're the kind of movie miracles that belong to everyone. They are that great.".

Each and every one of their characters is played memorably making for far more than an extended acting stunt on their part you actually feel for and connect with each and every one of their incarnations forgetting completely that they are played by the same actors you are drawn into their characters' sometime painful sometime painfully funny dilemmas which all get resolved since all the possibilities are shown.This is a UFO to me a hilarious touching comedy with absolutely no flaws even though some have said the running times were a little selfindulging an experimental film that works and never feels forced a triumph of acting... I suppose some will find it overbearing but actors directors and screenwriters alike should make this one of their necessary albeit hardtocomeby viewings because if you're caught by the magic on screen you won't be turning back. Although the films can be seen in any order i would recommend you start with No Smoking as it offers a more supple introduction to the films' method and characters and also because Smoking is probably the better of the two and thus you've got a dramatic crescendo going for yourself.For people who don't necessarily like French cinema or who don't understand the British watch thesethey're the kind of movie miracles that belong to everyone. They are that great.";

A faithful cinematic version in French of a play by the great contemporary English dramatist Alan Ayckbourn the whole enterprise  might appear to superficial critics as an impossibly eccentric undertaking A quintessentially English comedy of manners turned into a film by an entirely French team! How can two such diverse national temperaments as the Gallic and the English possibly cohabit in any meaningful creative enterprise? Well this is the challenge of course and there were once philistines who thought even Shakespeare could never be attempted en Francais. The interest of this film lies indeed very largely in the attempts of all concerned to acculturate themselves to an alien perspective naturally the results are mixed and noone fluent in English would want to deprive themselves of the version originale. However a talented group of French actors succeed commendably on the whole in communicating the very particular English humour of the play. For this chance to increase their repertoire the actors have to thank Resnais whose choice of Ayckbourn was far from merely eccentric. He has obviously recognised in the Englishman a person who is as typically obsessed as himself with opening up narrative structure and in finding more creative ways to tell a story. Though a very strange hybrid especially for an Anglophone! the enterprise is no monstrous abortion but actually a very elegant and worthwhile tribute by our neighbours across La Manche. This is a most attractive film version of Ayckbourn's drama. It even succeeds in retaining a great deal of the downright hilarity of the original which in their plays the fellowcountrymen of Shakespeare have learned early to intermix with the sadder side of life. In other words we have here a suitably touching hilarious and clever and moreover a fascinatingly unexpected version of a great original. Authentic Ayckbourn comme Resnais authentique.

	schema:reviewBody "The Lubitsch Touch is evident in this witty intelligent film. Jennifer Jones shows a vivacity and humor she had never displayed before and would not again until her clever performance in Beat The Devil. In one amazing scene where she cannot resist showing her wares as a Plumber to the disdain of the other party guests she gets to play a reaction to the debacle that is amazing in its combination of pathos and hilarity. Very interesting character actors including a very very funny Una O'Connor whose dialogue consists mainly of incessantly clearing her throat the light as a feather and dead on playing of Margaret Bannerman and also a chance to see Helen Walker. Charles Boyer plays with his customary light touch and is the anchor to this film but finally it is Jennifer Jones' performance that takes one breath away and stays with you long after you've seen it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cluny Brown had quite an impact on me when I saw part of it as a child. I'm sure my feelings had to do with the luminous beauty of Jennifer Jones and wanting to be just like her when I grew up. Jones has the title role of an imaginative young woman who being the niece of a plumber doesn't mind picking up a hammer herself once in a while and having a good whack at the pipes. It gets her into some trouble at the apartment of Hilary Ames Reginald Sinclair when she arrives before a party to clear out his sink before his guests arrive. There she meets Adam Belinski a Czech academician who's on the run from Hitler. Well that's who the very earnest Andrew Carmel Peter Lawford assumes he is...Belinski never actually says.When her uncle finds Cluny drunk and on the couch at the Ames apartment he puts her into service. She winds up working at the Carmel country estate where Belinski comes to stay. Attracted to her he sets about aggravating the local pharmacist Mr. Wilson Richard Haydn who is courting Cluny and getting involved with Andrew's romance with Betty Cream Helen Walker.This is a very sweet light comedy from Lubitsch that touches on not only the class system in England but the attitude of the upper class toward the impending war. As in the Fox film This Above All the upper class in Cluny Brown seems annoyed by the mere thought of war and hope the nonsense will just go away. As for Cluny born to her class she's expected to work and behave a certain way though it isn't really her nature.The performances are all very good with Boyer a delight as Belinski a character perhaps modeled on the Czech freedom fighter Jan Mazurek  though he basically doesn't act in danger or worried and manages to hit Andrew up for money. One is never really sure throughout the film what he's up to. Richard Haydn is hilarious as Cluny's suitor Mr. Wilson one of the best scenes taking place when he plays the harmonium for her and she all but swoons. As his mother all Una O'Connor does is cough but that's all she needs to do. Playing opposite boyish Peter Lawford Helen Walker seemed too old for the part of Betty. The other supporting players are all excellent including Sara Allgood Reginald Owen and Margaret Bannerman.David O. Selznick saw Jennifer Jones in his outer office and it was love at first sight. It's easy to see why. She is radiant and spirited as Cluny her vivid imagination shining through her eyes and smile. A wonderful presence  gentle vulnerable and guileless.Cluny Brown isn't at the top of Lubitsch's best  it's uneven and doesn't have enough of a plot. It's entertaining nonetheless and the ending is pure joy.".

And yet I would like to think that people would love it for what it is a charming piece of old world cinema.It is possible that this movie could be made today. Though I'm not sure who would be able to play all the parts with the sincerity the cast do in the movie without going over the top. Especially I wonder who could play a character like Cluny with the charm and depth that Jennifer Jones brings to it.Jennifer Jones's Cluny is one of the most captivating characters I've ever met on screen. So engaging so charming so innocent.Jennifer Jones acting is sublime. I couldn't help but watch the different expressions on her face through each emotion she was going through. Good facial expression is always for a me a good sign that the actress is immersed fully in the part.Charles Boyer's Adam Belinski must be the kind of man women dream about meeting but probably never will. Handsome french accent worldly wise kind gentle understanding. He is of cause the perfect man for Cluny as against the boring Wilson played with great verve by Richard Haydn. I hated the character lol. But I thought Haydn's performance quite brilliant too.The rest of the cast do a fine job too. And the ending is perfect.".

I've watched this movie about 15 times and I cant really explain why except that it makes me feel good. This is the kind of movie you want to watch if its a rainy cold day outside and you can curl up with a cup of cocoa. The cocoa will warm your insides and the movie Cluny Brown will warm your heart. I will always treasure this sweet simple romantic comedy. Keep in mind that this is a very old movie and the purpose was for entertainment back then not detailed plot twists.

	schema:headline " One of Jennifer Jones' best roles.";
	schema:reviewBody "I am frankly shocked that I haven't seen this film as I thought I'd seen about everything that Ernst Lubitsch directed in the States and many of his German films as well. But oddly I'd overlooked this one.Before I talk about the film in detail I have a few comments about the cast. Casting Charles Boyer with Jennifer Jones is really odd and you just don't normally think of them togetherbut the film managed to handle this odd combination well. Additionally the film has some excellent supporting character actorsReginald Owen Reginald Gardiner C. Aubry Smith and Richard Haydn. And while I am not a huge fan of Una O'Connor she overacts horribly in some films here she is great...as she says nothing! As far as Jennifer Jones goes she is usually one of my least favorite actresses. I think it's because her lover and later husband David O. Selznick really mismanaged her career and placed her in some roles which were terrible for her. In Duel in the Sun she played a halfbreed shedeviland played it to the hilt. Coming from a woman who excelled in sweet roles such as Cluny Brown Song of Bernadette Since You Went Away and Love Letters playing such an unwholesome and sleazy character didn't work at all and came off as silly. Several of her other films were clear misfires due to casting her WAY against type such as in Beat the Devil and Ruby Gentry and Indiscretion of An American Wife. Here fortunately Jones is at her very bestas a very sweet and ditsy sort of character you can't help but like. And everyone she meets seems to like her in this sweet little comedy.The film begins with a stopped up sink. Reginald Owen and Charles Boyer are about to have a dinner party and are relieved when they think that the plumber has arrivedbut it's NOT the plumber but the plumber's niece Cluny Jones who shows. She isn't a plumber at all but seems to enjoy fixing plumbing as a hobby. And since her uncle is busy she thought she'd come and give it a try. She very quickly fixes it but they have her stay because she is so vivacious and sweet that they don't want her to go. And after a couple drinks she REALLY opens up and shows a cute side of her that is fun to watch. Obviously Boyer is taken with herbut can't do much about it as he's a homeless refugee from the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia.A bit later a rich idealist Peter Lawford meets Boyer and it turns out the Boyer is a famous professor and political refugee. So wanting to help a guy down on his luck Lawford invites him to stay at his family estate in the country. When Boyer arrives he's thrilled to see that Jones has just been hired as a servant thereand spends as much time as he can with her. And by the way she's a terrible maidbut she's so nice they can't stand to fire her.Sadly for Boyer Jones is inexplicably taken with one of the most boring men in human history Haydn. And she somehow likes the idea of possibly becoming this dullard's wife. But what about poor Boyer? He's homeless and is secretly in love with Clunyand the likelihood he'll ever win over Cluny is remote. And even if he does how can he possibly afford to marry? And Haydn and his weird mother O'Connor are bound to choke the life and charm out of poor Cluny as they want her to be more proper and 'adult'something no sane person would want from her! I could say more but think it's best you just see this charming film for yourself.Utterly charming from start to finish. I do so wish Jones had made more films like this and the lovely Lubitsch touch is more than enough to make this film a treat to watch. MY only quibble and it's a tiny one is that the scene in New York following the train ride at the end was NOT necessary. I think having the film end a tiny bit sooner would have been a bit betterjust a bit.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am frankly shocked that I haven't seen this film as I thought I'd seen about everything that Ernst Lubitsch directed in the States and many of his German films as well. But oddly I'd overlooked this one.Before I talk about the film in detail I have a few comments about the cast. Casting Charles Boyer with Jennifer Jones is really odd and you just don't normally think of them togetherbut the film managed to handle this odd combination well. Additionally the film has some excellent supporting character actorsReginald Owen Reginald Gardiner C. Aubry Smith and Richard Haydn. And while I am not a huge fan of Una O'Connor she overacts horribly in some films here she is great...as she says nothing! As far as Jennifer Jones goes she is usually one of my least favorite actresses. I think it's because her lover and later husband David O. Selznick really mismanaged her career and placed her in some roles which were terrible for her. In Duel in the Sun she played a halfbreed shedeviland played it to the hilt. Coming from a woman who excelled in sweet roles such as Cluny Brown Song of Bernadette Since You Went Away and Love Letters playing such an unwholesome and sleazy character didn't work at all and came off as silly. Several of her other films were clear misfires due to casting her WAY against type such as in Beat the Devil and Ruby Gentry and Indiscretion of An American Wife.

An awkward confrontation an improbable entry of one character into another character's world. There is whispering and disbelief and nonchalance all mixed together in a way that is in fact lighthearted but isn't as funny or bright as you would want.And so the movie zips on quite fun and lighthearted but always for me missing some basic gut humor or even a more trenchant critique of its subject the British upper class.

	schema:reviewBody "That's a funny comedy that takes England as the target of its humor the England of 1938 and what's more the aristocracy and their twisted class relations with their servants. It is humorous by the way it shows how an Eastern European can easily trap the aristocrats in 1938 with the sound of Prague some good manners and a little bit of antinazism. That Adam Belinski is able to charm these English aristocrats especially the son who wants to go and fight against Hitler and his parents who do not even ask a question or hardly. That Czech refugee is able to live on that noble family for a while before leaving for America along with the maid who arrived the same day as him and he had met in London before. The comedy is funny because that girl who is not an aristocrat far from it does all the mistakes you can imagine English etiquette is going to frown upon severely. She pretends to be a plumber and she repairs some toilet or washstand in a jiffy in front of a middleclass family their guests and the pharmacist who was getting enamored. The result is the departure of all the guests after the departure of the pharmacist's mother and then she is practically rejected. She does not know what class differences are. She will of course be captured by the Czech refugee and taken to America where he is going to become a popular writer and she will finally be away from silly class distinctions. It is funnily absurd and the Lord and his Lady are just pass and oldfashioned quaint is probably the word if we want to remain nice. Lubitsch takes great pleasure at showing how silly such classdistinctions are. The whole comedy is more humorous than really funny and that humor always remains polite even at times mundane though in the light American way.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines CEGID".

	schema:reviewBody "Lubitsch's evolution as a director is the most delightful and surprising of Hollywood's old Guard giants. In a sense he arrived on the scene from Germany readymade with little visual skill but a prodigious talent for gags which were transparently clever and loaded with innuendo but too rigorously rehearsed to be as funny as their reputation suggests. There's plenty of inventive bits of business in his 30s output to warrant the reputation for the Lubitsch touch but in review the supreme brittleness of these pictures represents a spoon feeding arrangement between a maestro and an odd assortment of players including Chevalier and Jeannette MacDonald who seemed to be taking their marching orders on blind faith alone  rather than in thoughtful collaboration with the puppet master.But then in 1940 the naughty knowingness of cynical bedroom farce is replaced by the comedy of quiet desperation of workers at their appointed stations in the sublime SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. A true sense of actor participation and a celebration of democratic spirit in spite of the artificial Budapest setting is projected with unforgettable humour and warmth by a perfect ensemble featuring Margaret Sullavan Jimmy Stewart the blessed Felix Bressart and the most precious Frank Morgan. Instead of merely mirroring what the master wants in shadow play the performers for the first time in a Lubitsch production appear in full command of their instruments. And there is something else that undergoes a transformation in Lubitsch's art as well.The screenwriter of THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER Samson Raphaelson started with Lubitsch in the 30s adapting Continental stage comedies into English to the screen. SHOP was pivotal still ostensibly set in Eastern Europe it was as much about American manners as it was Old World sentiment. HEAVEN CAN WAIT 1943 starring Don Ameche Gene Tierney and the invaluable Charles Coburn was explicitly a satire by Raphaelson and the director lovingly administered of U.S. sexual mores but before that with TO BE OR NOT TO BE 1942 starring Jack Benny and Carole Lombard allusions to the English classics ie. Shakespearetook precedent over German ones eg. MolnarErnst Lubitsch never mastered American popular culture eg. the intricacies of baseball to the same degree of expertise that his logical successor Billy Wilder did but philosophically his conversion to an AngloAmerican outlook was more sincere and more surprisingly profound.His most perfect film remains THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. He and Raphaelson accomplished something comparable  in terms of romantic sentiment and comic use of language  to the music of Mozart. But in his last completed film CLUNY BROWN 1946 he finishes off the comedy of AngloAmerican and Victorianmanners by returning home to its cultural source Merry Ole England. This lovely easygoing satire about the propriety of British plumbing is so gentle and deft in its ridicule that it is as much a salute to the country's eccentricity as it is a swipe at its silly stuffiness. Working with another great screenwriter this time it is the more flagrantly absurdistpoetically digressive Samuel Hoffenstein LOVE ME TONIGHT 1932 LAURA 1944 ETC. Cluny Brown is beyond obvious touches and is instead a steady succession of impeccable grace notes so clean and pellucidly clear as to rival the perfection of Bunuel's THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOSIE 1972. Charles Boyer as Belinski is not just a quintessentialized version of Boyer's familiar charm and usual persuasiveness he is a standin for Lubitsch himself. When he tells Cluny at the train station to Get in he is the director playacting the most romantically momentous scene of his career. After removing the strain of the drain the first time Jennifer Jones as Cluny Brown feels with a revived intensity that Persian cat feeling coming on. Meow meow. We don't need to understand as we once did with Lubitsch the meaning of the innuendo for pipes when we have before us the sexual soul of this divine creature served up to us hilariously on a silver tray.Hawks had the same comedic gift of exposing the personalities of his actors in the most gloriously charming light.Lubitsch does the same in CLUNY BROWN and the end result brings tears of gratitude to the viewer's eyes.Rating 9 12 out of 10. the missing .5 adds to the charm".

But Cluny is quickly moved into the boring typical role of housemaid in a stuffy English manor and nothing much of interest happens after that. Within days she becomes engaged to the local chemist I found it unbelievable that such a beautiful woman would settle for the unattractive dull chemist as a suitor surely men from miles around of every class! would have been beating a path to Cluny's door!.Good performances from Jennifer Jones although her British accent wasn't very strong and Charles Boyer however.".

The big draw is the cast it is hard to resist a cast that includes Charles Boyer Jennifer Jones Helen Walker Reginald Owen Una O'Connor and Richard Haydn. Am also a fan of Ernst Lubitsch responsible for many great films 'Trouble in Paradise' and 'The Shop Around the Corner' being favourites and with a very distinctive style.Mostly 'Cluny Brown' interesting for being Lubitsch's last completed film works. It is not one of Lubitsch's best by any stretch with uneven stretches but even when Lubitsch was not at his best he fared much better than many directors at their worst and there are directors who could only dream of being on his level at his very finest. 'Cluny Brown' is good fun and charming as well as hardly being a waste of the fine talent in front of and behind the camera.Admittedly the story is disposable there really isn't much of one and it can get silly and muddled in the more eventful parts. Peter Lawford did seem somewhat bland compared to the rest of the cast.While most of the humour is fine that referencing Nazism felt heavyhanded and not particularly tasteful. Compared to the lighthearted tone of the film in general it did jar.However 'Cluny Brown' is beautifully filmed and designed. Lubitsch brings enough of his distinctive directing style and Lubitsch touch expertly. The music is like the film itself lively and elegant. A few stumbles aside 'Cluny Brown' sparkles in the comedy with the satire having bite and punch with enough subtlety in the mix. The romantic element is sweet and charming and the whole film goes at a sprightly pace.A large part of 'Cluny Brown's' appeal is the cast. Charles Boyer is delightful while Jennifer Jones radiates on screen and has a lot of spirit. The support is excellent especially from Reginald Owen and a particularly hilarious Richard Haydn.Overall uneven but a very pleasant and fun film. 710 Bethany Cox".

This is just mildly glossed over while he looks at with loving eyes Miss Jones Cluny who acts almost as she did as the young Miss Dove 9 years later.Richard Haydn 19 years before being the impresario in The Sound of Music comes across like Peter Sellers. I now think that Seller's intonation was based on Haydn. The latter's mother Una O'Connor never speaks but is constantly clearing her throat.

Charles Boyer and Jennifer Jones are two likable lead characters but it is Richard Haydn who steals the comedy limelight. He is one of those characters that are so awful that they become fascinating. Watch how he proudly shows Jones a map of his life with his birthplace and his place of work heavily marked up and the scene where he plays his harmonium with a sudden change of pace that is totally unsuitable for the moment. He also makes speeches in Latin. He is basically funny whenever he is on screen. Jones has funny moments as well  watch how she enthusiastically bashes various pipes with a hammer in the name of plumbing while continuing to make conversation. If there is a downside it is in the character of Andrew Peter Lawford who seems to be unpleasant. Lawford doesn't seem to be able to do comedy. Betty Helen Walker is also unpleasant but she does at least manage to portray a comical character. Mrs Wilson Una O'Connor is just on the wrong side of annoying  she never speaks she just clears her throat and it becomes tiresome. In contrast the supporting characters of housekeeper Mrs Maille Sara Allgood and the butler Syrette Ernest Cossart are very funny in their desire to be nothing but servants.It's a funny film that is worth keeping to watch again.".

Selznick on the set but it's a safe bet they clashed because Selznick could not help interjecting himself where his wife was concerned.Jones is the daughter of English plumber Billy Bevan and the most interesting thing is that in this English setting her nonEnglish speech pattern is perfectly acceptable even against Bevan's cockney accent. Jones was also perfectly acceptable in another English part in Love Letters and certainly got no criticism. The camera always loved Jennifer Jones and in parts like Cluny Brown as the girl next door she lit up the screen.Boyer as often as not played a whole lot of European types not necessarily French.

There should be some class barriers but Boyer breaks them down and Jones is more than agreeable.Lots of agreeable Lubitsch touches and a minimum of Selznick interference make Cluny Brown still a treat after over 60 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was an okay way to spend a cold January afternoon. I wouldn't rate it up there with my favoritesbut it has some redeeming qualities.First it stars a delightful actress Jennifer Jones. She has such a natural beauty and charm to her and her acting seems so genuine. Not to mention she is quite beautiful has stunning eyes and prominent cheekbones. Quite a face. MY main fault of her performance is her British accent doesn't quite work the majority of the time then suddenly reappears briefly.Charles Boyer is the other star. At times his french accent is quite heavy. But as you adjust to it his voice has a very pleasant and melodious tone to it.The film is mainly poking fun at stuffy British aristocracy and their class system. While this is billed as a comedy I never really found it too funny. There are some cute moments. My favorite was Ms. Jones adaptation of a Persian cat. No doubt this drove all the fellas crazy! We've all heard of the Lubitsch touch for the director but I'm not quite sure it was apparent here  as say it was in Shop around the corner. Although there are amusing characters here there's not quite the depth and detail. I also found it move a little slow at times.This ran on TCM Christmas Eve 2008. Robert Osborne said the movie was quite a success in its day and still has quite a cult following although it is not very well known now. With that remark I was surprised there were only 12 comments and some 600 votes on IMDb. It seems quite obscure.There are some good supporting performances here. My favorite was Col. Graham played by C. Aubrey Smith but he appeared only briefly. The snobby and dim witted couple Mr. and Mrs. Carmel played by Reginald Owen and Margaret Bannerman were also amusing to watch. I also think Richard Haydn turned in a superb performance as the chemistpharmacist Mr. Wilson. His voice sounds quite like a cartoon character reminds of Mr. Peabody.".

It seems that the movie bombed both in the US and here on its release in 1946 and in retrospect perhaps that was too close to the recent war for fluffy polished satire PrevertCarne' had similar problems with La Port de la nuit the same year albeit with a fantasy rather than a satire and both titles have now been reassessed. Seen today it's difficult to fault the targets each hit squarely and the idea of two nonconformists winding up together and here at least Lubitsch was on welltrodden ground given that Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn had done the same thing in Philip Barry's Holiday which was released in 1938 the year in which Cluny Brown is set. There's strong support from the cameo by C.

I found however that with no dialog it was tough to watch more than 30 minutes at one time. You might want to break this up into two or three segments.

Music accompanies some of the scenes adding a degree of drama. Two slimy snails are seen touching and fondling each other indicating unmistakably that foreplay has begun and sexual union will follow as the choral music climaxes.  The photographers must have a rare patience to record such intimate and detailed incidents.The film is not without its humorous moments.

Fascinating too was Mr. Spider working at lightning speed as he wrapped in a shroud his most unfortunate victim.I found it even more enjoyable on second viewing.";

Take a meadow in France that appears to consist of nothing but grass and show us what wonders there are to be seen if you lower your eyes and look at the very very small...Insects and arachnids and teensy molluscs offer a possible advantage over say lions in that with insects cinematography really comes into its own. If you want to show a lion catching an antelope then you have to point your camera at a likely spot and wait and wait and wait until the event occurs and when it does chances are that the lighting is at its worst the background is less than ideal and you would have got a better view from somewhere else.  The world of the tiny gives the fellow with the camera much more control much more room to manoeuvre.  It's much easier to hit upon the perfect angle from which to show the spider eating the grasshopper.  I don't know if this is true but it's one possible explanation for why the shots are so gorgeous and why we feel we were given the best possible seats.But if you find yourself asking What the hell was going on?  well you shouldn't have to ask.  You should have been told.  One of the reasons I hope for watching what is after all a documentary is to find out WHAT GOES ON in an ordinary meadow and if the producer thought that a human voice would destroy the sibylline loveliness of it all that's just too bad  filmmaking isn't all pretty pictures.  If you don't want David Attenborough doing the talking although frankly I don't see why you wouldn't then find someone else or some other style of narration or perhaps take more care to arrange the images so that the images themselves tell the story. I'm sure it could have been done.  As it was I got the impression that we were shown ants getting hit by raindrops until they thought we must be tired of ants  and then we were shown something else.I don't want to carp too much.  The makers could well retort that books rather than films are ideally suited to explanation and that they had simply made a film for us to watch AFTER we had read the relevant books.

The film isn't adapted from fiction or drama it's purely based on an original idea.The characters are believable because there aren't any unreal bugs that appear.

The film is meant to come across as 'arty' and could to the right people but certainly not to me as i'm just not interested in watching bugs for hours.The theme of the film is bugs. Its made up of short clips of mainly insects involved in everyday life. These clips are well developed and put together. These clips are shot in appropriate settings. The cinematography is effective and the film makes good use of shadow eg. When the caterpillar was the other side of a leaf you could see the shadow of it's body but when you actually saw it it had spines coming out.The music used in the film is appropriate but isn't to my taste.Camera angles are used effectively they mostly consist of closeups. But different camera angles were used looking up at a bird from and ants point of view made it look imposing.There are no special effects used.The film does contain shots of snails mating which aren't really necessary.Overall i didn't enjoy Microcosmos because i'm not really into nature but if you were the right kind of person you could love this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The word 'insect' in the minds of most people brings about images of destructive diseasecarrying 'bugs' flies maggots cockroaches. But if Microcomos does anything it reminds me that there are hundreds of thousands of constructive insects that are simply beautiful.The directors of this film spent a number of years using microscopic cameras to capture breathtaking images of hundreds of insects in their natural habitat in this case a meadow in France. They select just the right music for a scene in which a pheasant who attacks and ant colony. Two snails seem locked in some time of embrace a ladybug tries to take off but has a little trouble getting off the ground.'Microcosmos' fits the category of a documentary.

But if Microcomos does anything it reminds me that there are hundreds of thousands of constructive insects that are simply beautiful.The directors of this film spent a number of years using microscopic cameras to capture breathtaking images of hundreds of insects in their natural habitat in this case a meadow in France. They select just the right music for a scene in which a pheasant who attacks and ant colony. Two snails seem locked in some time of embrace a ladybug tries to take off but has a little trouble getting off the ground.'Microcosmos' fits the category of a documentary.

The picture is superb as it has to be.There is no plot to the story and it doesn't attempt to encompass all of the miniature world of insects. It simply gives us the viewers a series of brief glimpses into their everyday world.We see ants busily moving a variety of grain into their tunnels. In a different clip we see a colorful bird perhaps a Pheasant busily pecking and eating ants who have no clue as to protection.We see a spider and its web and how it uses the web to wrap up a small grasshopper that happens to jump into captivity.We see a mighty struggle a battle between two large beetles. And in another clip a Dung Beetle working mightily to successfully roll its ball of dung to its burrow.Plus many many more small critters.The image saved for last is an impressive one we see what looks like a giant sea monster rising slowly out of the water and when it is over we realize it is a mosquito emerging from its larval state and then flying away.A wonderful viewing experience for anyone who is at all fascinated by the miniature world around us.".

For another it's got a bit of a structure and it aims for mystery. Also it confines the stupid voiceover to the bookends not that I wouldn't rather that they dispatched it entirely which goes double for the sporadic John Villiamsisms of the soundtrack. While I eventually stopped suspecting CGI I do not doubt that some of it was staged including one of my favourite scenes the dung beetle rolling the dirt ball.

Beautiful shots I can imagine setting the camera for hours waiting for proceeding of an ant and then show all that crusade during several seconds. Maybe it seems that this kind of movie does not need any screenplay but I do not agree with it. When you watch it you find out it made some sense.

No big stars no truly stellar performances but the story line is solid and I was so taken in by it that I'm going to watch it again tonight with someone else who's not yet seen it. Some mesmerizing visuals and scenarios. The lighting is particularly strong creating great ambiance and dramatic effect without drawing too much attention to itself. This movie is about human frailty various emotions and connections about the work we do in order to follow our dreams. It also relates feelings of being small powerless and becoming disconnected because of technology  assessing trust in others and in the systems which dominate our lives searching for 'truth' and authentic experiences...A very unconventional melding of ideas which for me worked on many different layers.Highly worth a trip for any SciFi lover.".

Yeah there are plot points that have been explored before in other movies but seriously who cares? It's how you portray those situations and plot. So I wasn't disappointed there.

It's moody without being cloying it's scary without cheap horror tactics it's thought provoking it delivers twists and turns and it is not predictable. It is hard to classify Cargo as it has many elements and this is what makes it so engrossing. The acting is believable i.e. being in space for a long time leads to quirky behaviour people will do anything for a better life and who can you trust?

	schema:reviewBody "OK Fist of all I was severely impressed by the fact that I could not find an what I thought to be English original Soundtrack.. I was misled by the looks of this movie as to be a lower budget Hollywood offspring.. whoa OK so the Original Soundtrack is German.. interesting! Actually as I learned now it's swizz made.. Well Swizerland is famous for cheese and the main feature of most cheese is.. holes in it! To bad the went with that..First I must say the props and the looks are very very good and I must also say more CGI would not have been necessary for me... but even in the first 20 minutes I start noticing Logic holes that are just not right.. Like The Space station consists of rotating rings the rotation creates artificial gravity but when our main character enters the axis of such a Ring she does not become weightless or anything.. she just walks through there OK Door passed thank you.. Although the Bulk door and the camera zooms in on that to show this nice detail has a sign saying beware of change of gravity or such.. But. Aaaahhh!! Logic! If I make the effort of creating such a nice setup and details as the Rotating station which use was explained back in Stanley Cubricks 2001 Space Oddyssey why don't I stay with it? OR put in a feature that explains why she's not floating around.... and irrational acting of the characters.. Like in the scene where she discovers the Maschinenstrmer Activist who is a stowaway on board.. They Struggle and someone shoots him and the FIRST thing she does is like taking a good look around.. going through the stuff she finds.. not asking herself who just saved her life maybe? the question kind of comes up about 2 Minutes later.. but is never really given much weight Then The oppressive regime that is obviously creating this whole lie about Reha is not monitoring the data streams? hello?? Opressice Regime 101 is what? Like she can upload her what must look like from the perspective of the Regime terrorist message right to the Newsfeed of the Spacestation back close to earth to kick off a riot ? Like she can sharevia what i take as an equivalent of a cellphone very very confidential about what they just found in the Cargo section that they are not at all allowed to pen but hey.. information with her Sister and no one notices this? The Ship has NO movement sensor whatsoever to actually monitor the crew on the ship while only one person is supposed to be on watch? And yea they travel 4 Years to an ass end of Space blow up some communication device.. and no one can actually go there and Fix it just to declare this another failed attempt of the from the oppressive regime POV Terrorists..? There is more of these Logic errors in there Like Message traveling Time It was used at some point in the plot and then totally ignored at another. She notices the response time of her sister is increasing and therefore that they are closing in on reha. She even discusses this with the tech engineer who says it usually takes months but later her Message from Reha back to earth about the truth of Reha is received there almost instantly..... and so on... I must say this really ruined the movie for me. It could have been Great the looks and the feel is super the Story setup is good Nice twist in the story the revealing of the true evil is kind of foreseeable but still good the acting is kind of stiff sometimes but OK... but the logic.. I can't go with that. And the discrepancy between the bad Script writing's missing logic and the rest of the movie is so huge! Like usually crappy scripts also have a crappy looking movie and bad actors.. here. One aspect messes it up for the rest.So sad Axel".

It reminds me of what I had hoped for in event horizon but doesn't take the downward spiral into the realm of hell in space nonsense. Aside from some minor flaws in pacing why do the main characters seem to grow immediately intimate without any real interaction the characters are almost entirely fascinating. I found myself interested in what happened to them rather than the usual well he's going to get offed and no mistake of space thrillers.The other major aspect that I thoroughly approved of is that the characters are all believable. In standard thriller fare from your generic zombie flick to something like Pandorum the antiheroes always seem to be completely irrational. It is very frustrating to try and take a film seriously when characters are constantly betraying others for no other reason than to create drama. In Cargo the characters all act rationally according to their motivations which are revealed as the plot unfolds no spoilers. The drama is refreshingly natural and leads to a very satisfying and thoughtful experience.I also second the praise of the audio work. This film's soundtrack I screened it with the DTS core track is very crisp and positionally accurate and the ominous sounds of the machinery blends together very smoothly with the musical score.I would give it 910 stars if it weren't for some slight awkwardness in dialog and the obvious limitations of cgi overall the visuals were superb but there are some scenes where the animation is evident to an observant eye.".

	schema:headline " What a great film";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I just watched this its been around for 3 years and I am a big Sci Fi fan so not sure how I missed this.Earth is uninhabitable on the whole so people are now living on giant space stations orbiting earth but these are overcrowded and disease and illness is rife. Everyone wants to go and live on Rhea a beautiful planet full of life but there is one problem its expensive !!We follow a female doctor who takes a job on board a cargo ship to earn the money to join her sister on the Utopian planet Rhea. The film starts a bit like Sunshine but on a more simplistic cargo ship the ship is functional but very run down and has technical issues like an old oil rig that can often be seen sailing our seas. As the film progresses it becomes a bit of a murder mystery and you start to think that this is just a standard affair but revelations take place and you are sucked into the entire premise. There is a lot of homage to many Sci Fi films here but this is very much its own film with a good storyline as well as great suspense and mystery as well as a moral outlook. I was expecting something a bit low budget but this looked fantastic on the whole there were a few weak effects towards the end but inside the Cargo ship it looked very realistic and you felt the size of the ship. The acting was on the whole good but nothing ground breaking just simple story telling the lead female Dr draws you in in a vulnerable sort of way but at the same time shows great strength and intelligence. There are other characters on board the ship and they are less fleshed out an the focus is mainly the Dr and the police officer on board the ship. This is not Sci Fi action as such although it does have certain action elements it is well paced and ever revealing so will peak your interest continuously as long as you are not expecting loud bangs and flashy action scenes. I found this to be a Sci Fi film of the highest standard and often I am disappointed by many Sci Fi films. I am not sure what budget it was made on but it sows that with a clear vision you don't have to spend a lot to make a great looking filmTo sum up we have elements of Alien Sunshine Matrix but this is not a copy of any of them.910 for me".

And believe me it is very hard to sympathize with anyone. It is only in the last 10 minutes emotions somewhat become visible. This is not credible at all. I must confess I think the acting andor the direction is lousy.And it is not a problem of the budget. They have a small story and broaden it to almost 2 hours. Boooring!".

	schema:reviewBody "We have here a rather interesting scifi film in the vein of Sunshine Moon or Solaris where most of the action takes place in an isolated enclosed artificial environment. It's in the future Earth has been rendered uninhabitable for some undisclosed reason and people live in squalid conditions on space stations in orbit. There's a new heavenly planet Rhea where people can emigrate to if they can afford it. Our main character a doctor gets hired for a very long 8 years shuttle cargo round trip to resupply a remote space station. With her salary she should be able to rejoin her sister already on Rhea. She like the other crew members is in cryogenic sleep most of the time except for 8month awake shifts. As one can suspect she starts hearing strange noises senses some kind of presence in what should be a deserted ship. She wakes up a few people and then things get worse when somebody gets killed.One would think that this would be a premise for some kind of thriller involving a nasty alien creature. Cargo is not really that. Sure it has good suspenseful moments but it's the kind of slowpaced atmospheric pensive movie where you're more likely to be interested in the unfolding secondary mysteries than on discovering who the killer is or who might be struck next. At least that was the case for me. My mind was going in overdrive trying to figure things out inventing hypotheses and I like that. Unfortunately and I don't know if it's a translation issue from the original German although it's a Swiss film certain important plot elements were not made clear when they should have been. I had to check the Internet afterwards to properly understand a few things. Don't worry we're not talking 2001 metaphysics here far from it. The characters were rather stoic most of the time but at least they were ambiguous and not easily predictable. A particular blossoming romance didn't feel quite right especially how it started. It somewhat hurt the emotional involvement later on although you can see the director really tried for a good payoff. I thought the main actress lacked a certain something but she became more convincing as the film progressed especially in one of her final scenes involving greenery. The special effects were of tremendous quality especially for a nonAmerican film. Every space structure from the outside looked amazing. On the inside it was appropriately dismal sinister and even grandiose sometimes. I think Cargo might disappoint if you're expecting something more actionoriented. I personally enjoyed the story despite certain badly explained plot elements. I also liked it more from an intellectual perspective than from an emotional perspective.Rating 6.5 out of 10 Good".

	schema:reviewBody "First off although I am in possession of a Swiss passport I am in no way inclined to believe that the Swiss have a genetic advantage when it comes to filmaking contrary to what many of my fellow citizens seem to think.Cargo is by no means a terrible piece of work but suffers from problems that should have been apparent when viewing the finished movie. As any other director Mr. Engler appears to have invested a reasonable amount of time crafting a believable beginning a first few scenes creating a backdrop for the viewer in case things would start falling apart. A gigantic space station rendered with respectable detail especially considering the budget of 5 million Swiss francs is shoved in the viewers face within a minute of the film's beginning which is fine because it consists of spinning parts shiny things and a ridiculous number of lights. This is where most humans now reside after we've managed to turn the Earth into something about as habitable as nuclear testing grounds.All humans aboard this station have one goal in common to scrape together enough money to travel to the distant planet of Rhea a place that closely resembles certain pretty parts of Switzerland in Autumn coincidence?. The movie now begins to tell the tale of a small ship on it's way to Rhea. Ultimately in a series of undramatic events we find out that Rhea is actually a simulation and that the destination of the ship is a docking station outside the planet that contains millions of humans in a cryogenic state AND that the ship does not contain building materials but instead people in boxes with pipes attached to them. Whoever does not the see the parallel to the Matrix is kidding themselves because this is more than an inspiration this is almost a blatant remake.The issue not only lies in the premise of the movie which is so overly clichd and as mentioned copied that it brought a tear to my eye but also in the execution. It is obvious that the crew is in a small ship solely because of a low budget. The same goes for the number of actors that can be counted using both hands and one foot. The last half hour of the movie is basically terrible which is to a large part due to the hilarious space suits worn by the actors good luck finding a role as an astronaut in the future think 50's space suit with fur on it but also due to the terrible camera angles showing the actors in their terrible space suits. There is an offcamera sex scene that is as out of place as a racist joke at a funeral and I found it odd that the voice acting of half of the crew members sounded as though it had been dubbed from German to German by another man with more charisma. Then we have the logical holes the size of meteor craters that can only be explained by teleportation or magic. A man gets shot by another man although the man with the gun was captured behind a closed metal door before he shot the other man. Or what about the woman in the furry astronaut suit managing to perfectly hit the suddenly extremely slow moving space ship with her jetpack as its flying past her. By the way this same space ship has a insanely cool ability to become either ten times larger or ten times smaller depending if you're inside the ship or looking at it from the outside. Kind of like those crazy tents they have in Harry Potter. Would have been even more cool if it had been intentional.The biggest problem is that the story never seems to get going and I didn't find it very exhilarating to watch the same woman walk through the same dark corridors more times that I blink my eyes each day. It all just seems a bit pointless and the supposedly epic ending just falls short of being gripping in any way. Whilst I do take my hat off for effort this movie took 9 years to make I'm going to go ahead and make the bold statement that we Swiss should stick to making cheese and chocolate and Hollywood can take care of filmmaking.".

Yeah we're running 2 years behind here  too many kangaroos hopping around. I didn't even notice that it was a foreign movie as it was completely dubbed which I personally hate that's a big understatement until I noticed all those typical Swiss names. Why not release the movie in its original language? Anyway I actually really liked this movie its story its visual effects and most of the cast. I'm just amazed how good this movie turned out considering its limited budget and feel confident that the producer is capable of creating more S.F. greatness  maybe Ivan should have a look at Clarke's RAMA  Cargo is great S.F. really entertaining and also showing how easily we're being fooled by media and technology. I hope Ivan will make more S.F. as he's definitely competing very strongly with 100 million budget movies. I say give Ivan 100m and let him make something that will put Switzerland on the movie map once and forever. Way to go Switzerland  I'm proud of you!".

The figure of Laure is well cast she is convincing her impression remains. The moment she embraces her sister and then looks into the void with her incredible intensity that expresses the inconsistency of her emotions the joy at seeing her sister and the knowledge that everything is just a simulation is one of the emotionally most charged moments of the film. The two craftsmen are a funny pair a hilarious proletarian contrast to their hightech environment. And how they celebrate their party as if they sat at a terrestrial round table of regulars a heartwarming but also surreal oasis in space.

Imaginations were triggered and people came back for more offering their own explanations for anything that appeared to be a gap.With this movie I assume that 99.9 of the budget was spent on the effects.

And it is from Switzerland a country not known for its professional movie industry.I was trying to enjoy it and that was working really well for a while but after about an hour the movie lost me. Especially in the second half there are too many scenes that just drag on and on. I think you could easily cut 30 minutes out and get a more gripping movie. Because quite frankly I was bored by Cargo. Bored to the point that I skipped through the last half hour. The fact that I know when I started skipping tells enough because it means I got so bored I went to see how much longer the movie was going to run.The big plot idea is pretty obvious after the big find they make. And yet the movie goes on another hour.Also I read this in another review the sound is messed up. It is not only noticeable but quite annoying. Too much on the surround speakers not enough on the center.I only give it 5 out of 10 for its many flaws. But go and see for yourself. Maybe you can enjoy it. It is obvious that a lot of work went into this movie and it would be a shame if people don't see it.".

You then find out about his death from mock news reports. Hardly a sordid gratification from a 'perverse' director.The drama is convincing as a documentary by realistic interviews with decent unknown actors playing their roles just right without hyperbole as could quite easily be the case.Without spoiling exact plot points the drama makes a point in how the government may be more interested in finding a suspect and making the evidence fit the profile because it is more politically advantageous then actually running an investigation to find out exactly what happened and draw suspects that way. Considering the current climate where seemingly the Geneva Convention is open to interpretation and restrictions on Habeus Corpus this suggestion is not far fetched in the slightest.It aired on 'More 4' in the UK a channel from Channel 4 television and I'd imagine it would air on an American network at some point or maybe a limited screening at cinemas if the US networks lose their bottle.So for my US brothers and sisters consider what I've written and go SEE it and decide for yourself.

	schema:reviewBody "First off ignore all the hype and crap that been spouted about how this film is making money out of the idea of seeing George W. Bush assassinated. Don't watch this if you want a political film pointing out how much Bush diddid not deserve it. Reading some of the forums and responses from uptight Americans bitching about people daring to comment of American politics in a questioning way just saddens me. What we have here is a well made and thought provoking piece of what might happen in today's society and with public feeling the way it is if President Bush was assassinated.In fact what director Gabriel Range manages to pull off very well in my opinion is actually managing to show as little of the actual event as possible. We get the build up see the footage of the shooting in real time with no irritating slowmotion or multiple angles and just move immediately onto the aftermath.Range questions what political reactions there would be how the media would react how the investigation would move and each time he shows a scenario that is both shocking and depressingly believable. He shows the possibility of Cheney trying to manoeuvre events to allow him to move on Syria only to be forced to back due to lack of any real evidence. He highlights the question of whether the FBI looking for Middle Eastern suspects before white suspects is racism or common sense? How the media immediately jumps on any piece of information and starts presenting it as fact. How any response would be tempered by anger at what had happened and rightly so. Shows an Administration desperate to stick the assassin in the realm of Terrorism to back up their own policies.But the backbone of the film is not to point out any one person or aspect that would effect all of this but how the current atmosphere and the point that the world has brought itself would effect responses to such events. As soon as Bush is declared dead it seems to have been far more important to have done something and found someone to blame and more particularly to blame Terrorism than to take time and care to make sure everything is certain. Zahra Abu Zikri is convicted due to the fact that people wanted him to be guilty more than the flimsy evidence put against him. As his lawyer says The moment they the media said 'Al Qaeda Assassin' he was guilty and forensic experts were forced to work backwards. We say he's guilty find evidence to back us up on this. We're shown a US becoming obsessed that the killer had to be backed by terrorism totally refusing to believe that an American would want to kill their own President.Yes you do always have to be careful about portraying the death of any living person but this film would not have had the same effect if Range had used a fictional President just as much as if he'd make up a fictional country to replace America. The Bush Administration is a vital part in this whole story. I understand why people might get upset but they shouldn't use that as a reason to shout down political discussion.Ultimately this film is what I really wish it had been seen as from the beginning an excellent discussion on a whatif scenario and I happen to believe this style of film is a vital part in discussing global politics. See Peter Watkins The War Game for the best example of this subgenre Unfortunately like Range's past works this film has been hijacked by calls of 'scare mongering'. Should we ignore problems if they we are scared by the outcome? Or just if they make us see a truth we don't want to admit? What you should notice by the end is however much you agree or disagree with the idea or the subject matter the situation at the end of the film is unnervingly believable. That truth and reason are not the two most important things we look for anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death of a President is a truly original and intriguing 'future documentary' about an event that hasn't happened yet. It is a reflection on the events surrounding the October 2007 assassination of George W. Bush in a Chicago hotel.That future time is portrayed with an escalation of the antiwar fervor and a growing concern over the dangers posed by North Korea.The film flips between staged scenes real footage  documentary style interviews. It does a fine job of seamlessly blending those pieces to create a very plausible precreation.It is interesting watching this film on October 9th 2006... a day which began with news of North Korea's first nuclear test. The first twenty minutes of the film are dotted with mentions of that scenario.There are some chilling scenes in this film... especially early on when you get a real sense of the protesters being contained and beaten down by Chicago police in full riot gear.After a political speech in the hotel the President is ushered down a standard meetandgreet ropeline. It is at this point that the film lives up to its name. Shots are fired and one of the most frenzied scenes of any film this year ensues. Bush is thrown into a waiting limo which speeds off to the nearest hospital. The crowd at the rope line is panicked beyond recognition. The FBI launches into gear. The media machine revs its engines. And the Chicago skyline lights the night air as an eerie sense of historyinthemaking takes hold.Later that night newscasters announce the death of George W. Bush and the film transposes into an FBI procedural... A virtual whodunit for us viewers. It feels very much like a David Mamet plot crossed with an Oliver Stone concept. It truly is a wonderfully imaginative idea played out with great skill and cinematic artistry.OK  The secondary question in reviewing this film is this... Is it wrong? Is it morally questionable to have such a premise be the focal point of a film? Is it in bad taste?Well I have always been one to follow Roger Ebert's mandate that It is not always what a film is about but how it is about it. I try not to pass judgment on the subject but on the skill of the film itself.However this is a very brazen subject. Even for a Bushhating liberal like me this approaches the line if indeed it doesn't cross it. It comes dangerously close to going too far.That being said I think it stops short of that line and delivers a legitimate scenario that merits people's attention. I believe this film earns the right to touch on this subject. It is a quality film and should not be thought of as a sensationalistic attempt to shock audiences.Back to the plot... The film analyzes the hunt for suspects and forensic evidence. It follows the investigation all the way to a murder trial. I will not detail the story any further.What this film does brilliantly is to shade the discussion toward issues like the Patriot Act Homeland Security futility the right to privacy the right to a fair trial and the apathy of the American public to seek truth and justice. It hints at Governmental manipulation a wag the dog mentality. It tells personal stories of civilians and soldiers and suspects and Presidential aides. This film has a tremendously broad scope considering the budget.Death of a President meanders patiently toward a conclusion you will probably not expect. This is a very thoughtful film that wants us to think carefully about the consequences of future terrorism. It asks us to contemplate the futility of such a crime and the repercussions it would have on future generations. In fact it very much condemns this scenario as the worst thing that could happen.I was riveted by this film. It is not just a scream for attention with a daring title. It has something very important to say and it says it very eloquently. That it dramatizes the assassination of a sitting President only adds to the palpable tension and urgency of its message. I think that Death of a President is one of the best and most important films of 2006. Go out of your way to see it as soon as you can! Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This film Death of a President had been labeled controversial long before the product hit U.S. shores. British director and cowriter Gabriel Range first introduced his film on U.K. television and later at the Toronto International Film Festival where it won the International Critic's prize. This film has been given limited release in U.S. This docudrama opens with preparation for a presidential visit and speech at a Chicago hotel. You get a glimpse of the president's speech writer and an individual heading the Secret Service as they position themselves and prepare to protect the Commander in Chief. You get brief looks at large groups of protesters waiting in the streets to welcome the President. And just like the title says  the President dies. All that happens in the first 20minutes. The remaining 70minutes of this film carefully details the hunt and investigation to find the killer. The impact on two minority families who may or may not be associated with the event. You see how an ethnic group becomes suspect and how hundreds are picked up for questioning. You get a peek at how the world receives the event and how the current phrases terror attack and AlQuida are tossed into the mix.The film is frightening because each and every scene is plausible. It's tightly written directed and edited. The actors who range from a close assistant to the President and First Lady to a spouse who may never see their innocent partner again are all excellently cast.Contrary to popular belief Death of a President does not advocate the killing of a leader instead it takes a credible look at America and the possible events following such an occurrence.Trust me  this one you don't want to miss.".

You get brief looks at large groups of protesters waiting in the streets to welcome the President. And just like the title says  the President dies. All that happens in the first 20minutes. The remaining 70minutes of this film carefully details the hunt and investigation to find the killer. The impact on two minority families who may or may not be associated with the event. You see how an ethnic group becomes suspect and how hundreds are picked up for questioning. You get a peek at how the world receives the event and how the current phrases terror attack and AlQuida are tossed into the mix.The film is frightening because each and every scene is plausible. It's tightly written directed and edited. The actors who range from a close assistant to the President and First Lady to a spouse who may never see their innocent partner again are all excellently cast.Contrary to popular belief Death of a President does not advocate the killing of a leader instead it takes a credible look at America and the possible events following such an occurrence.Trust me  this one you don't want to miss.";

	schema:headline " A Very Good Movie  And It Is Not AntiBush or AntiAmerican";
	schema:reviewBody "Death Of A President is an excellent film and is in no way antiAmerican or AntiGeorge Bush. It has great cinematography an interesting and very plausible story line and exceptional performances. Whether you're left right center or none of the above this is a a very good film for the thinking moviegoer. The controversy of course stems from the use of the current U.S. President as the victim of an assassination. The assassination scene itself flies by and can't be more than 23 seconds long so fast in fact you can be forgiven if you miss it altogether. It's what precedes and follows that scene that is the meat of the movie. Film footage of Bush and other real political figures is spliced seamlessly into this film and includes footage of VicePresident Cheney and Mayor Daley of Chicago. None of these real persons are in any way abused or mischaracterized in the film. And the portrayal of fictional FBI agents Chicago Police officers and White House and Secret Service officials is if anything mostly very complimentary to them. This film does not do a hatchet job on anyone What the use of real characters in a fictitious scenario allows the filmmakers to do is to let the moviegoer realize that real actions have real consequences. And by putting real persons into a totally fictitious plot the filmmakers can develop an accurate scenario  something that still can't be done with the Kennedy assassination of more that 40 years ago. We can't present an accurate portrayal of that real event even now because of the doubts cast on the whole event by the actions of our own government. The USG botched the assassination investigation so badly with its lies of omission and commission that we will probably never know that whole truth about what happened that day in 1963. With the fictional scenario of Death of a President though we know exactly how things play out.Whether you are a President an assassin an FBI agent or just a moviegoer realizing that actions have consequences  often unforeseen consequences of course  is something we all need to be reminded of from time to time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am no fan of George W. Bush but when I heard about this film I wondered if its central hypothesis would come across as exploitative and unnecessary or if the assassination would serve the narrative and illuminate some greater theme. It is quite provocative obviously to make a movie such as this. The question for me walking into the theatre was Is killing Bush in this movie necessary? I do have to say that the filmmakers handled this project with sensitivity and an obviously deep and intelligent understanding of the American political climate.The film succeeds on a number of levels  first it gives the audience a bird's eye view of an event for which the public would normally have few if any visuals.Second Bush is portrayed positively in this  we see him at his most human and likable when delivering what was a real speech in Chicago. Bush is clearly not the buffoon many make him out to be he's an expert at playing against type. The image of Bush we see before the assassination is quite positive. Therefore the murder is indeed tragic.The filmmakers wisely sidestep what would be typical and uninteresting coverage of a country in mourning and instead focus on the criminal investigation. We see how the FBI and other forces would be under extreme pressure to make an arrest. Their investigation leads them to an employee of Syrian descent who works in the building beside the hotel outside which Bush was shot. They delve into this man's past and find out he spent time in Afghanistan and may have had links to terrorists  despite the almost complete lack of forensic evidence the rush to judgment is complete.We know that if this scenario were to play out this is exactly how it would happen. The man would be convicted in the public's eyes  and his incarceration would serve the U.S. administration's political goals. When Dick Cheney is sworn in as President his first response is to pressure the FBI to find a link between the assassination and Syria's government. Echoes of Cheney looking to capitalize on another national tragedy 911 in order to fulfil a political and economic goal depose Saddam Hussein are clear.Without giving too much away the film brilliantly implies that the real culprit in the assassination was a Desert Storm veteran who lost a son in the current Iraq war driven by hatred to kill the President.Was it necessary to kill Bush in this film? Perhaps the metaphor of killing the monster by slicing off its head only to see it grow back another even worse is appropriate here. The film seems to be saying that Bush has created a legacy where a national tragedy can be used to justify criminal acts and wars with no connection to the original events  that the truth will always be buried if it doesn't complement the political and ideological goals of the powers that be.In the end while the real assassin's identity is implied it's never entirely clear who did it. An appropriate ending as we the public typically are forced to live with confusion and misinformation over the events that shape our countries and our lives never knowing for sure what really happened only what our governments have told us to believe.".

It is really quite strange being entirely like a real documentary but with acted interviews. The integration of real archive footage of Bush and Cheney with digitally manipulated images of the pair to create various moments in a false present is eerie. Cheney even gives a funeral oration for Bush at one point. Overall the film seemed a bit too long but if nothing else makes one worry about Cheney as president! It also serves to make one realise how much is possible with digital manipulation of images. It is realistic. Not a great movie but an interesting one.For this particular European who has visited most of the US States at one time or another and who has many American friends the film was another reminder of how worrying the United States has become. Still a great nation but hard to think of it as Leader of the Free World now that it allows cruel and degrading treatment of enemy suspects and indefinite imprisonment without a fair trial. Perhaps US viewers will find this movie in bad taste but they should find some of the policies and actions of their current government a lot more distasteful.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very skeptical before seeing this movie. Title and premise of Death of a President led me and probably others to expect either a shallow Bushbashing hackjob or some sort of bizarre 24like we against the evildoers heroepic in a cheap documentary costume.I'm happy to report I was wrong. Death of a President is a very well written performed and directed drama in the style of a modern and hardly opinionated documentary. And most surprisingly it isn't really a movie about George W Bush. It was a very smart move to make it a mock documentary since it keeps the viewer on a skeptical distance to all the protagonists so the movie doesn't push the audience into immediately placing the characters into the good and bad categories like it would be the case with a drama done in a conventional narrative. That gives room to examine the characters different motives and actions without having to rely on pressing the emotionbuttons too much. Of course this approach relies on convincing performances from all actors involved mabybe even more so than with a conventional drama to keep the illusion alive of actually watching a documentary.... overacting could have been a disaster for this movie and i'm very glad cast and director avoided that pitfall. Fine performances all around.Now to the obvious elephant in the room and the reason why this movie is so controversial Why did the makers of the movie not just have a fictional president killed? Shock value? Some kind of perverse joy in getting rid of the real President? I don't think so.First of all having the real President Bush in the movie obviously makes this theoretical exercise just more authentic and convincing. And more importantly the viewer is forced to place himself somewhere among the characters to place his sympathy and antipathy bets just based on preconceived notions so to speak. I doubt there are many people who don't have a clear opinion about George W Bush and his administration I certainly have mine. And in the interest of full disclosure I'm no fan to say the least. But that opinion whatever it is is important for the movie to get it's point across it's the setup to play effectively with the viewers prejudices. Death of a President manages to make you look beyond the stereotypes and makes a solid point about the misleading force of preconceived notions for the viewer as well as the characters in the movie. The tag line Do not rush to judge is well chosen. The movie in particular makes a valid point about the worrying tendency in the US and the world in general I cant think of any society that's not to some degree affected by this disease of more and more dumbing everything down to us versus them.Be it the inflation of the word Terrorist as a magic opinion maker and drifting away from the movie for a second be it Republicans versus Democrats be it the insane shouting matches that pass as talk shows these days or be it the bizarre notion of an inevitable clash of the civilizations.The movie isn't perfect though. For example the character of Bushs speech writer was a bit over the top in her praise for the man while the protesting crowds remained rather stereotypical. Also some doctored shots didn't quite live up to the otherwise impressive technical level of this production.Yet Death of a Presindent offers a bit of much needed perspective on the Terrorismissue it sure does it by rather drastic means but it doesn't fail to deliver. Of course for me as a distant observer of the USA the fact that the actual President gets assasinated in this movie doesn't have quite the emotional punch as it must have for Americans. So I can understand the very mixed reactions it gets from reviewers.But if you feel up to it go see it yourself and then make up your mind instead of rushing to judgment based on title and plot outline.".

It is neither negative towards Bush or his standpoints. It in fact shows him to be in a very positive light whilst showing the anger and frustration of others at his actions towards Iraq and conflict in general.In all Death of a President was a very entertaining mockumentary and deserves to be seen. It does not incite violence nor does it glorify war or Bush it is more or less just a simple look at what would happen IF this were to really happen.".

With bag checks and guys with night vision scanning the audience for the entire screening looking for pirates argh! it felt like I was seeing the Prez himself.Gabriel Range's mockumentary that is set 3 years after the assassination of President George Bush. This televisionstyle mockumentary delves into interviews with suspects and those whom were responsible with protecting and then those who were in charge of finding the assassin and anyone else who was responsible. The way the film was laid out was that the identity of the assassin is unknown until everything else suspect was eliminated. All in all a who dunnit? tale told by those involved in it.Controversy and hype aside as a mockumentary from the future it was very well done and convincing with great use of archival footage and staged scenes. However if this were an actual documentary my interest in the topic would've been different and more interested because I would've had a good 3 years of nonstop media coverage and countless discussions and opinions about the event not to mention how such a thing not only affects everyone around the globe but personally as well. For example if I were to watch a fictional film about 911 before that horrid and devastating event I wouldn't have the same reaction or emotional responses as if it were a documentary after that event.Range's approach to fictional storytelling is fascinating indeed but lacks that personal touch to myself as a viewer. All in all if released worldwide this film will probably garner much hype but it'll end up having no real bite to it.".

Beyond all the obvious up to this point nothing is to be taken for granted otherwise about Death. It is a stunning work literally. It will leave you dazed floored stupefied. That is if you see it... but you won't.To begin with it's neither a mockumentary nor a fictional documentary nor documented fiction... I just don't know what to call it. But is is GOOD if you drag yourself into the theater you will be grabbed buffeted your anticipation and secondguessing will turn out to be all wrong. The opening narrative right off the bat seems obvious but will gain a totally different meaning when it's repeated at the end. Exciting as the recreation of the foul deed may be Death is really more about the capturing trial and conviction of the suspected assassin who may or may not be the killer. Not that the 44th President Dick Cheney cares about that. But you may. While incredible as it may seem you being to feel somewhat nostalgic about No. 43.British journalist and filmmaker The Menendez Murders The Day Britain Stopped Range is brilliant. Overlapping documentary and fictional footage blend flawlessly. Bush Cheney many others play themselves are themselves. The interviews with actors playing Secret Service agents government officials etc. are totally believable  in fact they may fool you for a while even a long while.Range's work has little to do with what may appear to be an obvious twin Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911 except for dealing with the same national shame of fear and fearmongering. Moore tried to fill in the gaps left in what is known and what is claimed. Death of the President projects our sorry time into the world of Patriot Act III. Range is clear about the certainty of being denounced sight unseen I have always known that I would be condemned for the very idea of this film he has said but I believe that sometimes it is not only acceptable for art to be outrageous  it is necessary.We live in a time of incredible fear... The advance condemnation of this film by politicians and pundits who have not seen  and may never see  this film reflects the landscape of fear in which we live today and which my film attempts to address.".

I am pretty sure that this is not the first movie that deals with the fictional assassination or assassination attempt on a sitting political leader movies such as Gandhi Malcolm X JFK The Package and the original Day of the Jackal touched upon this topic to various degrees.This is however the first film with such a single minded focus on the death of a sitting leader of a country. In this movie that leader is George W. Bush the President of the United States and the assassination in question is his very own.Unfortunately people will probably stay away from this movie imagining some cruel and insulting vengeance wetdream see Bush get shot payback time etc. They couldn't be more mistaken at such a notion.This movie was a surprisingly well crafted executed and acted what if scenario. The director smartly might I add chose to forgo the regular route of a feature film rather he decided on presenting it as a documentary style picture i.e. a kind of serious and stark mockumentary. There is indeed nothing funny about the movie quite the contrary it is touching sad and tragic.The camera work and cinematography were outstanding masterfully conveying the atmosphere and feel of the movie. The acting was good and only added to the ominous sentiment that builds as one watches the picture and the action unfolding leading to its heartbreaking conclusion. The movie's spartan atmosphere and environment works well with its somber themes also the combination of real footage is incorporated in a seamless manner.The director has repeatedly said in interviews that several critics praising the picture have mentioned that the movie distorts reality to uncover a greater truth. I agree with that statement after having seen it.The director did his best not to take sides as much as one can overcome hisher own bias and beliefs. The film does not revel in its subject matter it does not celebrate the fictitious death of George W. Bush nor does it propose or encourage that such action as depicted in the movie should be undertaken.Quite to the contrary the movie goes out of its way to present the story from multiple points of view with characters that cover a range of opinions feelings ideas beliefs and so on.This film asks some pointed and poignant questions as to why would such an event take place what would drive someone to get to the point of going through with such an ultimate act. What could create the conditions for such an assassination to take place.Death of a President is NOT about revenge or some gleeful fantasy or some nihilistic notions of doom and gloom. The movie does NOT at any point infer that George W. Bush deserves such a fate as depicted in the movie. It looks at how one of the most controversial leaders in recent times affects the world around him and even more directly the very citizens he represents. It analyzes how his rhetoric ideas and actions weigh upon the international stage and the possible repercussions reactions and consequences that might be the end result of all those factors.The movie is hardly perfect though I am not going to spend time debating what works and what doesn't in this commentary. I think that it is up to each individual to make up his or her own mind as to what the value of this movie is its importance as well as its artistic merits.In such times as we live in today it is more important than ever to question probe prod and analyze the status quo. It does not smack of treason or gross indecency or any other morally infused controversy to ask questions of our leaders to hold them responsible for their actions policies ideas and any other factors that make up their leadership.After all George Walker Bush as all Presidents before him has ONE boss that is above him that is THE American PEOPLE all 300 million of them not only those that agree with him and voted for him.Take that for whatever you think it is worth see this movie and decide for yourself what its relevance is don't let others do that for you your voice and opinion is just as important!".

The acting could be compared to SAW I and if you never got a chance to see SAW I then don't rent that either.Then there was the way the protesting Americans were portrayed. They were holding up signs with pleas of peace and chanting for peace in Iraq while violently attacking the police to penetrate the barricades to Bush's limousine. Close ups of protesters showed people with blue hair or a shaved head all young angry and willing to commit violence.News to ya Mr. Range not all Bush haters and this includes me and well all people I know commit violence to express our displeasure with him and his ideals. In fact a great deal of us find very peaceful ways to deal with him like voting in primaries or peaceful political activism. Despite your obvious judgment on American's based on one thing you might have seen in the past I am not going to assume that all British are as ignorant as you Mr. Range.The movie was biased... it was not informative if you are going to do a fictional drama doing it in a documentary format is never a good way to go. Documentaries are meant to be an informative medium. No one will EVER successfully make a fictional drama in an informative media like the documentary. Can't be done. You can't INFORM on something that is dramatic fiction.".

Which isn't to say the film was entirely without merit. There was appropriate comment from some of the mock interviewees and placards in the crowds during the demonstration but it all seemed to be merely well observed window dressing without ever really getting stuck in to the substance. A great shame that such an apparently good and well timed idea should get lost in what seemed to be more a throwaway modern spin on the Kennedy assassination than to actually have the guts to deal with modern issues. Ultimately the word that sums up the whole thing is 'diappointing' and the filmmakers should really kick themselves for missing such an obvious opportunity to make a much more interesting and thought provoking film than the open goal that this is as this has received more attention than it deserves for an idea that it doesn't really address. Watch JFK instead if you want a quality assassination thriller. If you want satire watch Bob Roberts watch Wag the Dog.

Bush on October 19 2007 and the subsequent manhunt for his killer. Constructed from archive footage of Bush's fateful trip to Chicago and countless talking head interviews this tale of Bush's demise and the wrongful conviction of SyrianAmerican Jamal Abu Zikri doesn't shed any light on Zikri's kangaroo trial and the real guilt of Al Claybon. This material was handled better in Michael Moore's UNDISCLOSED PRESIDENT about President Cheney's rise to power and the passing of Patriot 3. Thankfully filmmaker Gabriel Range leaves out Jeane Dixon's daughter who seems to be making a living recalling her dubious prediction of President Bush's death.In all seriousness Gabriel Range's mockumentary was produced for the BBC but feels much more like an AE special. All of the conventions of a television documentary are followed to the letter. Range does a skillful job using preexisting footage as archive. The line between fact and fiction are blurred rather well though some flaws risk jettisoning viewers from the conceit. These include some poor computergenerated additions of Bush's faux speech writer into background shots and a horrible audiovisual edit of Dick Cheney eulogizing George W. Bush rather than Ronald Reagan. If there was ever a moment perfect for a cutaway to hide an awkward mouth match that was it.Utilizing a cast that could very well have been on any one of tonight's ten repeats of the various Law  Order franchise shows Range does a fair job using generic actors though forensic expert James Pearn did too good of a job as I recognized him immediately. Missing from the proceedings along with the aforementioned requisite psychic scene are the shots celebrating Bush's death in whatever axis of evil country needs demonizing the most at the moment. Even more than convicting Zikri we also should have had an immediate response that the shooter was a suspected Al Quaeda terrorist even before anyone was in custody recalling the Oklahoma City bomber reported to be an Arab well before Timothy McVeigh was apprehended. There are other shadings that could have boosted the film's verisimilitude to make DEATH OF A PRESIDENT a more polished film. As it is the film works as a cinematic experiment and an act of wish fulfillment though is a President Cheney and better than a President Bush?".

What makes it gripping and somewhat eerie is the subject matter  the assassination of a current president  and the emotional distance that the director creates through the use of a documentary style. The viewer is looking back matter of factly at a future event from a vantage point even further in the future. The first half of the movie is told entirely except for the opening interview which foreshadows the later turn that the film will take from the points of view of those close to President George W. Bush and from bodyguards and law enforcement people responsible for protecting him during a speech that he is delivering in Chicago. AntiBush and antiwar activists have attained a permit to demonstrate along his route from the airport. As people are interviewed about their recollections of the assassination day the film cuts from them to newsreel and other footage of the events they are describing. What makes this film particularly uncanny is the verisimilitude of the scenes  especially of the demonstrations of Bush's activities and speech and of Cheney's memorial speech during Bush's funeral. The filmmakers have apparently used actual footage from antiwar demonstrations and have cleverly interwoven real speeches by Bush and Cheney.The interviewees exhibit a great respect and often a deep caring for President Bush. The first half of the film gives little indication of where it is heading which helps mount the suspense.The second half of the film gradually and subtly turns to its chilling point of view  first by interjecting interviews with some of those rounded up and held suspect after the assassination. The ending is even more scary because it seems such a deadon logical progression of what has already occurred since 911.".

As a stranger visits him in the station the truth that unfolds then seems stranger than fiction.6. Twinkle Twinkle Little StarSix brave children misusing their school picnic freedom hike in a forest and arrive at a haunted house where they meet an old lady who lives alone without fear. As they get friendly with each other she challenges to scare them by narrating six frightening stories. While she stops after the fifth the bravest kid asks her Where is the sixth one Dadi Ma?. He will be told.It would take too long to review each story. Therefore I'd like to put it in a brief way. Each story has its own theme and its own shock value though a few similarities can be felt between The Couple and The Director in both one tries to fool another with a scare and also between The Director and Ma the car dark road rain. Nevertheless the rest are unique among them.Life is Risky devastates a common man's sense of selfsecurity. It jolts but doesn't scare. Rajpal Yadav is greaaaatttt as the Insurance man. Sunil and Sonali just fit in the role. The Director is beautifully made. When Mallika narrates her story in dark it somehow reminded me of the song Ye Sard from RGV's Bhoot. I expected more but unfortunately it ended too soon and made me feel Is that all?. Anil Kapoor and Mallika have done whats necessary. Nothing more. The Couple is slow sensuous playful scary and predictable. You just cant forget that smile! Makrand shines in his role. Arjun and Bipasha have done a good job. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star is the movie's central story. Ava Mukherji is in one word scary! The children have dutifully performed as they have been instructed.Now the three best episodes. Ma... is a brilliant tale. Randeep is wow! Zakir is unbelievably superb. Rasika excels in her role. Are you going to Poona? In car? In the night? In rain? Beware! Boo... is the Prologue. Manoj Pahwa. Man! What a carelessly cool actor! His mother is a good diversion. She has done well too. Sorry. I wont say anything more than this.Of all the seven stories The Professor steals the show. Amitabh! The icon of Bollywood gives one more earth shattering performance! How many more styles does he have! This episode stops you shocks you and gives you shivers cos you don't know whats in it and whats gonna come next. Ritesh has rendered a befitting performance. He seems more scared of Amitabh's acting skills than the scenario he is in. Cos the old man rules!This movie on the whole has more fear and shock value than Darna Mana Hai although I should accept that except for The Professor DMH had much better story plots. In my opinion the most shocking of all the 14 stories in both DMH and DZH is The Professor and the scariest of all is The Teacher from Darna Mana Hai. Overall DMH didn't scare as much as DZH but it made us squirm and feel creepy cos of the reality which the stories reflected. It left a long lasting impression in us. On the other hand the shocks that DZH has in store will hit you hard and cruel with sudden force only when you naively think that its time to relax. Thats merciless! It shocks you. It keeps you excited. It makes you giggle with fear. And its fun. Its a different experience on the whole. Feel sorry for yourself if you miss this great movie. And feel more sorry while watching it...Hey! Look who is behind you!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first movie Darna Mana Hain was not really brilliant as far as implementation was concerned but scored top marks on attempt for being such a different concept in Indian cinema. Clearly inspired from tales from the crypt though.Hence I went in to this movie expecting that the great churner of horror films Mr. Ram Gopal Verma may have learned from his earlier mistakes and definitely offer a much better film this time.Sadly this movie if anything was worse than the earlier one.Basically this movie is divided in six different segments made by six different filmmakers.It started of very well though in fact i would say exceptionally well in a segment directed and conceived by comedian Sajid Khan clearly if there was a filmfare for best opening sequence in a film this would get it. The idea was creative and it properly mixed the element of horror and some humour even poked some fun at the first film. And set the expectations for a great film in fact the brilliant start made the future disaster all the more unbearable.The other segment that deserves mention is the one with ranjeet hooda that is not exactly that scary but scores on humour yes humour and more like thriller besides the opening segment this was the most impressive with some genuine creativity and convincing acting.The only other segment that deserves mention is the one with Anil Kapoor and Mallika which again scored on humour and though predictable was convincing mainly due to the acting of the lead actors. Mallika is definitely maturing as an actress and showing her talent in the limited roles she receives.The other segments including the one made by Ramu himself were shoddy unoriginal uncreative and utterly disgusting. The less that can be said about them the better Ramu did clutter them with some big stars but the story is the greatest star in such films and no amount of acting talent can even salvage a bit entertainment from the wreck.Special mention the for the Segment involving Rajpal Yadav and Suniel shetty which will go down in Hindi film industry as probably the most uninspiring scenes in an Alist movie ever. This segment alone had the potential to destroy this entire film. Rajpal yadav has now finally beaten Johny Lever and the uncrowned king of annoyance and i hope we are spared watching a similar role from him in the future.Even though 3 of the segments deserved mention only one had any entertainment value and even that didn't score very high on the horror front.This movie in fact is almost incapable of being listed in the horror category thriller maybedue the absolute lack if horror in it.No marks can be given for attempt as this is the second attempt.Please avoid this movie at all costs the filmmakers haven't learned from their mistakes and neither did I learn from minewatching the first one.Please learn from mine and watch a rerun of bhooth instead. When it comes on TV do watch the beginning though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Darna Zaroori Hai is one of the few Indian Movies that are made in this genre that is horrorand considering that alone I think we all ought to give it some credit for this venture. ProdDir Ram Gopal Verma proves once again that he can not only pick up unusual stories but also portray them well. Based on the same format as its predecessor Darna Mana Hai Darna Zaroori Hai Has got six storiesone in the beginning not related to the plot and five others which an old hag narrates to five unlucky children which are caught inside the woman's mansion due to heavy rain and storm. And then there's one main story that of the old woman and the five kids which binds the movie together. All the stories have there own charm. Some are good others are even better. Apart from sticking to the creepy theme they portray their individual meaning. There have been several improvements in the sequel technically as well. The film has been shot most beautifully the direction being pretty good. The special effects put now and then into the scenes are also surprisingly slick for an Indian film and completely enhance the ghostly setting. There is also quite a huge star cast in the film with most actors acting very well. The Audio effects remain typical for a horror flick and help you immerse deeper into the feel of the movie.All good said I would want to add that although Darna Zaroori hai is still a stunning accomplishment with what it does do there are many finer points in the film that remain half baked deteriorating what could have been a most thrilling horror film. The main story has no depth and is absolutely typical in its very root. The short stories are all good but in one or two cases you may have wanted the ending to be more climactic then what happens eventually even though the setting for the climax has in all cases been done most proficiently. The pace is quite astonishingly managed in the first half of the film but begins to twitch severely in the latter half. All this leaves you thinking that if only this could have happened like this it would have been perfect.In the end let may say it comparatively that although not as polished as Ram Gopal's excellent horror thriller Bhoot Darna Zaroori hai still makes on my goodmovie list. It is definitely better then its prequel. I give it a 610 Good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film Factory deterioratesPicture this  there was this small time thela who used to sell pavbhaji's and its taste was second to none. Due to popularity business expanded and now its an restaurant. You still go there but sadly the taste is clearly missing. That's the analogy of RGV and Film Factory.The prequel 6segment Darna Zaroori Hain was an unexplored area no filmmaker dared to risk which should be lauded. Not exceptionally well but it had its moments. Darna Zaroori Hain takes one level up  six different directors one for each segment Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez can do we should we be left behind?. Well intended thought  however the result falls flat.Segment One Manoj Pahwa's shouts and overacts. Clearly the segment director is a rookie. Probably the most irritating segment. And why reference to Darna Mana Hain?Segment Two THE most anticipated for obvious reasons. Clearly Ramu is not committed. and.... he doesn't care! Big B is wasted. At the bare minimum a better plot could have been chosen. Segment Three Proper utilisation of resources  Arjun Rampal Makrand  Bipasha. Well executed but bears resemblance a segment from the prequel.Segment Four The insurance agent segment is the number one from bottom though. The talent of all the actors are washed down the drain. For starter  the basic premise is flawedSegment Five The Anil Kapoor and Mallika segment is done well  though gives away the suspense in between. Nevertheless it is good. And Karan Johar Aditya Chopra leaves a bad taste. Segment Six Cleverly the pudding is saved for the last. The best of all the segments and whoever the director is  had spent sleepless nights brainstorming over the plot and its execution. Its does carry RGV style. Randeep Hooda and Zakir Hussain are simply superb. Watch out for the scene where Zakir Hussain imitates the killer  awesome. The last segment which binds all the stories together is similar to the prequel except that its replaced with kids. The kids surely must be watching a lot of horror TV shows movies  for their act very well.

	onyx:emotionText "Film Factory deterioratesPicture this  there was this small time thela who used to sell pavbhaji's and its taste was second to none. Due to popularity business expanded and now its an restaurant. You still go there but sadly the taste is clearly missing. That's the analogy of RGV and Film Factory.The prequel 6segment Darna Zaroori Hain was an unexplored area no filmmaker dared to risk which should be lauded. Not exceptionally well but it had its moments. Darna Zaroori Hain takes one level up  six different directors one for each segment Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez can do we should we be left behind?. Well intended thought  however the result falls flat.Segment One Manoj Pahwa's shouts and overacts. Clearly the segment director is a rookie. Probably the most irritating segment. And why reference to Darna Mana Hain?Segment Two THE most anticipated for obvious reasons. Clearly Ramu is not committed. and.... he doesn't care! Big B is wasted. At the bare minimum a better plot could have been chosen. Segment Three Proper utilisation of resources  Arjun Rampal Makrand  Bipasha. Well executed but bears resemblance a segment from the prequel.Segment Four The insurance agent segment is the number one from bottom though. The talent of all the actors are washed down the drain. For starter  the basic premise is flawedSegment Five The Anil Kapoor and Mallika segment is done well  though gives away the suspense in between. Nevertheless it is good. And Karan Johar Aditya Chopra leaves a bad taste. Segment Six Cleverly the pudding is saved for the last. The best of all the segments and whoever the director is  had spent sleepless nights brainstorming over the plot and its execution. Its does carry RGV style. Randeep Hooda and Zakir Hussain are simply superb. Watch out for the scene where Zakir Hussain imitates the killer  awesome. The last segment which binds all the stories together is similar to the prequel except that its replaced with kids. The kids surely must be watching a lot of horror TV shows movies  for their act very well. And all the granny's are not goodygoody beware Little Red Riding Hood.The segment directors have not done workshops together. There is loss of continuity between the segments clearly the common vision is missing which wasn't the case in the prequel owing to a single director.

I think Ram Gopal Verma is following the footsteps of Ramsay Brothers but his horror flicks are subdued and still thrilling. You just cant predict what when and how something will happen.

The theme is the same as before so one can easily come to a conclusion how it will end even before getting the ticket to the film So no complaint the way it ended. If Manoj Pahwa's was brilliant in portraying horror Amithab's episode touched the peak with the backgroundscore if Arjun Rampal's was do with beautiful horror then Rajpal yadav's was to do with fear if Anil Kapoor's was to do with bluffing then Randeep Hooda's was on revenge. So we had all the flavors of POSSIBLE horror in the film with excellent performance from all most all the people in the lead. The Maturity of each actors helps the film to reach at least halfway where it was heading. Did it deliver that good at the right content well that of course depends on how much you were horrified. After the film i started counting at how many instance i felt a ShockTremorHorror. When i finished counting it wasn't even two digit number but it wasn't zero either. The film does at least triggers a small shake in your body for me it was with the episode with Amithab Bachan the others where tilted towards the comic side but the lesson in those stories to learn was don't play too much with others when you don't know how much they can handle. As far this film goes except few scenes you can handle most of them. You cant expect every frame with blood on it to say its a horror film this film will horrify you provided you see the film without expecting when will you be horrified meaning concentrate on the drink and popcorn rather on the story and at the end count the popcorn on the floor that's the number of time you where horrified.".

From underworld mafia gangwars to 'rangeela' musicals he has proved himself to be the demigod of experimental cinema. The Indian cinema seems to on an upswing and the golden era is not too far as our optimism grows with a row of hits and different films like 'Zinda' 'Rang De Basanti' 'Gangster' or even the film that boasts of a rustic comic streak 'Malamaal Weekly'. In the light of being uncommonly charitable to most of the recent Indian films what do we think of 'Darna Zaroori Hai'?

An ensemble of quite predictable seven short stories the film proves to short circuit right after the first story directed by Sajid Khan intelligent story line great acting by Manoj Pahwa sharp camera work and sound recording. To be fair another story worth mentioning is the one directed by Chakravarthy of Satya fame starring Randeep Hooda as the man possessed. Ram Gopal Varma the man who claims to love the world of horror and directed spinechilling 'Bhoot' in the past ironically tells the story in this film which is perhaps the weakest of the seven stories. Though ironically again the acting by Amitabh Bachchan in that piece as a man intimidated by an invisible entity is top notch as the man delivers the expressions of trepidations with the most natural ease. Riteish Deshmukh his coactor also delivered a proreactive set of emotions with brilliance. A story that seemed like revenge onto life insurance agents again had powerful acting by Rajpal Yadav. But was it scary? No. Comparing the sequel to Varma's first 'Darna Mana Hai' this one has weaker story lines and yet scarce punch of the ghost factor. Our verdict Good for a DVD scare.

	schema:reviewBody "First I would like to say that its Slightly better than Darna Mana Hai. Darna Zaroori Hai is fresh  a good attempt for its Offbeat style. These kind of Movies are mandatorily required for Indian Cinema which in turn is lacking differentiation from conventional filmy plots also carrying on  on the same old theme with a hero  a heroine running from opposite sides until they bang on the center of the screen with green mountains on its background making the director feel a nirvanian satisfaction.Nevertheless Had this film shown to group of sensible audience the film makers could have come out with many overdirected removable scenes.The fatal flaw of the Movie was their background score of a nursery rhyme. Every time this score buzzes our brain starts flowing currents of Pathetism. This score was horrible  absolutely mediocre.Starting with the first story directed by Sajid Khan was simply a Crap. The second one by RGV  performed by Amitabh Bachchan was too short to believe. The Stories after that are good enough to hold our attention on to the screen. The Story of Arjun RampalBipsMakarand was good  gripping. The one with Anil Kapoor  Mailika Sherawat was also good enough.Watching all the clips we understand that those direction  script flaws were actually saved by good acting. All of them did a great Job.Finally the best act of the Film was from the Story of Rajpal Yadav playing an Insurance Agent who breaks in Sunil Shetty's house. Yadav's performance was Topnotch.Just when you could see the last Story of Randeep Hooda ends its advised to get your ass off the seat ! The Grandma story was absolutely unbearable......and again... the Nursery Rhyme Score....It sucked like hell ! Overall I rate 510 just for 3 good stories  great acting by all of them.".

These kind of Movies are mandatorily required for Indian Cinema which in turn is lacking differentiation from conventional filmy plots also carrying on  on the same old theme with a hero  a heroine running from opposite sides until they bang on the center of the screen with green mountains on its background making the director feel a nirvanian satisfaction.Nevertheless Had this film shown to group of sensible audience the film makers could have come out with many overdirected removable scenes.The fatal flaw of the Movie was their background score of a nursery rhyme. Every time this score buzzes our brain starts flowing currents of Pathetism. This score was horrible  absolutely mediocre.Starting with the first story directed by Sajid Khan was simply a Crap. The second one by RGV  performed by Amitabh Bachchan was too short to believe. The Stories after that are good enough to hold our attention on to the screen. The Story of Arjun RampalBipsMakarand was good  gripping. The one with Anil Kapoor  Mailika Sherawat was also good enough.Watching all the clips we understand that those direction  script flaws were actually saved by good acting. All of them did a great Job.Finally the best act of the Film was from the Story of Rajpal Yadav playing an Insurance Agent who breaks in Sunil Shetty's house. Yadav's performance was Topnotch.Just when you could see the last Story of Randeep Hooda ends its advised to get your ass off the seat ! The Grandma story was absolutely unbearable......and again... the Nursery Rhyme Score....It sucked like hell ! Overall I rate 510 just for 3 good stories  great acting by all of them.";

Pretty witty but nothing scary.Amitabh episode left me pretty baffled. My copy ended when the student looks at the image in the mirror. Did something else happen after that or was my copy complete? Arjun Rampal episode was a complete REPEAT of the Nana Patekar episode from Darna Mana Hai. I had an impression that Arjun would be the dead guy. Nothing special in the episode.Rajpal YadavSuneel Shetty episode was the WORST. I have no clue what the message was unless I miss something. I can't believe after so many years Suneel still speaks such pathetic Hindi. His dialog delivery was horrible. Rajpal Yadav is a brilliant actor Main Meri Patni Aur Woh! YES!! but here his role didn't do any justice. So he dies at the end. What's scary in that???Anil KapoorMallika Sehrawat episode was funny not scary and probably the best in terms of acting. Poor guy dies thinking that she was a spook. Witty again!Randeep Hooda episode was a cheap BGrade Story. A soul acquires a body and kills her killers. Overall Darna Mana Hai was a great movie and really had good direction and mature acting even from unknown faces. This movie although much anticipated was a waste of time. I'm sorry but so many directors a hoard of actors still couldn't save the poor screenplay. 310".

However Manoj Pahwa's story Arjun RampalBipasa's story and Anil KapoorMalika's story are satisfactory. RitieshAmitabh Bachachan's story surprisingly directed by Ram Gopal Verma is mediocre. Finally the Suneil ShettySonali Kulkarni story is a total letdown. The movie suffers due to bad screenplay notsoscarystories and at some places awful acting.In conclusion the movie is a complete disappointment to all those avid Ram Gopal Verma fans who watch his movies for his unusual and distinctive stories!So if you have all the time in the world to throw away then call your buddies at home eat popcorn watch Darna Zaroori Hai and laugh all the way through the movie!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure of seeing Perks Of Being A Wallflower at Arclight Cinemas in LA yesterday and it was definitely worth the one hour drive.The story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well never feeling like it's being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully.Directing wise it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying.Same thing with the writing. The dialogue is very honest and beautifully well written. It was very fun to quote along with the movie. Not just the writing but the overall tone of the film reminds me a little bit of John Hughes' work. Adapting a epistolary book into a film is incredibly challenging but Mr. Chbosky did a fine job of translating it into a film.The musical score is done by Michael Brook who's also responsible for Into The Wild another favorite of mine and he did a very good job. In fact one of the scores made me cry because of how it emotionally resonated with the scene it was fitting in. The soundtrack is awesome. Along with Mr. Chbosky Alexandra Patsavas who's also the music supervisor for The OC did a great job of picking out the songs and treated it as if it were a mix tape.Logan Lerman my god he did a masterful job as Charlie. The character literally jumped out of the book and made its way onto the big screen. Logan's performance blew me away. He did such an amazing job portraying the embodiment of Charlie through his expressions his emotions his movements everything! So perfectly cast. The last 10 minutes of the movie alone is awards worthy because it really shows how talented he really is. I fell in love with his performance. So perfect in every way.Emma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it it's nothing distracting and it didn't really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much.The second standout of the film is Ezra Miller! He plays Patrick a gay character who's not afraid of who he is and Ezra portrays him amazingly well. I've seen almost all of his work and he's becoming a great actor who's very rare in the sense that he's brave and daring in contrast to the roles he has previously played. He steals every line and scene he's in becoming the comic relief. But even so Patrick has his own personal problem and this is where Ezra Miller proves once again just how great of an actor he is.Everyone else in their supporting roles all have their moments. Nina Dobrev who plays Candance aka Charlie's sister did a good job. Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth was hilarious. Adam Hagenbuch as Bob was great. Erin Wilhelmi as Alice Johnny Simmons as Brad and Nicholas Braun as Derek were all fine. The rest of the cast Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott who play the parents as well as Joan Cusack who plays Charlie's Doctor were all good despite having little screen time. Melanie Lynskey did a very good job as Aunt Helen. Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson is awesome. He's also a standout. Paul Rudd in general is a very likable actor and again he doesn't have a lot of screen time either but he still manages to play his part memorably. What makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they're very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect.I love this movie. It's amazing. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a diehard fan of the book. It has a great script great cast it's well directed awesome soundtrack and undeniable strong performances. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower may not be the most faithful adaptation but the spirit of the story is still there and it does great justice to the book. This is one of the best coming of age movies I've ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Perks of Being a Wallflower is another story about a simple guy living in a cruel life of high school. The difference is he's not ought to save the day wants to lose his virginity seeking to be popular or revenge on his bullies. The story is about a shy kid who wants to get along with people and can't wait to leave high school. Behind it is the genuine pain and emotion of the characters which makes it more than just another story about teenagers. Stephen Chbosky tells his own story on screen pretty well and the performances are quite excellent. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is often heartbreaking charming and wonderful.Charlie is palpably just another teenage protagonist but he is not one of those who tries to prove everyone who mistreated him wrong. His goal is to get away from being antisocial and be like anyone else in high school. We may have heard a story like this before but what makes this one extraordinary is when it mostly depicts the darkest aspects of their lives. Expressing the most heartbreaking truths about these teenagers. Knowing their problems easily makes it reasonable for us to care about them. The romance is rather credibly lovely than a mainstream claptrap. In the joyous moments it's pretty delightful and plays a quite nostalgic soundtrack.The film gives the actors some nuance. This is probably a good thing for Logan Lerman. He usually plays the simple charming guy in movies. Since he's good at those he adds some credibility to Charlie. Emma Watson is likable enough as Sam. The best among the three is Ezra Miller. One might hams it up for Patrick but Miller gave the character a genuinely wonderful personality.The director and author Stephen Chbosky didn't try anything else than to bring his book to life. He tells it straightforward on screen with plenty of strong effective emotions. The cinematography is bright and beautiful enough. The tunnel scene has the best shots. While the soundtrack is too conspicuous the music score is noticeably melancholic.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it's not depressing the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall it's a great film. It's a film adaptation that replaces the clich mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end it's quite a remarkable film.".

Stephen Chbosky tells his own story on screen pretty well and the performances are quite excellent. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is often heartbreaking charming and wonderful.Charlie is palpably just another teenage protagonist but he is not one of those who tries to prove everyone who mistreated him wrong. His goal is to get away from being antisocial and be like anyone else in high school. We may have heard a story like this before but what makes this one extraordinary is when it mostly depicts the darkest aspects of their lives. Expressing the most heartbreaking truths about these teenagers. Knowing their problems easily makes it reasonable for us to care about them. The romance is rather credibly lovely than a mainstream claptrap. In the joyous moments it's pretty delightful and plays a quite nostalgic soundtrack.The film gives the actors some nuance. This is probably a good thing for Logan Lerman. He usually plays the simple charming guy in movies. Since he's good at those he adds some credibility to Charlie. Emma Watson is likable enough as Sam. The best among the three is Ezra Miller. One might hams it up for Patrick but Miller gave the character a genuinely wonderful personality.The director and author Stephen Chbosky didn't try anything else than to bring his book to life. He tells it straightforward on screen with plenty of strong effective emotions. The cinematography is bright and beautiful enough. The tunnel scene has the best shots. While the soundtrack is too conspicuous the music score is noticeably melancholic.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it's not depressing the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall it's a great film. It's a film adaptation that replaces the clich mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end it's quite a remarkable film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Brace for gushing. Last evening I attended a screening that included a fascinating QA with writerdirector Stephen Chbosky. It reminded me of how personal and intimate and observant and incisive a wellmade film can be. A well written script is so refreshing and an exceptional script can be truly breathtaking. Mr. Chbosky takes the unusual step of directing his own screenplay based on his own novel a 1999 bestseller and he left me stunned and enthralled.The popularity of the novel would typically make the film version a disappointment for its fans. Not so this time. Mr. Chbosky remains true to the spirit despite the need to edit for the sake of continuity and brevity. The key characters spring to life thanks to the efforts of four strong performances from young actors Logan Lerman Percy Jackson The Three Muskateers plays Charlie Emma Watson Harry Potter films is Sam Ezra Miller We Need to Talk About Kevin City Island is Patrick and Mae Whitman Arrested Development is Mary Elizabeth.If you have read the book you know the story ... you know the characters ... you know the themes. If you haven't read the book I will spoil nothing. The brilliance is recognized only as you get to know these characters and slowly uncover their stories. What we discover is that regardless of our age we recognize these characters from our high school days. We know the introverted observant Charlie who so desperately needs a support system. We surely recognize the attentionstarved lacking in selfesteem Sam who is the epitome of We accept the love we think we deserve. And we all knew a Patrick ... the flamboyant one who sheaths his pain with an overthetop act of public confidence. What Chbosky does is shine the spotlight on these characters to ensure that we really SEE them this time.The themes reminded me a bit of a darker John Hughes film that's a compliment. There were also pieces of two other really good films Stand By Me and Almost Famous. The formative years of a writer determine the depths to which his or her work will reach later in life. Admittedly the film is substantially autobiographical so when Mr. Chbosky says it's a personal story we begin to understand the foundation of his remarkable writing style.Welcome to the island of misfit toys. When this line is spoken we realize that most every high school kid has thought the same thing at some point. These are painful and difficult times and as Mr. Chbosky stated we should encourage kids to fight through this stage and get on to the next ... then able to find their true self. Clearly the film made a strong impact on me. My favorite reaction to a movie is profound thought and this one caused this in waves. The decision to release as PG13 was wise. There is no excess of profanity or nudity to divert attention from what really matters ... the characters. I can think of no finer compliment to a writer and filmmaker than to cite them as the cause of my internal discussions related to their film. My hope is that you have the same reaction. httpmoviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com".

The highlight of the film for me at least from a acting stand point is Ezra Miller really funny but very heartfelt at the same time. Don't get me wrong the whole case is amazing Emma Watson was perfect for this after HP but Ezra really stands out. Stephen Chbosky really cared about this book and it really shows in this film. Him Directing and writing his own book was a amazing idea. It's going to get many comparisons to a John Hughes film and rightfully so this movie is heart felt and just amazing.

	schema:reviewBody "The Perksas it were was a bit of a marvel when discussing what teenagers have to contend with. Anyone that decides to see this film expecting a run of the mill high school drama or teenage angst tale will be pleasantly surprised at the depth with which this story delves. This adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's novel seemed to take the difficulties facing one young man embarking on his high school journey through one extreme situation after another. I could visualize a totally different version of this tale of misfit toys being played out where all is right with the world and Charlie Logan Lerman is the most popular freshman in school for the simple fact that all his friends are seniors. The immediate infatuation that Charlie had with Sam Emma Watson was no surprise what did surprise me was the challenges that she and her step brother PatrickNothing Ezra Miller had to endure. Even I started to get annoyed as the school year progressed and the running 'Nothing' joke persisted. It's always surprising when a story focuses on well to do young people whose lives would be expected to mimic a fairytale. This story gives insight into the fact that some young people have the same if not even more struggles than others and having money can't really fix that. I found it interesting that there was no clear indication in the story as to the school year even at graduation there was none of the typical 'Class of '92' or whatever to show how proud of their time graduates are. It may be that Mr. Chbosky wanted to steer clear of associating the story with a specific year but it was obviously the early 90's when the primary mode of sharing and exchanging music was via cassette. I recall so very clearly the good old days when the 'mix tape' ruled. I have to say that I liked Emma Watson as an American teenager she can cross the pond and put it down any time. Yes there were a few moments in her dialog that she sounded like Hermione but this role did a great deal to paint her in a different and mature light. I am not drawn to tales of the human condition unless there is a deep truth to be gleaned from the story so if I had to say the moral of the story is It would be 'you gotta have friends'. This story worked because of what the three key characters gained from getting to know each other. I give it a green light.".

To be honest it didn't really move or impress me in any way. In my opinion it's a decent film with some flaws that could have been far better if it wasn't so mainstream. I think most of the enthusiastic reviewers are young people who recognize themselves in this story about teenagers who choose to be different from the rest. It's a very romantic story a melancholic teenager befriends a group of progressivebohemianintellectual youngsters who differentiate themselves from the rest of the school. They introduce him to parties drugs and music from The Smiths and David Bowie. He falls in love with one of the girls and another girl falls in love with him. There are secrets to keep memories to share and experiences to cherish. This could have been the cinematographic equal to Donna Tartt's novel 'The Secret History'. But it lacks the dark mysterious Gothic aspects of the book. There are traumas and secrets in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' but they are implied and not clearly explained. It's clear this movie appeals to young people who perhaps can recognize a lot about their own life in the film. But to be a good movie in its own right it should also be attractive for viewers in other age groups. I think in that respect this movie fails.".

But it lacks the dark mysterious Gothic aspects of the book. There are traumas and secrets in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' but they are implied and not clearly explained. It's clear this movie appeals to young people who perhaps can recognize a lot about their own life in the film. But to be a good movie in its own right it should also be attractive for viewers in other age groups. I think in that respect this movie fails.";

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Alert There will be some spoilers in this review.I was very fortunate to have finally seen Perks of Being a Wallflower POBAW at an advance screening courtesy of a fellow film fanatic and blogger. I had to travel for the most part of a day through a couple of States to get to the screening but it was worth every penny of the toll fees charged.Disclosure I read POBAW nearly 10 years ago when I was just about to start college and it remains one of my favorite books alongside works by Thomas Pynchon Jane Austen Sylvia Plath John Irving Gore Vidal  a very eclectic bunch.I had also been tracking any plans to make a film version of the novel since 2008 when Chbosky was quoted in an online interview that he was working on a script based on his novel. I thought that's a very hopeful positive and at the same time brave sign. Around the time I read the novel I was also totally engrossed in a new drama series on the WB called Jack and Bobby which starred a then 1213 year old actor named Logan Lerman whom I had seen previously in the cult favorite The Butterfly Effect as a young Ashton Kutcher and the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie A Painted House. I was struck by the maturity of Lerman's weekly output in Jack and Bobby and thought at the time that he reminded me so much of Charlie in POBAW.Fast forward to 2010 when Variety broke the news that Lerman Chbosky and Emma Watson were all involved in the POBAW film with John Malkovich's Mr. Mudd Productions  I knew then that it was going to be special.And it is. It is a faithful adaptation of the novel to the screen but not necessarily a set pieceforset piece accurate one. More than the plot elements and details it is the story arc and the emotions in the written work that have made a successful transition to the screen. For that I must credit Chbosky for knowing what to cut and what to retain in the film version. Even the use of songs other than those in Charlie's mixtape works because the director and the entire team know the essence of the book and how and why it has affected so many readers and they respected it.Spoilers There is no abortion scene no reading of Dr. Earl Reum's moving poem in the film or some of the scenes with Charlie's extended family over the holidays and yet I have to agree wholeheartedly with Chbosky's decision on this. Fans of the book should not get into a twist because some of these will not be seen because Charlie's story and more importantly his unique voice is there in all it's quirky lovable and emotional beauty.Don't let the obviously very commercial trailer fool you the film retains the book's darker moments and the demons which torment the protagonist.As for the acting I cannot say enough about how the cast embodied and fully embraced the characters they were playing. First off those who know Logan Lerman only from his Percy Jackonfranchise should take another look at this promising young actor. I have seen Lerman in other performances in 310 to Yuma and My One and Only and always found him to be a mature and sensitive actor. And while his performances in those films are noteworthy Perks allows him to show his full range and versatility. He is Charlie no doubt about it and imbues the role with sophistication and emotion. I realize the Academy doesn't take notice of younger actors unlike the actress categories but Lerman's performance is truly awardsworthy.Ezra Miller's portrayal of Patrick may surprise some fans of the book as his characterization may be slightly more flamboyant than the Nothing of the book but he delivers a funny outrageous but ultimately warm performance.Now Emma Watson really needs to do more work on her American accent as her natural one flits in and out but it doesn't totally distract from a winsome and winning performance as Sam. Perhaps not in the same league as Lerman and Miller but certainly a departure and breakthrough from just being known as Hermione. The actress knows how to choose material. Also the chemistry between her and Lerman is outstanding.Mae Whitman Paul Rudd Joan Cusack Kate Walsh Dylan McDermott and the always great Melanie Lynskey also make wonderful contributions. I wish though that we had seen more of the young actor Chbosky cast as Michael cut out of the film and Julia Garner of Electrick Children.Just a last note Chbosky makes full use of his Pittsburgh setting to situate the characters in the film. The Christmasholiday scenes are beautiful visually and so is the RHPS.If there is one thing I hope fans of POBAW will do is to tell people they know to see the film. This is not your typical teen fare and certainly miles ahead of the Twilight series and the Hunger Games. As a comingofage film I would place this in the same league as Dead Poets' Society and the classic Harold and Maude. More substantial than John Hughes' work. This is real. I would love it if families could see this film together. It deserves nothing less. I hope that there is enough critical mass at TIFF and beyond to elevate this film for the accolades it deserves.".

Not to say anything against Best Picture nominee Silver Linings Playbooks but I would myself place an Oscar nomination for The Perks of Being a Wallflower over SLP for a Best Picture nomination. That being said let the review be underway A young and troubled freshman by the name of Charlie Logan Lerman attempts to make his way through high school and gain friends as he falls in love with Sam Emma Watson The story is definitely based off Steven Chbosky's novel which he writes and directs in this case. Normally having the author of a book direct a film can often come out horrible as a reader's interpretation is completely different from a film director's. Also a book must be structured and paced differently to that of a film and in most cases an author directing a film would more so attempt to direct it like a film. It's not the case here thankfully! The direction in this film is definitely marvellous and the way the characters were presented is truly fantastic. Having never read the book myself I was almost immediately fascinated by the film and a while into the film I knew I would love it. Despite only reaching a 100 minute run time I would personally have loved the film to be another half hour longer.The film is a truly moving one and is not an average popcorn flick. Very powerful emotionally at least for someone like me who has experienced a similar life to that of Charlie it can definitely be hard to rewatch this film despite its complete brilliance.With good performances throughout from Logan Lerman to Emma Watson this film adds further credibility. If I were to pick a fault with this film I'd really have a tough time sitting through thinking but perhaps if a few characters mainly Mary and Sam were elaborated a bit more there may have been a bit more of an emotional connection but for Sam it doesn't tend to matter much as her character is a likable one and the screen time she has is relatively long.In a year that saw the releases of films like Django Unchained The Hobbit Skyfall The Dark Knight Rises The Avengers and Looper I myself would personally rank it above all those great films of the year except for my personal favourite Django Unchained.Fantastic direction excellent writing and an excellent knowledge of book to movie adaptations from the book's very author The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a brilliantly acted story and is emotionally powerful yet displays elements of other films. A fantastic film a near masterpiece of the decade. One of the most underrated films of this new decade.".

	schema:headline " Angst Overdose";
	schema:reviewBody "I usually don't bother reviewing anything at IMDb that's already been reviewed a hundred times but since the vast majority of reviews here are glowing I thought I'd offer my two cents.I kind of hated Perks of Being a Wallflower. Why? It was like an angst overdose in a depressing fantasy world. Now I know there exists bullying in high school but generally high school is not like it is portrayed here. Everyone in high school is not mean to you from the first to the last day and even if jocks can be insensitive depicting them as nothing but evil bullies is a tired stale plot mechanism.The main character Charlie is so introverted that we never quite care about him. I'm remembering the introverted character from Almost Famous and how he ended up being really funny and lovable. I really didn't feel anything for Charlie. And both his parents are just robots so we're never given an explanation of why he is the way he is other than his aunt molested him and then died in a car accident. Really? That's what totally screwed up an otherwise normal intelligent halfway good looking kid?Patrick is probably the best character but really he's a flaming queer and knows every word of the Rocky Horror Picture Show by heart but he has never heard of David Bowie's song Heroes? Really? And he isn't into theater? He just goes to parties and acts flamboyant while he is secretly depressed?

Why? Because he gives him books? There seemed to be some homoerotic thing going on there that's never touched upon. Perhaps a moment a bit more awkward than the hug Charlie gives himthat might have shed some light on their mysterious relationship.Charlie's high school crush Sam is an okay character but she also just sort of goes along with the absence of plot.

This schools seems to have one freshman Charlie and everyone else is a senior. It makes NO sense.I kept looking at the time realizing I still had forty five minutes a half hour twenty minutes to go wanting to puke from eating so much angst until I finally was shouting out loud It's David Bowie's song Heroes good God it's not exactly obscure!!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "I usually don't bother reviewing anything at IMDb that's already been reviewed a hundred times but since the vast majority of reviews here are glowing I thought I'd offer my two cents.I kind of hated Perks of Being a Wallflower. Why? It was like an angst overdose in a depressing fantasy world. Now I know there exists bullying in high school but generally high school is not like it is portrayed here. Everyone in high school is not mean to you from the first to the last day and even if jocks can be insensitive depicting them as nothing but evil bullies is a tired stale plot mechanism.The main character Charlie is so introverted that we never quite care about him. I'm remembering the introverted character from Almost Famous and how he ended up being really funny and lovable. I really didn't feel anything for Charlie. And both his parents are just robots so we're never given an explanation of why he is the way he is other than his aunt molested him and then died in a car accident. Really? That's what totally screwed up an otherwise normal intelligent halfway good looking kid?Patrick is probably the best character but really he's a flaming queer and knows every word of the Rocky Horror Picture Show by heart but he has never heard of David Bowie's song Heroes? Really? And he isn't into theater? He just goes to parties and acts flamboyant while he is secretly depressed? Yet he and the rest of the wallflowers probably have more friends than any of the socalled cool kids do so what are they so depressed about?The teacher Mr. Anderson is a minor minor character yet supposedly he has a great impact on Charlie's life.

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed this film as something I've seen before. I'd go so far that I thought it was more something very typical for these kinds of movies and it was also very overstated. When this should be a character driven film it's plot is way too controlling. We're hanging out with a smart but introvert guy who has problems with something that was done to him rather than something he has done. Nothing is his fault even tho he feels that way. The protagonist is a thoroughly nice person but haunted by a gruesome past that ultimately will strike him in what is the climax of the film.The film is however not about his head. It's about the cool alternative smart pretty and older group of people he starts hanging out with. And these are not the popular kids? Wow why? Even tho the members of this group are all very bright in theory this does not reflect on their choices within the film's plot. Sam is having a relationship with an allthrough asshole and it's very obvious that he has a lower level of intelligence as well. Sam then goes on about how she loves Charlie and kisses him. But wait she doesn't leave the asshole. Why the F not?Charlie is then persuaded into a relationship with Mary Elizabeth supposedly a Harvard candidate who is also ignorant to seeing Charlies real desires to want Sam. Does this group of friends even talk to each other? They become mad at Charlie when he reaches into these desires during a dare. The group becomes mad at him because he has now hurt both Mary Elizabeth and Sam for desperately showing this. He's suddenly the asshole. Charlie now feels that his is his fault. He becomes for a very brief period cast out of this group until he hits this bit is unclear even in the film a person and is suddenly a hero again. This leaves me with the impression that the film's 45 minutes to 1 hr 15 minutes are just time extending plot material. It does not in any way provoke the climax of the film or lead up to it. Conflicts in this time area of the film are quickly started and solved. It's overstated annoying and boring. I pounded my head a lot to my desk during these minutes.I like the ending because it is much more intriguing than the overstated personal dramas of this overly cool but not popular group of people we follow. If the film had been more about Charlie's head displaying more of his inner conflict surrounding his past and his feelings towards his 1000 days left of college I would think this film is great. But a lot of the plot is only to please the youthful audience and to feed them with a film that appears alternative but is really just a remix of the old. Much like EasyA and it's ''selfreflective'' script discourse. But I mean if you're fourteen you'd not only love this film but maybe also find it intriguing to display yourself through the identity of the characters. Emma Watson is hot she has 3 of my 4 stars.".

Jocks JewishAmerican princesses closet gays and geeks all populate this film in fairly conventional representations. The lead character is in a state of fragile mental health but no Holden Caulfield. He finds friends has a loving family and a teacher who looks out for him. The main issue he has is historical abuse but the rendering of this is so 'lite' as to be unrealistic and totally lacking in emotional impact. I can buy that they did not know a Bowie classic in this part of the world in the early nineties but I can't accept that they would ostracise a clearly fragile friend after one drunken party faux pas. The film does not explore the fallout of childhood abuse in meaningful terms and it fails to capture the pain and euphoria of being a teenager. All in all a bit flat and disappointing.".

	schema:headline " So I don't know about all these good reviews.";
	schema:reviewBody "This may be somewhat disjointed but there are significant problems with this film.First off I love how Emma Watson looks but she is not organic. Her line delivery is terrible. How are we supposed to buy a 17 year old saying Welcome to the island of misfit toysreally? She loses her accent only somewhat and moves her head before every single line. And shows a complete lack of inhibition at all times whereas Patrick and Charlie still have some moments of varied emotion. And if she's the second most important character where is the depth of storyline and evidence of I'm a messed up kid. She mentions that she had older gentleman boyfriends at 11 and got drunk in freshman year and was promiscuous. Then all of that totally disappears and she acts like a normal person throughout the film. Her other emotional opportunity is he said I was right to have broken up with him. There is no anger or revenge shown just a matter of fact thing statement. Emma Watson still has a lot of development to do.Patrick was great range of emotions was believable his acting was brilliant and his reactions were on cue. No qualms with him.Problems Why does everyone think Charlie is a great writer if he never really a tells them b shows them or c demonstrates. He hands some essays to his English teacher and then they have this huge connection due to Charlie liking him and his teacher giving him books and only saying We accept the love we think we deserve. So that makes him the best teacher ever and it also makes Charlie a great writerthough he never attempts a novel. The father and mother have about three lines and in the book the Dad was a lot more standoffish. You can't prove a father standoffish if he's just not in a lot of shots. The mother has less lines than the repeated lines of Aunt Helen.Charlie. Great acting but there's a huge problem with the way the film is developed and how his role comes about. They only mention It is getting bad and then keep it vague. Who the hell says things like it's getting bad and then are you seeing things again. There is barely any mention of his stay in a hospital during middle school and tell me what teenager with light suicidality stays in a hospital for a year? Or even 3 months after his breakdown. Even if it's supposed to be in the '80s that seems off.Mary Elizabeth is apparently a punk rock Buddhist and then all of the sudden she calls at all hours of the day when they go outdoes not seem consistent with her character.Charlieyou're saying that a guy who doesn't work out has the ability to black out and beat up three football players and that the football players are suddenly stunned and decide to just look stunned rather than fighting back? Really?Then someone thinks it's a good idea for Charlie to have a pot brownie without telling him and he doesn't freak out? And of course they toast him. And there is no detail about his friend he writes to or his friendship with his best friend who just commit suicide. But about the pot brownie. He is completely fine then decides voluntarily in the same month or two to try LSD having never actually smoked. Who does that? Not to mention the absolute lack of supervision throughout the entire film. These kids are allowed to do whatever they want and have house parties seemingly every week with alcohol and drugs and only once are almost caught sadie Hawkins. Again what teenager decides to do LSD after ingesting a pot brownie once unknowingly?Then there's the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The QB is fine to be in the crowd of people but cannot be in the show itself because someone would see him. What? And how the hell do all these 17 and 18 year olds all have the leads to this production. You're telling me that anyone who had been at this theater for this production had decided to give up the reins to acting in RHPS to this band of teenagers who apparently know everything about it? And that Charlie has no memories of his Aunt when he's touching breasts of Sam in the show and Mary Elizabeth but then suddenly has a revelation when Sam's hand slides to his nether regions?And Sam is totally okay with them going to have sex as soon as Charlie says I wanted to ask her out knowing Charlie? What happens at that point?This film is absolutely illogical and does terrible justice to the book. Emma Watson is gorgeous but unconvincing Logan could be good in the future and Ezra has a brilliant career in front of him. But for god's sake this is not a good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to like this movie. I read the book about a decade ago while in my late teens and the story resonated with me on several levels. I have been hoping and praying as much as an atheist can pray that the Hollydood commerce machine would not screw it up. Alas in vain.I am struggling of what to describe first in this review but I think that I will give the makers of this movie a little credit. Perks was always going to be a difficult story to televise and the attempt is not a total copout. The movie stays true to the book in many respects and it's obvious that there was some thought put into capturing the feel of the written tale. That it didn't succeed is a confluence of several factors.The main problem is down to the casting and portrayal of the main characters. I have no issue with the protagonist Charlie but the roles of Patrick Ezra Miller and especially Sam Emma Watson have been rather absurdly twisted albeit each in a different way.Patrick is overtly and flamboyantly homosexual which becomes a real distraction. In the book he was just a cool and funny guy for whom sexual orientation was a nuisance with which he struggled but he didn't seem to consider it a core of his persona. The movie falls way short of that level of subtlety. Here Patrick is oozing gayness  that's where he begins and that's where he ends.The character of Sam is even worse. I am not sure what is the big deal about Emma Watson. She has very little in terms of acting chops and it's a shame that she keeps getting roles on the strength of Potter fame that she is totally illsuited for. She lacks any kind of charm and on top of that she looks androgynous. Sam is supposed to be a slutty girl gone good who is still feminine and unwittingly seductive. Emma looks and acts like a preteen boy making it hard to understand Charlie's infatuation with her.The last problem that I want to touch upon is the lack of flow in the narrative. There is just no feeling of cohesiveness that characterizes good movies. It's a succession of short vignettes loosely related and strung together. The book also makes frequent jumps in time but they are easier to digest due to transitional material. It makes sense that there is a time lapse when Charlie starts writing his letter but somehow that doesn't translate well to the screen.Overall I give this movie a 410 score as I consider it a slightly subpar effort. It wasn't for a lack of trying but I wish that the creators resisted the urge to capitalize on Emma Watson's supposed star power and instead found an actress well suited for the role.".

Yes there are 1 or 2 silly scenes but it was still funny.I think the best thing about this comedy was that it left it up to the audience to draw their own conclusions on the characters of the central characters without laying on as Hollywood usually doesit on heavy with the romantic or schmuty character embellishment.Just a funny story with 2  4 including the supporting friends very good comic actors. Give yourself a break its not overly typical Hollywood flick and I found it funny anyway ! PS I am not a teenager !".

Fortunately it gets better on the second half and that's because it takes an unconventional way in difference with similar movies.Towards the ending it gets actually funny and almost creative.The performances are just fine. Cameron Daz is always sexy and bubbly. Her legs are a delight to watch. Ashton Kutcher is good in this role. Just as goofy as ever. Lake Bell is the highlight in my opinion. She's extremely hot candy for the eye and her performance is actually funny. I liked when she was called stripper and when Jason S.'s character draws an obscene picture to her during the court meeting. The guest cameos are funny. Zack G. is hilarious.Watch this movie only if it airs on cable. It's not worth your money but it's up for a few good laughs.".

It's only and hour and a half so it's not going to stretch on forever. Kutcher and Diaz provided enough funny moments to make the movie fairly amusing but what really surprised me was their chemistry. Maybe it was because I was so negative about it before but they went together well. There were also a few sweet moments and a few with more tension which was good. Unfortunately I found some other parts of the movie sweeter than the end but it wasn't that bad.The screenplay is nothing new but then what movie is THAT original? Not many. The point is it's fun and a good time if you want to spend an hour or so relaxing. Even my brother who is a die hard action fan didn't mind the movie.No matter how original or unexpected a movie is if it doesn't entertain me I DON'T CARE. This one was entertaining.

The only sad part we have Cameron Diazwho looks like a really good looking aging woman and Ashton Kutcherwho still looks and acts like he's 12 years old so we have two obnoxious actors that could have made a very disastrous film. But I saw What Happens in Vegas... yesterday and even though it was very predictable and stupid it still had some very funny moments. I mean Cameron and Ashton play two of the most unlikeable characters in movie history who just bicker back and forth. The characters who win you over in the film are Rob Corddry and Lake Bell who's fighting is actually very funny. But Aston and Cameron had some really good moments too.Joy just got dumped by her boyfriend in front of her friends Jack just got fired by his own father so what's next for them? VEGAS! They happen to meet when their rooms get mixed up and end up drinking together having a ball in Vegas and end up accidentally marrying each other. When they come too they realize it was a mistake but start bickering Joy leaves a quarter at her slot machine and Jack puts it in and wins 3 million dollars! But when it comes to the annulment for some strange and unbelievable reason the judge sentences them to 6 months hard marriage and freezes the money. So these two who have nothing in common battle it out until of course they fall for each other.What Happens in Vegas... is silly and predictable but I do think the rating her on IMDb is a little harsh. I completely side with people who hate Cameron and Ashton but their battle scenes together are pretty funny. Just I've seen so many worse films this was just a fun romantic comedy to lighten the spirit of Iron Man and Speed Racer not to mention the more action packed movies for the summer. So I'd say it's worth the look but more of a rental vs. a high priced ticket but just have fun I think you'll get more than a few laughs.510".

I was not all that excited about seeing it in the first place myself if I am going to be honest but I only got it because there was nothing better to get I guess and in the end I had a fun time with it. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot.The movie is quite humorous. Not one of the funniest or even most memorable RomComs I have ever seen but here again it does not try to be anything more than it is. The story is cute and entertaining if you give it even the slightest bit of chance to be and though I would say if you are looking for a RomCom for you and your significant other there are plenty of better ones like The Proposal and The Ugly Truth you could see if you have any interest in seeing this I encourage you to do it because if you know what you are in for it will be just what you needed. A refreshing little movie that deserves better reception.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lazy young man who's just been fired by his own father and an uptight financial sector striver just dumped by her boyfriend go to Las Vegas with pals to forget and meeting get married in a night of drunken carousing and diminished rationality. Then he wins 3 million on a slot machine with her quarter and they wind up in court fighting over an annulment and the right to the three million. The judge dislikes them both equally and sentences them to remain married and cohabit for six months and prove they're working to get along. A series of domestic plots and battles follows as each tries to outsmart the other to win in court and get all the money. They end up liking each other. I know the reviewers are right to trash this movie but they're missing something essential that would raise the audience rating a good many points above the critics' if they fail to note one thing that is the main reason why most of us go to see it. 'What Happens in Vegas' has not only the trappings of a big expensive Hollywood comedy the bright colors and nice sets but two big glamorous stars and they are not humiliated by being here because they do look very good and mismatch or not look good together too. Yes the script is lousy. The setups and jokes are lame and clichd and sometimes crass tasteless and adolescent. The arc is predictable. The progression isn't particularly interesting or even logical. The individual scenes consequently aren't ever pitched to be very funny and the dialog never surprises you either. But that very lack of high pitched comedy can be a plus if you find Cameron amazing and cool and Ashton gorgeous and appealing. The absence of a high laugh level such as the Apatow comedies occasionally achieve means they get to act more like people they can register ordinary expressions instead of mere comic mugging and you get to look at them which is one good and durable reason for watching this movie. And both are aging well. Ashton is big and handsome. The prettyboy quality is fading into something more like an old time Hollywood leading man look. Cameron is sexy and elegant and looks great in a tight gown. Ashton has learned something since the staccato limitations of That Seventies Show. He actually registers six or seven different and recognizably human expressions now. He's added sarcasm and meanness. He may be a peoplepleaser forever but he doesn't try as hard as he used to nor does the good old boy personality hide a certain level of intelligence just as the Punk'd badass persona has never hidden an essential kindness. The one plot element that works is that he's the one of the pair who's got the emotional smarts it is harder to believe Cameron's character is as cut off from feeling as she's supposed to be. But not too hard because there's a hardness about her.Yes it is disappointing that most of the Vegas night is done in a rapidfire montage that's more like an acid trip than an evening of heavy drinking that nothing sexier happens that the wedding is reduced to a final not very successful outtake sequence. The ending is slushy sentimental but it is sweet. The critics' revulsion remains incomprehensible to me because 'What Happens in Vegas' leaves a good taste if not a very strong one. I was a little bothered by the young Asian woman a misused Michelle Krusiec being made so stereotypically the unappealing suffering striver that's more mean than funny. Queen Latifah is mellow as always but wasted as the marriage counselor. Director Tom Vaughan deserves little credit but it is writer Dana Fox who is most to blame for the mediocrity of the result. Kutcher and Diaz and the others do a very good job. When you think about it how much is the originality of other recent Hollywood comedies really worth? Where's the trailblazing in '40 Year Old Virgin' 'Super Bad' or even the wishfulthinking 'Juno'? But no mistake about it this movie is for fans of goodlooking people in glossy movies not smart comedy or edge. Compare this to Ashton in 'Just Married' and you'll see this role is better. For sheer mindless fun he peaked in 'Dude Where's My Car?' Of course Cameron has a far stronger comedyand general moviersum so again Ashton's playing opposite her is not a step back but a step forward. But an attempt to analyze the plot seems futile. Its failings are too obvious to bother listing.".

It has great number of comic scenes and some of them are really funny but if we exclude the beginning the plot really lacks originality and significance. We can see it especially at the ending because it has the expected conventional and boring Hollywood ending we are all used to watch in this sort of comedies.I liked the performances of the main actors though.

	schema:reviewBody "I went into the screening of What Happens in Vegas thinking I was in store for a trainwreck I mean the trailer looked horrible. I suffer the pain for all of you readers though in the hopes that you won't have to live the same fate. In actuality the movie ended up being a sameold sameold romcom that had some laughs but overall just plodded along to its inevitable conclusion. Being that this pair of New Yorkers married after a night of heavy drinking in Vegas must spend six months as man and wife before a judge decides what to do with the three million dollar jackpot they won one would think we'd get a lot of their trials and tribulations probably way too sentimental for anyone to stand. Instead we get gag after gag as the two attempt to sabotage the union to take the money for themselves. Only about half the film takes place during the six months however it feels like six years. I couldn't believe the running time was only an hour and a half it felt a lot longer. All this said if someone has their mind set on seeing a film of this kind my words would not detract yousomething the producers know. I'll say one thing whomever came up with the marketing plan of selling Las Vegas with the tag used in the title here is going to bed with a smile this weekend snuggling up with the piles of money overflowing his roomhe couldn't ask for a better affirmation of that simple phrase.The premise itself is just a rehash of the same dried up plot used in Hollywood whenever the bank seems a tad low. Man and woman get together are forced to stay together against their will and eventually find out all the good things they didn't notice about each other beforehand. We have the stereotypical friends trying to help their buddy come out of the situation unscathed and a winner the token parents and exfianc who set into motion the events that get the odd couple to meet and the supporting roles that help infuse some much needed comedy into an otherwise stale story. I do jest somewhat the movie isn't without some good moments. The scenes that are overplayed in the TV spots fall flat of course but there are other moments saved for the big show that deliver. I will admit to loving the work retreat for our leading lady mostly due to Dennis Farina's scenestealing cameo as her boss. He is absolutely hilarious whether it is his mannerisms his facial expressions towards Chong and her husband or his complete exuberance tempered with a strict work ethic.I should probably mention the leads before I go too far. Admittedly I don't care very much for either Cameron Diaz or Ashton Kutcher. If I hadn't the knowledge of Kutcher being married to Demi Moore I'd have been totally taken out of the film just by the age difference between these two lovers. No offense to Diaz but she isn't getting any younger. Their real age difference is only six years yet it appears to be much more here. Diaz isn't horrible she is herself if that is your thing you won't be disappointed. Kutcher however actually surprised me a bit. He is quite likable here even when partaking in blatant subterfuge and hijinks. Far from being a great actor he plays the role perfectly even hamming it up to uncomfortable levels when acting in his role. Trying to show emotions that his character is faking leads to very funny moments and such horrible acting one must credit him for seeming natural when being himself. The two have some chemistry and you can see the abrasive union mixed with understanding and an ability to be truthful to each other. When they begin to fall for one another towards the end seriously this shouldn't be ruining anything for you I really started to enjoy their relationship. It was a good payoff from the overthetop antics of hatred at the start.As for the supporting cast there are some gems and some wasted talent. Once again much like Stranger Than Fiction I don't know what Queen Latifah is doing. I really enjoy her and find it incomprehensible that she needs to take throwaway roles like this to stay afloatsomeone please offer her a real part. Lake Bell is funny and endearingly sassy and sarcastic as Diaz's best friend Tipper while Rod Corddry vaults himself out of my notafanof ranks to be funny at all times. It appears that he can be likable when playing an ass rather than a man of power that doesn't realize he is an ass Harold  Kumar 2. Treat Williams brings some nice touch to his father role some added laughs as well as heart and even Zach Galifianakis has his moments playing pretty much the same role he does in everything he touches.I really wanted to just bash on this film but while feeling long and without any originality I didn't absolutely hate it. The acting was fine and not without its moments while some of the setups delivered on their attempts for comedy. You will start to get tired of the games they play with each other as the ante is upped over and over again more for the benefit of the audience then any real plot necessity. Once the two calm down and start to really see each other is when I must say I got a bit caught up in everything. Still though I can't recommend anyone go out and spend your hardearned Friday night cash for this one. All I can say is that sitting through the first 90 minutes does payoff with the greatest two scenes of the entire movie at the start of the credits. If you're already paid for and in your seat don't leave earl those final moments are priceless.".

	onyx:emotionText "I went into the screening of What Happens in Vegas thinking I was in store for a trainwreck I mean the trailer looked horrible. I suffer the pain for all of you readers though in the hopes that you won't have to live the same fate. In actuality the movie ended up being a sameold sameold romcom that had some laughs but overall just plodded along to its inevitable conclusion. Being that this pair of New Yorkers married after a night of heavy drinking in Vegas must spend six months as man and wife before a judge decides what to do with the three million dollar jackpot they won one would think we'd get a lot of their trials and tribulations probably way too sentimental for anyone to stand. Instead we get gag after gag as the two attempt to sabotage the union to take the money for themselves. Only about half the film takes place during the six months however it feels like six years. I couldn't believe the running time was only an hour and a half it felt a lot longer. All this said if someone has their mind set on seeing a film of this kind my words would not detract yousomething the producers know.

And boy am i glad that i watched it. It is the best comedy to come out in a really long time and i mean that 100. It was fast  comedies loose their charm when they tend to go slow on you  quick in getting to the main story instead of lagging us on and on and surprisingly the Vegas section was pretty small which was actually a Plus point! The acting was superb some of the scenes were just hilarious and others were great. The ending was expected but then for such movies it is...All i can say is that it was after a really long time that i watched most of the movie again and again yes twice right after i had completed it.In short... if you want to have a great time and some good laughs then give this a go.

	schema:reviewBody "What Happens in Vegas reminds me of that great Seinfeld episode the one where Jerry and George create a sitcom pilot about a traffic accident that results in the guy without insurance being the butler of the other man. It's the idiot plot a concept that Vegas indulges in like a free buffet dinner. The movie proves that what happens in Vegas should sometimes just stay on the cutting room floor. The movie stars Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher as Joy and Jack. Joy got dumped by her boyfriend while Jack just got fired from his job. Both needing a pickmeup they are convinced by their friends Rob Corddry Lake Bell to take a trip to Vegas and after one wild and drunken night the two wake up in the morning to find each other lying in holy matrimony. Not only that but while trying to end the marriage Jack wins a huge jackpot after playing Joy's quarter throwing a wrench into the divorce proceedings. Whoever gets the other to divorce them first is entitled to the money and so the happy couple move in with one another and hatch escalating schemes in order get the other to bail out of the marriage first. Only if you've seen this kind of thing before what do you think happens when they come back from Vegas? It's a contrived sitcom from the start. Even before I went in I knew what I was getting myself into. Still if the movie was funny it would more than make up for the complete lack of anything new. I was surprised with the kinetic and wild energy that director Tom Vaughan brings to the opening Vegas scenes as it almost made me think that this movie may actually be likable. But then these two idiots wake up married and the movie slows to a halt. They each find one witless and unfunny way after another to get on the other's nerves. Joy hogs the bathroom Jack pees in the sink Jack rubs his balls then handles food Joy throws food at him. At one point Jack gives himself a black eye to show that Joy is abusive. The movie wouldn't dare do it the other way around because of course spousal abuse on a wife isn't nearly as hilarious. I don't know what's more insulting that the movie finds this crap funny or that in the last half it expects us to buy this phony romance based on life lessons and profound understanding. And then you have Kutcher and Diaz two likable actors forced to play with bottom of the barrel material. Kutcher seems to know the material is terrible and tries to be comedic in his own way but the effort turns out to be more obnoxious and overwrought instead. And Diaz is just shrill and unpleasant. We don't buy it when these two turn from being incredibly mean and nasty to one another to actually understanding the other and so the romance just flounders. On the upside Rob Corddry is in the movie and he is fastly becoming comedy's best supporting player. What Happens in Vegas is just dumb. I expected nothing less was hoping to be surprised with more but am completely unsurprised by what I got. Sometimes you just have to roll the dice and see what happens though. Snake eyes!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review What Happens In Vegas";
	schema:reviewBody "My only trip to the US not counting the toddler days where I can remember what the heck I was doing was back in December 2005 gee time flies! where I spent a total of 7 full days trawling the streets as well as the casinos up and down the Strip and its outskirts and seriously it's never as sexy as that portrayed in the movies or that television series though you'd truly never really run out of things to do despite everything being overly expensive at tourist prices. I think I still possess a mental map of everything on the Strip!And of course Vegas is famous amongst other things besides the Elvis impersonators live entertainment etc is the ability to conduct quicky marriages which is what Ashton Kutcher's Jack Fuller and Cameron Diaz's Joy McNally get themselves into during a night of drunken stupor and cheap dares two lonely souls who journey to Sin City as an escapism from their failed lives where you can enjoy all the pleasures the city have to offer before the drudge comes kicking in when you receive that credit card bill.So begins the story when the duo find themselves in a situation to annul their marriage given a night of impulse that they cannot remember but cannot do so when McNally's quarter was inserted into a jackpot machine by Fuller and that brought them a cool 3 million dollars jackpot. Which they can't agree how to split the money and a quirky judge sentenced them to 6 months hard marriage to work through their marital vows before their frozen cash can be touched. As what the trailer had already explicitly spelt out it's War of the Roses in Mr and Mrs Smith styled couchtherapy sessions by Queen Latifah with comedy ranging from the slapstick to the plain juvenile toilet tricks.Attempts to elevate the movie and give the characters more depth come in the form of Jack Fuller learning to believe in himself and to shed his playboy noncommittal ways and with Joy McNally having to learn to let her hair down lighten up and basically doing something she loves rather than to continue doing things that she dislikes in true live your dream fashion. And throw in a quirky boss and ideal parents into the mix you'd have a whole host of supporting cast to boost variety in this rather predictable tale where you can see the outcome shining brightly like a star in a moonless night.I thought Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz could be playing themselves i.e. one's dating an older woman the other other no qualms in dating younger men. Well at least their characters had never felt the need to reveal their ages but you can tell Diaz is a spring chicken no longer since her big screen debut in The Mask. Typical of all her roles Diaz again plays a ditzy blonde with quirky skill sets and I thought somebody should really consider giving her a role in an action movie since she has on display really menacing looking biceps and a scene where she got to show off her combo moves of a right hook and reverse roundhouse kick.Kutcher on the other hand is well Kutcher from Punk'd with nothing really new offered in his role of the smooth talking slacker with brooding good looks. Instead the one who stole the show was sidekick Rob Corddry as Hater Fuller's best friend and lawyer. He would already be familiar to some as the crazy Homeland Security agent in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay and I'd stick my neck out to say this is one guy to watch over the next few comedic movies as he totally let it rip in this movie with his crazy antics.At best What Happens in Vegas is ideal for those itching for yet another formulaic romantic comedy from the factories of Hollywood or for those who missed out on the hot tickets for Speed Racer. Stay behind after the end credits roll for a final coda. There are 2 at the beginning of the end credits but hold out right until the end before you decide to make for the exit.".

I think I still possess a mental map of everything on the Strip!And of course Vegas is famous amongst other things besides the Elvis impersonators live entertainment etc is the ability to conduct quicky marriages which is what Ashton Kutcher's Jack Fuller and Cameron Diaz's Joy McNally get themselves into during a night of drunken stupor and cheap dares two lonely souls who journey to Sin City as an escapism from their failed lives where you can enjoy all the pleasures the city have to offer before the drudge comes kicking in when you receive that credit card bill.So begins the story when the duo find themselves in a situation to annul their marriage given a night of impulse that they cannot remember but cannot do so when McNally's quarter was inserted into a jackpot machine by Fuller and that brought them a cool 3 million dollars jackpot. Which they can't agree how to split the money and a quirky judge sentenced them to 6 months hard marriage to work through their marital vows before their frozen cash can be touched. As what the trailer had already explicitly spelt out it's War of the Roses in Mr and Mrs Smith styled couchtherapy sessions by Queen Latifah with comedy ranging from the slapstick to the plain juvenile toilet tricks.Attempts to elevate the movie and give the characters more depth come in the form of Jack Fuller learning to believe in himself and to shed his playboy noncommittal ways and with Joy McNally having to learn to let her hair down lighten up and basically doing something she loves rather than to continue doing things that she dislikes in true live your dream fashion. And throw in a quirky boss and ideal parents into the mix you'd have a whole host of supporting cast to boost variety in this rather predictable tale where you can see the outcome shining brightly like a star in a moonless night.I thought Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz could be playing themselves i.e. one's dating an older woman the other other no qualms in dating younger men. Well at least their characters had never felt the need to reveal their ages but you can tell Diaz is a spring chicken no longer since her big screen debut in The Mask. Typical of all her roles Diaz again plays a ditzy blonde with quirky skill sets and I thought somebody should really consider giving her a role in an action movie since she has on display really menacing looking biceps and a scene where she got to show off her combo moves of a right hook and reverse roundhouse kick.Kutcher on the other hand is well Kutcher from Punk'd with nothing really new offered in his role of the smooth talking slacker with brooding good looks. Instead the one who stole the show was sidekick Rob Corddry as Hater Fuller's best friend and lawyer. He would already be familiar to some as the crazy Homeland Security agent in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay and I'd stick my neck out to say this is one guy to watch over the next few comedic movies as he totally let it rip in this movie with his crazy antics.At best What Happens in Vegas is ideal for those itching for yet another formulaic romantic comedy from the factories of Hollywood or for those who missed out on the hot tickets for Speed Racer. Stay behind after the end credits roll for a final coda. There are 2 at the beginning of the end credits but hold out right until the end before you decide to make for the exit.";

The film is pretty predictable to the viewer but that doesn't make it bad. It's not a typical Hollywood flick. It may be basic with storyline and humour but somehow it still appeals to many people.Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher both play fantastic roles as always. In the film they both act about 10 years old playing jokes on each other and just having a good time. They play there characters incredibly well. In my opinion Kutcher has played his most energized performance to date.What happens in Vegas is an exceedingly bright comedy and Diaz and Kutcher seem to work well together and have fun playing their roles with each other. The start of the film is basically like many other film set in Sin City but it eventually settles into a rhythm.Tom Vaughan  the director  structures this film in a way that makes it enjoyable compared to some other similar RomCom's. I recommend watching if you have liked previous RomCom's. Something about this particular film makes is stand out from other classic movie's.".

Most movies remade from old TV series ignore the stars that made them popular enough to BE remade  kudos to the producers of this film who apparently know better.Other roles are filled capably the biggest surprise for me was Jodie Foster whom I normally dislike on screen.  She is very impressive in a rare comedic role and thankfully discards her repetoire of facial tics for a much more natural performance here.  The plot is kept pretty simple until near the end  and the end has a great twist which I won't divulge.

After the several failures of Red KitLucky Luke's cinema adaptation between 19911993 Roy Huggins's Maverick TVseries of 1950s' had been enriched with the HannaBarbera vision of Lucky Luke1984 TVcartoon series to integrate the whole concept of writing a new modern day Maverick by the writer William Goldman. There are a bunch of similarities between these two Western legends but still Maverick's story was unique and impressive. Here in my review I would much rather talk about this movie itself instead of its production values. Anyway if you would like to share your opinions with me and everybody else visit my message board topic with the title 40 factors that Lucky Luke and Maverick have in common.Director Donner has preferred a leftinthemiddle Adventure type opening right away in the first scene as if it's a continuation to Maverick's adventures. His antagonist performed by British actor Alfred Molina has left him in a trapped dilemma that appears to our eyes as Maverick is just about to die. As the widely known old saying says A person recalls his life just before he dies  Maverick starts to tell his story to sum up the reason how he ended up being in that deadly dilemma. Under his narration we're welcomed to a heartwarmingly told weirdo story. He's been collecting money to enroll in a Poker tournament and travelling the country through several adventures.What makes Maverick memorable and unique in style is first of all the mood. There is a political filmnoir view that we get every time we meet a new character. Every single character even the cameos in this movie is so selfish rebel and against the law. Robbery racketeering murder gambling bribery deception is a musthave character profile for all. The sheriff of a town is in debt with fugitives. A credible police chief steals a 500000 poker tournament prize from his son. A son of a police chief is a bandit. Well his father known as the most credible police chief in Western America and he even steals money from his own single child son. Even the most likable Jodie Foster's Annabelle character tries to steal money from everywhere she fools every man to steal their wallet even from a dead old poor wagon rider It's very absurd and reasonable at the same time that this is the greatest dreamy Western adventureland ever that the audience is witnessed.After this great accomplishment who cares if there are gaps in the plot? Indians might be so friendlyespecially after Dances With Wolves all the American Indians in Western movies somehow has become very friendly. All the bandits might be sappy. Set Designs might be cheap and distracting. Audio and sound effects might be the lowest quality. But still with craggy zigzagged narrated style of editing works perfect and thus the film always rises unexpected incidents and surprises. The zigzags of the storytelling keeps the viewers' attention on trying to find the reasons why each character chooses to do what they do. Cinematography and directing of photography are also admirable. The sceneries are taken in rivers of Arizona uplands of Oregon canyons of Utah prairies of Washington Yosemite National Park of California. It feels like a falsely guided visit to Western states Maverick says that he's going to the poker tournament in New York while in the actual Earth geography he's in Yosemite. This film was nominated only in Costume Design category at the Academy Awards but instead Hugo Weaving  Guy Pearce's Australian desert comedy won it.Maverick can be seen entirely by everyone. Mostly with humour and filmnoir comedy of Old West it's also worth your time for PokerRoad Trip SceneriesAdventureCowboy GunfightsLiving with the Indians segments.".

This western is really a lot more of a comedy but so was the TV show on which it was based. In the movie we get some really neat twists at the end too. Kudos also for including TV's original Maverick  James Garner  in this film.Mel Gibson the new Maverick and Jodie Foster play off each other well in the leads and Graham Greene has some very funny lines as a supporting player. Alfred Molina James Coburn Geoffrey Lewis also shine in supporting performances and it is really fun to see all the cameo appearances in here. Included in there were a couple of oldtime western movie stars along with countrywestern singers all at a big card game at the end.Another plus are the two songs during the ending credits. There is rousing CW rendition of Amazing Grace followed by a good Randy Newman song called Ride Gambler Ride. They are worth sticking around and hearing.One negative about this film the message seems to be that cheating lying and just being a dishonorable person if okay if you can get away with it!! Only in Hollywood!".

	schema:reviewBody "Starring Mel Gibson Jodie Foster James Garner Ah the old west. Personally I'm not big into western movies which would probably explain why I like this movie. It isn't a western. It just happens to take place in the old west. Maverick is the story of a poker player Gibson who is going against all odds to get into a championship poker tournament to find out once and for all just how good he really is.The movie starts with Bret Maverick at the end of a noose sitting on a horse out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by the men who put the noose around his neck in the first place. Then the movie goes into a flashback that tells about the week leading up to this point. A very large chunk of the movie takes place in the flashback.Bret hasn't had the best of luck over the last week. His horse was stolen and he had to replace it with a donkey his friends double cross him when it comes to issues of money that they owe him he nearly gets his butt kicked after a game of poker goes sour his lucky shirt gets shrunk and all sorts of other misfortunes. While playing poker he meets Mrs. Annabelle Bransford Foster a thief who is also trying to get into the poker tournament. They get stuck riding on the same stagecoach together along with Marshal Zane Cooper Garner. True to Bret's luck the driver has a heart attack and the coach goes out of control. He plays the hero and stops it of course since he is the hero of the movie and they continue along on their way to the tournament.They encounter a group of settlers that have been robbed by Indians or at least who believe they have been robbed by Indians and Bret agrees to help them get back their stuff for a cut of the money he'd be recovering for them. He finds the group of whites who were masquerading as Indians and gets the goods from them and then when they return the goods real Indians show up ones that are actually friends with Bret. The encounter between the Indians and the settlers is one of the more hilarious parts of the movie.After Bret goes along with the Indians and has some interesting encounters with them we finally catch up to the present where Bret is dangling from that noose again. He gets out of it and makes his way to the poker tournament.I'm not going to say whether he wins or loses the tournament but I'm sure you can guess. But if you haven't seen this movie before there are probably quite a few things you won't be able to guess as this movie has many different plot twists and turns along the way. It's absolutely hilarious and in my opinion a classic.Bottom Line 4 out of 4 own this movie".

The movie brings to mind Blazing Saddles and Butch Cassidy   The Sundance Kid.  In fact the screen writer wrote the latter film though this one fells a bit more like The Sting with all its cons and scams. I also enjoyed the cinematography and locations.  The movie goes from Lake Powell to  Owens Valley to  Yosemite and a beautiful river boat in Oregon.  I may be a bit biased towards this film because I walked the set in Yosemite Valley  but I'm still giving it an 8  10.".

I may be a bit biased towards this film because I walked the set in Yosemite Valley  but I'm still giving it an 8  10.";

	schema:reviewBody "As TV show adaptations go Maverick is a movie that excels because of a rollicking sense of fun and good humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I think everyone involved is perfectly chosen for the job. The film opens with Mel Gibson's eponymous gambler out to prove he's the best poker player. He's 3000 short of the 25000 buyin and his quest finds him in an unlikely partnership with likeminded gamblers Annabelle Bransford Jodie Foster and Marshall Zane Cooper James Garner. And it's a journey that will see our hero tangle with rattlesnakes renegade Indians and even a runaway stagecoach.Maverick is an ActionAdventureWesternComedy that runs high on likability and even a few great setpieces. Everyone involved is clearly having fun and it goes a long way in inviting the audience in on the laugh. It's the kind of TV show adaptation that doesn't require the viewer to have seen the original show. There's enough here in the engaging protagonist to keep the audience interested in the free standing story. And what an affable hero Maverick is a role that greatly benefits from Mel Gibson's trademark boyish charm and joking sense of humor. It's not just Gibson Foster and Garner also show an unexpected flair for comedy. Maybe the real star of Maverick is William Goldman's terrific screenplay one that infuses the movie with a delightfully wry sense of humor and lightheartedness. In almost every scene things aren't always as they seem and it's usually played to great comedic effect. This is the movie that made me a Goldman fan in my defense I haven't yet seen his greatest hits so to speak. I found myself constantly grinning from ear to ear. You don't even have to be a Western fan to appreciate Maverick. It's just an overall likable movie.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Maverick is a comedy Western which relates the adventures of Bret Maverick a gambler and adventurer in the Old West. It is based apparently on a television series from the 1950s but I am too young to remember it indeed I am not sure if it was ever shown in Britain. Maverick wants to enter a major poker tournament but lacks the entry fee of 25000. The film tells the story of how he manages to scrape together the required money and what happens to him during the tournament itself as well as his dealings with three people he meets along the way Marshal Zane Cooper a lawman based upon Wyatt Earp a rival poker player named Angel ironically as he is far from angelic and a young thief and conwoman named Annabelle Bransford.The film stars two actors Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster whom I would not normally have associated with comedy. Gibson had previously made the light actionadventure films Bird on a Wire and the Lethal Weapon films contain some elements of humour but Maverick is the closest he had yet come to pure comedy. As for Jodie while she had made some comedies such as Bugsy Malone in her teenage days by 1994 she had become regarded as a rather serious intense young actress. Her previous film before this one was Sommersby another costume drama set in the late nineteenth century but much more serious.Both however reveal their previously hidden comic talents here which is just as well. Neither Maverick nor Annabelle is morally speaking a particularly admirable individual. He is a wisecracking adventurer who lives by his wits his code of ethics as a professional gambler might prevent him from cheating at the poker table but he is not always so scrupulous in other areas of his life although he is occasionally capable of a generous gesture. She makes a living out of stealing and swindling normally from men who are attracted to her good looks. As neither is admirable therefore it was important to make them sympathetic and both Gibson and Foster succeed in this. Gibson's Maverick comes across as a likable rogue and Foster makes Annabelle sexy and winning enough for us to overlook the fact that she is a scheming minx. Another good performance comes from James Garner as Cooper in the sort of injoke that modern casting directors love Garner played Bret Maverick in the television series.The film was directed by Richard Donner who had earlier directed Gibson in three instalments of the Lethal Weapon franchise and was later to direct him in a fourth as well as in Conspiracy Theory. Donner is an experienced director of action films and manages to make the film an entertaining mixture of humour and thrills often combining the two in the same scene such as the one where Maverick is desperately trying to stop a runaway stagecoach in which he Annabelle and Cooper are travelling. Unlike some other films from this period starring Gibson e.g. The Man without a Face or Foster e.g. Nell there is nothing very deep or serious about Maverick. For all that however it makes entertaining viewing. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the horror movie genres in existence ghost stories have always been my personal favorites. The Haunting JuOn The Innocents Ringu The Shining...all nice moody creepy ghost tales. The Eye now finds itself at the top of my list along with the aforementioned as one of the best and creepiest ghost stories of all time.Mun blind since the age of 2 receives the gift of a cornea transplant at the age of twenty. Her restored vision comes with a price however. She can no longer play with the all blind symphony that she once found solace within she cannot read or write having had no reason to learn and she has no words for visible objects having always identified them by touch. She's also seeing things that nobody else can see...terrifying things. A little boy looking for his lost report card plagues her daily. An old woman wanders the hospital corridors complaining of the cold. Shadowy forms come to escort the recently deceased away to parts unknown and Mun's own bedroom flickers in the darkness changing into another room that once belonged to another girl in another country. Mun knows that the things she sees are not normal but no one seems to believe her not even at first the cute doctor who is trying to help her. Mun finds herself alone in a frightening world filled with things she never wanted to see. When Mun and the cute doctor finally learn the identity of the donor whose corneas Mun has received they also learn of her frightening abilities her sad death and a terrible tragedy which is destined to repeat itself. The Eye is an original and innovative film and yet it is also a perfect mixture of plot points and elements drawn from such previous films as The Sixth Sense The Mothman Prophecies and Blink all of which are very good films in their own right. The Eye knows exactly how to scare you and does so without a drop of blood or a hint of gore. A scene in a calligraphy class provides a truly frightening shock while a scene in an elevator is an exercise in slow building dread which grows more excruciating by the second. The performances are all wonderful and the feelings of loss alienation fear and determination are genuine and powerful. Fans of the aforementioned films would do well to seek this one out as would ghost enthusiasts and Asian Horror aficionados. It's rare these days that a film will actually make me jump gasp and check the corners of my bedroom for boogeymen but this one spooked me very well indeed  and I watched it in the middle of a bright sunny day. The Eye tells a good story and tells it well with strong characters and genuine scares. It is never dull or cheap or overly dramatic. Highly HIGHLY recommended!!!".

While most HK films nowadays involve big pop stars in pointless romantic comedies this film and also Infernal Affairs show that there are still talented filmmakers in HK.The story is about a blind girl named Mun getting a cornea transplant. When she gets her vision back she begins seeing supernatural beings ghosts to be precise. For the first half of the story we see her experiencing all these haunting encounters. One notable scene is in an elevator. The mystery and creepiness in this first half is incredibly effective and wellmade.The same cannot be said about the second half though. Like The Ring or Ringu Mun travels to Thailand to figure out the origin of the owner of her cornea. What starts out as a supernatural thriller turns into a mystery.The film seems to be a mix of The Sixth Sense Ringu and a touch of Final Destination. The switch of style in the middle and toward the end is somewhat annoying. The ending is an effort of the directors to show that they can do big CGI action sequences too. But this film would have been good enough to stand on its own without that.The acting is pretty good. Angelica Lee as Mun is very believable. The same cannot be said about the doctor though. I think this is mostly because his character's motivations are not convincing enough. Why does he give up his whole career to travel all the way to Thailand to help her after meeting her for a few times only? For love? Probably...but I don't buy it at all.Overall this film is pretty good. It is a nice effort from promising directors.".

A good reference is BLINK where Madeleine Stowe was the receiver of the creepy transplants suddenly able to see events from the past and future. Here the main character Mun Angelica Lee a blind violinist receives the transplants. Slowly albeit a little too slowly she becomes aware that aside from being able to see the world for the first time she can also see the souls of the recently departed who also seem oddly attracted to her. That she eventually sees the owner of the eyes a girl about her age through her own reflection is an interesting but not especially shocking twist but her plight to Thailand to track down the mystery behind the girl and what she finds there does generate some needed tension.With this film the Pang brothers only add to the growing statement that Asian horror is on the rise. While this is probably not the most memorable of the lot it does have its own style which is deliberately slow much like THE SIXTH SENSE. The way these ghosts appear to her echo that film in tone and dread and there are no sudden shocks here. Angelica Lee with a totally expressive face conveys the horror and then determination of a girl caught under a remarkable circumstance without betraying her own character development. The only sequence which rings false  or forced as to bring some impact  is where she runs through the streets knowing that disaster is about to strike in the form of a gasoline tank banging at car windows. I feel that THE EYE didn't need this sequence to be a chiller  it kept reminding me of the similar climactic sequence in THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES  and is the one point that detracts from the films honesty.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good little Asian horror film that I would definitely recommend renting or even buying if you like foreign films. A young blind woman receives a cornea transplant and soon finds out that she got way more than she bargained for when she starts being visited by some very unhappy dead souls. It's not very original true but the acting is good the lead character played by Angelica Lee is that her name? is adorable as is the little girl who plays Ying Ying there is some serious tension and dread here especially in the first half hour. The scene in the hospital hallway had my skin trying to crawl off my body as well as the Why are you sitting in my chair? scene. We're talking serious chills. Some of the music IS a bit cheesy and over the top but hey you can't have everything right? The scenes where we see through Mun's eyes in the first few minutes are very effective we know someone is standing there we just don't know who it is and we feel her fear and uncertainty. Not the best movie ever made but it's definitely worth seeing.Before I close I would like to respond to the attitude expressed here by some people that American films are all stupid and that American filmgoers are all drooling idiots who have to see a throat slashed every few minutes in order to be engaged by a movie. When you make comments like that you really show how ignorant you are when it comes to American cinema as some of the finest movies ever made came right out of Hollywood and no they aren't all slasher films or mindless teen comedies. But then I'm sure you folks already know that you just want to feel intellectually superior to others. I enjoy a good foreign film and so do many Americans but just because they're foreign doesn't mean they're perfect.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a good little Asian horror film that I would definitely recommend renting or even buying if you like foreign films. A young blind woman receives a cornea transplant and soon finds out that she got way more than she bargained for when she starts being visited by some very unhappy dead souls. It's not very original true but the acting is good the lead character played by Angelica Lee is that her name? is adorable as is the little girl who plays Ying Ying there is some serious tension and dread here especially in the first half hour. The scene in the hospital hallway had my skin trying to crawl off my body as well as the Why are you sitting in my chair? scene. We're talking serious chills. Some of the music IS a bit cheesy and over the top but hey you can't have everything right? The scenes where we see through Mun's eyes in the first few minutes are very effective we know someone is standing there we just don't know who it is and we feel her fear and uncertainty. Not the best movie ever made but it's definitely worth seeing.Before I close I would like to respond to the attitude expressed here by some people that American films are all stupid and that American filmgoers are all drooling idiots who have to see a throat slashed every few minutes in order to be engaged by a movie. When you make comments like that you really show how ignorant you are when it comes to American cinema as some of the finest movies ever made came right out of Hollywood and no they aren't all slasher films or mindless teen comedies. But then I'm sure you folks already know that you just want to feel intellectually superior to others. I enjoy a good foreign film and so do many Americans but just because they're foreign doesn't mean they're perfect. They have flaws just like any other human effort so please get over yourselves and try to watch movies with an open mind because you'll enjoy them much more that way. That's just my two cents.Watch this movie it's good.";

The fact that a lot of people don't 'get' the parts of this film which seem to have no relevance is probably as much due to the difference in culture more than any wrongdoing on the production team's behalf. The same can be said for a lot of Hong Kong comedies the 'humour' which would probably illicit a wry laugh back home flies miles over everybody else's head.In that sort of circumstance I've developed a good trick I switchoff trying to figure out what all these little hints and gestures mean and concentrate on the character interactions and the scares. I've had a lot of practice Western cinema in recent years has been guilty of 'rambling' and they've got no such excuse as 'cultural differences' Anyway the movie! good grief! the plot's already been explained and probed so I won't go into that. What this film has is a constant 'pressure' a claustrophobic atmosphere which persists regardless of the location. Clever camera work afoot! The palpable distance which the heroine feels from her family and the people around her perhaps a symptom of not being able to communicate nonverbally with them so long? Perhaps not but it's there is always there too. You get the impression that she could be surrounded by a crowd and still walk alone from one side of a city to the other.The smaller roles are played out very nicely great acting considering the film concentrates almost solely on the two main characters.The ending is a little bit of a letdown predictable and not entirely 'working'. But BUT it isn't a catastrophe which ruins the film which I'm sure you'll know what I mean. The ending of a film is what you're left with when you switch off the TV and if it's bad then so is the film.This movie is the only one in recent years which actually gave me a start and that's something. Real horror isn't about dripping guts and hooks with heads on them it's about the unexpected it's about being confronted with something terrifying something which makes you wish the character was elsewhere. In order to achieve that you need to give a damn about the character in the first place which is where 90 of cheap horrors fall down. Not here the characters are likable and have a little childlike innocence about them you want to get in there and slap the more unpleasant visitors PAll in all I very much enjoyed watching this film and intend to buy it when I find it for a pittance almost all DVDs can be found for the right price at one time or another shop around and ask people where they get their bargains. I would heartily recommend renting before buying however. As several have mentioned already there are several elements of this film which seem to have been deliberately copied from recent films such as Sixth Sense. If that prospect leaves a sour taste I'd look elsewhere but everyone else who hasn't had enough of all that yet should certainly have a look DThanks for reading.".

Directing shooting editing lighting soundtrack  sound effects really check these out!  just simply amazing  Hollywood pay attention !I guess one of the reasons this experience was so eerie was that the spoken language was Chinese so I understood what was going on because of the subtitles but the mumblings and other horrible voices were 'not familiar' to me it made the movie even more scary. I know this review is a bit weird but it's written by a guy who's still messed up from yesterday by The Eye. I'm checking the closets looking over my shoulder. I'm still scared as hell.If you ever have a chance  check out The Eye. Turn off the lights put a little more volume on your speakers than usual  and prepare to be SCARED. 10 !".

	schema:headline " Not so much a Scare Fest than a decent thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "About three months ago I was paging through cable and found a film that looked intriguing. After watching for about five minutes I had the pants scared off of me so being the complete wuss I am I turned it off. Curiosity made me want to go back to it of course so about twenty minutes later I got up the guts to turn it back on. After about two minutes I was full on terrified and turned it off for good. I told some friends about this film and all seemed intrigued mainly because of the scare factor so this weekend we got around to finally watching it. That movie of course was the Pang Brothers' The Eye a film that ended up being something completely different than what I was expecting.In The Eye Wong Kar Mun Lee is a young blind woman who gets a corneal transplant. Soon after her operation as her eyes are adjusting she begins to see some pretty scary images shadowy black figures hanging around people who later die dead people themselves and her room keeps doing a pesky trick where it changes on her as she's looking at it furniture and all. Her doctor Dr. Lo a really young looking Edmund Chen doesn't believe her at first but then realizes that there may be some merit to her claims so they go in search of the donor in order to find out what history her eyes' previous owner had and what kind of baggage Wong Kar Mun has to deal with now.Based on my first impressions of the film I was actually expecting a big scare fest like The Grudge short on story big on scares. What I actually realized is that the two parts that I briefly watched were actually two out of the three genuinely scary parts of the film. The elevator scene was enough to make me take the stairs today at work seriously. The rest of the film is certifiably creepy but there is actually a decent story to support those creepy parts.

Some of the special effects in The Eye were kind of cheesy basically SciFi channel madeforcable television caliber and in typical Chinese film fashion the music was horrible but all told it is a decent film.After doing a little reading on the film I saw that Tom Cruise's production company bought the rights to the film and are planning a remake. I'm not very educated on Asian horror films and their American remakes yet but I think I would see it just out of mere curiosity because I would imagine that they would take this relatively small film and mess with it to make it bigger.

	onyx:emotionText "About three months ago I was paging through cable and found a film that looked intriguing. After watching for about five minutes I had the pants scared off of me so being the complete wuss I am I turned it off. Curiosity made me want to go back to it of course so about twenty minutes later I got up the guts to turn it back on. After about two minutes I was full on terrified and turned it off for good. I told some friends about this film and all seemed intrigued mainly because of the scare factor so this weekend we got around to finally watching it. That movie of course was the Pang Brothers' The Eye a film that ended up being something completely different than what I was expecting.In The Eye Wong Kar Mun Lee is a young blind woman who gets a corneal transplant. Soon after her operation as her eyes are adjusting she begins to see some pretty scary images shadowy black figures hanging around people who later die dead people themselves and her room keeps doing a pesky trick where it changes on her as she's looking at it furniture and all. Her doctor Dr. Lo a really young looking Edmund Chen doesn't believe her at first but then realizes that there may be some merit to her claims so they go in search of the donor in order to find out what history her eyes' previous owner had and what kind of baggage Wong Kar Mun has to deal with now.Based on my first impressions of the film I was actually expecting a big scare fest like The Grudge short on story big on scares. What I actually realized is that the two parts that I briefly watched were actually two out of the three genuinely scary parts of the film. The elevator scene was enough to make me take the stairs today at work seriously. The rest of the film is certifiably creepy but there is actually a decent story to support those creepy parts. The Eye has no doubt been compared to The Sixth Sense in terms of theme but it is also similar in substance as well. Even without the scares the film would be able to stand on its other merits. Some of the special effects in The Eye were kind of cheesy basically SciFi channel madeforcable television caliber and in typical Chinese film fashion the music was horrible but all told it is a decent film.After doing a little reading on the film I saw that Tom Cruise's production company bought the rights to the film and are planning a remake.

	schema:reviewBody "The Eye ...SpoilersFirst blush reaction to this film while it was on is that it would never have been made without the conceptual model provided by The Sixth Sense. Our heroine does indeed see dead people and like the tragic little kid in that seminal thriller her gift of seeing that which 99.99 of the people can't see is a life and mindthreatening  curse. Her sanity is soon enough questioned by herself and those who love her cranking up the angst factor already established by floating corpses following her and her glimpses of flickering black specters mutely leading people away at the time of their death.There the similarity of copy to pattern pretty much ends.Like the American 'The Ring' 'can't speak for the Japanese original this film rather too quickly and completely breaks down into a mundane investigative procedural just when the mindbendingly creepy stuff is beginning to really take hold of the film. The rationale for the eerie stuff for this viewer anyway could have come off any of a number of madeforTV films of the supernatural from the 70s and 80s. It's that tame and lame.Maybe no rationale could be as strong as what is implied in the early going of this film as the heroine's world reels off its axis into darkness. But I believe it could be as strong and these filmmakers simply failed to crack the code. Aside from questions about the strength of the rationale here why feel at all that you have to halt an overthetop experience for the cutanddried sensemaking of a standard detective story? Do all supernatural films cry out for Scooby Doostyle windups? Understand unlike the old Scoob toons this film stays true to it's supernatural premise. But the rationale for what is happening feels alternately too vague or too specific in the wrong places rings false and eventually sinks beneath detective story rationalizing to big tearsfortheheroine soap opera bathos. By this point if you are like me you will feel real pity not for the heroine but for the Pang Brothers for beginning their nifty little film with such atmosphere and style only to miss several turns and wind up Nowheresville.In the final analysis this film's trouble is one common to most 'entertainment' films today a slambang setup one that sells the film to producers and studio and audience and may be the films sole reason for existing disintegrating because of a pathetically weak followthrough. Wild hook concepts are neat but they're not enough. The most promising joke burdened by a letdown punchline isn't worth starting to tell.".

The spectacular climax helps somewhat but overall it is quite an unsatisfying movie. There are some creepy and atmospheric moments in the first half of the film but descriptions of it being the scariest movie since 'The Exorcist' are absolutely ridiculous and can only help create a negative reaction. Also one thing that really niggled at me throughout  a cornea transplant enabling the recipient to see the dead is something I can accept in a horror film but to HEAR them too is a bit on the silly side! Anyway despite 'The Eye's flaws I still found it to be more interesting and entertaining than 'Ringu'. I just wish the Pang brothers had spent more time on the script which really dragged this one down.

There didn't seem to be a whole lot of originality in the movie the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment and the second half of the movie descended deep into the realm of the ridiculous.

Was the operation really worth it  whose cornea's does she have exactly?This Hong Kong British  Singapore coproduction was edited co written  directed by Oxide Pang Chun  Danny Pang as the Pang Brothers  in my opinion this is yet another overrated Asain horror ghost story which didn't do much for at all. The script by the Pang Brothers  Jo Jo Yuetchun Hui feels like The Sixth Sense 1999  I couldn't get the scene of Haley Joel Osment saying the infamous line 'I see dead people' out of my head as that's basically the whole plot of Gin Gwai in a rather literal sense. Personally I thought it was a touch slow going at times I thought it was repetitive  just didn't really hook or interest me much at all. I found the character's dull the dialogue simple I thought it was very predictable  the socalled twist parallel type ending sucked. I'm sorry but I just couldn't get into the film at all  I was glad when it finished which is never a good sign.Director's the Pang Brothers do OK they use a variety of annoying techniques like skipping frames changing from colour to black and white  all the other editing  camera tricks we've all seen loads of times before. I hear how lots of people say how scary Gin Gwai is it may be to some but I thought it was pretty lame in the scares department as the ghosts don't really do anything there's no excitement no tension  no atmosphere either. I certainly didn't have any problems sleeping last night after I saw it. Gin Gwai relies on storytelling to get it's point across so don't expect any gore or special effects as there aren't any.Technically the film is OK I only saw it a few hours ago  I can barely remember a single scene from it so that says everything really. The acting is hard to judge as everyone speaks in different languages.Gin Gwai didn't do a thing for me to be honest it's watchable I suppose  tells a story but I'm not a fan.

Go see it for yourself.Take my word for it this truly scary flick will trigger fear you don't know you possessed. Its phantasmic moods and imagery will linger in the dark recesses of your mind long after its final reels ended.Not since The Ring has a horror film incited such twisted dread and rampant imagination amongst its viewers. You can't quite place it but THE EYE will definitely scare you silly with its uniquely Asian sensibilities and haunting sequences. Look out for the Lift and Stairs segment. It'll leave you gasping. As an added bonus not present in most horror films The Eye is also not content with scaring you silly. It also had many poignant elements thrown in for good measure. Issues explored included meditation on the role of fate and predestination and the strength of kinship. All these made it very harder for me to reconcile with the gnawing fear it instilled in me and the genuinely heartfelt emotions it sneaked in the process. In conclusion this is one of the most unforgettable film of the year.And you have been warned.".

	onyx:emotionText "Have you seen my report card.To have such a simple line bringing with it an utterly terrifying chill is an achievement in itself. Don't believe me? Go see it for yourself.Take my word for it this truly scary flick will trigger fear you don't know you possessed. Its phantasmic moods and imagery will linger in the dark recesses of your mind long after its final reels ended.Not since The Ring has a horror film incited such twisted dread and rampant imagination amongst its viewers. You can't quite place it but THE EYE will definitely scare you silly with its uniquely Asian sensibilities and haunting sequences. Look out for the Lift and Stairs segment. It'll leave you gasping. As an added bonus not present in most horror films The Eye is also not content with scaring you silly. It also had many poignant elements thrown in for good measure. Issues explored included meditation on the role of fate and predestination and the strength of kinship. All these made it very harder for me to reconcile with the gnawing fear it instilled in me and the genuinely heartfelt emotions it sneaked in the process. In conclusion this is one of the most unforgettable film of the year.And you have been warned.";

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of Japanese horror as well as the foreign film scene as a whole and by foreign I mean nonHollywood I was excited at the prospect of seeing this movie. I wasn't disappointed well for the most part anyway. It opens strongly with a narrative style as the young blind woman receives her eye transplants. As her sight returns we are greeted with the traditional Japanese style of under stated shock and horror. Creeping dread. As we are treated to the sights of blurred unfocused figures and images only the music and the subtle camera movements to tell us something is wrong. Soon however her seeing returns and we are treated to a more tangible horror and yet it is still treated with careful hands and controlling care. There are shocks aplenty and a few quiet scares that are hardly noticeable but when you do boy do they freak you out! Unfortunately as it is with many Hollywood films nowadays the ending is what lets this film down. During the latter half of the film the focus turns from the slow horror to a plot that most of us have seen before and we are dealt a final sequence that seems unconnected and distant from the rest of the movie. With no discernable conclusion or understanding to come from the film you're left with a feeling of a wasted movie with such promise from the rest of the story. Still perhaps this is a sign of a reversal of the movie syndrome to date a foreign film that doesn't quite make it at the end has now been bought by Hollywood perhaps they could turn it around. Still I would recommend seeing this version now some of the scenes will have you totally creeped out.".

By brilliantly and hilariously segueing between the real players and the fantasy characters their actions affect this film authentically captures what a true tabletop role playing game RPG session entails and the fun of imagining how your decisions plays out ingame.Despite the fact that this film had practically no budget and all parties on both sides of the camera have little to no experience the writing direction and editing more than compensate for these issues as many of the jokes roll 20 and score a direct hit.If you've ever cast the die or were curious about what is the appeal of tabletop RPGs then you must find a way to see this film at least once in your lifetime.";

Could I believe back then that anyone would rather go out with a beautiful intelligent young woman than hang out with his best friends playing adventure games? No!

This is another film from the that group I love Dead Gentlemen and they did it again.Not much I can say it's parody on the RPG counter culture but it does it cleverly mainly on it's format which is kinda similar to the fantasy films The Neverending Story and The Princess Bride it makes perfect sense because that's exactly what playing the game is like roll the dice make whatever moves your character can make all to imagine the outcome of your actions.The action is good the choreography actually does look up to par. The music is also good though it's not as memorable but their still good tracks. The make up work on monsters is good. The locations they used were solid they worked well with whatever they could get. The special effects are decent not too shabby but what can you expect from a low budget amateur film. But the really magic is once again in it's script the dialog is just very good it's above average writing. I really like what the characters say they all have some good memorable lines. It's once again an example of verbal humor going together well with visual humor and I'm a fan of verbal humor.The only problem with this film is just simply that it was too short may'be it was because of budget or this was how it was meant to be but still I really felt like the film could of had some more minutes in it that campaign the characters were on could of been a bit longer.But oh well overall The Gamers is a solid fantasy film so if anyone is a fan of RPG board games or video games or even a fan of the fantasy genre then The Gamers is a game you can't lose.Rating 3 stars".

That's the case when we push PAUSE button. The film makers had to meet these situation a thousand times to show them so precisely and very funny form. Beyond the fun with the time other extreme RPG situations like 'you can do it since there's no rule against this' and the power of dice  rolling 20 and hit in almost impossible circumstances and rolling 1 for a really easy task and fail are also well caught. And much more.I'm quite sure that some players will recognize his own party members when look at the players in the film. The guy who just drop by roll some dices and goes. The rule master who knows the rules better then the DM. They are so typical characters.You won't get high profile fantasy scenes from this film like movies which created from a few million dollars but The Gamers have a fair look and it's enough to tell the story. I especially liked its music which can be mostly created on a simple synthesizer. Doesn't matter. It gives the desired feeling anyway.I think this film got the point in all sense.

The writing is entertaining dearly love the backstabbing with the balista and at times very witty Next there will be killing followed by a light salad ...  And you will NOT see the ending coming.If you are a gamer this is a must see. If you know a gamer this is a must see. If you are not a gamer see it with a gamer and have them explain any jokes you miss but I think you'll have a good time just the same. It's short but it's well worth the price of the DVD.";

	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to what you may think initially nothing happens by coincidence on Arlington Road.'  Outstanding performances by Jeff Bridges As Michael Faraday and Tim Robbins Oliver Lang highlight this taut thriller about terrorism in America a disturbing film instilled with a sense of loss fear and paranoia.  Director Mark Pellington perhaps does not mine this vein to the depths but there is still a silver lining in this movie which contains elements of two of Alfred Hitchcock's classics The Man Who Knew Too Much' and North By Northwest.'  Had this film been made forty years ago in fact Hitchcock would have been at the helm and we would have had James Stewart instead of Bridges and Richard Widmark in place of Robbins.  When Jeff Bridges stars in a thriller you can usually bet that the project is going to be a cut above the average fare of the genre and this one is no exception arguably his best of it's kind since Jagged Edge.'  This is a riveting film and the tension builds steadily throughout as we uncover along with Faraday the dark secrets which ultimately lead to an explosive climax.  The excellent supporting cast includes Joan Cusack Hope Davis and Robert Gossett.  A trip to Arlington Road' is a jolt to the senses and may cause you to stop and rethink a few things about your life.  At the very least you're going to want to finally meet that neighbor who moved in across the street last year.  I rate this one 810.".

Last year it was BULWORTH and this year it's ARLINGTON ROAD.  Obviously after all that's happened this decade in America from Waco to Oklahoma City the time is ripe for a movie to explore the cracks in the American dream which brought about events like those.  This film ultimately asks more questions than it answers but that may just be a condition inherent to this type of film.  More troubling is two things 1 Though I agree with thoseand I'll try not to give away too much here who theorize the ending changes the whole perspective of the film there are still too many key narrative cheatsa conversation Robbins supposedly had with Bridges' son seems unbelievable and the traffic light scene near the end also is to make it fully effective 2 The film seems a little confused of what it's about it is a study of one man's psyche or the nation's?Still ARLINGTON ROAD shouldn't be dismissed.  There are troubling questions explored and you don't have to be a conspiracy nut to believe those socalled fringe hate groups are entering the mainstream at a frightening rate for a socalled civilized society.  The ending is also powerful and though I understand it more than anything else was responsible for the delays I applaud whoever was in charge for not changing itthough again how they got there is another story.  Bridges' performance is another thing which makes more sense once you look back with the ending of the film in mind and it doesn't seem like overacting.  Robbins is a little more problematic there are scenes where he's convincing and then scenes where he goes overthetop and shouldn't.  Hope Davis doesn't have a big part but she injects a lot into it as usual.  But the biggest surprise here is Joan Cusack.  Anyone who thinks of her only as a goodcomic actress will be in for a shock there's one scene involving her which is the scariest in the film.Again ultimately while it leaves you with nagging doubts about the quality ARLINGTON ROAD makes you think enough to recommend it.".

That's what's really frightening.";

	schema:headline " A hard core High Octane thriller with a terrible disturbing ending. 12 out of ";
	schema:reviewBody "ARLINGTON ROAD 1999 12Starring Jeff Bridges Tim Robbins Joan Cusack Hope Davis Mason Gamble and Robert Gossett Director Mark Pellington    117 minutes    Rated R for intense violent content and some language By Blake French Arlington Road is this year's Breakdown. It's filled to the rim with hard core high octane tension and suspenseso much that it is almost hard to catch your breath throughout the movie's running period.  Fueled with first rate performances and a script that is understandable and clear this may be one of the best thrillers. The movie starts off with a boy named Brady Lang who stumbles down Arlington Rd. with blood dripping from his body. Jeff Bridges who plays Michael Faraday a single professor who teachers a course on terrorism at a local university observes this terrified and injured child from inside his car as he drives by. After realizing the nature of his wounds he dashes out of his car to help. Michael rushes Brady to the nearest hospital in result he saves his life and meets some people whom he will soon wish he would have never laid eyes on. Wow. What an exhilarating opening scene. While it may be a little over the top it does provide the setup needed for such the brutal bloodthirsty film this really is. It is not a film for younger viewers and I would check into it some more if you're faint of heart or squeamish in any way. This movie takes itself seriously for every second of the way unlike many other scary movies out there today.Brady Lang belongs to a new family down the block from the Faraday's consisting of Oliver the friendly dad Cheryl almost eccentric wife and their children who are very bizarre acting. Quiet and suspicious almost as if they are holding something back.  When Michael and his girlfriend Brooke meet the Lang's they introduce them to his son ask them over for dinner sometime and look around their new house. Oliver is an architect currently working on a shopping mall somewhere out of town. But wait! When Michael was over there last he saw the blueprint to his so called mall and knows that this is no mall he his constructing. This makes Michael very wearily of his neighbors especially when he beholds Oliver's mail and discovers that there may have been a name change sometime ago in Lang's past. He brings these things to the attention to Brooke only to have her call him paranoid and that his occupation is getting to his head. That is also what his old buddy FBI Agent Whit Carver says to him when Michael asks him to do a background check on Oliver.Things really heat up when Michael discovers the truth behind his friendly neighbor's secret identity. Movie posters and newspaper ads suggest it. Previews and reviews reveal it and by the time the film takes an unexpected turn in the third act the only one suspecting Oliver Lang to be just an ordinary person is Michael. Arlington Road is smart enough to develop Jeff Bridge's character with feelings flashbacks and an emotional past rather than showing us the details of his past marriage. It is also smart enough not to develop a romantic subplot between Michael and Brooke beyond the suggestions and interest in each other. It stays on track every inch of the way all the scenes further the plot a little bit at a time. Leading us with a perfectly structured flawlessly planned out thriller. The performance by Jeff Bridges is so great and certainly Oscar worthy we actually buy into the paranoia plot and end up caring about him so much this movie's ending actually hurts to watch. It ruins the entire production. The last twenty minutes of this movie arrant just unbelievable but the closing scene features a sense of injustice unfairness and is unsettling beyond comprehension. All of this and I still have not revealed the actually end to you and will not. But I hated it and think the majority of an audience will join me in saying as the closing credits arouse on screen their jaw dropped off their face and hit the floor.However I do think the film is unconventional because of the thematic structure it used for its closing and subject madder. If it would have concluded in a predictable usual fashioned people would complain about that too. It proves how much we care about the characters. And at the same time allows us to realize that this film deserved better somewhere down the road it deserved to be much better.".

When new neighbours move in next door he begins to suspect that the husband Oliver Lang has a double life and may be part of an internal terrorist movement.  However as he looks into Lang's past the evidence seems to lead nowhere  is he just being paranoid?This starts well.  It feeds off the US paranoia that has arisen from the fact that they are as likely to be attacked from within as they are from external agents.  That said we are really not sure if Lang has a past or if Faraday is just paranoid.  This tension is good right up till the lines are drawn in the sand and goodies and baddies are identified.  At this point it becomes a more traditional cat and mouse thriller  but even then it is better than most of the same ilk.  The tension builds to a great ending whose only fault is dragging it's point out over a few minutes.Bridges is great as the crumbling Faraday  he sometimes get a little bugeye crazy at times but overall he works very well.  Robbins is also good for the most part  his average Joe with bite act is good and his ruthless terrorist maybe! has some genuine menace about it.  However outside of the main two I can't say anyone caught my eye in particular. but they were all good nevertheless.Overall this is a superior thriller that trades off USA fear of internal terrorism.

We both were so upset by the movie that I felt that I needed to communicate our feelings.We are frequent movie goers who are in our mid fifties.  We certainly are not prudes when it comes to our selection of entertainment.  We almost always pick an action or drama film and are used to not always coming away from a film feeling good.However this movie today was very disturbing to us.  In light of the problems with real life violence these days  we certainly did not need to watch what happened in this film.  I realize that we could have walked out when we felt uncomfortable but as I said we like action and drama.   The way the film ended was what truly disturbed us.  The fact that the bad guys won and the truth was not told was tragic way to leave the film.We saw this movie as encouragement for all of those nuts out there watching it.  They could see this and feel that they could also get away with such an evil deed.  We are very disappointed that Jeff Bridges would have performed in a movie with such an outcome.I am sure that there were many other people in the theater who felt the same way that we do but would not take the time to voice their opinions.I am sure that my writing this letter will have absolutely no effect on what is chosen for the big screen but I sure feel better for writing it!Nancy Marschak Santa Barbara CA".

We both were so upset by the movie that I felt that I needed to communicate our feelings.We are frequent movie goers who are in our mid fifties.  We certainly are not prudes when it comes to our selection of entertainment.  We almost always pick an action or drama film and are used to not always coming away from a film feeling good.However this movie today was very disturbing to us.  In light of the problems with real life violence these days  we certainly did not need to watch what happened in this film.  I realize that we could have walked out when we felt uncomfortable but as I said we like action and drama.   The way the film ended was what truly disturbed us.  The fact that the bad guys won and the truth was not told was tragic way to leave the film.We saw this movie as encouragement for all of those nuts out there watching it.  They could see this and feel that they could also get away with such an evil deed.  We are very disappointed that Jeff Bridges would have performed in a movie with such an outcome.I am sure that there were many other people in the theater who felt the same way that we do but would not take the time to voice their opinions.I am sure that my writing this letter will have absolutely no effect on what is chosen for the big screen but I sure feel better for writing it!Nancy Marschak Santa Barbara CA";

I was initially drawn to the film because of the lead actors Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins but I left feeling thoroughly disappointed at the way this fantastical tale was so crudely and clumsily constructed. Aside from the transparent screenplay and conspicuously poor direction I was generally distracted by Jeff Bridges wayoverthetop depiction of a terrorism professor who conveniently happens to have a bonafide terrorist and his lovely roboticlike wife and children move in across the street.Mr. Bridges is capable of much better acting than his selfconscious performance in this banal schlock represents but I suspect he got caught up in the trite melodrama of the story and couldn't resist gushing his lines at virtually every opportunity. His portrayal of the professor didn't remotely resemble a real human being and that is an essential prerequisite for the audience to identify with his character and truly care about what happens to him and his young son.Mr. Robbins performance on the other hand wasn't quite so histrionic but his reaction when Bridges character uncovers his true identity is wholly unconvincing and merely serves to epitomize a lackluster effort that doesn't begin to showcase his dynamic range as an actor.It seems unfortunate to bring together two gifted actors and then squander the possibility of having them truly connect and develop a compelling relationship but I suspect it was virtually impossible to overcome such a weak screenplay by Ehren Kruger and it is clear that the director Mark Pellington was incapable of pulling things together to create a textured and believable movie.I could go on ad nauseam to dissect this remarkably obtuse story and address each absurd plot point one by one but suffice it to say that the only reason I can think of to enter a theater to spend time with this film is to escape the heat of summer and take a nice nap.".

	schema:reviewBody "...... But getting there is a bumpy road. It might be easier to dismiss this plot as simply a paranoid fantasy had something like this not actually happened. Though the movie refers to an incident in St. Louis where a federal building was bombed it clearly is based on the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City. And its up to Jeff Bridges to prevent another such incident in Arlington Road. Bridges plays a history professor at George Washington University who specializes in acts of domestic terrorism. In fact his wife was an FBI agent killed in a botched raid on a separatist farm three years earlier. Now a new family in his suburban neighborhood seems to have a lot of things they are hiding. The father has changed his identity and had once tried to blow up a government agency with a pipe bomb. He claims to be an architect for structures like malls but he has all kinds of schematics in his home he will not allow anyone to see. Their oldest child almost blows his arm off with an explosive device. They lived in St. Louis when the previous bombing took place etc etc etc. Does the family across the street have a future bombing on their agenda now that they live in the Washington D.C. area???I can appreciate the acting directing and pacing of this film. It has a good cast and great production values. And the conclusion was well thought out and very very clever. But there are just too many silly scenes and coincidences that the entire plot is built on. If you apply logic to even a couple of them then this plot could not get from A to B. How big of a coincidence is it that Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack the bad guys end up moving right across the street from someone who so perfectly fits the kind of man they wish to frame? How does Bridges's grad student girlfriend just happen to be on the exact same level of the exact same shopping mall at the EXACT same time as Robbins so she can witness him up to no good? Not possible. No way. Awfully convenient that someone always seems to sneak up behind Bridges or his girlfriend just as they are about to discover something or say something important. And of course the soundtrack always provides a sharp dose strings and horns as they do. I think Ebert refers to these as stings. And how could so much of the bombing plot be left to the actions of someone not knowingly involved in it? Would this terrorist organization really hinge everything on Bridges being able to drive his damaged vehicle through heavy security and into the targeted building? And why does Bridges's cell phone connection with his FBI friend just happen to disconnect at a time when he could logically explain everything and prevent the attack. Oh hell. The ending is really cool at least. The entire film is a good time capsule from a point when Americans were most frightened by domestic enemies. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

His screenplay which he cowrote with cohort Jim Taylor is deeper than it appears on the surface.

My point is that Sideways is a great movie and nothing more. It doesn't rely on blockbuster star power. It doesn't need flashy special effects or gimmicks. Paul Giammatti performs flawlessly as a flawed and deeply troubled character. I found myself forgetting he was acting. I only saw the character he was playing and became engrossed by his presence. Thomas Haden Church offers a very nice contrast by playing what appears to be a twodimensional sophomoric womanizer. The story is simple and focuses more on character development. It is easy to connect with each of the main characters. They may not be likable but what they are is human. If you can't relate to them personally they remind you of a family member or close friend. Overall this film is for those who like movies based in reality which as you will see can produce some of the most bizarre and comical situations of all. If you like movies with jokes you don't have to think about Who doesn't from time to time don't worry this film has a surprisingly high amount of low brow immature vulgar humor mixed with the dry and subtle. Give it a try. 910".

It wasn't until now that I saw it and the reason is because I recently saw Payne's new film The Descendants and I fell in love with it. It wasn't just his simple writing but his direction the feel that he gave it. Sideways was another gem and an even better one.This could be called a dramedy in many ways a comedydrama. There are many films these days getting released that could be labeled in those two genres and yet Sideways makes it look easier than The Descendants even. What we have here is a brilliant script all around fully fleshing out these characters. And the investment I had with Giamatti... enormous. I was on this ride with him I felt his pain his anger his awkwardness when confronted with aggravating or tense situations. I found myself telling him things on the screen and even staying at the edge of my seat in a funny situation he is put in by his friend near the end. Whereas The Descendants lived on it's script through a lot of quiet moments Sideways blends in simple subtle moments with really incredible dialogue. The dialogue between the two was the main difference and yet Sideways is very much of the feeling one is put in. I want to say the ensemble cast is fantastic. Church really made me question just how much of a friend he was and yet still made him completely sympathetic and be able to be understood. As for Virginia Madsen... I felt like I was also falling for her like the lead. Some of her scenes especially the conversations between her and Giammatti she plays incredibly. She makes you feel the likability of her character and yet also feel the sensuality and the vulnerability that she is pushing through with her shared desire. She was fantastic. Giamatti is fantastic as the disappointing lead and although he always seems to play these sort of characters he knows what to do to make them completely work.Overall extremely satisfied with this and still here is the unique touch of real feeling for the characters that I witnessed in the Descendants. How could I not love this? Payne's film pushes through the screen what can only be described as an incredibly real connection a connection that I honestly don't witness very often with comedies.".

	schema:reviewBody "SIDEWAYS 2004  Paul Giamatti Thomas Haden Church Virginia Madsen Sandra Oh. DIR Alexander PayneA truly vintage comedy. Paul Giamatti is one of our finest character actors who seems to be neckandneck with William H. Macy on cornering the market of portraying losers as a cottage industry and in the latest endeavor of hapless misanthropes he may have found Oscar gold.Giamatti stars as Miles Raymond a miserable mope of a man who realizes he is never going to amount to anything especially given the fact that he is his own worst enemy in his highly critical outlook on life particularly on two things he holds dear his struggling attempts to become a writer of notice and his taste in wine. The latter leads him to a certain road trip to salvation when he embarks upon a few days of rr away from his stagnant day job as a middle school English teacher with his best friend and former college roomie Jack Church in easily the career defining role of his life since his hey day on the TV sitcom 'Wings' whose impending nuptials is Miles' wedding gift as the best man. Jack a longinthe tooth secondrate soap actor whose 15 minutes are at a close 1459 is adamant about getting laid for one last time before his commitment to a younger woman who clearly deserves better and Jack shrewdly knows this.As the duo drive through the sundappled wine country of Northern California in a road trip not unlike two virginal horny teens looking to pop their respective cherries they come across two unlikely conquests. One is the shapely and surprisinglydowntoearth waitress Maya Madsen in a career comeback of epic proportions shines through the Giamatti gloom who strikes a fancy to the depressed Miles while Jack has his sights on the sexy wine pourer Stephanie the sublimely reassuringly funny Oh and real  life wife to director Payne who also is charmed by the blithely feckless Jack. What unfolds is a sweet yet toogoodtobe true few days of bliss and unbridled emotional rescue for the foursome as they take to one another like ducks to water although Miles' hesitancy is deeply reasoned since he is still licking the open wounds of his twoyear old divorce.Payne one of my favorite filmmakers doesn't disappoint as he dollops evenly the tragiccomic proceedings with his frequent longtime collaborator Jim Taylor in adapting an unpublished novel by Rex Pickett that has many layers to it and doesn't betray its four intriguing and ultimately human characters with all their flaws and neuroses on full display. Each actor shines with a few moments of soliloquies and dialogue that ring true that will have you laughing til you cry and vice versa and that my friend is no easy trick!The four actors give supremely wonderfully acted turns and all are Oscar worthy as well as the screenplay which mixes misery with hope and some truly funny moments including an anger management golf sequence that feels like an outtake from 'Caddyshack' and Giamatti's drunken phone call to his ex is on par with Jon Favreau's caraccidentinslowmotion answering machine mishap in 'Swingers'  one for the archives. Church makes his borderline jerk a quasipathetic lothario who finally sees the forest for the trees in a surprisingly moving moment of realization in a teary confessional Oh unleashes the old chestnut of a woman's scorn with noholdsbarred and Madsen is a true welcome back from a seemingly endless string of nothing vehicles into this warm and welcome turn as comforting as a blanket on a wintry night in front of a cozy fire.While it is so easy to resort to the wine as metaphor  as the film amply does with smart sharp and pungent dialogue  the film is a fullbodied never precocious vintage that needs to be savored in a desirable bouquet of cinematic finesse.".

Jack a longinthe tooth secondrate soap actor whose 15 minutes are at a close 1459 is adamant about getting laid for one last time before his commitment to a younger woman who clearly deserves better and Jack shrewdly knows this.As the duo drive through the sundappled wine country of Northern California in a road trip not unlike two virginal horny teens looking to pop their respective cherries they come across two unlikely conquests. One is the shapely and surprisinglydowntoearth waitress Maya Madsen in a career comeback of epic proportions shines through the Giamatti gloom who strikes a fancy to the depressed Miles while Jack has his sights on the sexy wine pourer Stephanie the sublimely reassuringly funny Oh and real  life wife to director Payne who also is charmed by the blithely feckless Jack. What unfolds is a sweet yet toogoodtobe true few days of bliss and unbridled emotional rescue for the foursome as they take to one another like ducks to water although Miles' hesitancy is deeply reasoned since he is still licking the open wounds of his twoyear old divorce.Payne one of my favorite filmmakers doesn't disappoint as he dollops evenly the tragiccomic proceedings with his frequent longtime collaborator Jim Taylor in adapting an unpublished novel by Rex Pickett that has many layers to it and doesn't betray its four intriguing and ultimately human characters with all their flaws and neuroses on full display. Each actor shines with a few moments of soliloquies and dialogue that ring true that will have you laughing til you cry and vice versa and that my friend is no easy trick!The four actors give supremely wonderfully acted turns and all are Oscar worthy as well as the screenplay which mixes misery with hope and some truly funny moments including an anger management golf sequence that feels like an outtake from 'Caddyshack' and Giamatti's drunken phone call to his ex is on par with Jon Favreau's caraccidentinslowmotion answering machine mishap in 'Swingers'  one for the archives. Church makes his borderline jerk a quasipathetic lothario who finally sees the forest for the trees in a surprisingly moving moment of realization in a teary confessional Oh unleashes the old chestnut of a woman's scorn with noholdsbarred and Madsen is a true welcome back from a seemingly endless string of nothing vehicles into this warm and welcome turn as comforting as a blanket on a wintry night in front of a cozy fire.While it is so easy to resort to the wine as metaphor  as the film amply does with smart sharp and pungent dialogue  the film is a fullbodied never precocious vintage that needs to be savored in a desirable bouquet of cinematic finesse.";

Its lead players Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are both actors we remember seeing from time to time for at least the past fifteen years but whose names never before appeared on our radar screens. Here they both enter the arena of notable film actors and memorably so. The film is a comedy drama to a great extent at least in my own mind influenced in style by my late friend John Cassavetes. Finely directed by Alexander Payne its comedy issues from the breast of characterization and not contrived pasted on sitcom lines. This alone is rare in film and denotes craft writing of the preeminent kind.The icing on this cake is its constancy and within that its splendid subtlety. The story is simple two friends get together for a last weekend of wine tasting in some of Southern California's wineries just before the marriage of one of them. As it unfolds we see that the story clearly issues from the breast of the two characters a hapless English teacher still suffering over his divorce of two years past. He has written an honest novel instead of a commercial one so we know that it will not be published some time before the reveal. The other his pal since college some twenty years before is a fringe actor about to be married but struggling to retain his youth through womanizing. This Lothario is no less pathetic than his writer friend. The film is beautifully cast with the extraordinary Virginia Madsen as the writer's acquaintance with potential to be more. Highly recommended be prepared to laugh for just over two hours with very little let up while at the same time being conveyed to the essence of our humanity.".

With Sideways he proves his insight into human nature was no fluke but instead an amazing gift. He captures many Hollywood stereotypes such as midlife crisis groomtobe cold feet postdivorce confidence crunch and the overall desire to be loved or at least liked. What makes Payne's work so unique is his ability to deliver multiple messages with brilliant comic twists using little more than unlikeable lead characters and sizzling dialogue! Moral bankruptcy is at a peak in Sideways as one of our leads the magnificent Paul Giamatti from American Splendor and Man on the Moon steals cash from his mother and the other Thomas Haden Church from TV's Wings is on a mission to have his bachelor party last an entire week while claiming we just don't understand his plight. Also delivering a wonderful touch to the film is Sandra Oh Diane Lane's pregnant buddy in Under the Tuscan Sun. Oh has very unique looks and mannerisms but is terrific as one of Church's conquests. The soul and spirit of this film belongs to the drastically underrated Virginia Madsen if you have never seen The Hot Spot make it priority viewing. Madsen sister to cult favorite Michael Madsen of Kill Bill and Reservoir Dogs fame literally jumps off the screen with her eyes and smile. Her character wants so much for a better life but is strong enough to avoid her past mistakes. She is the one we root for. This is an excellent film and nice character study with a snappy jazz score. Payne has proved he should be considered among the best filmmakers of today  now could someone please help his film obtain better distribution!!!".

By the end of the movie I felt very sorry for Church as he was not only dumb and shallow he was actually so empty that whatever female was before him became a mirror of his need to connect with anything that felt like caring. Church did a fabulous job and was incredibly believable as a hasbeen wannabe desperate to hold on to his dream of the kind of good life that is bought by charm and good looks. He is just on the edge or realizing his time is running out and that is a whole lot for this character to absorb as he has never given much to the concept of thought.Giammeti is a pitiful selfabsorbed destructive depressed alcoholic whose in possession of two things. He knows a great deal about wine and he has written a book. Nothing else informs him. Yet his performance is so nuanced that we are able to fill in his depth of character and decency primarily through his huge limpid eyes. What a performance. He should have been nominated for an academy award. This is a role that comes along onceinalifetime for this type of character actor like Liza in Cabaret.The women are really nothing more than backdrops or props for the men to expose themselves. Madsen is lovely but you do wonder what on earth she really sees in this man. While he may be redeemable he is really pretty much a selfabsorbed jerk. It is most interesting that this film has been released at the same time as Closer as they are similar in their exploration of selfabsorption. Though Closer explores how destructive its characters are to each other in the end Closer is not as intimate and seems more artificial than the sweetly revealing Sideways.".

	schema:headline " A Bad Movie for People Who Don't Know Any Better But Think That They Do";
	schema:reviewBody "The one great redeeming quality of this movie is its philosophical consistency. It's about a middleaged man who has populated his life with pretensions  that he is a writer an epicure and an expert on wine. This movie will appeal exclusively to those with an alltoo common and alltoosimilar conceit that they appreciate good movies. Sideways is a brilliantly acted brilliantly polished turd. The direction and editing is superb the acting is magnificent and the characters have both depth and realism.BUT THE MOVIE SUCKS.In fact it prides itself on its sucking. Our protagonists are a pathetic and selfpitying though utterly selfabsorbed writeraesthete wannabe and an unsuccessful TV actor whose stated purpose is to cheat on his fiance as often as possible in the week before his wedding. These characters are drawn with subtlety and artistry and both actors turn in bravura performances but when all's said and done it's impossible to give the proverbial rodent's behind about either of them. If the film had concluded with every major character dying painfully the emotional impact would have been a nice round zero.To enjoy this movie you have to identify with the main character Miles and to identify with Miles you have to have a smug selfpitying streak a mile wide. Let me make something absolutely clear MILES IS NOT TALENTED. That the director would choose to betray the preceding seven hours at the very end by making Maya as uninteresting a love interest as I can imagine appreciate his behemoth of a novel is neither here nor there  Miles is not a good writer or a good anything. If you've never written a novel you might think that Miles is what a writer is like. If you have you know that he's a talentless hack.I repeat it's only the MOVIE that is bad. The acting is excellent except for Madsen's pale and boring millstone of a character everybody shows up and turns in a good show. But the movie itself is really really awful.Not funny.Not romantic.Not charming.Sideways manages to be both contemptuous and contemptible small and smallminded. I won't bother enumerating the many many ways in which this movie shows its contempt for anybody who isn't a lifeless oenophile.I walked into Sideways thinking I was going to love it. I tried so so hard but it just broke my heart. This movie hates you and it wants you to suffer  and if you genuinely enjoyed it you should be ashamed of yourself.Two thumbs down.".

Miles an avid  some would say sneeringly snotty  oenophile comes up with the nifty idea of the two of them driving up the coast of California touring various wineries and vineyards and such. That way Miles can show off his knowledge and Jack can have a one last good free time.One small problem. Although Miles is perfectly content to wine and whine for the week Jack's eye wanders  and soon he's setting up a double dinner date with a winery employee Sandra Oh and a waitress Virginia Madsen. Suddenly the trip's not about the two friends bonding one last time it's more about Jack sowing his wild oats figuratively hopefully while he still can. This change in plans leads to awkward funny and funnyawkward moments meanwhile poor Miles  recovering from a divorce and finding out secondhand that his exwife has just remarried and waiting to hear if his latest literary opus will be accepted for publication  is a walking rubber band ball of neuroses and nerves. He tries to maintain the trip's focus while Jack just tries to have a little fun.As with most buddy films Things That Go Wrong tend to snowball into something far greater and on one level Sideways is a typical road trip movie including assumptions lies illogical decisions red herrings and so forth  all in the name of low comedy. But on another level the movie is an honest look at love and relationships from the perspective of a single closinginonmiddleage male.Even though Giamatti and Church were hardly unknown actors before Sideways this is truly the breakthrough film for each. Giamatti a veteran character actor perhaps best known for his role as Pig Vomit in the screen version of Howard Stern's Private Parts is perfectly in his element as the selfobsessed nervous sincere Miles. It's a performance to which many people can instantly relate Miles is not handsome he's not smooth he's not really all that charming but somehow he's still appealing. He's a good guy who tries to do well and sometimes suffers the whims of Lady Luck. Church is known for two TV series he was in Wings and Ned  Stacey and I can't recall his ever being classified as a good actor just an entertaining one. But he's wonderful as the rowdy randy perpetually horny Jack he seems to give the role an extra layer of depth. You can't just write Jack off as a selfish bastard just as you can't just write Miles off as a dork.Director Alexander Payne who made the clever Election does a fantastic job at transforming what's really a twocharacter study everyone else including the two female leads is background to the relationship between Miles and Jack into a realistic fully textured movie. Payne's screenplay doesn't dwell on caricatures and doesn't offer pat explanations or resolutions. Sometimes the film tells us things don't end up good or bad. They just continue on.Although Giamatti and Church are at center stage Oh and Madsen are both fantastic although perhaps slightly underused. In particular Madsen who earned an Oscar nomination as did Church makes the most of her brief screen time oozing intelligence wit charm and sexuality from every pore.Sideways doesn't move too slowly and isn't too talky and because wine is one theme there are plenty of beautifully photographed scenes of the lovely Napa Valley's vineyards. Sideways is thoughtful entertaining and fascinating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sideways is a marvellous movie. For a change it's not about someone who walks between heaven and hell routinely destroying demons or some eccentric enigma of a figure living half a century ago but real people whom we come across every day people we can identify and empathise with.At the start Sideways looks a little like a road movie in the odd couple genre. But it's neither. The trip starting from San Diego soon winds up in a hotel in California wine country where the heart of the story unfolds. Nor are Jack a groomtobe seeking one last fling or Miles his buddy and twoyear divorce accompanying him truly an odd couple in the sense of the structure of the movie. Although Jack provides comic relief aplenty the focus of the movie is by far on Miles.The first halfhour of the movie does not appear to be going anywhere quickly as Miles takes uninitiated Jack on wine ONLY to wine tasting and buying visits in addition to a quick stop to visit mother. The patient and attentive in the audience however will appreciate that in so many ways Miles is very like so many of us particularly the scene at mother's place so much so that he feels like someone we have known for a long time. Just like sipping a good wine we gradually take in Miles his vulnerability his insecurity and selfdoubt his deep yearning for his divorced wife his frustration with a deadend job as a schoolteacher and his fervent hope to get his first book published.The story truly begins with the double date Jack engineers with Maya waitress and graduate student and Stephanie who pours wine at a tasting counter. Jack and Stephanie hit it off just like that and provide the lighter side of the plot. Miles and Maya on the other hand bring us the true beauty of the movie.One of the most fascinating things a movie can try is to portray is how two perfect strangers can click and then carry on to develop a much deeper relationship. Look at Bridges of Madison County. Look at Before Sunrise. Both excel in different ways in bringing this about. Sideways does this in a dialogue that movie critics universally hail with unanimous praise. Miles and Maya have known each other casually during his previous visits to the restaurant where she works. But it's that one evening in Stephanie's house when the other two disappear in their fiery pursuit that Miles and Maya start to talk about wine a hobby and passion for both and about themselves. To try to tell someone how wonderful the dialogue is would be akin to trying to explain how great is a legendary painting or an immortal symphony. Watch it. Then watch it again as you would savour a vintage wine.Make no mistake that this is also a very funny movie with some excellent lines such as after Miles makes an impulse call to his exwife after the first doubledate dinner Jack quips to him You drink and dial again. But Sideways goes a lot deeper than just a few good laughs.Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen are as perfect a combination as you can find for Miles and Maya. Watching them you understand why you don't need earsplitting screams and shrieks that are often futile claims of hey look I can act. They're probably too good for the Oscar. Thomas Haden Church and Sandra Oh as Jack and Stephanie deliver more than just laughs and allow you to see some of the ironic poignant helplessness underneath the laughs in the characters they play.And then there is of course wine which I have always enjoyed but know very little about. Connoisseurs would undoubtedly get even more out of this splendid film.".

	schema:headline " Awful. What are people thinking?";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a terrible movie.Some Spoilers below but if it keeps you from watching this particular movie I don't think you can really say it's been spoiled. We follow two fortysomething losers Jack a hasbeen minor actor and Miles a divorced wine geekwannabe writer middle school teacher who drinks too much through a bachelor trip they take together to the Santa Barbara wine country during the week before the actor's wedding.There are lots of problems with this movie but most of them lie in the area of credibility. I understand that this is not meant to be precise realism but It seems impossible that these two guys have ever wanted to spend 5 minutes with each other. They nothing in common and personalities that intersect at no point whatsoever. Furthermore they are both unbearable. Jack is an ass. Miles is the kind of deliberately unhappy man who makes you want to slit your own throat to escape his moaning. The idea that they've been best buddies since college is ludicrous.The idea that Jack  a classic goodtime Joe who's main goal for the trip is to get laid agreed to a tour of the vineyards of Santa Barbara County as his week before marriage trip is dumb. You don't go to wine country to meet someone for sex  you go to wine country to have sex with someone you already know. Jack is Mr. Vegas or Acapulco or even Tijuana all the way. It's like the idea of George W. Bush going to Sta. Barabara to party. It is admittedly not my area of expertise but I just don't believe that two fortysomething straight guys would EVER plan a weeklong wine tasting trip with each other.So to my mind the movie tries to build itself from a central relationship and a central plot device that are equally incredible.As for character development well... Jack turns out to be little more than a horndog former pretty boy stereotype. He is allowed to cry at one point while claiming to love his fiance but it's sort of a shock and hard to buy given his complete indifference to her at every other point in the movie. Miles on the other hand does seem to go from being a tedious depressed sot to a tedious somewhatlessdepressed sot. Really he makes you yearn for the cheerfulness of Giamatti's Harvey Pekar character in American Splendor. But from everything we see it seems unlikely that Miles will ever manage to pull a worthwhile existence out of this particular life. He's such a selfinvolved emotionally unattractive person that when at the end of the film he takes the step of chasing down Virginia Madsen's character a warm wise and beautiful woman who is way far out of Miles' league in any universe fictional or real not only is it difficult to cheer for him one wants to yell at the screen to warn her not to answer the door.As for the women  well they are all there pretty much just to be mistreated demeaned andor talked about like meat. As silly as it is the wine country trip is of course supposed to be a metaphor.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a terrible movie.Some Spoilers below but if it keeps you from watching this particular movie I don't think you can really say it's been spoiled. We follow two fortysomething losers Jack a hasbeen minor actor and Miles a divorced wine geekwannabe writer middle school teacher who drinks too much through a bachelor trip they take together to the Santa Barbara wine country during the week before the actor's wedding.There are lots of problems with this movie but most of them lie in the area of credibility. I understand that this is not meant to be precise realism but It seems impossible that these two guys have ever wanted to spend 5 minutes with each other. They nothing in common and personalities that intersect at no point whatsoever. Furthermore they are both unbearable. Jack is an ass. Miles is the kind of deliberately unhappy man who makes you want to slit your own throat to escape his moaning. The idea that they've been best buddies since college is ludicrous.The idea that Jack  a classic goodtime Joe who's main goal for the trip is to get laid agreed to a tour of the vineyards of Santa Barbara County as his week before marriage trip is dumb. You don't go to wine country to meet someone for sex  you go to wine country to have sex with someone you already know. Jack is Mr. Vegas or Acapulco or even Tijuana all the way. It's like the idea of George W. Bush going to Sta. Barabara to party. It is admittedly not my area of expertise but I just don't believe that two fortysomething straight guys would EVER plan a weeklong wine tasting trip with each other.So to my mind the movie tries to build itself from a central relationship and a central plot device that are equally incredible.As for character development well... Jack turns out to be little more than a horndog former pretty boy stereotype. He is allowed to cry at one point while claiming to love his fiance but it's sort of a shock and hard to buy given his complete indifference to her at every other point in the movie. Miles on the other hand does seem to go from being a tedious depressed sot to a tedious somewhatlessdepressed sot. Really he makes you yearn for the cheerfulness of Giamatti's Harvey Pekar character in American Splendor. But from everything we see it seems unlikely that Miles will ever manage to pull a worthwhile existence out of this particular life. He's such a selfinvolved emotionally unattractive person that when at the end of the film he takes the step of chasing down Virginia Madsen's character a warm wise and beautiful woman who is way far out of Miles' league in any universe fictional or real not only is it difficult to cheer for him one wants to yell at the screen to warn her not to answer the door.As for the women  well they are all there pretty much just to be mistreated demeaned andor talked about like meat. As silly as it is the wine country trip is of course supposed to be a metaphor. Many of the characters are obsessed with wine to an extent that makes you think that maybe they fall in together because nearly everyone else runs away when they see them coming and they use the language of wine to discuss other issues in their life. A lot.Basically People like wine are complex and you should take the time to savor them properly.

	schema:reviewBody "Alexander Payne's Sideways is what is known in the movie business as a Little Movie That Could a low budget independent film without major stars or dazzling special effects that nevertheless achieves a measure of success at the box office and in this case at least an Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the year.Based on the novel by Rex Pickett Sideways tells the story of two middleaged men Miles and Jack who head to the wine country of Central California for one final fling before Jack gets married. Miles is an aspiring writer whose recent failures in life have left him bruised cynical and deeply depressed. In fact he feels like a loser on two fronts both as an author and as a husband for he has yet to have a single work of his published and he has recently gotten divorced from a woman whom he obviously still loves deeply and whom he can't quite seem to let go of. The one aspect of life in which Miles really seems to excel and in which his passion is given free rein is his connoisseurship of fine wine. His buddy Jack is a hasbeen TV actor who has spent the last few years doing voiceover work for pharmaceutical commercials. Jack wants his final week as a bachelor to be a nonstop orgy of wine women and song but Miles prefers a quiet week of three parts wine tasting to one part self pity.Like a rare vintage Pinot Noir Sideways is a film best appreciated by those with a finely developed taste for the subtle and offbeat. What often happens with a small film that achieves an unexpectedly wide crossover success is that it tends to suffer a certain critical backlash from people who go into it with soaring expectations and come out wondering what all the fuss is about. The ideal way to experience a film like Sideways is to allow it to sneak up on you to let it catch you unawares with its uniqueness and charm. But since none of us can turn back time to that particular moment of nascent discovery we are forced to watch it through the filter of our own preconceived notions and expectations.All this is preparatory to saying that Sideways is a very enjoyable little film for those willing to give it a chance. Not only are the premise and the setting novel and unique but the film boasts some of the finest ensemble acting in any movie of recent years. Paul Giamatti long one of our most talented and underrated actors gives a performance of tremendous understatement and restraint creating an entire character as much through facial expressions and body language as through dialogue. Miles isn't even all that likable at times  he actually steals money from his own mother on her birthday then leaves without saying goodbye  but his lack of selfimage his cleareyed rationality and his puppy dog vulnerability win us over anyway. As the playboy Jack Thomas Hayden Church reveals a layer of sensitivity buried under all that coldblooded crassness. Playing the two women who enter into their lives that week Sandra Oh and especially Virginia Madsen provide a sweetness and warmth that contrasts nicely with these two emotionally stunted middleaged losers. In a perfect blending of form and content Payne and coauthor Jim Taylor have created a tasty mixture of revelatory conversation understated humor and lyrical camerawork. So sit back uncork a bottle of your favorite vintage and enjoy the aperitif that is Sideways.".

	schema:headline " Was I the only person that DIDN'T like this movie???";
	schema:reviewBody "First of I'd like to start by saying that Sideways was one of the biggest disappointments that I've experienced in a very long time. I went into the movie theater with great expectations of a comedy that was funny and bittersweet at the same time similar to Payne's previous film About Schmidt. I came out feeling that I had been cheated. There were so many things that I disliked about this film that I don't even know where to begin. First neither of the two characters is remotely likable. I know that Payne was trying to show the desperate nature of Giamatti's character in the scene where he steals money from his mother. But in all honesty can any normal selfrespecting person relate to that??? I'm not trying to sound high and mighty but I cannot think of ANY reason to steal from my mother much less doing so in order to fund a winetasting trip with one of my friends. Likewise am I honestly supposed to believe Church's character when he begins to cry about losing his wedding rings and in doing so possibly losing his fiance? Am I supposed to overlook the fact that he had sex with two women 6 DAYS before his wedding? Give me a break. Throughout the movie I did not feel that any of the characters were real but that scene was the most ridiculous. The second thing that disappointed me was the fact that the movie was not funny. Before I go any further I should say that I enjoy dry and subtle humor Being John Malcovich Curb Your Enthusiasm. That being said I found absolutely nothing funny in this movie. There were a few moments that deserved a small chuckle but that's about it. Perhaps I would've enjoyed the movie more if I was a wine connoisseur which I must admit I'm not. As a matter of fact the wine is the best and most likable character in the movie aside from Virginia Madsen who was very good. On that same note one of the only redeemable factors of this movie was the cinematography and views of the California wine country which were beautiful. Also although I did not like or feel any sympathy towards Giammatti's character I have to admit that he's a good actor and delivered a solid performance. My overall description of this film is that it's a mediocre buddy pic that does not deserve any real acclaim. If however anyone who has not yet seen it decides to do so I have this advice...Do not believe all the hype surrounding this movie and do not expect a funny comedy. You will be disappointed. I know I was.Since I wrote this review I've spoken to several members of my family about this film and have been disappointed to find out that all of them liked it. I felt compelled to come back to IMDb and add another paragraph to my review because I honestly can't understand what it is that people see in this movie. Then I read a very interesting review of Sideways that gave me a different perspective. The writer commented that characters in a film do not necessarily have to be likable in order for someone to enjoy watching them on screen. I thought about this and decided that it's a true statement yet still thought that Sideways was boring and in my opinion completely unbelievable. This lead me to ponder the question of what makes a film or more precisely what makes a character interesting to watch. I came to the conclusion that a great film character doesn't have to be good or evil likable or repulsive funny or somber. The only thing that they should have to do is grab your attention and make you want to root for and in some cases against them. They should elicit some kind of emotions from you whether those emotions be good or bad. Ralph Cifaretto from the Sopranos is a great example. He was a completely repulsive character that no normal human being could possibly like or have respect for. But Joe Pantoliano played him so well that you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. You had to keep watching to see what he would do next. The two main characters in Sideways on the other hand are not the deep and complicated personalities that critics would have you believe. They're boring overly simplified in Jack's case and unbearably dreary in Miles' case characters that give you no reason to want to know or care what they will do next. Personally I could have cared less if Maya ends up with Miles at the end of the film. For me that is the biggest failure of this movie. The only emotion that I felt other than anger for having spent money on this dud was remorse for Jack's wife for marrying such a prick and a similar sadness for Miles' mother for raising such a failure. In the end this film fails because it's a character study of two completely hollow onedimensional and uninteresting characters. I suppose I would not feel so strongly about Sideways had it not received such glowing reviews. I felt the need to express my opinion simply to show others who hated it that they're not the only ones that feel like someone is trying to pull the wool over their eyes with this overhyped garbage.".

How is any of that funny? The whole movie is equally juvenile and pointless.Words can hardly describe how much I hated this movie. I would have liked it moderately more if it weren't so popular but it's popularity just goes to show how stupid and immature the general public is.

We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money. We were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.We found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab.

	schema:headline " John Ford's stark portrayal of a poor family in the depression remains one of the most moving films in history.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family who are run off of their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. I think that one of the most striking elements of this movie is the black and white cinematography. Obviously there wasn't a lot of variation on this particular subject in 1940 but especially today the lack of color enhances the feelings of poverty and desperation and emptiness due to the family's loss of their home. In this way because it would not be nearly as noticeable in 1940 as it is today this timeenhanced effect of the black and white film stock has allowed for the film's impact to actually grow with time. Henry Fonda plays the part of Tom Joad a young member of the family who is released from prison at the beginning of the film only to find that his family has been driven from their home and is staying at his uncle's house until they can figure out what to do about their sudden homelessness. It is by pure coincidence that Tom was released early on good behavior otherwise he may very well never have seen his family again. He finds them in a state of near desperation as they begin more and more to realize the predicament that they are in. Their trek across half of the country on their way to California to assume jobs that they've heard about provides for a substantial portion of the plot and is extremely wellstructured.The family encounters every hardship imaginable on this journey from family members dying to their struggle to feed themselves to their rickety old truck constantly breaking down. They run into disillusioned people who claim that they've been to California and there are really no jobs there at least not nearly as many as there are people going to look for them. They are periodically and derogatorily referred to as Okies' a term which places them in a broad category of poor folks driven from there homes in middle America who are traveling to the coast to get jobs that aren't there. There is so much doubt and hardship presented that it is never really certain whether they really will find jobs. The audience is never able to assume a happy ending because there is so much contrary foreshadowing throughout the film. The struggles do not abate once the family reaches California and takes up shaky residence in residential areas that would be more accurately referred to as shanty towns and the rest of the film is dominated by the family's efforts to survive in a new and unfamiliar place while working for wages that are barely sufficient to prevent starvation. Ma Joad spends the majority of the film stressing the importance of keeping the family together seeing it as the only thing that they really had left but this is eventually set aside in favor of each member of the family not only surviving but also flourishing which provides for one of the many powerful messages that the film delivers. The Grapes of Wrath is not exactly an edge of your seat film but it is a shockingly realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performances are flawless and the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational. It's no secret that most people do not watch movies to learn but there comes a point at least once in a great while when a person should watch a film that requires a little mental thought processing and in such cases The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult on a first viewing of The Grapes of Wrath not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the gee whizz style of filmmaking so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own and the film inspires a great deal of admiration and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out like its final image for example but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hardbiting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joadnever have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitchperfect as Ma Joadshe captures the toughasnails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images and isn't that what a good booktofilm adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.Grade A".

	schema:headline " Economic Dislocation";
	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess but it takes its toll.Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on but those are stories for another film review. Tom Joad is a midwest country kid a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road he's not got all the answers but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.Given some of the problems of the American economy today The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.".

To get the part which he knew he was so right for he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on but those are stories for another film review. Tom Joad is a midwest country kid a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road he's not got all the answers but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.Given some of the problems of the American economy today The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.";

	schema:reviewBody "During most of the decade of the 30s the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release plans for a film adaptation began to be made and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.In The Grapes of Wrath Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy John Carradine the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John Frank Darien looking for the Joads and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However things won't be as easy as they thought they would.Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson The Grapes of Wrath takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel changes were done due to censorship the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments The Grapes of Wrath avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.In 1939 John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career having directed Stagecoach Young Mr. Lincoln and Drums Along the Mohawk in less than 12 months. The Grapes of Wrath would also be shot the same year being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and largerthanlife heroes The Grapes of Wrath was in many levels a very personal movie for him so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job probably her finest as Ma Joad and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.As written above the movie has several considerable differences with the novel specially the second half so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character it's hard to diminish its value due to them as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.With a haunting atmosphere a beautiful visual composition and superb performances by his actors Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 1010".

Of course in 1940 Ford could not film much of the graphic squalor described in the novel.  For example the film cannot show a starving hobo suckling at the breast of a young Rose of Sharon who has milk to spare following the death of her baby.  But far from degradation Rose of Sharon's gesture is a reflection of the goodness that resides within her and that quality is well illustrated in the character development seen on the screen.  Tom Joad may be an excon but he is a good man.One of the commentaries below uses this film to rant about the exploitation in today's society.  That completely misses the point.

	schema:reviewBody "Classic Hollywood films that tried to tackle important issues or answer big questions typically were cheesy and hard to take seriously. They had gratuitous overacting fake Hollywood dialogue and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically overdramatized in this way their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clichs. And the ones that don't are still remembered and cherished to this very day films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington or Modern Times or 12 Angry Men faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.As I'm sure you all already know Grapes of Wrath is an adaptation of the John Steinbeck Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name that was published only a year before the film was first released. The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad played by Henry Fonda who collaborated with John Ford several times. who returns to his family's home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers so of course the bank repossessed there home and land and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west. If I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won't spoil any of these fantastic moments but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck's masterful writing and the actors's somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography done by the legendary Gregg Toland who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane. is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma the wide open road on highway 66 and the overcrowded filthy slums of California all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere. Every single actor in the film gives it hisher all Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. well except for some minor childactor roles. John Ford is an excellent actor director though so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director this was his second Oscar his first was for The Informer. and it is well deserved each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscarbait movie would Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don't even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100 genuine.John Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath because he was politically conservative and the bookfilm supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. see what I did there. Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Unionit was only allowed because it supported procommunist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirtpoor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry alongside films like Citizen Kane Vertigo and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film and should be viewed by everyone.9.510".

The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad played by Henry Fonda who collaborated with John Ford several times. who returns to his family's home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers so of course the bank repossessed there home and land and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west. If I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won't spoil any of these fantastic moments but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck's masterful writing and the actors's somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography done by the legendary Gregg Toland who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane. is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma the wide open road on highway 66 and the overcrowded filthy slums of California all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere. Every single actor in the film gives it hisher all Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. well except for some minor childactor roles. John Ford is an excellent actor director though so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director this was his second Oscar his first was for The Informer. and it is well deserved each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscarbait movie would Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don't even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100 genuine.John Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath because he was politically conservative and the bookfilm supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. see what I did there. Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Unionit was only allowed because it supported procommunist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirtpoor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry alongside films like Citizen Kane Vertigo and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film and should be viewed by everyone.9.510";

Even given that the times were bad more balance in the characters outside of the family and in the Joads' experiences would have made it an even better story. Certainly this is barely even noticeable when compared with the stories in many presentday movies and novels which often dispense with any attempts at plausibility.And that does not stop this adaptation from being a worthwhile and often moving film.

	schema:reviewBody "Do I have your attention? Okay Go out and watch this movie immediately because to not do so is well it's unAmerican. John Ford with this nifty little film made the greatest argument for populistsocialist politics in cinematic history. This movie understands the Depression and the Dust Bowl and the poor and the hungry and the starving and all those people that the sign at Ellis Island or is it at the Statue of Liberty? says that we'll take on and help. It understands those people better than anyone or anything else I know. Steinbeck's novel helps this movie get to where it needs to be but let's be honest the Grapes of Wrath is all John Ford. The sweeping vistas the excellent editing and pacing and the acting are of the highest caliber as befits a John Ford film. I'm amazed every time I see this movie just how moving it is without straying into trite sentimentality. Tom Joad's speech at the end always makes me cryhis chilly delivery of the word homicide at the beginning continues to give me a prickly spine. Fonda was a great actor and he is certainly at the top of his game here. Without him interestingly the film would have probably floundered. No one else could have possibly played Tom Joad no one would have that charm and charisma and most importantly that voice. The rest of the cast is amazing don't misunderstand but Henry Fonda is Henry Fondaan actor unto himself. There is no one like him and never will there be he is the single most watchable actor of all time. And this isn't even my favorite John Ford movie! Nevertheless it's a great film with a great message. Call me a pinko it's been done before but what's superb about this movie is its humanism. Yeah the ideology promotes a type of socialism ahem I mean let's not forget that that is basically what the New Deal was and if you think that system was a bad idea then fine but really the movie is about caring for people who don't have the resources to care for themselves. Grapes of Wrath is not a scathing indictment of anyone it's a simple portrait of a family's struggles to overcome the Depression. It's uplifting and shows a real feeling for the downtrodden and that's more than you can say about most American films that intend to deal with the poor and hungry.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good or great as you can get especially considering that it was shot in 33 days. But it often gets nailed for two scenes one absent from the film the other changed drastically. No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast. If the scene had been shot in 1939 or even suggested the movie would never have been released. The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle and we're the people that live. That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s. Of course tragedies had been filmed for years but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate. Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest closeknit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare. We need to look at art in the context of its time.From the Marxist perspective that Steinbeck used in writing the novel Tom Joad Henry Fonda is the protagonist but the two most important characters are Ma Joad Jane Darwell and Casey the Preacher John Carradine. Ma represents what Marx called false consciousness the tendency to attribute our misery to our own flaws to bad luck or God's will. Ma Joad's solution is retrograde  to hold the fambly together. Casey on the other hand discovers class consciousness. It's not our fault. The flaw is systemic and the solution lies in correcting the inequities in the system. Our allegiance has to transcend groups like the family and embrace all the exploited workers. The film endorses not Marx's revolution but a milder form of socialism  the governmentrun labor camp with its democratic sanitary units and the emerging union movement with its collective bargaining. Steinbeck's polemic is more acid. The novel has a reference to the extremely wealthy William Randolph Hearst better known as Charles Foster Kane who is described as have a mean face and a mouth like a ahole. There aren't many references to communism either in the novel or the film just a few remarks about Who is these Reds anyways? Still pretty bold stuff for the 1930s with the public in one of its periodic Bolshevik scares!No need for anxiety though. By the late 1930s the Great Depression was easing up and World War II was about to bring it to an end. Bakersfield now looks as if Tom Joad had made a successful escape and decided to open a chain of organic food stores. This is a marvelous film. To single out just one shot note when the Joads drive through the first starving Hooverville. The camera is mounted on the front of the old truck and travels slowly without any cuts or dialog through groups of wary singularly ratty looking people men and women young and old some resembling photos of criminals from old Police Gazettes who don't look none too prosperous. If nothing else the film is a valuable corrective to the current view that people are poor because they're lazy. How did one third of a nation become so terribly lazy in the years following the 1929 stock market crash?".

While I don't think it's director John Ford's best film I preferred HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE it is superb and wellcrafted. Some of the acting in particular Jane Darwell as Ma was terrific and very realistic while occasionally it was a bit over the top John Carradine as the Preacher. And the story itself was excellent and wellconstructedmaking an emotional and heartfelt appeal for justice and a more Socialist nation in response to the poverty of the Great Depression. You can't help but be sucked into the pitiful yet somehow hopeful lives of the Joad family. While some of the facts were definitely exaggerated in order to make this point making it a onedimensional fight between good and evil the overall message of upheaval and loss was important and potent.I am a history teacher and so naturally I gravitate to films like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is an amazingly powerful film that is extremely touching and lovingly madethough historically some of the film is pretty much fiction. While most web sites I checked praised the book one presents a thoughtful and documented analysis of the actual Okie experience and compares it to the book and moviecoming up with many ways in which THE GRAPES OF WRATH isn't a totally accurate portrait of the times. Some examples cited were the general success the Okies had when they arrived in California that the exodus to California from most of America PREDATED the Dust Bowl years and the Dust Bowl itself had very little actual impact on Oklahoma though it DID affect Kansas and some other states considerably. This isn't to say that the film is completely fiction or it was a bad book or that Steinbeck was a Communist but that Steinbeck wasn't always careful in his research and seemed to stretch facts to make his social and political statement. See for yourselfit makes interesting reading at httpwww.newcriterion.comarchive20jun02steinbeck.htm".

Some examples cited were the general success the Okies had when they arrived in California that the exodus to California from most of America PREDATED the Dust Bowl years and the Dust Bowl itself had very little actual impact on Oklahoma though it DID affect Kansas and some other states considerably. This isn't to say that the film is completely fiction or it was a bad book or that Steinbeck was a Communist but that Steinbeck wasn't always careful in his research and seemed to stretch facts to make his social and political statement.

I was prepared to see some classA drama but everything what this family goes through is even worse than I thought. This famous movie milestone goes about the Joad family. They have to leave everything they own in Oklahoma behind. Them and several other poor families are attracted by California because there is supposed to be work and a place to live. The long trip is filled with misery and when they finally get in California it seems that they've been deceived once more. There's almost no food and 8 hungry mouths to fill. It's impossible not to get touched by the Joad family. All the characters are so sad but at the same time so brave. They don't give up and keep fighting...you just have to encourage them while watching this film. The Grapes of Wrath really makes you feel happy you live in this era and in this part of the world. You know stories like this really happened in the old days and they still do in some parts of the world. This kind of film is excellent to make you realize you have nothing to complain about.The dramatic highlights in this motion picture are countless  The flashbacks about how families are driven away from their homes the grandfather's funeral  the mother and son conversation near the end... All these scenes and several other ones are indicators of great drama and brilliant cinema. The Grapes of Wrath received several prices and nominations and it deserved every single one of them. Every element in  it is flawless. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad is one of the most intriguing characters ever shown of the screen. He's absolutely brilliant.The highest possible recommendation isn't yet high enough to describe The Grapes of Wrath...If you ever have the chance SEE IT !".

The Grapes of Wrath is a depressing film which I knew coming in but I was surprised by the little instances within the film where kindness was shown. In a film peopled by crooked cops and harsh times it was refreshing to see these acts of kindness and integrity.The lighting in the film was also superb. In the opening scene where Tom is in his old house at night it really looks like it's at night. And in another scene where he has a candle at night it looks real. I know The Grapes of Wrath is the textbook example of natural lighting but there's a reason for that.  And without spoiling anything I love how the film ended.".

	schema:headline " An account of people trapped in the cage of poverty and misery !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Grapes of Wrath directed by John Ford from a screenplay by Nunnally Johnson was the film adaptation of the very well known and renowned book of the same name by John Steinbeck. The film like the book is set during the era of the Great Depression in the 1930s and follows the Joad family from Oklahoma as they deal with poverty on their way to the 'promised land' of California after being thrown out of their own land and property.The themes of the film revolve around the concept of the loss of home. After the Joads get uprooted from their home like many other farmer families they head out for California in their truck. This truck becomes their mobile home. They become wanderers in search of a real home. It is unreal how the issue of migrants that enrich Steinbeck's novel and Ford's film is still extremely relevant to this very day. We see the local officials mistreat mislead and exploit them and all the poor migrants like the Joads go along with it with the hope that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. The Darwinian concept of the 'survival of the fittest' also comes very much into the equation. Once the Joads leave their land some members of the family lose their grit hope and conviction like Grandpa Grandma and Pa while on the other hand the misery and sorry plight of the circumstances emboldens Ma and makes her the source of strength for everyone including Tom. Tom Joad is a very interesting character. He starts out as the angry loner. He then comes into contact and becomes a part of the family unit. But the misery and struggles force him in an ironic sense to reembrace the identity of the outlaw loner to bring about a change. The purity and sweetness of the motherson relationship between Tom and Ma is given a lot of attention by Ford and Johnson even more so than Steinbeck did in the novel.Ford's direction in the film is understated and not very flashy. There are moments of great artistic imagery eg the 3 shadows trampled by the tractor marks Gregg Toland's brilliant cinematography under Ford's direction involving shadows specially in the scene where Tom and Casy meet Muley the brilliant shot where the Joad family leaves on their truck bidding adieu to their home and Ford decides to hold the shot a few seconds longer after they have left to show the wind dust and garbage blowing towards the houseetc. Ford's direction in the scenes in the Transient Camps is absolutely brilliant. He uses the moving camera from the perspective of the Joads to introduce them and the viewers to all the other migrants. The other aspects of those scenes involving the hungry kids are very touching.But the film I thought is flawed. First of all clearly due to all the restrictions that films of that era were plagued by there are a lot of crucial aspects of the original novel that get watered down a bit. I am certainly not someone who gets annoyed when the film is very different to the original source material because I have the maturity to understand that cinema and literature are two completely different fields. But I do think if the political aspect of the novel was explored more boldly in the film it would have worked to its benefit. Another aspect of the film that put me off a bit is some of the hokey nature of the written lines. Nunnally Johnson's writing at times gets too cheesy and overt. The overt nature of some of the lines spoken by the characters might work on the page of a book but on screen it does stick out in an ugly way. The acting by the ensemble cast is also a bit too theatrical at times which made it difficult for me to maintain a constant emotional attachment with the characters. Although the quality of acting is not consistent from everyone but Henry Fonda as Tom Joad Jane Darwell as Ma Joad and John Qualen as Muley are the ones who stand out. Fonda accurately conveys the repressed anger and frustration that makes up Tom's character with moments of touching emotions. Darwell is as likable as ever as Ma. She exudes a caring and loving quality that is impossible to avoid. She also plays the character with some strength as Ma does in a way become the backbone of the family after they leave their home. Although John Qualen has a peculiar appearance but the power of his performance forced me to really empathise with Muley's pains and struggles.'The Grapes of Wrath' is not flawless. In my view it has its fair share of issues much of which was down to rigid restrictions that were imposed upon the films of that era. But even with its flaws it still is a very solid John Ford film which made me feel for the characters. Just like the novel it forces the viewer to put themselves in the shoes of the central characters and live the struggle with them.".

The book has a strong lesson of the I becomes we whereas the film lacks the sort of artistic ability to really capture that phenomenon. The film puts forth a plot of the Joads against the world and the most important and striking part of the book was realization that a community of perfect strangers had come together bonding over their nothingness and had become a greater 'fambly' of their own a unit to reckon with. It is because the Director's cut of the film failed to bring to screen Steinbeck's message of the human nature of a people coming together when they have no means of living and yet there they are  still fighting the silent fight. While the film has an impressive cast of actors and several other noteworthy aspects of the film which are quite beautiful when speaking the film in parallel with novel the film has fallen short.

But what holds it together is the outstanding inputs from Henry Fonda  Jane Darwell especially the latter who delivers a powerful performance that only gets better as story progresses.On an overall scale The Grapes of Wrath is tragic heartbreaking  harrowing but despite its bleak appearance it isn't entirely devoid of hope  optimism. We witness the Joad family disintegrating under the burdens of crashed economy yet the end result is a reflection of the strength that lies in unity and how a stronglybonded family can steer through any situation. Expertly directed deftly written brilliantly performed  culminating with one of cinema's most inspiring monologues The Grapes of Wrath comes thoroughly recommended.".

But what holds it together is the outstanding inputs from Henry Fonda  Jane Darwell especially the latter who delivers a powerful performance that only gets better as story progresses.On an overall scale The Grapes of Wrath is tragic heartbreaking  harrowing but despite its bleak appearance it isn't entirely devoid of hope  optimism. We witness the Joad family disintegrating under the burdens of crashed economy yet the end result is a reflection of the strength that lies in unity and how a stronglybonded family can steer through any situation. Expertly directed deftly written brilliantly performed  culminating with one of cinema's most inspiring monologues The Grapes of Wrath comes thoroughly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "In what has to be one of the greatest adaptations of a novel ever we follow the Joad family and more specifically their excon son with a heart of gold made infinitely likable due to an outstanding performance by Henry Fonda. This is the kind of film you just don't ever want to end. Nunnally Johnson does an incredible job making John Steinbeck's words ready for the screen and John Ford never fails to do justice to the narrative. When a character performs a longer dialog you can tell you're seeing it with the same impact readers felt reading it. When Tom Joad walks across a lonesome road under the dim blue sky of an early morning you just have to imagine Steinbeck was proud of the people who worked so hard to bring his work to a new medium.The story of the Joad family is a rough one. It begins with Tom fresh out of prison for what is described as self defense. It seems hopeful but this is the last good fortune he'll see for a long while. Upon finding his family displaced and staying with an uncle he learns that they've been removed from the farm where the Joad family had been sharecropping for decades. Their seemly only hope is a sizable journey towards California so they load up a 'jalopy' far past its breaking point to set out on a trail ripe with misery in hopes of rebuilding. You start out rooting for the Joads how could you not? But the film subjects them to a myriad of misfortunes along the way. Your hope turns to pity quickly but you can't help but appreciate how much you admire their courage. It's remarkable how much I came to feel for the Joads. Tom is an outstanding protagonist and you're with him till the very end.A film with a story this great would do fine without being technically impressive and pleasant to look at but those aspects are wonderfully done too. The film looks incredibly crisp. I didn't manage to forget it was black and white but I couldn't take my mind off how great it looked. You can see every mark on a person's face every detail in Tom's scar and California's ugly brown hills and beautiful green pastures are both presented just as they are to this day.I genuinely loved this movie. It had such an emotional impact. It was hard seeing the Joad family suffer and it was such a relief to see them finally catch a break. Tom Joad was such a great character that by the end of the film he actually felt like a brother. The film really makes you feel like a Joad yourself looking back at the family's history. I've been lucky enough to see Cannery Row on a few occasions and I've seen with my own eyes the fields that the migrant workers of the time would have gone to in search of work. It gave the film a great impact. I'm glad I took the time to watch something so well done that I enjoyed so much.".

Flitting back and forth in the marriage it asks Is romantic love the ultimate form of masochism?Fine young actors Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams play Dean and Cindy who unite through a dogged courtship. Dean is easygoing happygolucky and content in his removal and packing company. He is chary of formal education but has a philosopher's outlook. Cindy is sexually overactive and although occasionally frolicsome is more mature than Dean. About five years on romance becomes repulsion and their marriage becomes one of inconvenience.

	schema:reviewBody "I am going to soap box it here for a second. The MPAA those fine folk who decide what rating a film will receive ticks me off to no end. Their system feels arbitrary outdated and stupid. You can only use the F word once in the non literal sense and maintain a PG13 rating. Because that's the problem kids hearing the f word too many times. For want of any other description it is terribly stupid.Why do I bring this up? Well because the film I watched tonight a powerful and incredibly touching film has been assigned an NC17 rating for a sex scene that is not erotic not violent not disturbing. It is graphic but more that that it is sad. Really sad. I'll talk more about this later but the idea that we have a system that gives The Human Centipede Hostel 12 and all of the Saw movies an R rating without a second thought gives this film an NC17 stuns me. I honestly cannot make sense of it. This is a beautiful touching and wonderfully authentic film that deserves a shot at release. There is no logical way a reasonable human being could say that this is less appropriate for a teenager than any of those listed above. For some reason we think graphic torture is fine but sex and nudity will be the downfall of us all.My favorite poem is T.S. Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. I've always identified with it and I think it is one of the finest pieces of writing ever produced. Specifically I am enamored with the line Shall I after tea and cake and ices have the strength to force the situation to its crisis. This describes a situation most of us have been in. You're in a relationship that is failing you know it's failing the other person knows your friends know but it just hasn't reached that crisis point that forces it to end. That is what this film is about.Most films center on the beginnings of a relationship the honeymoon the middle where things have reached a comfort point or the divorce proceedings but you rarely get the moment when the relationship dies. It's hard to present well and it's difficult to watch. This is what happens when the things that were once funny and cute aren't funny or cute anymore. We've all been there and it is painful.If you think of a relationship as having a life then Blue Valentine is that life at the moment of death where the life that is dying flashes in front of your eyes. There is a combination of present time and flashback showing how these two people came together and how the inevitably fell apart.Gossling and Williams are both superb in this film. He plays all the clumsy sweetness and frustration of Dean perfectly and she plays the damage and need to be loved with a quiet power that is absent from most performances today.These are two people with a very idealized and romanticized view of love. They view it as something that is there or it isn't. From their backgrounds it is obvious why. Neither of them has any exposure to a couple working at it tending to the relationship. Things are good then they aren't. Williams character says early on How can you trust your feelings when they can just disappear like that? That is a question that has plagued people as long as there have been relationships. At some point your feelings will change and if you are unequipped to change and grow with them then any relationship is destined to fail. The two stories falling in love and falling apart are told in intersecting circles. You see the beginning of the end then you see how they meet you see the relationship deteriorate further then you see their amazing first date. This style allows you to see how they fell in love with each other but also showed the lack of foundation the ultimately doomed them. Through most of the film it is obvious that the only reason they stayed together as long as they did is because of their daughter and their absolute love for her.Gosling as the devoted hard working father is touching Williams as the overworked mother who seems to be raising her husband along with her daughter is touching. The dynamic of goofy doting father and concerned loving mother is brilliantly played and creates some genuinely sweet and heartbreaking moments.This is not an easy movie to watch. It's quite brutal emotionally at times. The scene that earned the NC17 is quite graphic. The two go away to a romantic hotel for a night to try and rediscover something and end up in a graphic sex scene that is just hard to watch. It's not as graphic as say Monsters Ball but there is a resistance by Williams followed by a resignation she doesn't want to but she'll do it. It isn't violent it isn't a glamorized rape scene it's hard to watch because it's just so sad. There is no way to deny that this is the death of the relationship embodied in a single moment. He is still infatuated with her but she has moved on and there isn't any of the old spark left.While I did enjoy this film it is most definitely not something I would watch often. It is good enough to deserve another view or two but it is just to heartbreaking. This script went through 66 drafts over 12 years and it shows in the attention to detail the brilliant pacing and the way it allows a look and silence to speak volumes. This is a well acted solidly written and directed film that is well worth at least one viewing just be aware that it won't be an entirely pleasant experience.".

Gosling singing while Williams tap dances what she reveals to Gosling on the bridge and how he reacts the scene in the doctor's office towards the end... they achieve that sense of cinematic transcendence so rare these days.

	schema:reviewBody "I came away from this film more wary of love and relationships than any film I've ever seen. You look at Dean's character Gosling's best role todate and wonder what it is that he did wrong. He fell for a beautiful young woman Williams steppedup to care for her and her yetunborn daughter and shifted his life to focus entirely on being a good husband and father. He was so charming in his interactions with his daughter and was also loving towards his wife enduring more rejection from her than most could trying to breathe love back into the relationship. Even his outbursts seemed attempts to give her what she wanted.So many reviews talk about this being a story of falling in and out of love. My response is surely subjective but I don't feel Cindy ever loved Dean. She was desperate pregnant and facing life as a young parent and Dean was there to hold her. As a mother and wife I found her to be unlikeable and selfish cold and unloving. Cindy was probably not intentionally manipulative but from her initial reluctance to tell Dean about her pregnancy to her secrecy around her job offer or the encounter in the grocery store these are all subtle manipulations and lies hiding the truth and her true self from Dean.I heard the director say he was sympathetic to both characters. Any sympathy I had for Cindy as a young woman caught in a relationship and family she did not hope for was overshadowed by the fact that she made the choices that led her there and dragged others in with her. I did not sense any growth in her character to indicate she'd move on to create a brighter future for herself and Frankie.Dean on the other hand was a good person eager to love and alltoowilling to devote his life to Cindy and daughter Frankie a sparse but strong performance by Faith Wladyka and in the end he's left with a broken heart and a broken home. I'd love to feel he's betteroff without Cindy if only it weren't so heartbreakingly clear that he loves her and her daughter immensely. To me the film served as a warning in love to be careful where you put your energy.".

The acting is perfect. The metaphors are delicious and the hidden signs are just waiting to be uncovered. Another great thing about this movie is that it is interesting to get different perspectives from your friends as to what they think happened in the movie and to whose side they are on. It is unlikely that they will have trouble connecting to or relating to the characters in Blue Valentine no matter if they have ever been married or had kids before. Don't expect this to be a date movie or a nice happy romcom. It is pretty much the antithesis of a date movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This family album is familiar. A beautiful small town girl meets an eccentric but charming stranger and they fall in dumb. Five years and one enchanting child later his romantic notions sustain the illusion of his happiness but her reality is not so poetic. This is a quick snapshot of Dean Cindy and Frankie. What happens in this family is what happens to so many others when affection is replaced by contempt when passive aggression becomes less the former and more or less the latter.Derek Cianfrance has been developing Blue Valentine for nearly 12 years and his film is not just a complex portrait of its two main characters it's also profoundly honest as it examines intimacy from every angle. Emotionally and physically the romantic story of Dean and Cindy flashes backward in beautifully edited matching shots that show us the first flourish of affection and the final backlash of frustration. Cianfrance doesn't force his audience to choose sides though it was probably easier for me to identify with Cindy. That's what is the most compelling about this film. I cared about both of the main characters and didn't want either to lose. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams both delivered superb performances and each took a little piece of my heart. Or as Tom Waits said in his song It's the tattooed broken promise Dean has a Giving Tree tat on his upper arm.The camera work and art direction are exceptionally effective. Set primarily around Independence Day we see flags fireworks and all realm of red white and blue. This motif is subtly conveyed with the lighting and costumes throughout the film and continues throughout the credits. Fireworks serve as a last reminder of the explosive power and fractured remnants of a brief illumination.When this film is finally released I expect it will receive an R rating for some fairly graphic nudity and explicit sexuality. There is also a brutal fight alcohol consumption and smoking. And if that's not enough a nearabortion might be too much for some but hey this is a very contemporary portrait of a familiar American marriage.".

	schema:headline " Sweet And Emotionally Devastating";
	schema:reviewBody "BLUE VALENTINE is both sweet and emotionally devastating. It's raw in every sense of the word. Writerdirector Derek Cianfrance has crafted a brave and genuine relationshipcharacter study. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams floor me. Acting doesn't get better than thisDramas about a couple whose relationship is warm and fuzzy at first but then grows cold and bitter over time is not something new. You don't have to go back to classic films in the 60s you could just take last year's indie Peter and Vandy for example. So there have been many attempts to capture relationships on the big screen that's not fantastical but more grounded and more honest. I believe that BLUE VALENTINE has perfected it.What's genius about Cianfrance's story is that the dialogue doesn't hold any type of pretense to it. I attended the press screening and read the press notes afterward and was amazed by the long grueling process that Cainfrance went through along with his stars Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams just to get the kind of characters they have in mind. Some of the scenes you see in BLUE VALENTINE were contributions of Gosling and Williams who had complete understanding of the characters and the goal of the story. The story shows you the past how these two characters met what made them fall for each other romantic and heartfelt.. and then.. the present of what time does to a relationship when communication is not clear anymore and misunderstandings take over like an ugly bacteria that worsen every situation it just doesn't look hopeful from that point on.Last year we had the film Precious which was a pretty heavy emotionally draining drama. This year is BLUE VALENTINE which serves similar kick but it's less cinematic and even more performancedriven. I can't even begin to fairly describe how astounding Gosling and Williams are in this film. Their performances here will be the kind that aspiring actors and theater students will learn from for years to come. They're spontaneous and unadulterated. I'm completely amazed by the way the play the fights and the arguments. As Dean and Cindy Gosling and Williams respectively convince you that they once love each other and now they may or may not be able to stand each other's presence.Which leads me to the characters themselves I don't think Cianfrance created them so that you the audience would take sides or try to decide which of them is right or wrong because I believe that these are two individuals who eventually realize that they're living not just with each other but also with regrets of the past which make it very hard to be grateful.. you can tell that they're 'suffocated'.One could argue that Cindy is right in that Dean seems too content like he doesn't have ambition he's short tempered and very demanding. And one could argue that Dean is right in that Cindy is too consumed by the thoughts of what could've would've should've been if the her choices had been different. Their relationship is not physically abusive but it might as well be there are times when things get heated you would think it's only a matter of time before somebody would get seriously hurt.It seems like somewhere along the way Dean and Cindy just aren't in the same wavelength anymore. Their unhappiness stems from the fact that they no longer know how to make each other happy. Cianfrance wants to remind the audience that marriage is hard it's a lot of work and it can get rocky it's no laughing matter. If you're looking for a happy ending or perhaps Dean and Cindy have a moment where they'd still be friends BLUE VALENTINE doesn't offer that what it offers you is a depiction of both the beauty and the hardship of relationshipmarriage. It speaks to those who may have grown up in a home where the parents aren't your stereotypical love dubby mom and dad you see on 7th Heaventype soap operas. So if you don't come out appreciating BLUE VALENTINE not even for the performances then it's possible that it's because you're not the intended audience.".

	schema:headline " Blue Valentine The Most genuine and heartfelt romance in more than a decade.";
	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was a perfect film that defines the romantic relationship for the 21st century Derek Cianfrance's 'Blue Valentine' is that film. We begin at a secluded ranch house where a little girl is trying to find her lost dog. We then see her father Ryan Gosling comforting her. Enter mom Michelle Williams the concerned mother who tries to balance work and her child's needs. Seems like a generally happy household right? Wrong. Though they may not want to admit it Dean and Cindy's marriage has been on the rocks for years. Dean decides to take his wife to a sex motel that ends up being more like a Star Trek motel to try to rekindle the way they used to feel about each other. The reason for their bickering is unclear until the flashbacks that have been following the main plot line give you a full understanding of why things have deteriorated so. You see them meet each other fall madly in love and then experience well you'll have to see it yourself.Personally I think this is the tragic romance to end all tragic romances. Films will try to beat it but they will have to work long and hard before they can eek out an ounce of the genuineness with which this film tells its story. Ryan Gosling's performance is one with a true everyman quality while allowing for a fullfledged interesting character and a brilliantly realized character arc. Michelle Williams does the same. She delivers this role with so much raw truth that you almost forget that it's Michelle Williams and not just an average woman. I would not be surprised at all to see both of these superb talents get nominated for Best Actor Oscars along with Derek Cianfrance for Best Director and the writing team for Best Original Screenplay.It's heartbreaking it's deeply moving it will have you laughing crying and singing its praises. Even though the MPAA seems to have a beef with truth in filmmaking it's hard to imagine this film not being discovered over time and being recognized for the infallible masterpiece that it is.".

The script was weak there was no decent dialogue no compelling plot no creative storyline no real character development and no insightful resolution it was as if someone wrote about a sad boring broken romance that they had and found some sucker to produce it. It was a hyperbolized exhibit of the worse side of the marital statistics in society. As for the cinematography I have seen better quality work done in Junior colleges. Some of the scenes the frame was zoomed in so much the viewer didn't know what they were looking at I understand that it was done purposefully to bring a first person perspective for the viewer but it was contrived not avantgarde. I don't understand how people found this movie entertaining or valuable in anyway. Now for the story. Let me break it down guy meets girl already Pregnant 9 weeks in takes her anyway gets married in a roadside chapel five years later she doesn't appreciate him due the suffering of her own guilt but can't own up to her faults and blames it all on him. Guy sucker that he is raises the child as his own after being beat up by the biological father and still stays with the girl even though it is blatantly apparent she doesn't love him and using him as a scapegoat emotional crutch that throws him to the side after everything he's done for her. Heartwrenching? Only because Gosling's character was so spineless. Was I moved? To tears that I opt to go see another movie. Never did I imagine that a shotgun wedding love story could be made into a movie in such a pretentious and predictable manner. Those of you who thought this depressing chic flick was some kind of phenomenon please reconsider some truly good films that are out there and compare their qualities to this one and appreciate the well crafted deserving work that is available to you. As for the morals of the story don't marry someone you just met and is pregnant with someone else's child or stalks you on a bus with a ukulele. Don't need to remind me twice.I must again stress that Gosling and Williams did very well in their performances. Their abilities to show the change of state in their characters feeling towards one another was astounding and quite an inspiration in their work. Their choice to be a part of this project is what was disappointing. If these two were not involved in this project it would have never had such a big spotlight on it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout this film about a failing marriage I wanted one question to be answered What was the problem? Here we have a funny loving childlike guy married to an unhappy woman. Seems she gave up her medical career because she became pregnant before they married. Hmmm...since when does this thwart an entire career? It ain't the 50s anymore. We see through flashbacks that they were very much in love but we do not get to know why she not he becomes dissatisfied with the relationship. We are expected to believe that this is how most relationships dissolve? For no particular reason just a blah feeling about it all. This film needs a half hour of editing and a much faster pace. The dialogue is flat and the much hyped sexually explicit scenes may be just that for prime time network TV but not for me. I didn't see sexually explicit at all here. I asked audience members around meall womenwhat her problem was. Three said that it wasn't clear to them why she was no longer in love. One suggested it was probably because he smokes. Another because he drinks. Another because he is immature. Hmmm...Then I asked bothered it seemed two other moviegoers again women and they looked at me puzzled. When I asked her what the wife's problem was she said You meanwhat caused her problems? Uhm...yeah. The other said Life. And they both left. This film is not satisfying emotionally or intellectually. And it's a bore too. When the female protagonist says that she has two children implying that one of them is her husband I thoughtcould be this is her issue then. Lame just lame. The guy clearly loves her and their daughter and he is clearly childlike not childishin fact is is she who seems childish and selfish. Writers be clear.".

Rather it is a bleak look at a marriage that starts with good intentions and fades into misery. On the plus we witness an acting clinic by two of today's absolute best ... Ryan Gosling as Dean and Michelle Williams as Cindy. Dean is quite the oddball romantic as he strums his ukulele and quivers You Always Hurt the Ones You Love in a bit of foreshadowing. Cindy on the other hand is a bit more ambitious and has dreams of medical school.The two meet by happenstance in the hallway of a nursing home when Cindy is visiting her grandmother. Immediately there are sparks and after Cindy's macho boyfriend proves his true rotten self to her she becomes more enamored with Dean. When an unexpected pregnancy occurs Dean is pretty quick to stand up for Cindy and they set off to build a life together.Flash forward 6 years and Dean has changed very little while Cindy just seems totally beaten down. They both cherish their precious daughter Frankie played by newcomer Faith Wladyka but their relationship is nowhere gone kaput. Even an attempted onenight getaway to a themed hotel doesn't provide the relief they need. Instead it's the final straw. When Cindy repeats I'm done ... we don't doubt her at all.Director and cowriter Derek Cianfrance does a tremendous job with the details and creating the personalities of these two people. Every relationship requires work and failure can be predicted when one gives up and the other pretends all is fine. This one probably won't save any marriages but it is worth seeing just to watch Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in action.".

	schema:headline " The complexities of human relationships";
	schema:reviewBody "Blue Valentine is a complex drama as it requires the viewer to take a step forward beyond the visuals and in to the depths of the psychological world of the protagonists and how they operate as human beings. The viewer needs understanding of their life experiences and how this effects their ability to love and be able to take part in a loving relationship. I really liked the film for these reasons  it stretches the viewer beyond the superficial and in to the psychology of love and why a relationship may fail due to unresolved issues and failures in early family relationships. The fabric of the story revolves around a kind young man who is drifting and without education. He yearns for love and it becomes clear that his yearning is also connected to his lack of family in early life and mother abandonment. He meets a lovely intelligent young woman who is hoping to become a doctor  she has a weakness and that is rooted in a promiscuity and lack of true connection with men  this is due to her father being a bully which is clearly shown. Fate throws these two young people together and a pregnancy issue brings them to marriage  whether or not the child is truly his is never totally explained. However what is clear is that both of them are looking for love and the child serves as a catalyst for deeper connection. As the story emerges in the form of flashbacks we are shown the gradual deterioration of a very promising beginning. I can pin this deterioration on a few factors which the film masterly leaves in the viewer's consciousness to discover. Firstly the girl is not honest  she is not honest to herself and to her life wishes. She does not make decisions based on self awareness even though with her intelligence she is capable of that. She uses the love of the man to see her through a stage of being a mother that she has chosen but not with her whole heart. Meanwhile the young man is not without flaws but he cannot find the structure in himself to improve himself as an individual he sinks into a kind of lethargy probably sensing that he 'is not good enough' for the girl but not able to comprehend that if he had moved into education and goals she would have respected him more. The film then moves into the territory of what we are capable of in terms of emotional damage in early life. This is a heart wrenching drama as you can see the potential of their love and how it is eroded by their subconscious destructive mechanisms and inability to grow together. The acting is SUPERB I have total admiration for these two actors for these very difficult roles. I would like to conclude that Blue Valentine is not primarily a love story it is fundamentally a story about human complexity and the journey it takes to shake off the past and to redefine the personality THROUGH love for another individual. Unfortunately sometimes the demons that people carry and the burdens of childhood are too strong and too overwhelming to survive even the greatest love. We are more than just emotion and in the pursuit of a loving relationship we need to be brave enough to improve ourselves seek help and reach out for ways to grow within the initial love attraction and make it long lasting for life's long journey.".

I felt no discomfort except boredom in watching Blue Valentine because the actors who've swept me up entirely into other socalled difficult films Williams in Wendy and Lucy Gosling in The Believer for example were utterly unempathizable if intensely acted caricatures in this one.

The child is sweet and a talented little actor but is sadly just a plot device not the emotional story center she could have been.The structure had promise but the direction and script or improvisation were sloppy the work of people who base their visions of reality on other films not life. Muffed details like the clichd meet cute or Cindy's dad's careless morphing from awful father to sensitive grandfather or the incredibly wooden level of dialog and acting in the doctor's office fight could have been overlooked if I simply cared about the people at the core of the story.But the pair were as fake as the robot's vagina of a sexmecca offered up to show us how low their relationship had sunk.

When she falls pregnant she cannot be sure that He is the father.We also see the couple in the present She now a busy medic He naturally! a drunken chainsmoking bozo who has never progressed beyond warehouse work. Not that he is an unlikeable character for we see that he loves children his infant daughter animals the dog and old people he tenderly helps an elderly man settle into a rest home.The couple's marriage is disintegrating they go to a futuristic hotel for a weekend of passion in a room that looks like a cross between an American diner and the Tardis. It seems as He puts it 'like a robot's vagina'  a phrase which is striking but which doesn't really work  and neither do they. Later there's a confrontation at her place of work and they are nicely shown looking past each other with Her image reflected in a glass partition. Interspersed with these scenes are various depictions of fullsex which simply become boring and which don't add to the story.What we don't see however is what happens in between then and now. We don't see them struggling with Life so we are not really much wiser at the end of the movie than we were at the beginning. How He and She got to be where they are remains frustratingly obscure.The movie is saved from being a complete turnoff largely by the excellent acting all round and by the lush camerawork. Faith Wladyka is particularly brilliant as the couple's child especially in the early scenes with her daddy. If only He had not been encouraged to mumble his lines so much  what is it with this mumbling thing? It wasn't up to much even from Brando.So worth seeing but don't be surprised if you come away disappointed.P.S.

The way they move back and forth in time in Blue Valentine was similar to the movie Notebook and the emotionally depressing scenes were bit similar to the movie Revolutionary Road. So it didn't feel too original to me but still this movie had few things going on its own. Anyone who has been in a troubled relationship with the opposite sex will know how realistic this movie is but mind you it will leave you depressed. Good to see some realistic movies keep coming along the way in the midst of stupid scripts.".

He makes mistakes but never let go of his family.The director portrayed beautifully about the most common problems which arise between a man and wife and how they overcome those problems.

We find out only well into this bore that she wanted to be a doctor while he was a high school dropout and and made no bones about it. He marries her even though another guy just knocked her up. For the first half of the movie I thought she was just an impossible person in the second half we are given a crumb as to why  he drinks in the morning and lacks ambition. And that's it. The only charming pleasant scene in the whole movie is in the trailer him playing the ukulele and singing but we are given precious little more to convince us they should fall in love. In fact we're given no reason why she broke up with the previous guy except that he came inside her and that she would never speak to him again. Everything is too sketchy. What were the things that happened along the way to make them so miserable? Instead of a storyline we get awkwardly timed flashbacks and long lugubrious scenes of them being miserable together. My wife and I have been married happily less than two years and thought this movie might provide some food for thought things to watch out for but this movie gives nothing of the sort.

I just finished and they said this film stings...boy does it. The acting first off is exquisite. The back and forth from past to present was perfectly placed throughout the film and the overall outcome is so heartwrenching it feels like you've been punched in the stomach. Awards season here this film comes...And The Soundtrack? I want it.....soooooo bad. Whoever did the music deserves a medal.Best Scenes 1. The part where Ryan Gosling sings You Always Hurt The Ones You Love 2. The rest...Excuse Me Michelle... Michelle Williams seems to always play the role of a grieving wifewidowcancer patientDawson's Creek so maybe that's why she has this role down to a tee. It's not an insult it's a compliment....or just an observation. I don't think I've ever seen her in a happy comedy role so maybe a future project...no nevermind.Best Lines 1. Dean In my experience the prettier a girl is the more nuts she is which makes you insane. Cindy I like how you can compliment and insult somebody at the same time in equal measure. 2. Dean I feel like men are more romantic than women. When we get married we marry like one girl 'cause we're resistant the whole way until we meet one girl and we think I'd be an idiot if I didn't marry this girl she's so great. But it seems like girls get to a place where they just kinda pick the best option... 'Oh he's got a good job.' I mean they spend their whole life looking for Prince Charming and then they marry the guy who's got a good job and is gonna stick around.Overall A wonderful and heartbreaking love story with spot on acting singing cinematography directing and writing. It's so powerful it outshines most films I've seen this year and it's definitely going down as one of my favorites.9.5 Stars. Read all my movie reviews at httpdianalynn5287.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Blue Valentine is a realistic and somewhat depressing film about falling in and out of love.";
	schema:reviewBody "Blue Valentine is truly an independent film. Everything from the way it is shot to the acting to the storyline to the realness screamed indie! Blue Valentine has a simple storyline. It's a movie about two people Cindy Williams and Dean Gosling who fall in love. I will warn you now that this is not your typical love story. This film shows everything from how a relationship forms to how it can turn into a utter nightmare. Blue Valentine is realistic full of raw emotions and showcases two great performances but does that mean it's a great film? Well I will break that down for you in the next few paragraphs.Just think of Blue Valentine as a independent or poor man's version of Revolutionary Road with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Blue Valentine as I stated in the above is a very independent film. Cindy and Dean portray the average blue collar American couple. From the trailer you don't really know what the film is about besides the fact that there will be a random and somewhat humorous song and dance number by Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling in the film. The movie is about falling in and out of love. It shows you how once you begin to live life work and have a child how life changes and not always for the better. It's a very raw and in your face kind of film. Why this film got slapped with an NC17 rating is beyond me? There are some realistic love scenes in the film however nothing to raw that warrants that harsh of a rating. I don't get why MPAA got so tough on this film.I always enjoy Ryan Gosling in his independent projects and this one is no different. He was a really good hipster in this film. Without giving too much away from the film there is one scene where him and Williams are arguing and the emotion is so real and powerful. Gosling hasn't been this solid in a film since The Believer. As for Michelle Williams well she is another great actress. I always enjoyed her work but like Gosling she hasn't really had many mainstream hits. I think Williams is a talented independent actress but I don't know if she will ever be a huge scarlet. It's OK though because a lot of the best actors and actresses never make their way to being huge leads. Williams will hopefully be noticed this year for her performance in this film.This film was written by three different people and when there are normally more than two writers attached to a project I tend to worry. Why it took three people to write such a simple screenplay seems odd but maybe Derek Cianfrance Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne put a little bit of their relationship experience in the screenplay. I don't know for sure but this looked and felt like a realistic story at times like the writers had a similar experience. Gosling's character seemed a bit out there and was never really explained that well in the film. I didn't quite get why they didn't do a better background on his character. Also there was no middle of the relationship. It seemed to jump from good to bad and that hurt the chemistry of the two leads. Cianfrance also directed the film. He had some really good scenes where he captured the emotions of the characters perfectly but than others where he didn't do so well. Also it should be stated that most of the scenes in the film were written and then shot flashback to the present. It fit the film well and helped overlook some of the relationship potholes in the film.Overall Blue Valentine was a depressing heart wrenching and well acted piece of cinema. It didn't blow my mind as much as I would have liked it too but than again maybe I was expecting too much from a film with an 8 million dollar budget. As previously stated Blue Valentine can simply be summed up as a poor man's version of Revolutionary Road. With no disrespect to Williams or Gosling Kate and Leo pulled the trouble relationship off better. While Gosling and Williams were both extremely believable at times and showcased some raw emotion their chemistry wasn't as strong as the I would have liked I think as the characters got older they just seemed so different from one another. Gosling got so weird as he got older and since it wasn't truly explained why the film lost points for that. I think the big missing element was the storyline in the middle of the relationship which was there but not detailed. The story seemed to go from bad to good with no middle. This was the film's weakness and why the two leads didn't have has good of chemistry at times. If you can ignore a few missing plot holes and try not to focus on the inconsistency of the two leads chemistry with one another than I would say you should really be able to appreciate the film. I am trying not to be too harsh because I did enjoy the film a lot and it featured some terrific scenes even if they were extremely depressing.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Blue Valentine is a 7 out of 10. Not the best film of the year but definitely a realistic and raw look at relationships.".

Many describe a film about a couple who were in love and fall out of love. That isn't what I saw. I saw a picture about an appealing likable workingclass man who has the misfortune to love and marry a person who doesn't love him even at the beginning of their story let alone at the end. I can't figure out what she doesn't like about him. He's affectionate goodlooking a devoted parent and gainfully employed. I feel sorry for the couple's child at the end of the picture. Her dog is dead and the parent who is actually fond of the child is forced to leave.One of the characters muses that men marry only if they meet someone that they can't live without while women merely wait for an acceptable offer. It's a depressing opinion and I hope it isn't true but since it's offered as part of the screenplay maybe we're supposed to factor it in as part of the explanation for the wife's behavior.Less importantly the character of the wife's father seems to undergo a change that is not explained. He's an intolerable bully in the flashback scenes but seems passive when we see him again.Some of the handheld camera work is annoying.".

Her character seems to use and discard men for no good reason.Also the director said he was inspired by the second Godfather movie for creating parallel story lines separated in time. However the contrasts in the flashbacks and contemporary story lines aren't drastic enough. It made the flashbacks too confusing. If you spend time in a film saying Wait what's this right here? which I found myself doing several times there's something wrong.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second part in the Guinea Pig series and this is the bloodiest part the sickest is in my opinion the first part Devil's Experiment. Flowers of Flesh and blood is directed by Hideshi Hino who has made at least Mermaid in a Manhole the fourth Guinea Pig film. The story involves this psychopath who is dressed as samurai and kidnaps an innocent girl in the street. He takes her to his house drugs her unconscious and slowly starts to disembowel and mutilate the girl in sadistic detail occasionally saying something to the camera. This is the most controversial and infamous Guinea Pig and also one of the most feared sicko flick in the world. Hollywood actor Charlie Sheen saw accidentally a copy of this film and was 100 positive of it being a genuine snuff film and so he took the tape to policeFBI and the investigations began. I'm not sure how large investigations were in Japan or America but I've heard that the film makers had to prove to authorities how they made the effects and thus show that the act committed in the film is NOT real and the girl didn't die and that is the case this is NOT snuff film and all the sick things that happen in the screen are faked and acted.The next paragraph tells the things what our psycho does to the girl and so they can be considered spoilers.The scenes are pretty repulsive and blood is everywhere but this is not realistic as the girl would've bled to death immediately after the first arm was cut off. After the samurai has cut off all the limbs he slowly disembowels her and after that mutilates her face and eyes and finally cuts off her head. Sounds nice doesn't it? After the girl is dead the head removed we are shown that there are many other limbs and corpses in his house and the girl was not the only victim. The house crawls with worms that are eating the bodies and all the images in the film are repulsive. The film ends when we see that man again in the streets of Japan hunting another young girl with things in his mind..So who directs a sequel? Hopefully no one.No spoilers anymore.Flowers of Flesh and Blood is among the sickest and goriest films I've seen but it cannot be considered too significant cinematic merit. The scenes in the samurai's apartment are haunting and dark but since the film is so shock intended and has no any value as a real film I can't consider this too noteworthy piece of cinema and it is only intended to shock as the whole Guinea Pig series. Junkies of Japanese horror movies will probably want to check and try to find copies of these but others should stay away. Even though it is so over the top it is not as sick as all have said so some may even be disappointed when they expect something totally unmatchable in sicko department. After all I'm glad I've seen this and most of the Guinea Pig series because having not seen them I wouldn't be able to know what these are about and horror fanzines have written so much about these that a natural interest as a horror buff raised. And I was pretty lucky to get copies of these films that are not too much distributed and that is pretty positive thing! After all I've said about horror fans and others my opinion still is that these are not noteworthy films and cannot be considered real films and they only want to deliver shocks and disgust the viewer without any other merits. Flowers of Flesh and Blood cannot even be considered a feature film since its running time is mere 40 minutes.".

The darker underbelly of the investigation resulted in the banning of Guinea Pig in Japan. To date no distributor has picked up and reprinted the films officially though the ban has not stopped new ones from leaking out and the series now stands at nine and so when one finds copies of Guinea Pig films they are often fourth and fifthgeneration dubs of questionable quality at best.

If I disappear quickly you know why.Yesterday I received a thirdgeneration copy of II and III see below. GP2 is the most infamous of the series. It is also the shortest clocking in at a scant fortytwo minutes. It has no plot to speak of. A woman is abducted by a man dressed as a fourteenthcentury Samurai warrior and systematically dismembered. And while if you know the basics of film composition and realize that the cut shots could not have been done in the ways they are if this were actually being filmed in realtime there are a few points where the best thing one can do is to sit and repeat to oneself this is not real. The effects are quite simply spectacular within the framework of what's going on and I was pleasantly if anything about this can possibly be said to be pleasant surprised by the fact that other than the differing genders of the two players in this twisted brutal sturm und drang and much more drang than sturm if you translate it literally any sexuality involved is read into it by the viewer.Guinea Pig 2 is not something to be enjoyed it is something to test the boundaries of one's endurance. How is it possible to rate such an experience? And do you really want something like this in your home? In my case the answer is an unqualified yes but then I'm depraved. Going strictly on the quality of my copy and the shattering effectiveness of the film at what it sets out to do I'm forced to give it  12.".

	schema:reviewBody "I began hearing about the infamous Guinea Pig series several years ago but admittedly only got my hands on them recently. I really didn't want to spend 20 for a 2nd generation VHS copy so... I waited and picked up the Unearthed boxset release. Luckily I found it for pretty cheap anyway... Quick synopsis Freaky samurai dude abducts and dismembers a chick the end. Flower of Flesh and Blood is definitely gory and the lack of any real storyline may be what makes this film so shocking. It's pretty much the torturemurder of a girl with no apparent reason behind it. The problem is that even though the effects are pretty good for something shot in 1985 with a probably nonexistent budget it still looks fake. Anyone who would actually mistake this for real snuff is a retard sorry Charlie  The other problem that I have with this film as well as The Devil's Experiment another Guinea Pig fake snuff film is that the victims don't respond appropriately to what is happening to them. They whimper and whine a little bit but I think someone who was having their extremities removed violently would react a little more spiritedly. Another thing that makes these films look fake is the quality of the transfer to DVD. Unearthed did such a good job with the transfer that you can clearly see how fake everything is. I think if this film had a little more grainy look to it it may have actually enhanced the realism factor  Not that Unearthed should have made a crappy transfer I just think that some films actually come off better looking kind of old and grainy this film being one of them. Overall definitely worth a look for extreme horror fans if nothing else than to quench your curiosity about what all the fuss is about. Definitely not for the mainstream horror movie goer. A generous 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to say something that I've seen very few reviews anywhere say Guinea Pig Flowers of Flesh and Blood really simply is NOT that gory. Do not misunderstand me. I'm not one of the countless reviewers who are complaining this movie didn't look realistic. Some of those people wouldn't think a real body being cut up looked realistic if they didn't know it was real. What I'm saying is the actual events depicted on screen simply weren't all that gory or sick. Not by today's standards.It's a sad little world when you read the internet nerds who hide behind a cheesy screen name and trash modern torture movies because they're not gory enough for their supposed juggernaut balls. Most of them speak with elegance spouting off the names of obscure Japanese movies that are So sick! and Make Hostel look like a family movie! Put simply They're almost always wrong. What's sadder than that is that most people don't realize their wrong even after they watch ohsosick obscure movie and shyly realize they've seen worse on the Saw promo posters but would never admit it because it would mean going against the selfproclaimed film buffs.That is why I'm here to stand against the crowd and say what needs to be said. Flowers of Flesh and Blood is not the goriest movie of all time. For someone who's seen modern torture movies it's not even that gory at all and here is why . . .First and foremost as has been stated by almost everyone this movie has no plot. It's pure fake snuff from open to close. I have absolutely nothing against that at all. While it was too tame for me to fully enjoy the lack of a plot made the film very intense and easy to sit through without getting bored. On the other hand however the lack of a plot made the film seem a lot more brutal than it actually was. If you were to take any of the five Saw films and cut out every minute except the pure gore all of them would seem just as intense if not more intense than Flowers of Flesh and Blood. If you were to add forty more minutes of plot to Flowers of Flesh and Blood it would seem just just as tame as all the Hollywood torture films that the selfproclaimed film buffs all call tame. Don't mistake intensity for gore.Second Flowers of Flesh and Blood isn't something you can just walk to the local video store and get five copies of. It's nowhere even slightly as wellknown as Saw and Hostel. The obscurity is something selfproclaimed film buffs have always fed off of and if this were something you could easily pick up the same selfproclaimed film buffs wouldn't even consider it gory. You see it's not about content it's all about lack of popularity that builds a false hype. Likewise whenever someone says for example that Ichi the Killer is The sickest movie I've ever seen! the selfproclaimed film buffs all jump on his back and say they found it tame even if they really didn't. Then they say something like But man go watch Flowers of Flesh and Bloodnow there is a sick movie! Again the lesser known name build the hype.Third the gore content is simply uncreative. Standard limbs are severed as in every other standard gore movie ever. The only difference here is that the cameraman goes into ultra closeups every few seconds to give the illusion that this movie is actually doing something that hasn't been done thousands of times.There were at least ten spots in the movie where my own mind went into things that could have been done to make the scene four times as gory but the director doesn't even have half that imagination or balls. He stuck to the generic seenitathousandtimes gore scenes. That alone makes this inferior to the Saw and Hostel series as far as gore goes not to mention inferior to the countless other modern films like The Decent and Inside. Point blank there is nothing here that is sadistic or even that gory. Sadism implies that gore has creativity and that is a total joke here. Gore implies that something is brutal and bloody and as I've said compared to modern movies this is fairly average.Don't believe the hype that this is ohsogory.On a technical level the acting from the main villain a joke as I think it was meant to be. The acting from the woman was very believable. The ultra closeups became cheesy. The gore effects are nothing compared to the French gore film Inside but I never once thought they lacked enough realism to become laughable as some reviewers stated. You have to remember also that most of the reviewers who say they laughed at this movie are most likely saying that to overlook that they have weak stomachs. It's common.On an entertainment level I found this movie to be very much worth a watch and very entertaining. I give it credit for the intensity. The only plot point in the film that the killer only kills women is a outright clich but it doesn't bear anything on the actual film.Overall Flowers of Flesh and Blood is a fun little torture film that lacks anything truly disturbing or gory but is worth the watch if you're a gore fan. I'm really just sick of people hyping this to be so much gorier than the Hollywood norm because it simply is not. The first five minutes of Saw IV alone the autopsy scene had every single thing this movie had. When it comes to the world of gore this is the single most overrated film of all time.410".

He intercuts his jobs of slicin' and dicin' with interesting monologues.First he removes her clothes and covers her with a white sheet. Then he takes a needle and jabs it into one of her thighs and she falls into an unconscious state. He dismembers one of her hands then her other hand and everything else up to her leg leaving her head alone. Then he cuts her open grabbing her heart intestines and other stuff as the woman vomits blood and finally dies. One part left her head so he chops it off and licks the blood off of it. Then to add insult to her serious injury he pokes her eye out. Then he shows us his collection.This is an extraordinary film. It is a little rougher than your standard gore fest and it has great special effects. DO NOT watch if you have a weak stomach though. So sit back and prepare for the Flower Of Flesh and Blood.".

Although after viewing Flowers I would have to say that this movie is probably even more infamous than its predecessor.The movie virtually has no storyline just like Devil's Experiment. Basically a woman is abducted off the streets late one night. She awakens tied to a bed with a man dressed as a Samurai standing over her. He injects her with a powerful drug which knocks her unconscious. Then he proceeds to saw off her hands. Next he saws off her arms saws off her legs removes her intestines hacks off her head and removes her eyeballs. All of this in about 25 minutes. As he is mutilating this poor girl he is reciting poetry and talking about putting her with his collection.I wasn't really disturbed when I saw this. Maybe a little grossed out during the hand removing scenes but for the most part if you are used to seeing this type of thing in lowbudget horror films you won't be effected. The little bit of a score that was in the movie was rather appropriate and well placed. All the gore was great looking. Unlike Devil's Experiment inwhich there is no rhyme or reason to what is going on and why Flowers introduces you to the mutilator himself and builds some character and why he is doing this. Although it would not make any sense to a regular human being.This movie is a true masterpiece of rough gore. Although not recommended for the squeamish I would really have to recommend this to those of you who really look for the gore in movies. Fake or not you should like this. 810".

Also the favorite film of the first five in the series prominently displayed among notorious serial killer Tsutomu Miyazaki's 5000strong video collection and supposedly the inspiration for his own crimes. When Charlie Sheen came across a battered VHS copy of this in the late 80's he was convinced it was real and reported it to the FBI.

But is it really? Can't you just read up on some serial killers or something if you want to be 'disturbed'. Watching this was ultimately a fairly worthless experience and outside of the undoubtedly impressive though certainly fakelooking special effects there is really absolutely nothing else to recommend with this 'film'.

The special effects are fairly admirable but there is literally nothing else of worth here.I sat through it. I suppose that this is something I thought I should see for myself due to its notoriety and reputation. Not that I was expecting it to be good but I at least thought it would be worthwhile. Don't fool yourselves this is on the level of a high school student film technically there is no 'writing' to speak of well except some rambling about blood resembling flowers or some nonsense like that and the 'actor' in the lead role spends most of the 'movie' looking pretty goofy. The abducted woman 'guinea pig' if you will is asleep most of the time. There is nothing here except something for fledgling serial killers to watch while sharpening their knives. I'm not dismissive of 'shock' films in general some of them can be genuinely wellmade and reasonably compelling films. This simply isn't one. It's absolute garbage cinematic puke. Truly one of the worst films ever made and my hatred comes not from being 'offended'. Watching this isn't watching somebody being tortured it's torturing yourself.010".

	schema:reviewBody "I first heard of this movie when I was 17 so about 13 years ago and it took me 2 years to find it and gather the balls to watch it. At the time I heard that was the worst movie next to Cannibal Holocaust which I still refuse to watch not because of the gore but because they killed and tortured real life animals on film and I am a vehement supporter of PETA and am against animal being mistreated let alone tortured and killed for the sake of entertainment.Anyway stoned I sat down in a dark room and watched the copy of Gin piggu 2 Chiniku no hana I had downloaded.First off the beginning is a little creepy but nothing I hadnt seen before cue to the kill room and still nothing I hadnt seen but I started to get a ominous feeling since I had heard so much horrible stuff. To tell you the truth the torture wasn't that shocking it was actually a let down. I mean my heart was racing and I was sweating but I chalk that up now to stuff that were in my system making me hyper focus on the screen not wanted to move or blink in the chance that I missed something terrible. To tell you the truth the worst thing was I had a stiff neck from tensing myself in anticipation that something horrible was going to happen the hype and anticipation freaked me out more than the actual movie. I actually found myself getting bored at times. When the movie ended I was more shocked that is was over because I thought that surly that wasn't the end of the movie.As far as the gore goes I have seen worst on film since then and had been exposed to worst before that looking up stuff on death and violence and torture for horror stories I wrote. Also things like how the hand acted after cut from the wrist were inaccurate and kind of threw me off. The thing that threw me off the most though was the blood and how long the chick survived before she died. He gave her anything to slow the flow of blood down nor did he tourniquet her to slow the bleeding. Im sorry but she wouldn't have survived very long bleeding like she did. No matter what magic drug he gave she would still show signs of bleeding to death. She would physically shiver as her body heat dropped. No matter how much pleasure she was getting the blood loss would make her confused and anxiety would kick in and no matter what she felt her mind and body would know she was in danger and start to freak out also she would involuntarily start breathing fast and heavy as her body tried to get rid of CO2 and get more oxygen.At the end of the film I never got queasy felt I was going to be sick felt like I had watched something horrible felt changed nor did it stick with me after watching it. Im writing this review after attempting to watch it a second time a few hours and stopping it in the middle of the torture because it was so damn boring that I couldn't take it. I have came to the conclusion that my beating heart and sweating the first time around was because I was on stuff and because of the hype was anticipating something that never came. The truth is the hype of this movie is far more horrible than the movie will ever be. And the lack of any plot or worthy dialogue makes it seem worst than it is like in a previous review I agree that if this had a plot dialogue or any kind of story thrown into the mix this movie wouldn't seem that shocking. This isn't horror its smut and the horror equivalent of shock jock radio. All filler no substance.There are so many movie out there that are more gory disturbing and wrong out their that actually stick with you after watching and far more with superior sfx. Also they think out the deaths more. Quality prosthesis are not hard to come by realistic blood is easy to come by and it not hard to make the cutting and hacking look realistic. The sound was probably the most upseting thing in this movie but how hard is it to go to a butchers and get a pig and record the sounds of you hackingslicing sawing and chiseling and breaking bones. They did all that perfectly but they forgot the most important things the science of what happens when someone dies. A little research and it would have been 100x more realistic and all it would have taken was a little acting from the actress and deciding if she absolutely had to survive till her organs we removed what are ways to make sure she doesn't bleed to death be it cutting off the blood flow or cauterizing the stumps.You want to see a movie that is horrible gory and sticks with you after watching it making you question the world yet has a good story? Then watch A Serbian film. While not a lot of it the gore is top notch. But the messed up parts which are 100x's worst than what is done to this girl is what the main character sees and is manipulated and forced to do in the movie. All of it is sexual in nature and it not only affects him but his family too. The last scene is probably the worst thing I have ever heard of anyone planning to do. There are worst movies out there than A Serbian Film but it affected me and made me profoundly sad after watching it.".

When the movie ended I was more shocked that is was over because I thought that surly that wasn't the end of the movie.As far as the gore goes I have seen worst on film since then and had been exposed to worst before that looking up stuff on death and violence and torture for horror stories I wrote. Also things like how the hand acted after cut from the wrist were inaccurate and kind of threw me off. The thing that threw me off the most though was the blood and how long the chick survived before she died. He gave her anything to slow the flow of blood down nor did he tourniquet her to slow the bleeding. Im sorry but she wouldn't have survived very long bleeding like she did. No matter what magic drug he gave she would still show signs of bleeding to death. She would physically shiver as her body heat dropped. No matter how much pleasure she was getting the blood loss would make her confused and anxiety would kick in and no matter what she felt her mind and body would know she was in danger and start to freak out also she would involuntarily start breathing fast and heavy as her body tried to get rid of CO2 and get more oxygen.At the end of the film I never got queasy felt I was going to be sick felt like I had watched something horrible felt changed nor did it stick with me after watching it. Im writing this review after attempting to watch it a second time a few hours and stopping it in the middle of the torture because it was so damn boring that I couldn't take it. I have came to the conclusion that my beating heart and sweating the first time around was because I was on stuff and because of the hype was anticipating something that never came. The truth is the hype of this movie is far more horrible than the movie will ever be. And the lack of any plot or worthy dialogue makes it seem worst than it is like in a previous review I agree that if this had a plot dialogue or any kind of story thrown into the mix this movie wouldn't seem that shocking. This isn't horror its smut and the horror equivalent of shock jock radio. All filler no substance.There are so many movie out there that are more gory disturbing and wrong out their that actually stick with you after watching and far more with superior sfx. Also they think out the deaths more. Quality prosthesis are not hard to come by realistic blood is easy to come by and it not hard to make the cutting and hacking look realistic. The sound was probably the most upseting thing in this movie but how hard is it to go to a butchers and get a pig and record the sounds of you hackingslicing sawing and chiseling and breaking bones. They did all that perfectly but they forgot the most important things the science of what happens when someone dies. A little research and it would have been 100x more realistic and all it would have taken was a little acting from the actress and deciding if she absolutely had to survive till her organs we removed what are ways to make sure she doesn't bleed to death be it cutting off the blood flow or cauterizing the stumps.You want to see a movie that is horrible gory and sticks with you after watching it making you question the world yet has a good story? Then watch A Serbian film. While not a lot of it the gore is top notch. But the messed up parts which are 100x's worst than what is done to this girl is what the main character sees and is manipulated and forced to do in the movie. All of it is sexual in nature and it not only affects him but his family too. The last scene is probably the worst thing I have ever heard of anyone planning to do. There are worst movies out there than A Serbian Film but it affected me and made me profoundly sad after watching it.";

During the last few decades he directed a lot of low budget nonsense movies for stones film students but nothing you can really enjoy.Deutschland neun null Germany nine zero from 1991 is his film about the German union in late 1990 and the fall of the communist East German government. The only entertaining thing about this movie is that Godard chose Eddie Constantine in his old role as Lemmy Caution a successful hardboiled detective that he used to play in some European bmovie productions in the sixties. Godard already used his role for his strange science fiction Alphaville from 1965.But in this movie Lemmy Caution is just stupidly walking around and facing senseless situations supported by weird collages renditions of poems and other nonsense. There is no plot here and Godard never really seemed to have liked scripts at all. This production might enlighten some depressed leftwinged intellectuals but no normal thinking human can enjoy this waste of time and money.The worst thing are the cliches that Godard is using and adding boring discussions about German philosophers to footage material of Adolf Hitler the Third Reich the Berlin ruins after WWII Mozart and Beethoven tunes and cold war situations is everything that mindless people might associate with Germany... only the Bavarian leather trousers skinheads Kraftwerk or Rammstein songs soccer stars and some German beer and sauerkraut are missing!

	schema:headline " Such bad writing what a disappointment!";
	schema:reviewBody "OK this movie was extremely disappointing. From the plot do the characters to the acting to the three 3D it was one poorly written premise after the next.The first thing that was stupid...The opening trap...This one left me feeling the writers purposely set out to make it stupid and unbelievable. The scene opens with hundreds of people walking by the window with three people tied up you only see two of them until the trap begins. The reason jigsaw puts them in the trap was just plain stupid two guys manipulated by one girl and must have taken 5 seconds to come up with...Also does anyone honestly think in such a public place no one would notice two people tied to construction equipment??? And then the only attempt from the crowd to save them was one small women trying to bang the glass with a briefcase obviously the glass wasn't going to break and so that was it no more attempts...Really?? And not only that but everyone was watching like it was some movie taking pictures with their camera phone...I was literally laughing in the theater at how stupid it was...In the end the only person who died was the girl who frankly out of the three deserved it most and you didn't care at all...Second thing that was stupid and totally not believable....Bobby's character or the main character...Bobby was a guy who lied about surviving a jigsaw trap so he could sell books and lead a publicized support group of real jigsaw survivors This again made me feel like the writers just gave up and used the first idea that came to mind...Why was it not believable? Because if someone had gone through a jigsaw trap there would have been a police report a thorough investigation all sorts of documentation about what happened where it happened people involved hospital reports about his injuries...So how he can write an entire book get it published do book signings go on TV lead a support group without having any proof other than fake scars is BEYOND ME...Not only that but the decision to make Bobby's trap about going through a house and trying to help out his colleagues is completely unoriginal...SPOILER After everything unfolded and everyone died I was left feeling that writers didn't want to make anyone live because then they would have had to think harder about the plot...Besides the characters in the traps are so thin and meaningless to the other characters you really don't care at all when they die because they contribute nothing to the story line anyway...Third thing that was stupid...Hoffman's character....His motive the entire movie was revenge on Jill tuck for putting him a trap...Spoiler His character for the entire movie was nothing more than a thug...He just walked around stabbing people in the neck until he got to Jill...I mean how freaking stupid is that? Again I was left feeling the writers had no desire to put anymore thought into the movie and said Screw it I'm done thinking about this movie...Let's just make him stab people in the neck and be done with it..Fourth thing that was stupid...Gibson's character...In the past Hoffman saved this cop's life told to the audience via flashback but then brutally killed Gibson's attacker Gibson reported him for excessive brutality and Hoffman held a grudge ever since...STUPID premise!! Spoiler The goose chase Hoffman puts them on was retarded and required no thought...He led them to a room and they all got shot by a sub machine gun.Fifth that was stupid...The ending and Doctor Gordon's character....Total Spoiler It was always rumored before Saw 7 came out that Doctor Gordon was still alive helping out jigsaw...So I was really excited to see how it would pan out...Man what a disappointment...You see him once in the survivor support group for about 30 seconds and then doesn't show up until the last two or three minutes of the movie where he attacks Hoffman....The writers decided that a thirty second flash back was all that was necessary to explain his involvement with Jigsaw after that he puts Hoffman in the room from the first movie where Dr. Gordon originally hacked off his own leg and shuts the door...You don't see him die! And the movie ends...Spoiler But wait what happened to Bobby? Nothing he goes through each trap trying to save the lives of his colleagues but fails them all...He finally gets to his wife in the last trap fails at saving her she is burned alive and the last time you see him on the screen is crying in front of the furnace that is burning his wife. Out of any character in the movie I really wanted her to live because she did absolutely nothing wrong...So again this movie was such a waste of time...The plot on ALL LEVELS felt rushed and meaningless completely unoriginal and POORLY written....Perhaps I held it to a higher standard because the first one was BRILLIANT!!! and the others good but it's really nothing more than a mindless slasher movie...In fact the only thing I can say good about the movie is the traps are pretty cool...There are a lot of them and they're creative...All that being said I am glad I saw it... because at least now I have NO DESIRE TO SEE ANOTHER SAW MOVIE...If they come out with Saw vs Freddy or Jason I'm leaving the country.".

	schema:reviewBody "If it's Halloween then it must be Saw We've heard this tag line repeated over the years and it's no surprise another Saw film has popped up into cinemas. There is however a catch to this installment it's the final chapter. As a loyal fan of the series I was excited last year with Saw VI and saw it as the perfect opportunity to end the series. Sure there were a few unanswered questions but I didn't think it was worth another film to get the answers. Obviously the producers disagreed with me and not only went for a seventh installment but also gave into the latest 3D phenomena to cash in some bucks.Financially the producers put themselves in a nice position. There were tons of moviegoers paying to see Saw 3D. As far as credibility goes the producers threw it out the window. Saw 3D is without a doubt the worst installment in the series. It's badreally badand I can't stress that enough. Not only does the film deliver a ridiculous plot but it also fails visually leaving movie goers with empty wallets and a shortcoming 3D experience.Saw VIIexcuse me I mean Saw 3Dtells the story of Bobby Dagen a Jigsaw survivor who makes profit from his grisly experience by writing books and televising interviews on television. He also acts as a counselor to surviving Jigsaw victims guiding them towards psychological recovery. Life seems good for Bobby until he is thrust into a horrific game where the goal is to save his wife before the timer hits zero. Meanwhile Detective Hoffman hunts down Jill Tuck seeking revenge over the events of the last film.There's a lot going on in Saw 3D and you honestly never get bored with it. There are eleven traps the highest in franchise history and the Hoffman and Jill story line is presented on the side. The problem however is that we've seen this all before. We've seen someone go through a series of tests against a timer we've seen gruesome traps and we've seen the now predictable twists. Not only is the material in the film recycled it's poorly made. The plot is ludicrous the acting is horrible the traps lack creativity and the 3D looks cheap and isn't utilized at all pretty disappointing considering it was shot with 3D cameras.Tobin Bell whose character died in Saw III is in the film for an estimated five minutes possibly even less. Carey Elwes who played the infamous Dr. Gordon in the original Saw is back this time around but also has very limited screen time. It's a shame that a majority of the main characters are pushed to the side for Bobby Dagen's game which in essence turns out to be a waste of time. The traps are boring the shock value has completely disappeared and you ultimately don't feel for any of the characters in the film. All of these cons along with the cheap 3D make for a horrible film that shouldn't even bear the Saw title.It's even difficult putting the blame on some of the film makers. Director Kevin Greutert was forced to return since Lionsgate had a clause in his contract for another film. He was set to direct Paranormal Activity 2 but was pulled in to Toronto a week before the filming of Saw 3D. He attempted vigorous rewriting of the script but it proved to be difficult since a majority of the sets were already built. Greutert tries his best to salvage the film but it ultimately falls into pieces due to the production and incoherent story line. Producer Mark Burg and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan should be ashamed for giving into 3D and crazy fan theories online.Overall the only positive thing about Saw 3D is that the franchise is finally over. It's run its course and while I expected the film to be poor I didn't expect it to come to this. After following the franchise for six long years I honestly feel betrayed and cheated after the final twist. The Saw franchise started with an interesting concept and ran with it but it fell flat on its face at the finish line.".

	schema:reviewBody "What can one attribute to another entry into the Saw franchise? Number 7 comes right on the heels of the 3D craze and purports to be its final chapter. So Jigsaw Tobin Bell is still dead and but his legacy still goes on in flashbacks. And in a protg Hoffman Costas Mandylor. And in his widow Jill Betsy Russell. The entire soap opera of Jigsaw's family and professional life carries a narrative that attempts to reconcile the final film with the beginning of the franchise and it definitely does seem to have recapitulated rather well for both hardcore fans as well as fairweather ones. But it has to be said that the films have been on a downward spiral since its fantastic first installment. It delivers the gore in more elaborate ways than the past few films have  considering how quickly they were rushed out  but loses that sense of cleverness and more importantly that sense of menace that the franchise has always attempted to retain.After the previous six films the franchise does not so much look through the eye of the victims anymore as it does its villains who have an entire mythology unto themselves. And Saw 3D almost solely focuses on Hoffman who it really has to be said is a sad substitute for Jigsaw. He carries on his messiah's waning moralistic philosophy by continuing to find victims in need of a baptism by blood but finds himself hindered by Jill who is now cooperating with the police and giving them everything she knows to spite her husband's latest protg. Add to this one Bobby Dagen an actually funny Sean Patrick Flanery who has written a bestselling book and sold DVDs about being a Jigsaw survivor and profiting from Hoffman's hallowed gift of life. Suffice to say he and his wife quickly becomes the main plaything of this film's grand guignol torture play with 60 minutes set on the clock.Now even with the requisite twists and betterthanexpected inventiveness of its traps Saw 3D does not deliver in the least with its titular promise  it's 3D sets yet another low standard for the technology. If the onus on watching this film is to attempt a different perspective then it never quite reaches the mark. But who are we really kidding here? It's just one more excuse to milk this cash cow. The franchise has truly run its course. If you watched and enjoyed all seven of its films at least you can be proud of that. Right? Anyone?www.moviexclusive.com".

But first the plot if you can call it a plot.Detective Hoffman is still alive. Jill's attempt to kill him backfired when he found a way out of his supposedly inescapable trap. Whilst Hoffman is out to kill Jill he has to contend with setting up another set of traps for the lying Bobby Dagen and his friends. If Bobby is to make it to the end and save his wife he will have to push himself to the limit.Step 1 The plot. Ensure your plot is convoluted and does not make sense in the slightest. If you are worried that it does then provide meaningless flashbacks. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Why change the format when it worked for Saw IV V and VI. Just rinse and repeat.Step 2 The main character. Who wants motivation plausibility and character development? The answer nobody! Ensure your character is as bland as humanely possible. The make him unlikable arrogant and selfabsorbed. If he possesses any humanity wipe it out immediately!Step 3 Jigsaw. The main villain is not Jigsaw anymore. To let your audience know this have Tobin Bell dress as a gangster for one scene so that he can embarrass himself. Then watch the less interesting Hoffman blunder from scene to scene.Step 4 The script. Make sure your script consists of lines that would make Sylvester Stallone worried. Fill it with profanity and the screams of human beings. When you have ninety pages of Horror clichs you are almost ready to begin.Step 5 The Acting. Ensure your actors are human and made of meat and bone if they can scream louder than a toddler hire them forthwith.Step 6 The camera work. The reason these films make so much money is because of their budget. You spent it on the traps so borrow the cheapest hand held camera you can find and film all scenes in one take.Step 7 The length. Make your film as short as possible but feel ten times the length. Your audience will wonder how it lasted so long.Step 8 The traps. Have as many traps as you want the more the better. Who will notice pink blood? A lack of invention and tension? Nitpickers that's who. If your audience is not sick within the first five minutes then you have failed them as a Director.Step 9 Closure. Do not allow for closure. Provide questions with no answers. This will mean that if a sequel is green light then you can slowly divulge the answers in Saw M.Step 10 The Obligatory Twist Ending. If the climax does not leave you scratching your head then change it again. Have characters you thought dead return just so that you can destroy the brains of the audience.If you follow all of these steps you can guarantee the death of a franchise. Or for a few years at least until it is remade re envisioned rebooted or all of the above.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I could give this a rating of 0 I easily would. This was without a doubt the worst Saw film I have ever seen.I've been a fan of the Saw films since the start and while i think they should have ended it at the first I've still managed to catch each one each year to see what kind of new ideas they have brought to the franchise.Unfortunately the ideas brought to this one were terrible.The trap in the opening scene was just ridiculous a girl should die since she was been twotiming her boyfriend with some other guy. So they have a choice the guys can kill each other or kill the girl. These are the kind of ideas that just require no thought or imagination whatsoever.Then we are introduced to Bobby who was a survivor of a trap yet we soon uncover that he was actually not in one of Jigsaws traps at all. He was merely trying to cash in on fame by proclaiming he was one. Since the audience is introduced to this before Bobby must endure his test we really don't feel anything for his character. As I was watching I thought I hope he fails and he is killed because it's awful to lie about that simply to get yourself rich. But alas he did not die! And at the end of it I don't think he learned anything from his game. Come to think of it we never even see what happens to him. Instead we are brought to this.....Dr Gordon has returned! Wow what a surprise! Ugh no not really. It was obvious that the producers were going to bring him back when realizing this would be the last Saw film and that they would want to make it as huge as possible. Unfortunately the moment I saw him I immediately knew how the movie would end with him being involved. How did I know? Because most fans wanted that. It seems that the writers didn't have any ideas so they thought they would browse the forums jot down the whole Gordon being involved theory and end the film that way. While I have no issue with giving the fans what they want that only appeals to some movies. It just didn't work for this movie. I don't like watching a movie and knowing how it will end. The whole point of Saw was to catch you by surprise with its ending but i was not surprised in the slightest bit. If anything it just left it open for a future sequel.The acting in this film was also atrocious. The actor who played Gibson was awful I laughed as he tried to pass himself off as serious. The other's were pretty much as average as always. Tobin Bell in my opinion is always the best actor in the Saw franchise. Was a shame we only saw him in 2 scenes though.Also as usual with these sequels each one tries to outdo the last with it's level of blood and gore. This one was no exception. Except this time we have the opportunity to witness it in 3D. The 3D was pretty poor to be honest was way too gimmicky and just involved chunks of bone and flesh fly at you. One thing that really bothered me was just how overthetop the violence was. Particularly when Bobby is removing his teeth and blood is literally gushing out of his mouth like a waterfall. While most Saw films to this point have been overthetop this was just plain stupid.So to conclude I did not enjoy this film at all and felt very disappointed once the credits rolled. For the final film I expected it to be a huge surprise that would end the franchise on a high note. But it turned out to just be a lazily made film with a horrid ending. Hopefully this truly is the last Saw film because I will definitely not be going to see another after what they did to this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think you need to look at the Saw movies like this they are Friday the 13th movies with more innovation and creativity not to mention much more sick gore. Obviously if you didn't like any Friday the 13th Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street movie you should stop reading now because your mind has been made up. You will hate this movie.In fact to be perfectly fair even people who liked the earlier Saw movies will find plenty to carp about here. Saw 3D purports to be the end of the series oh sure but we did have several movies after Friday the 13th VII The Final Chapter and if it is it ends on a fairly conclusive note. Then again Jigsaw himself died early in the series and that didn't stop further movies from being made so take that for what it's worth.I can't review this without some plot points from previous Saw movies so if you haven't watched any of them and plan to stop reading. OK still with me? Let's recap.Mark Hoffman Costas Mandylor is the bad guy having served as Jigsaw's accomplice blackmailed into it really and he has a new game afoot. But complicating matters is Jigsaw's widow Jill Tuck Betsy Russell who knows of Hoffman's involvement. Jill brings Internal Affairs detective Gibson Chad Donella into the mix so Hoffman's dual goals of running the new game and getting to Jill Tuck drive the plot.The game involves a man named Bobby Sean Patrick Flanery who has profited mightily from having survived a Jigsaw trap he's written a bestselling book and runs a support group and makes the talkshow rounds as well. But is Bobby on the up and up? Duh. As with all of Jigsaw's games Bobby's games involve atoning for his own sins at the cost of some self sacrifice.The traps continue to be inventive although some  like the face trap  make welcome returns. I was reminded briefly of an old episode of the radio serial The Shadow called The House that Death Built in which various traps like a tripwire that triggered a doublebarreled shotgun were strewn about the house to keep people from finding treasure or something. Bobby must go through several of these much as victims had in earlier movies. And of course by doing so he loses his pound or so of flesh and secrets are revealed. Oh and Carey Elwes who played Dr. Gordon in the very first Saw movie makes a return here  not giving away anything there of course. He shows up to mock Bobby for having a support group in the first place something about profiting off misery.Even though it's pretty important to have watched at least some of the earlier films Saw 3D does its best to keep you in the loop reminding us of certain characters and plots of previous films. For example the support group includes bona fide survivors such as one who needed to cut off her own arm to save herself.But for me the best part comes at the very end when All Is Revealed. As the movie's denouement approaches and the bodies pile up you begin to wonder if Hoffman will emerge victorious  or if he's even the only bad guy out there. The ending answers both questions to some degree of satisfaction and helps to fill in missing information from the previous six movies as well. So on the one hand the movie ends the series in a satisfying manner and that's good.On the other hand the door is left ever so slightly open for more and more Saw films. It's not impossible to believe. In fact it's more plausible than the Friday the 13th endings because no matter how many times and in how many ways Jason was killed he somehow came back to slaughter more virgins in the next movie. At least the Saw movies follow some sort of logic.For me Saw 3D's 3D effects were well played indeed  if you don't mind intestines flying at you you'll appreciate them. Not so much if you don't. The plot is less convoluted and intricate than some of the most recent installments and the movie doesn't waste time on character development. Heck you hardly even see the nowlongdead Jigsaw. The movie flatout worked for me from a visual and visceral standpoint.".

I want to make this statement clear before I make the following rant about Saw 3D.What started off 7 years ago by Whannel and Wan has been ruined by the new writers. The world of Jigsaw has been diluted by the new writers to a very poor slasher film of utter nonsense.If the writer's ideas run thin they just make another victim an accomplice. Shame on you Melton and Dunton  lazy writing. No film after Saw 3 makes sense to the series although Saw 6 is watchable as a standalone film.Despite my average feelings for 4 and my detest of 5 there is such a wealth of characters and back story that could have been used to make the final Saw epic. Instead we have been introduced to more new characters and over elaborate traps. Really who is building these things and how much money and time do they have? More secret hide outs etc. One of the traps is a pop up machine gun! For Christ sake what were the writers thinking! The script is so bad that characters are even dreaming about traps. I am embarrassed for you Melton and Dunston.The original Saw was simplistic in it's brilliance but had the gore of a horror movie and the tension of a thriller. This is what made it great. Even Saw 2 which is not my favourite and Saw 3 possibly my favouritecontinued this tradition with clever but simple traps and involving stories that were character driven.Fans cared about what happened to the victims we cared for the anti hero Jigsaw and we sympathised with the accomplice Amanda  whilst being disgusted and questioning our own morals. Unfortunately since Saw 4 we no longer care about any of the new characters or the plot. We just have a body count as the writers think this is what horror film are about. Saw was more than this. And now given the chance to put some closure to the series you misused the chance to correct your earlier work and made it even worse by wasting the screen time of Tobin and Cary.I wish I stopped viewing at Saw 3 as the remainder of the series has cashed in on what would have been an excellent trilogy.".

	schema:headline " Saw 3D The Endgame with Mixed Feelings..";
	schema:reviewBody "Since the surprise hit Saw in 2004 there's been a sequel each year. I'm a huge fan of horror movies and I absolutely love the Saw Franchise. Each sequel was a worthy addition to the original story. I thought Part III and VI were the best sequels. Since the sixth one was amazing it's hard to beat that one with the final seventh installment. This time it is in 3D. Just to cash in on the 3D hype because let's face it it's pointless and adds nothing to the movie. You won't get bored with the story the pace is on an all time high with a maximum of traps and gory deaths. There are some thrilling and exciting traps but some have a very seen it all before feeling. Well it's already part 7 and quite frankly there's no need for another one after this. The story is not as surprising as the other ones the ending does not have the ultimate 'wooow' factor and the actions of some characters are not completely rational I'm not giving away the ending here.. Very limited screen time for Tobin Bell JigsawJohn Kramer and Saw 3D sees the long awaited return of Dr. Lawrence Gordon from the original Saw could have been better written. In a nutshell Saw 73D is an entertaining sequel that unfortunately can't cope with most of the Saw movies. It just isn't as strong when it comes to surprising twists and jawdropping moments. The story and the interesting characters gave the Saw movies the success and status not just gory deaths. And that is a little forgotten in this final installment. I love them all but there's no need for Part VIII.".

	onyx:emotionText "Since the surprise hit Saw in 2004 there's been a sequel each year. I'm a huge fan of horror movies and I absolutely love the Saw Franchise. Each sequel was a worthy addition to the original story. I thought Part III and VI were the best sequels. Since the sixth one was amazing it's hard to beat that one with the final seventh installment. This time it is in 3D. Just to cash in on the 3D hype because let's face it it's pointless and adds nothing to the movie. You won't get bored with the story the pace is on an all time high with a maximum of traps and gory deaths. There are some thrilling and exciting traps but some have a very seen it all before feeling. Well it's already part 7 and quite frankly there's no need for another one after this. The story is not as surprising as the other ones the ending does not have the ultimate 'wooow' factor and the actions of some characters are not completely rational I'm not giving away the ending here.. Very limited screen time for Tobin Bell JigsawJohn Kramer and Saw 3D sees the long awaited return of Dr. Lawrence Gordon from the original Saw could have been better written.

	schema:reviewBody "It was not a perfect movie by any means but Saw VI was the first Saw movie that really surprised me. Where the other films quickly became standard exercises in torture and brutality it was the first film in the series that really made an attempt at building and elaborating the overarching storyline that had been developed over the entire series. Instead of merely hinting at things we were getting full explanations things began to make sense and the movie on the whole was just a very satisfying and very enjoyable film. But much like its predecessors it ended on a bit of a cliffhanger moment  leading us directly into Saw VII or as it is more sadly referred to Saw 3D.After barely surviving a trap meant to murder him Hoffman Costas Mandylor is out for revenge on Jigsaw's Tobin Bell exwife Jill Betsy Russell. But Hoffman is not just out for her blood  he has setup a new game for Bobby Dagen Sean Patrick Flanery a survivor of a Jigsaw trap and selfhelp guru.If that does not sound like much it is because there is not much to Saw 3D. Outside of the long awaited and unfortunately spoiled return of Dr. Gordon Cary Elwes there is nothing really notable about the film. Jigsaw a character who must hold some sort of record for remaining the lead despite having died four movies ago merely appears in an extended cameo. Jill was always a supporting player but her screen time and presence has been drastically reduced even further. Hoffman's revenge ploy may drive the film but he too barely appears. So much was tied up answered and completed in Saw VI that this film feels merely like a film going through the motions to what should be the finale of the series.Instead of focusing on any of these characters for longer than a few seconds at the time the film pays attention mostly to Flanery's character and a new detective Gibson Chad Donella. Both are described and developed in the quickest and most superfluous of ways although there could have been a touch more explanation for the importance of Gibson to the storyline and then help fill in the gaps on the way to the film's conclusion. Neither character or actor is strong enough to carry the movie and having them help drag the film's running time out just made the film weaker at every interval. Worse yet the script and story give no reason for the audience to invest any sort of feeling towards either character. Each Saw film hinged on one or an assortment of characters going through some form of game set up by Jigsaw or Hoffman but there was a grand purpose in the end for why they go through that struggle. Here the actions of these two characters seem inconsequential. You may hold out hope that there is some reason for their inclusion and participation in the grand finale but in the end there is nothing.The deaths are a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand the film seems to have wisely amped up the victims working together motif for almost every trap scene in the film. It makes for a couple of interesting moments but inevitably still ends with the requisite brutally gory deaths. And a few of the traps are interesting as well  particularly one involving a love triangle saws and a public display. And for fans of the series one notable death involving a rather specific device will undoubtedly give cheers laughter and nausea all at once. But outside of these notable tidbits the creativity originality and even the morbid fun that come from these traps and deaths seems to have been sucked out of the film. Much like the storyline it all felt like filler padded out to fill gaps. It was a disappointment to say the least after the goforbroke style of Saw VI and only shows that the filmmakers are really starting to show how exhausted their imaginations are in this once gloriously and creative realm. The much hyped 3D does almost nothing for these traps and death scenes either. It is an amusing addition at first but after getting a character's innards thrown at you for the third time it starts to get a bit old and silly.But for everything else that is done so wrong and so haphazard the filmmakers manage to concoct an incredibly satisfying and wild shock of an ending. On one hand it is without any doubt the standout sequence of Saw 3D. Remember the awesome twists this franchise was originally known for? This one takes the cake and brings the film more in line with the original films than the later ones. The sheer surprise and audacity of it all is just too good and feels like it belongs in a significantly better film. It practically cheats the audience into sitting through such a horribly disappointing film just so they can get to this one moment of sheer greatness. On the other hand it stands as an awesome conclusion and finale to the entire franchise. If the ads are correct and this is indeed the final chapter of Saw then this may just be one of the most enjoyable and entertaining endings ever created. It just may force you to rethink everything that has come before it.I hate to say it but Saw 3D is the worst and most disappointing film in the franchise. It will leave a rotten taste in your mouth and just feels rushed disjointed and convoluted. Saw VI showed a renewed creative vigor that just failed to connect with this film. The ending is the film's only real redeeming moment and nearly makes up for everything that precedes it. Let's just collectively hope a reboot does not ruin its greatness.510.This review also appeared on httpwww.geekspeakmagazine.com.".

	schema:headline " Weak consolidation of a doomed franchise.";
	schema:reviewBody "I imagine after viewing the final instalment SAW fans everywhere were writhing in disappointment and anger with the poor final showdown. I was no different. In my opinion the franchise should have finished at SAW III. The empathy I had for Amanda's character meant that when she died I felt that the franchise was missing a poignant female character. What with being a hugely male dominated franchise without her it didn't seem to fit or be as frightening never mind believable.The last film exposed Detective Mark Hoffman as Jigsaw's second and believed final accomplice. Hoffman's eerie performance is adequately maintained but he offers nothing new to the role and in all honesty you are bored of him. Unlike Amanda or Jigsaw he possesses no depth and instead is just perceived by all parties as a mindless killer. Though Amanda emulated a little bit of that she maintained a disorientated and unhinged presence of which Hoffman is unable to recreate. As with any other SAW film we have some 'sinners' that are followed. The last instalment follows Bobby Dagen's journey to rebirth and rehabilitation in society as a 'better person'. Using the Jigsaw media meltdown as his foundation Bobby lies about having survived a Jigsaw trap in order to make money. Before this he hadn't achieved anything. This is hardly worthy of a Jigsaw trap but Dagen manages to convince the public through a false book and fabricated workshops that he did experience this.He works his way through a series of traps quite aptly set in an abandoned asylum. They predominantly focus upon the 'hear speak see' no evil transition where he is placed in a position of power against those who have adhered to his perverse lie. For example the first trap he is subjected to with another person is pulling a fish hook which is attached to the inside of his publicist's stomach. However she is also hooked up to a decibel monitor and if she screams to a certain volume a series of metal tubes will near closer and closer to her neck. If she screams for a predominant length of time these tubes will enter her neck at a frantic speed killing her from blood loss and flooding her mouth. The notion is if she is able to refrain from doing what has poisoned her speaking she will be able to survive.Unlike some of the other traps these are apathetic. Almost impossible. Noticeably less and less like Jigsaw. Granted we are expecting differences but the traps become increasingly boring.Another thing worth noting about this instalment is that for cinematic release it was in 3D therefore the blood in a 2D version has a fading red almost pink colour. If you watch the movie in 3D this is less prevalent but watching the 2D version? You'll find the gore laughable. Similarly some of the more graphic aspects of gore are poorly done and evidently rushed. Organs and skin look flawed plastic and fake. It is very difficult to immerse yourself in what SAW represents when it no longer does.We do identify very well with Gibson the detective that appears within this film. He is a very laid back and occasionally humorous character who perhaps gives Hoffman a run for his money. He's worth paying attention to one of my favourite detectives to appear thus far and he dies a more dignified planned death I suppose are the appropriate words for it.I will refrain from giving away the biggest twist but it becomes obvious from 13 minutes into the film what that twist is going to be which is unfortunate. The 'epic music' SAW is famed for is a let down. There is less and less excitement tension and suspense and it is very obvious why SAW put off creating the eighth instalment after the most poor of receptions to this.However there are a few PROs. In typical SAW style there's a lot of narrative to chew your way through and some interesting plot twists and character developments. We begin to appreciate just how skilled Jigsaw is and resent Hoffman's foolishness and misunderstanding of some of Jigsaw's basic concepts of importance.The franchise makes a decent full circle but expect to be dumbfounded by plot holes and a thirst for gore you simply won't be able to access.This is one of the weaker films perhaps in line with SAW VI but even in VI you had decent effects and aspects to consider through and through. This film is just as it appears unfortunately.For avid horror fans I recommend sticking to the first three if you want a decent run through. The cliffhangers were fitting and the ideas were thorough it just worked. Some franchises are bled dry and this is unfortunately one of them.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the midst of all the 3D action Saw producers thought this would be the best opportunity to cash in for the franchise. However movie goers will all be disappointed especially if you've seen the trailers with this stateoftheart 3D film.Saw VII revolves around Bobby Dagan an apparent Jigsaw survivor. But after about twenty minutes of pointless story Bobby is put into a real trap and we as an audience find out he's nothing but a liar.Meanwhile Dr. Gordon Cary Elwes returns and surprisesurprise is also an accomplice to Jigsaw. He's responsible for all the happenings since he survived his trap in the original film. What's wrong with this picture? A doctor devoted to saving lives has decided to become a serial killer? So what Saw does is take a cop and a doctor and turn them both evil. How imaginative! What sucks about this most of all is this has been discussed for the last six years from the IMDb message boards and the House of Jigsaw forums. What the writers have done was just use these idiotic ideas.Besides the pointless 3D elements Saw fails on all accounts because it destroys several characters the overall timeline of Saw and important plot elements about the Saw universe. It's annoying to have heard people say the guy who did surgery on Michael in Saw II was Dr. Gordon then have to see that the writers put that in the final film.I was an avid fan of Saw up until the announcement of Dr. Gordon returning. It sounded so inane to say that he's been working behind the scenes the whole time. He's a doctor. He was screwed over had to cut off his foot and lost his entire family in one night. But he forgives Jigsaw and wants to help him kill other people. Makes sense? How stupid! If he was helping why didn't he show up in any previous flashbacks? Where was he the last two years SawSaw VII is at least a 2 year time difference?? I thought Saw VII was a good final chapter up until Hoffman was halted by an unknown person in a pig mask who was revealed to be Dr. Gordon and then the usual Saw flashback brought all the issues unanswered to light. I couldn't be more appalled by this film.Don't forget this is quite possible the worst acted Saw film of all time. Minimal Tobin Bell screen time without counting his Jigsaw voice on the tapes and lesserknown actors trying to be established as prominent actors. Without substance in the story or any of the new characters this Saw has no real plot line to follow or development to undergo.It will be dubbed one of the worst horror films of all time for me. I'm very displeased with the producers writers and actors. Basically everyone involved in this franchise is no longer someone I like anymore. This includes the fans who thought up the Gordon theories and actually managed to have the writersproducers think they were good ideas. Not recommended.".

It's annoying to have heard people say the guy who did surgery on Michael in Saw II was Dr. Gordon then have to see that the writers put that in the final film.I was an avid fan of Saw up until the announcement of Dr. Gordon returning. It sounded so inane to say that he's been working behind the scenes the whole time. He's a doctor. He was screwed over had to cut off his foot and lost his entire family in one night. But he forgives Jigsaw and wants to help him kill other people. Makes sense? How stupid! If he was helping why didn't he show up in any previous flashbacks? Where was he the last two years SawSaw VII is at least a 2 year time difference?? I thought Saw VII was a good final chapter up until Hoffman was halted by an unknown person in a pig mask who was revealed to be Dr. Gordon and then the usual Saw flashback brought all the issues unanswered to light. I couldn't be more appalled by this film.Don't forget this is quite possible the worst acted Saw film of all time. Minimal Tobin Bell screen time without counting his Jigsaw voice on the tapes and lesserknown actors trying to be established as prominent actors. Without substance in the story or any of the new characters this Saw has no real plot line to follow or development to undergo.It will be dubbed one of the worst horror films of all time for me. I'm very displeased with the producers writers and actors. Basically everyone involved in this franchise is no longer someone I like anymore. This includes the fans who thought up the Gordon theories and actually managed to have the writersproducers think they were good ideas. Not recommended.";

	schema:headline " A top notch ending to the franchise warning contains spoilers!";
	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday me and my friends decided to have a Saw marathon we watched saw 1 up to 6 then went to see the new and apparently last instalment aw 3D at the cinema. I went with incredibly high expectations and in some ways was not disappointed however there were a few things i was not overly keen on. spoilers be warned The negatives  1. I expected the final game in the saw franchise to focus on someone rather more related to the saw franchise itself. Bobby's character not being known of or mentioned in any previous films ruined it a bit for me plus the fact i saw him as a completely unlikable character didn't help. In the previous games there was usually a character that i wanted to prevail and survive Gorden from Saw Jeff from Saw 3 for example but this guy didn't do it for me. 2. I so wanted Hoffman to survive he is my favourite character and although he isn't shown pyhsically dying in the film the end clearly shows he has no way of escape. 3.3D! In many cases 3D films can be incredible just look at avatar for example however i feel that this was only 3D for the sake of making it 3d it added nothing to the story and ultimately would have been just as good in 2D. This may just be me but i also thought that the 3D element of the film made it almost too shiny and polished. Saw in 3D just felt too gimmicky when the main focus should have been the fact that it was the last film in the series! The Positives  1. The traps were pretty fantastic. They were far more imaginative than i expected. I thought Chester Bennington's car trap scene was brutal whilst being clear it was cleverly thought out. I wont go into every trap in detail as it would take too long but there are certainly some imaginative ones in there. 2. Despite Hoffman's demise at the end he played the bad ass antagonist perfectly. The fact that he chose the old school reverse bear trap on Jill was perfect and throughout the film he remained ruthless. Even at the end when he was chained up he went straight for the saw in my eyes again proving he would do anything to survive. 3. The acting i've heard from a few people that the acting was below par i on the other hand did not find this to be the case. I thought every character played their role well. 4. The ending despite predictable to some was straight up epic. Lawrence Gorden's story was revealed and him ending it with the famous line Game over! gave me chills. Overall  In my opinion not one of the Saw films has surpassed the original due to its pure originality and legitimately shocking twist. Saw 3D didn't have an incredible story it had a slightly predictable twist but the bottom line is it wrapped the franchise up answering most questions and was a fun film along the way. If you have seen the others and enjoyed them then you can't afford to miss this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everything has been leading to this. Or so you'd think. Let's be frank if we've learn anything from our series of articles revisiting the Saw series over the last week it's that the franchise is so wrapped up in retcons flashbacks and timebending shenanigans that you couldn't really be surprised if this one had turned out to take place in 2003 before even that very first film back in 2004.At the very least I assure you that we're not looking at a prequel. This is very much a straight continuation from the end of Saw VI and some time during the last year we find Jigsaw's ex Jill Tuck has lost a considerable amount of bad ass points from having vengefully trapped Jigsaw's bungling successor Hoffman in a reverse bear trap. A year ago for us moments ago for her and yet after witnessing Hoffman's escape she rushes to the police for protection.Hoffman begins a reign of terror taking games into broad daylight and into the heart of the already decimated police force and he promises his old colleague Detective Gibson that the traps will continue until Jill is handed over to him. Ancillary to all of this we meet self help entrepreneur Bobby Dagen whose bestselling book about surviving one of Jigsaw's traps gets him caught up in another game. The final game perhaps.A stalwart companion who endured the Saw marathon along with me came to see Saw 3D last night. Afterwards he declared it the worst of the series hands down. For him this was the most disappointing and dissatisfying ending imaginable after all of the six films and all of the marketing hype around this being the series' conclusion.There's certainly a group of hardcore fans who haunt places like the IMDb forums and who will declare Saw VII to be the very best of the series and a fitting conclusion. However I personally find it difficult to imagine this being anybody's favorite Saw film.It suffers from the same symptoms of the franchise fatigue that plagued the fourth and fifth installments. The story structure and the progression of the main game are disjointed and disaffecting and aside from the opening sequence the much anticipated public trap seen in the trailers there's the same old lack of imagination.Most criminally there's barely any John Kramer to be had. The series has only survived to this its seventh installment because death was not the end for Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. He's the very best thing about this series and we had a partial return to form with Saw VI because the focus was back on his machinations from beyond the grave.Here it's pretty much Hoffman's show and with how much Costas Mandylor has previously paled in comparison with Bell that's really bloody boring. More than that it's a ripoff. Mandylor is reduced to a perpetual grimace as he chases poor Betsy Russell around. She deserved better than this too. Having bided her time as Jill for so many films she's reduced to the stock scream queen role here running away and hiding behind cabinets.Hell most of the performances are wooden. What would a Saw film be without a little dramatic sawdust billowing around our Bmovie players? In my revisit to Saw V I gave Greg Bryk the dubious Honor of being The Worst Actor In Saw and for his trouble he makes a small cameo appearance here in a support group for other survivors of Jigsaw. However he now gets the bronze as two other newcomers make late but impressively awful turns.Firstly there's Dean Armstrong as Cale. Not to give away what goes on with his character but he gets a silver medal for some acting that had people in the screening I attended laughing out loud. The new worst actor In Saw however is Chad Donella as Gibson. Golly he's bad. Not since Tommy Wiseau's cult classic The Room have you seen overacting this stilted or this far removed from human behavior.On the plus side I really have to praise Cary Elwes. It's been telegraphed by the filmmakers to all and sundry that he's back in this one finally reprising the role of Dr. Lawrence Gordon to bookend the franchise. He serves almost as the Mount Doom of the series. With him Saw was made and only with him can it be unmade. And frankly he's great in it despite sounding decidedly closer to his native British accent than the last time he was Dr. Gordon.As to my friend's reaction I can't really disagree except to say that's it's nowhere near the worst of the series. I'd say it's the third worst overall or to mark it positively the fifth best. It is a disappointment though and a step backwards from the improvements we saw in Saw VI. The writers are just up to their old rubbish tricks and director Kevin Greutert is on record saying he would rather have been directing Paranormal Activity 2 than another Saw sequel.With fledgling horror franchises ready to take its place in the form of Paranormal Activity or even Piranha it goes without saying that Saw 3D should be the last gasp of a franchise that's been running on fumes for a while now. It suffers from the same problems as the worst of the sequels but enough has been learn that it's more watchable than those earlier films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw 3D is the last7th installment of the popular horror series. I'm going to get right into it and be forewarned there WILL BE SPOILERS!!!The plot The plot evolves around a few stories an Internal Affairs agent named Gibson looking to arrest Mark Hoffman Jill Tuck looking for protection from Hoffman an author named Bobby Deagan of a book called survive in which he details his survival of a jigsaw trap SPOILER he was never put in a trap...until this film so don't rack your brain trying to figure out if he was in the last 6 films he wasn't Now the plot was pretty decent it wrapped up the series plus there are huge twists only problem we have theorized on these twists years ago and in most cases we were right. One of the big surprises for me was seeing the DEMISE of Jill Tuck I was legitimately surprised she was killed but with saw no character is safe not even the main ones. Everyone knows that Dr. Gordon has returned for this film I won't say much on him but I will say his screen time is limited but the times he's on screen are great. Overall the plot held everything together there were minor plot holes but hey what do you expect after 7 films. Acting The acting was soso. Tobin Bell was great as always Hoffman was at his best and most menacing Jill played her role nicely Gibson was kind of lame to me. I don't know the actors name but he comes off as more of a comedic actor than serious one at times and at times he kind of stood out for the wrong reasons.Overall I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 for... Hoffman being more menacing and badass than ever The return of Dr. Gordon even if it felt a little Yeah...we figured that The ending for me anyways was very well done. If you haven't seen the first one don't go see this one till you have. Obviously made for the fans if you haven't seen any of the films watch them ALL first the saw series was made to be a huge jigsaw puzzle with each film being a piece to that puzzle. The negatives or why I didn't give it a 10...Gibsons acting and acting of those who were new to the film excluding Linkin Park front man Chester Bennington he surprised me. His part was short but sweet. fell short for me. Gibson felt more like a prick than a real protagonists.The trap Hoffman left for Gibson was without a doubt the LAMEST trap in saw history almost chuckled at this trap I shouldn't chuckle during a horror movie when a trap in a saw movie is sprungMovie was shorter than I expected about an 1hr and 30min. was hoping it be longer since it was wrapping up the series but it is what it is.The obviously tacked on story of Bobby Deagan this man fails all of his traps all of them his story was strictly for traps and gore alone came off pretty shallow but hey it's horror right?".

Overall the plot held everything together there were minor plot holes but hey what do you expect after 7 films. Acting The acting was soso. Tobin Bell was great as always Hoffman was at his best and most menacing Jill played her role nicely Gibson was kind of lame to me. I don't know the actors name but he comes off as more of a comedic actor than serious one at times and at times he kind of stood out for the wrong reasons.Overall I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 for... Hoffman being more menacing and badass than ever The return of Dr. Gordon even if it felt a little Yeah...we figured that The ending for me anyways was very well done. If you haven't seen the first one don't go see this one till you have. Obviously made for the fans if you haven't seen any of the films watch them ALL first the saw series was made to be a huge jigsaw puzzle with each film being a piece to that puzzle. The negatives or why I didn't give it a 10...Gibsons acting and acting of those who were new to the film excluding Linkin Park front man Chester Bennington he surprised me. His part was short but sweet. fell short for me. Gibson felt more like a prick than a real protagonists.The trap Hoffman left for Gibson was without a doubt the LAMEST trap in saw history almost chuckled at this trap I shouldn't chuckle during a horror movie when a trap in a saw movie is sprungMovie was shorter than I expected about an 1hr and 30min. was hoping it be longer since it was wrapping up the series but it is what it is.The obviously tacked on story of Bobby Deagan this man fails all of his traps all of them his story was strictly for traps and gore alone came off pretty shallow but hey it's horror right?";

	schema:headline " Although most of the sequels have been subpar Saw 3D ends the genredefining series on a high";
	schema:reviewBody "There is no denying the impact the Saw series has had on not only the horror genre but movies in general. Starting off as a little lowbudget psychological thriller centred around two guys in a basement this series has smashed box office records and created a new horror villain in Jigsaw. Since 2004 audiences have flocked to watch new victims meet their demise in an inventive and cruel way while relishing the inane plot twists and convoluted story whilst others have condemned the series as torture porn and nothing but sick people coming up with sick traps for sick audiences.This latest entry stays true to its predecessors and delivers overthetop ultraviolent death scenes accompanied by a plot full of flash backs surprise revelations and an overuse of the main theme. To explain the plot of Saw 3D is silly as the whole point of a Saw film is to go in having no idea about any of the trips or twists and to enjoy them as they come at you from every which way. I will say however that the film does end well and the story is wrapped up fairly nicely with no obvious need for a sequel as this is hopefully the final film.Overall the film is very much the same as Saw VI 2009 which was also directed by Kevin Greutert. Like many of the sequels this has multiple stories going at once but it doesn't quite gel. It all feels very choppy and after awhile the sheer amount of changing scenes can get quite annoying as it takes away from the suspense which is often built up quite well. The editing lighting camerawork and music is all the same as the other entries by now it is stock standard Saw settings. Jigsaw's traps are back and they are as nasty as ever if there is one thing this movie delivers on is fantastic gore. A word of caution although you may be expecting this now the 3D is a total waste of money and there are one or two cool effects utilised in the whole 90 minute movie. Do NOT expect something cool just because it was filmed in 3D cos it ain't any better than the postconversion films.On a final note I have never been a huge fan of the Saw series but looking back it has been an interesting ride. The first film although flawed had a great new concept and a shocking twist. Unfortunately the sequels took away from the first creating a story based around traps and trying to fit as many twists in as possible. These last two entries by Greutert have been two of the strongest as well as Saw III but there are still glaring issues that prevent it from being a great movie. Saw fans will not be disappointed anyone else should probably stay away unless you like buckets of blood and don't care about understanding the story! 35".

	schema:headline " The Worst....Not a Saw Movie....";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know where to start. I have been a fan of the saw movies from the start. The first one was mind blowing. It was so entertaining due to the fact that it was a psychological thriller that kept you on your feet. They didn't push it with the gore and it was a thoughtful intense thriller with an interesting idea. When Saw II came I knew it wasn't going to be as good and it wasn't. It was more focused on blood and gore and less focused on quality. Saw III was fine. It was pretty bloody but the great story line leveled that out. The movies obviously deteriorated as the series continued and the producers cared more about money than quality. Saw IV V and VI did their jobs but weren't as good as the first few. But Saw 3D. All I can say is wow. The story revolves around a selfhelp author who is thrust into a deadly game and Hoffman's deadly chase to get to Jill Tuck. I couldn't feel more let down. First off way too much was going on in this movie. It was entertaining but not how a saw movie should entertain you. Second it didn't feel like a saw movie. I felt like I was watching a crazy goose chase. Third the acting. It was god awful. It was almost laughable. When Bobby tells one of his victims Why couldn't you just shut the F up? I just shook my head. Honestly who would say that after watching someone you knew just get brutally murdered? Also Gibson says crazier than a sack of cats. Who seriously talks like that? I think the writers settle on the first thing that pops into their mind. Another thing that made me mad was Bobby. How could he not save anyone? Please. Yet another thing was the traps. I feel like they ran out of ideas way too fast. They used the same metal spike in too traps! I was really angry to see Joyce die. She didn't do anything wrong at all! The thing that made me the most angry was the unanswered questions. 1 Why would Dr. Gordon help Jigsaw after he kidnapped his wife and child and made Dr. Gordon cut his own foot off? Dr. Gordon seemed like the kind of guy who wanted Jigsaw dead after the events of the first film. Come on! 2What happened to Dr. Gordon's family? And how did he escape and return to public without telling the police where he was. What did he tell everyone? 3How did Bobby fake being in a Jigsaw trap. How could he just make that up? Wouldn't the police investigate the crime and ask Bobby where he was? There's no way he could of pulled that off in real life. Cops would just believe him and not have to see the trap site? Come on! 4Jigsaw congratulated Dr. Gordon and said You survived. Yes Dr. Gordon did survive but he did not pass his test. He was supposed to kill Adam before 6. Clearly he failed to do so and was too late. 5Who were the other two pigmasked people with Dr. Gordon. More Jigsaw apprentices? Please! The end of the movie truly had nothing to do with the movie itself. Dr. Gordon really had nothing to do with the movie at all. He was there for less than 5 minutes. Him helping Jigsaw did not have to do with the movie. It didn't feel like Dr. Gordon. It was like he was a different person. Also the flash back scene with Jigsaw seemed silly. Jigsaw with a backwards baseball cap??? In general you can think that these movies all 'fit' together but truly everything is a big mess. The filmmakers try to make things fit together but so many things do not make sense. Its obviously clear that they make things up as they go. Too bad they can't at least make up something good. They say this series is over but who knows. The series is dead and at this point no matter how many more movies they make disappointment is a guarantee. RIP Saw series. You are dead but not buried. Tons of questions will be left unanswered. Its too bad it had to end like this but that's how it is. If you are a Saw fan you might as well see it but be warned this film is a huge let down!".

Jill put Hoffman in a trap but he escaped from it.GOOD TWISTGOOD PLOT AND IT WAS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT FROM SAW 5NOW HERE COMES SAW 3D in saw 3d huge side of the plot was talking about Bobby he is a new character to the franchise he has the main game in this movie but we c bobby with jigsaw in a flashback only in ONE SCENE. WT!.. in saw 6 William was a new character he has the main game huge part of the plot was talking about him and we c him with jigsaw in A lot of flashbacks scenes. but unfortunately that didn't happen for bobby and jigsaw in SAW 3D. on the other side of the film we have Hoffmansuperman VS EVERYONE!! how could one person do what Hoffman did in saw 3d all by himself!!!the actor that played Gibson was really bad we laughed on his acting at some moments. his role was unnecessary. the writers just needed new detective and police officer so they just brought this guyGibson and gave him few lines and also put him in a pointless flashback with Hoffman.Dr Gordon returns for saw 3d!! WOW i cant believe. well now i hope that he didn't return. bringing him back ruined the series. they showed us how Gordon used the hot pipe to stop the bleeding then jigsaw came and told him u r my personal favorite and he became jigsaw's accomplice WOOOWW HUGE SURPRISE!! we don't want to c how Gordon have stopped the bleeding WE WANT TO C HOW GORDON LIVED HIS NORMAL LIFE AND HOW HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLICE. the writers couldn't find any way to explain this to the audience and couldn't find any way to fit this with the plot so they decided to just show us what happened to him after he crawled in the hallway and then he become the accomplice.3D is pointless and cheap.Everything in the movie looked so FAKE and BAD the dead bodies the blood and the acting in some moments.the writers have used fans theories to end this series Dr Gordon is being an accomplice is one of them this series depends on twists so what is the point of using fans theories for the twists???? where is the twist in this film???they focused on goriness rather than focusing on twists no twists in this movie.the movie was rush. 11 traps in one movie with bad plot.the movie didn't add anything for the series and it didn't answer all of the questions.".

WOW i cant believe. well now i hope that he didn't return. bringing him back ruined the series. they showed us how Gordon used the hot pipe to stop the bleeding then jigsaw came and told him u r my personal favorite and he became jigsaw's accomplice WOOOWW HUGE SURPRISE!! we don't want to c how Gordon have stopped the bleeding WE WANT TO C HOW GORDON LIVED HIS NORMAL LIFE AND HOW HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLICE. the writers couldn't find any way to explain this to the audience and couldn't find any way to fit this with the plot so they decided to just show us what happened to him after he crawled in the hallway and then he become the accomplice.3D is pointless and cheap.Everything in the movie looked so FAKE and BAD the dead bodies the blood and the acting in some moments.the writers have used fans theories to end this series Dr Gordon is being an accomplice is one of them this series depends on twists so what is the point of using fans theories for the twists???? where is the twist in this film???they focused on goriness rather than focusing on twists no twists in this movie.the movie was rush. 11 traps in one movie with bad plot.the movie didn't add anything for the series and it didn't answer all of the questions.";

I thought that the young piano player stole the show. He was perfectly cast. However the real life piano player who played the character was also excellent in his role. It was so nice to have a complex plot without being in the middle of a story with family members screaming at each other.

	schema:reviewBody "VITUS is a film from Switzerland that has garnered many accolades and nearly won an Oscar. And yes it is that good! Written by Fredi M. Murer Peter Luisi and Lukas B. Suter and directed by Murer VITUS explores the life of a child genius a lad who from the age of five is obviously gifted in that he can play Bach et al after only a few months lessons and is able to read books and understand concepts that make his stance in a regular kindergarten class untenable. But the film is less about the gifts of a child prodigy than it is a story of how a genius child longs for a normal childhood. It is in the telling of the story that the audience is privileged to discover the joys and trials in a child's view of being extraordinary.Vitus  played at age 6 by Fabrizio Borsani and at age 12 by Teo Gheorghiu  is referred to as a little Mozart by his parents Helen Julika Jenkins and Leo Urs Jucker and by the family friends who are amazed at Vitus' gift as a pianist. But as is often the case with gifted children they are overprotected not allowed to engage in the normal activities of being a kid. Vitus finds consolation in his grandfather a brilliant Bruno Ganz whose creative energy includes Vitus in his longing to fly and to build complex machines. While Vitus continues his love for the piano he also takes risks with his beloved grandfather. Vitus' intelligence serves him well in analyzing the complexities of his father's job and his grandfather's role in that position and it is his genius that leads the family in a direction no one thought possible. And of course with every story of an extraordinary young lad adapting to a puzzling world there is also a love interest Isabel at age 12 Kristina Lykowa is his funloving babysitter and at age 19 Tamara Scarpellini is the queen of his inexperienced heart and fill a void in Vitus' life that otherwise would be empty. Fitting all of these subplots together is made magical by Vitus' constant playing of classical music  a feat the young actor is capable of performing on his own! The cast of this film is not only gifted but is also endearing. Bruno Ganz is a brilliant actor and he is matched by both of the young actors who play Vitus. The story is tender but avoids bathos. It simply is an uplifting inspiring entertaining film. A Must See! Grady Harp".

Suter and directed by Murer VITUS explores the life of a child genius a lad who from the age of five is obviously gifted in that he can play Bach et al after only a few months lessons and is able to read books and understand concepts that make his stance in a regular kindergarten class untenable.

The movie is one of the best I have seen in literally decades. And then there is the piano performance of a real musical savant. So this is the story  but the ability of the script and the director to move me into childhood to remember what some of the issues of autonomy are to see a family who loves and cares for their child but also faces issues of financial pressures and job loss. This is a movie we can all relate to on many levels. What a great show!! I hope it becomes available on DVD  I'll buy about 10 to give away. Dr. Margaret".

That seems to be the case with Leo and Helen Von Holzen the parents of the gifted Vitus. The boy shows at an early stage his aptitude for the piano. In making Vitus study and prepare for a career in music the elder Von Holzens sacrifice his normal life as they make the young child into studying constantly in order to fulfill their own expectations for the child.One place Vitus feels at home is with his paternal grandfather a crusty old man with a meager income but with a lot of love to offer the boy. Vitus own reward is the interest he takes in his teenaged baby sitter but when the parents see in horror the surveying tape they have installed at home they are horrified for watching their son being just a kid having fun.When we meet Vitus later on he decides to rebel by jumping off the balcony of his parents' apartment and survives miraculously. He begins by assuming a new personality that is just the opposite of his old self. Thus he enrolls in a regular school where he is bored stiff but at least he is surrounded by regular kids.Vitus father's company is not doing well and Leo has a chance of losing his job. Vitus who of course is just as talented and intelligent as before devices a plan to rescue his grandfather from almost poverty as well as his own father.Fredi Murer the director of the film achieves a sure hit with this film that will charm audiences that look for a good and entertaining time in watching an uplifting film. Mr. Murer was lucky in securing the help of Fabrizio Borzani and Teo Gheorgiu two young piano prodigies that are impressive as they play real music in the film.The best thing though is Bruno Ganz the great German actor who is on hand to impress us with his own take on the grandfather. Mr. Ganz does an incredible job as the rumpled older man who is totally amazed by the innate intelligence of his grandson. Urs Jucker and Julika Jenkins appear as the ambitious parents who finally come to terms with their amazing son.Vitus is recommended for audiences of all ages. The background music is glorious especially the last sequence where Vitus plays a concert in front of a live audience with a full orchestra.".

	schema:reviewBody "These two current movies both have boy protagonists Joshua is eleven and a half and Vitus is ultimately twelve who happen to be both intellectually brilliant and piano prodigies. 'Joshua' a psychological thriller with horror overtones is scary and depressing. 'Vitus' is an upbeat fairy tale children could watch if they can read subtitles dialogue is mostly in Swiss German and Hoch Deutsch with a little English. Neither of these films is quite an unmitigated success but both have interesting things to say about the plight of being supersmart and prematurely accomplished. Maybe Joshua just wants to be loved Vitus says he just wants to be a normal boy but fortunately there's more to it than that in both cases. Together these are two poles of attitudes toward such young people.Joshua's posh Upper West Side haute bourgeoisie or beryuppie life takes a dive when a new baby enters the scene. His collegeboyjovial hedgefundtrader dad Brad Sam Rockwell is videoing the infant and when Joshua Jacob Kogan plays one of his virtuoso pieces they just ask him to quiet down. Also present in that first scene are his bornagain grandma Celia Weston and his gay musical showbiz uncle Dallas Roberts. The uncle is the kindred spirit in the room.It's funny both Joshua and Vitus wear little suits and have tidy mops of hair and seem a bit undersize for their ages. But Joshua is a bad seed who spins out an aura of evil and fear off the screen as time goes on while Vitus is geeky and a prig for a while anyway and has a lust for his baby sitter that's at best nutty but he's otherwise ultimately sweet. Joshua brings down his family and Vitus saves his. Vitus becomes a successful entrepreneur and learns to dress casually.Joshua is like an incubus. He just stands there sometimes scaring Brad or his mom Abby Vera Farmiga by popping up behind them. His face and voice are without affect. Even when he says Mommy? Daddy? I love you it's creepy.Vitus is distant too initially anyway. He doesn't fit in at school and insults his teachers. But as a small child he has a downtoearth babysitter Isabel played by Kristina Lykawa later by Tamara Scarpellini and they enjoy hanging out together. She gets fired and replaced by his English mother Julike Jenkins who has blossomed into a controlling stage mom. But where Joshua only occasionally sees his simpatico uncle Vitus gets to spend a lot of time with his wonderfully relaxed and entertaining granddad Bruno Ganz anything but a Hitler this time  who makes things and goes on walks with the boy and talks about his dreams of being a pilot way back when.Bad things start happening in Joshua's household from day one the film takes us rather harrowingly through 70plus. The baby is fine for less than a week when she begins to cry constantly which brings Abby back to the shaky state she was in during Joshua's early stagesand then some. Perhaps if they'd found an older nanny for the kids or just the baby and paid more attention to Josh the household would not have come apart. Joshua has some very suspenseful moments. You may think the boy will go for the baby but that's a red herring. His methods are more devious than that and involve night vision filmmaking Egyptian methods of mummification and a performance of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star that is redesigned as if composed by Bartok. Like the two boys who play Vitus Fabrizio Borsani and Teo Gheogiou the boy who plays Joshua Jacob Korgan is a genuine piano prodigy.'Joshua' has a good ironic sense of its eastern urban white milieu and though it may fizzle away a bit at the end it does make you genuinely uncomfortable. This independent first film by Ratliff uses the conventional sound effects and disintegrating set devices of the horror film in fresh ways. But making Joshua into a monster limits where things can go. Rockwell Farmiga and Westson are good insofar as they avoid drifting into caricature. Ratliff previously made a documentary about fundamentalist Christians and the grandma's attempt to save Joshua becomes a realistically creepy element. She gets her reward. This is an indictment of insensitive parents but its picture of a wunderkind demonizes the type.'Vitus' is a softer world but this boy is suffering too. In a way his burly dad Leo Urs Jucker who creates hearing aids and becomes CEO of a company is another version of the squashplaying yuppie represented by Sam Rockwell but he seems more present. The problem is Vitus doesn't fit in in school and then his mom takes him from his childhood piano teacher who he says he loves to a famous lady who declares a rational mind and a warm heart those are what make a great pianist. That's why I want to be a vet Vitus answers refusing to play for her or become her student. Eventually he contrives to stage an accident after which he seems to have lost his special talent and his high IQ. He precedes to carry out some exploits with his granddad that lead to the film's conclusion. This could be rather fun for a young viewer though some American critics have found this charming story simplistic or sappy. It does perhaps leave you a little flat because its feelgood finale is too fanciful. 'Joshua' is a film that's riveting and disturbing its narrow horror focus makes for a concentrated effect. But it's much more fun to watch ''Vitus which brings up the same issuesabout how it's tough to be exceptionalwithout demonizing brilliance. Teo Gheorghiu may be a little but nerdy but he has a sensitive face and delivers his lines in ways that are sprightly and nuanced.".

I can't believe I am actually online looking for how to buy this movie. I have NEVER been bothered before to even look at the cast in a movie not to talk of looking a movie up online. With zero violence or nudity I find the simple manner of presentation of the plot highly intellectual. I hope to get it on DVD and perhaps distribute. It has definitely changed my perception of European movies. My son is musically talented and this movie has positively impacted on my thinking about raising him.".

I can't believe I am actually online looking for how to buy this movie. I have NEVER been bothered before to even look at the cast in a movie not to talk of looking a movie up online. With zero violence or nudity I find the simple manner of presentation of the plot highly intellectual. I hope to get it on DVD and perhaps distribute. It has definitely changed my perception of European movies. My son is musically talented and this movie has positively impacted on my thinking about raising him.";

	schema:reviewBody "Vitus is a 2006 Swiss film and almost 10 years ago that runs for almost 2 hours and won Best Film at the Swiss Film awards that year. It came pretty close to an Academy Award nomination in the foreign language category. It was Switzerland's submission and made the January shortlist. Basically it is about a child prodigy who has a gigantic IOQ keeps provoking his teachers is an incredibly talented stock market broker and most of all a pianist. This film deals competently with the issues of being just a child who wants a life like all children in the face of his great prospects. The actors were all very solid in here some even really good such as Bruno Ganz who you may know from Downfall. Here he plays a kind grandfather who helps getting his son on the right path when the boy's parents are overwhelmed with their own problems and do not know what to do with their son anymore. The actress who played the mother was okay too. The father was fairly forgettable. But the worst was probably the boy which is quite a shame as he was the absolute lead character just like the title suggests. Many children's films these days do not require great performances from the younger actors as they are not written in a way where they have to portray great emotion or range. Vitus is an exception here. The title character was actually written in a way where only a pretty talented child actor can make it truly work and Teo Gheorgiou was not the right choice. With another a better casting choice this could have been a truly great piece of filmmaking. Still Fredi M. Murer did a decent job all in all. There are moments when the whole child prodigy plot is way over the top for example when the boy makes millions within hours or starts running his own company but if we are not too strict on these it's a very solid watch in my opinion. Taking everything into account I recommend Vitus. Oh and another quick note. There are many Swiss German films out there which are impossible to understand also for German native speakers because the accent is too thick but this is not one of them. If you speak German you will understand everything.".

I love Vitus and Bruno Ganz makes also a terrific role and a couple of key scenes with him are just amazing. I specially like the fact about this movie that once you realize you are different and you try to hide it still your own scent will come up sudden unexpectedly. That makes you unique and should encourage you to direct what you want to achieve in life taking advantage of your own resources. Vitus shows you it's fine to have no clue about what to do.

I grew up in New York City with just such kids. They are portraying the real thing and they do it so well. It's unfortunate that they devolved into those silly characters called the Bowery Boys still true to life as the neighborhood slackers in those silly movies made in the 1940s and 1950s. They deserved better although I suppose it was a living.My particular favorite kid in Dead End is Leo Gorcey. That Spit  what a little punk. I think he plays the part with just the right mix of teenage bravado danger and insecurity and I think he is actually pretty sexy. I could see him playing smooth urban not necessarily urbane villains in other films but that never happened. Too bad. He would have been very interesting.".

	schema:headline " An End That Comes In Dead First";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently watched this film for the first time in many years and I would like to comment in particular on Humphrey Bogart's performance as Baby Face Martin. In the Depression days of the 1930's many citizens admired top criminals who successfully opposed the law i.e. John Dillinger in the belief that the law itself was part of the corrupt elitist system that brought Depression woes upon them and theirs. Martin's character fit this role to a T and it shows in his bravery courage and hatred of the police. A manyfaceted character it also reveals his love for mother and former girlfriend and his gut desire to settle down to a normal lifestyle abandoning his bloody career. Of course it is too late for him to turn it around. I believe that although not yet a star this was Bogart's greatest role arguably on a par with The Treasure of Sierra Madre. Incidentally a little known and seldom shown B film from the 1940's the spooky Return of Dr. X had Bogart as an absolutely chilling Dr. X resurrected from the dead. I highly recommend this for Bogie fans. This multitalented actor could definitely have become a star of horror films had he been so inclined.Allen Jenkins as his devoted cohort Hunk in Dead End gave a fine performance in probably his only serious role in a long career as a supporting actor in comedy parts. Really a shame. His fight gun in hand with Joel McRae in the alley could not have been more realistic to my way of thinking. The rest of the cast indeed was flawless. And how about those Dead End Kids? Although only six years old when the film came out it was reissued frequently and I clearly remember the mothers of that day did all in their power to prevent their children from seeing the film fearing perhaps not unrealistically that they would emulate the Kids. Wouldn't happen today now would it? One contributor here thought that Dead End should be remade citing all the problems of today's youth. I totally disagree. This would only be duplication ad nauseum of the same third rate trash  for the most part  that never ends in today's films and on the tube. Dead End however was the forerunner in showing juvenile delinquency and it's connection to  and likely development into  serious crime. This last is just another reason to heap praise upon this eminently laudable film. And in closing I would like to say that while 1937 was not a particularly notable year for the country in general being in the throes of The Great Depression as far as the efforts of the film industry went it was a very very good year. I for one am thankful for it.Just recently I finished the 1971 autobiography Cagney By Cagney. During the filming of Angels With Dirty Faces which one might say is a sequel to Dead End Cagney ran afoul of the Dead End Kids in the person of Dead End Kid Leo Gorcey who was proving uncooperative and insolent. Cagney in reality a tough guy gave Gorcey an elbow to the head that ended his behavior. Cagney says further that in a film with the Dead End Kids the Kids' took issue with a statement by Bogart and then took off his trousers. Bogart the consummate gangster in film was nothing of the sort in real life. The film would have to have been Dead End  the idea obviously emanating from detrousering the rich kid.".

Oddly enough it was made on loan out to Samuel Goldwyn. His expressions of surprise and disgust after meeting with his mother and Francey are a treasure to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "It's unfortunate that now morons write gangster films in which all they do is try to outsadist everyone else's comic book bad guy.This film showed so much not just about gangsters but how they fit into the world and how other characters fit it. Joel McCrea is a trained architect who makes small change as a painter in the run down tenement. The Dead End Kids are varied characters themselves with the nerdy voiced Gorcey the later stooge Huntz Hall and the likable Jordan for example.And Bogie is the main gangster. We only see two gangsters for most of the film and it moves at such a great pace that we forget it is only a meager setting basically a city block.Bogie's bad guy would shine today. He goes back to his old neighborhood to see his mother and ex girlfriend and their reactions and his are totally believable. This film is so well written that modern gangster film writers are put to shame. No wonder they try to hide this film.There is so much in this film that it is hard to say more without writing an essay but it is exciting dramatic and adventurous all at once. All the actors and all the crew shine.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's unfortunate that now morons write gangster films in which all they do is try to outsadist everyone else's comic book bad guy.This film showed so much not just about gangsters but how they fit into the world and how other characters fit it. Joel McCrea is a trained architect who makes small change as a painter in the run down tenement. The Dead End Kids are varied characters themselves with the nerdy voiced Gorcey the later stooge Huntz Hall and the likable Jordan for example.And Bogie is the main gangster. We only see two gangsters for most of the film and it moves at such a great pace that we forget it is only a meager setting basically a city block.Bogie's bad guy would shine today. He goes back to his old neighborhood to see his mother and ex girlfriend and their reactions and his are totally believable. This film is so well written that modern gangster film writers are put to shame. No wonder they try to hide this film.There is so much in this film that it is hard to say more without writing an essay but it is exciting dramatic and adventurous all at once. All the actors and all the crew shine.";

	schema:reviewBody "Cinema has always had an uneasy relationship with the theatre. By their nature stage plays tend to have very long scenes and base everything around dialogue and there is something in the power of having real life players there in front of you that makes this workable. But there is also something about the very specific visual form of cinema that makes straight adaptations of stage plays potentially very boring.The way in which this can be overcome other than completely restructuring the source text is by ensuring that the picture keeps moving and keeps storytelling on a visual level. You see perhaps the most important difference between stage and screen is that in the theatre every audience member sees things from a slightly different angle or distance  there is no universal perspective and theatre directors have to ensure that everything is clear whichever seat it's seen from. But in the pictures everyone sees the exact same image at any given moment and a screen director must find the best camera placements and shot arrangements. Fortunately for Dead End this screen director William Wyler was among the best and most inventive users of space on screen. For starters look at how the shots of the rich folks contrast with those of the poor ones. In the former the camera mostly keeps an aloof distance and everything is picked out in crisp white. In the latter the camera is closer to the action and the image is filled with mottled shades of grey.The other very important thing in adapting stage plays to screen is to ensure the performances are presented as well as possible in order to give cinema audiences a taste of that same atmosphere and presence they would feel in front of a stage. Wyler also happens to be especially good at this. In particular he is bold enough to focus us on just one facet of a performance sometimes keeping a character with their back to the camera and not showing us their face forcing us to focus more on their posture or the reaction of the opposite person. He also keeps the entrances of characters in keeping with their nature  for example having Humphrey Bogart smoothly slide into the frame or craftily appear in the background as other figures move aside.And the performances pay off big time. This was still a period in which an actor like Bogart was unlikely to be anything but a villain but his appearance here surely raised his profile considerably and put him one step closer to those heroic leads. He adds some incredibly subtle yet effective touches  for example when Joel McCrea gives him the cigarette look at how he pauses before grudgingly lowering his head to accept the lighted match as if this tiny stretch is some extreme display of generosity on Bogart's part. Joel McCrea is one of those actors like say Gary Cooper or Van Heflin who doesn't look like he ought to be a good actor  he looks like he ought to be an absolute hunk of wood  but he isn't. This is probably his finest performance. It's also the best I have seen from Sylvia Sidney. And of course there are those kids every one of them a character.The strange thing to consider about the acting in Dead End is that all the performances are essentially onedimensional  but in the best possible sense. Bogart is continually a mean and moody presence moving and speaking slowly submerging his feelings under a veneer of hardhearted masculinity. In so doing he fulfils his character's placement as the symbolic archetypal gangster figure. Sylvia Sidney is the eternal independent working class lass while McCrea is the honest levelheaded working man and even when he turns to violence it seems not so much character development but merely the natural result of his principled persona in extreme circumstances. Claire Trevor in her portrayal of the prostitutemoll has the very opposite tone to the measured performances of Bogart and McCrea all venom and fragile emotion. Of such things many a Best Supporting Actress nomination is made.The odds were perhaps stacked in the filmmakers' favour with Dead End it being a very engaging and punchy play that lends itself well to the cinematic medium. Of particular appeal is the way it begins as a kind of plotless social study but gradually a story emerges as the character's lives become interwoven. Still it is the superb efforts of Wyler and his cast that really bring this one to life.".

The talent assembled for this production is why the film withstands the test of time and makes Dead End a movie which I never get tired of viewing. Greg Toland's cinematography is masterful. Max Steiner's musical score is brilliant. He perfectly blended the feel of a fast paced urban theme which then becomes a beautiful and dramatic orchestral piece. Max Steiner had a real genius for bringing the right mood to whatever the film demanded. Of so many brilliant Steiner scores I find this to be among his finest. William Wyler's direction is awesome as always. I particularly like the constant background flow of pedestrians going about their day throughout the entire picture. The movie's cast is stuffed with talent. Character actors like Marjorie Mane and Esther Howard fill small segments with memorable scenes. Claire Trevor's portrayal of a sweet girl who became disillusioned and wound up as a prostitute is poignant while remaining gritty and realistic. The Dead End Kids are great throughout the movie. Ward Bond brings a plus to the movie in his role as the upscale apartment's doorman. I like Allen Jenkins and think no other actor was better suited to play the sidekick to Bogart's character as the prodigal gangster returning to his old neighborhood. Dead End is one film that has countless elements to enjoy. The level of talent on both sides of the camera keep me watching it over and over again.".

Sylvia Sidney is absolutely luminous in her portrayal of a young woman who would have a promising future if she lived anywhere else but is a frustrated trapped animal in the slums of New York.  Joel McCrea stands with one foot in each world having grown up rough in the neighborhood but without turning gangster and still able to dream of better things for himself and the people around him.  Look also for a couple of brilliant though brief appearancesMarjorie Main's chilling delivery as Bogie's exhausted and distraught mother and Claire Trevor's bittersweet portrayal of his old girlfriend.It's not as heavy as it sounds though.

	schema:headline " Great visual beauties direction acting. A soandso story.";
	schema:reviewBody "The main credit of Dead End lies in the stunning visual beauties. The studio reproduction of a New York slum is really magnificent worth of other major achievements of the same kind like say the set of Rear Window. A true joy for the eyes. The work of the camera and William Wyler's direction are outstanding as well. And of course the job of the cast is great. Bogart still in the role of the villain McCrea and Sylvia Sidney are excellent and save their rather straightforward characters and lines. In my opinion the best one is Claire Trevor in the small part of the lost girl. I normally dislike kids on the screen but I must concede that here they give great performances playing the gang of streetboys.The story is conventional with a noble message but few and predictable twists. The script is often clumsy and preachy. Luckily enough the director gives a quick pace to the narration and inserts a number of humoristic touches. There's a main flaw in the plot I think that even in the States of the 1930s a common citizen couldn't freely shoot a gangster.Anyway I've found in the screenplay an interesting and modern theme namely the psychological ambiguity of some characters whom even the allknowing viewer cannot fully understand. For instance Claire Trevor is apparently the cliche disgraced girl the innocent victim of poverty lack of opportunities social injustice. To end as a prostitute is her unavoidable doom... But when her former boyfriend Bogie gives some money to help her she makes the horribly vulgar request of twenty more bucks... with a grimace worth of a hardened prostitute great stuff by Trevor!. So we see that after all perhaps that girl is not so innocent as she pretends to be... And what about Drina's brother the leader of the streetboys? The audience is perfectly aware that in spite of his whining weeping selfapologies when he's in dire straits the boy is a REAL criminal. We see that he deliberately harms people steals brutally thrashes the rich kid wants to slash his gangmate. And he just mocks his affectionate sister and his friend McCrea when in tears he cries that he's good that he didn't intend to harm and all that. So are we supposed to feel sympathy for this hideous boy? Interesting ambiguity which creates a fine artistic effect... perhaps beyond the actual intentions of the writer Lillian Hellman.All in all we may forgive the defects of the movie. it is worth seeing Dead End enjoying the beauty of the set and the work of director and actors.".

The studio reproduction of a New York slum is really magnificent worth of other major achievements of the same kind like say the set of Rear Window. A true joy for the eyes. The work of the camera and William Wyler's direction are outstanding as well. And of course the job of the cast is great. Bogart still in the role of the villain McCrea and Sylvia Sidney are excellent and save their rather straightforward characters and lines. In my opinion the best one is Claire Trevor in the small part of the lost girl. I normally dislike kids on the screen but I must concede that here they give great performances playing the gang of streetboys.The story is conventional with a noble message but few and predictable twists. The script is often clumsy and preachy. Luckily enough the director gives a quick pace to the narration and inserts a number of humoristic touches. There's a main flaw in the plot I think that even in the States of the 1930s a common citizen couldn't freely shoot a gangster.Anyway I've found in the screenplay an interesting and modern theme namely the psychological ambiguity of some characters whom even the allknowing viewer cannot fully understand. For instance Claire Trevor is apparently the cliche disgraced girl the innocent victim of poverty lack of opportunities social injustice. To end as a prostitute is her unavoidable doom... But when her former boyfriend Bogie gives some money to help her she makes the horribly vulgar request of twenty more bucks... with a grimace worth of a hardened prostitute great stuff by Trevor!. So we see that after all perhaps that girl is not so innocent as she pretends to be... And what about Drina's brother the leader of the streetboys? The audience is perfectly aware that in spite of his whining weeping selfapologies when he's in dire straits the boy is a REAL criminal. We see that he deliberately harms people steals brutally thrashes the rich kid wants to slash his gangmate. And he just mocks his affectionate sister and his friend McCrea when in tears he cries that he's good that he didn't intend to harm and all that. So are we supposed to feel sympathy for this hideous boy? Interesting ambiguity which creates a fine artistic effect... perhaps beyond the actual intentions of the writer Lillian Hellman.All in all we may forgive the defects of the movie. it is worth seeing Dead End enjoying the beauty of the set and the work of director and actors.";

Wait a year and watch The Adventures of Robin Hood and his 1938 redistribution of wealth instead. It is difficult to think of any creatures less appealing than those deadend minigangsters. The impression left by this movie is its sense of unreality. The unvarying set scene is crammed with uninteresting incident often repeated which fails to advance the plot. Even the manner that McCrea gets chucked into the ditch and then the misdirected shootout with Bogart towards the end both seem flimsy and fake. Bending over backwards to make allowances for the film's vintage it still amazes me that it has attracted so many positive reviews and currently enjoys such a high rating.Its hour and a half is only redeemed by the presence naturally of Humphrey Bogart. Something of a mystery how this short fairly homely looking man succeeds in commanding such a strong screen presence. This may have its origins in the way he speaks. Firstly no matter how rapidly the words leave his mouth they are always clear and understandable. Secondly they never sound like lines scripted by someone else it's as if he had just thought of them himself and instantaneously come up with them. Added to which is the realism of his facial expressions. But since he only has a supporting role and gets eliminated by McCrea he can't really help the story. He does glamorise the bad guy which isn't what the film is trying to say. Most kids would rather be Bogart than McCrea. The romantic subplot adds nothing and is of minimal interest.".

He's Baby Face Martin a brutal gangster seven guys  you could be da eighth who's returned to his origins for a look at the old joint and to meet his Ma and his girl friend Francey neither of whom he's seen in ten years while on the lam. Bogart is barely out of his Duke Mantee phase. This time he carries only one elbow cocked instead of both. Well Ma isn't particularly glad to see him.

Will it happen? Not a chance. Half the gang have already been in and out of the same reform school. As the halfgrown knife wielder is led away by the cops one of the gang counsels him to look up Smokey he'll take care of ya. What a lot of anger in this screenplay Sidney Kingsley and Lillian Hellman. The identified enemy however is not the rich who are portrayed as no more than indifferent and naive but not stupid or cruel. And the tenement dwellers and their kids are hardly saints. The Dead End Kids exit at the end singing brightly If I Had the Wings of an Angel after one of their members is hauled off to the slams. Nope the evildoer here is not an individual not even a social class. It's the system itself. The system is never identified by name but capitalism would be a good guess. This was the 1930s and the Great Depression was considered one of capitalism's more brutal manifestations by the socially engaged. I wonder what Kingsley and Hellman would have to say about the current proposal to eliminate the estate tax? Those bumps you just felt were from the writers rolling over a bit in their graves.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead End the film adaption of Sidney Kingsley's play that ran for 687 performances during the 19351937 seasons was a harbinger of what Alfred Hitchcock tried to do in such films as Rope and even more so in Rear Window. The whole story is told on one very complex set showing the stark contrast of the rich penthouse dwellers with the inhabitants of the nearby tenements and flats.Building that set on stage and for the screen must have been one expensive proposition so it was a good thing Sidney Kingsley wrote a hit.It may be one set but the plot of the film involves three stories and how they interconnect. Story number one is about Joel McCrea a former slum kid himself who still lives down there while he tries to get a job as an architect. He's involved with two women rich socialite Wendy Barrie who lives in the penthouse and Sylvia Sidney who played more working class women than anyone else during the Thirties.Sidney works as a seamstress in a garment factory and she's currently on strike and she's got a younger brother to support who causes her much grief. The younger brother is Billy Halop and Sidney worries about the gang he runs with the kids who later became known as the Dead End kids later East Side Kids later Bowery Boys. Their a rough bunch and they get a visit from a celebrity of sorts.Which leads us to the third track in the person of Humphrey Bogart who grew up on this same block and is now a wanted fugitive of the John Dillinger variety. The kids and McCrea recognize him the kids worship him and McCrea is willing to give him a pass for now he's no rat. All their stories mix in this plot which does hold the interest through out the film.Besides the Dead End Kids who didn't all play the same roles you see them play on the screen only one other player came over from Broadway for the screen version. Marjorie Main who we usually know as the rambunctious and brassy Ma Kettle plays a very serious part indeed as Humphrey Bogart's mother. You'll not forget her as she rejects her hoodlum son both the anger and sorrow she expresses it is haunting.Bogart got another jolt in his trip down memory lane in the slum in the person of Claire Trevor. She's usually a good time girl with a heart of gold. Her heart may be golden in Dead End but she's a woman who's seen the seamy side of life as a prostitute. Very few prostitutes were portrayed as such during the days of The Code so in that sense Dead End was quite daring.The film is firmly set in the Depression Thirties. That same area where in certain shots you can see the Queensborough Bridge in the near distance is some of the richest real estate on earth now. Those same buildings that are portrayed as slums now rent to yuppies at obscene figures if in fact they survived.Though Dead End is a dated piece of work it does offer a great glimpse into urban life for the rich and poor. This is one of Samuel Goldwyn's best productions and William Wyler gets uniformly fine performances from his talented cast of players.".

Dave is her onagain offagain love interest who has done everything in the book to try to rise out of poverty but still can't get ahead. Dave has been seeing Kay a young woman torn between a future with a man she thinks she may love Dave and the comforts of wealth. we find out the two men in silk suits are gangsters one being the famous killer baby face martin who has returned to his home to see his mother and old girlfriend. he is rejected by his mother who is disgusted by his profession and track record and his girlfriend who has become a common prostitute. their are a million intertwining story lines that add up to one incredible climax but essentially this film is about the cycle of poverty and class issues. the performances are terrific. Sylvia Sidney not a big name today but a damn good actress and Joel mccrea are perfection as the films heroes. Bogart is unforgettable. this is one of the dozens of gangsters he played but i would rate this performances as high as duke manatee in petrified forest. he's tough and street smart but with each disappointment we see evidence of his emotions leaking out. the gang of kids remind me of the jets in west side story they don't like anyone not even each other half the time. look for Marjorie main ma kettle before she was ma kettle! in a touching but heartbreaking scene as Bogey's frail aging mother and Claire Trevor another fine forgotten actress as Bogey's sweetheart turned greedy streetwalker. the best thing about this film is they way each character believes he or she can overcome the way of life he or she seems fated to live with. each character tries desperately and fails. this is the way real people are. there's no Hollywood sugarcoatedness about any of it. no overdramatic music or madeforthepreviews lines. it's grossly realistic. this film would be on my top 50 list maybe even my top 25. it's that good.".

Bogart is unforgettable. this is one of the dozens of gangsters he played but i would rate this performances as high as duke manatee in petrified forest. he's tough and street smart but with each disappointment we see evidence of his emotions leaking out. the gang of kids remind me of the jets in west side story they don't like anyone not even each other half the time. look for Marjorie main ma kettle before she was ma kettle! in a touching but heartbreaking scene as Bogey's frail aging mother and Claire Trevor another fine forgotten actress as Bogey's sweetheart turned greedy streetwalker. the best thing about this film is they way each character believes he or she can overcome the way of life he or she seems fated to live with. each character tries desperately and fails. this is the way real people are. there's no Hollywood sugarcoatedness about any of it. no overdramatic music or madeforthepreviews lines. it's grossly realistic. this film would be on my top 50 list maybe even my top 25. it's that good.";

	schema:reviewBody "Set in a small New York City slum in the 1930s Dead End very powerfully depicts the hardship poverty and despair that are a fact of everyday life for its residents and also shows how naturally such conditions can foster criminality. Surprisingly a large block of luxury apartments has also been built closeby for the very wealthy people who have more recently been attracted to the area by its views of the river. The contrast between their beautifully maintained accommodation and the neighbouring cockroachinfested tenements couldn't be greater and effectively throws into sharp focus the huge differences that exist between the lives of the rich and the poor who through some unusual circumstances have ended up living very closely together.Returning after an absence of 10 years to the neighbourhood where he grew up notorious gangster Baby Face Martin Humphrey Bogart accompanied by his henchman Hunk Allen Jenkins surveys the various changes that have taken place since he left and with some amusement watches the antics of a local gang of kids who spend their days by the riverside swimming fighting and generally getting into as much trouble as they possibly can. Martin who has made a lot of money from his criminal activities has also had his appearance changed by plastic surgery to try to avoid being caught by the police who want to bring him to trial on a number of murder charges. His disguise doesn't however prevent him from being recognised by Dave Connell Joel McCrea who's one of his old contemporaries.Dave who grew up in similar circumstances to Martin trained and qualified to become an architect but having been unable to get any work in his chosen profession makes a modest living by doing a variety of lowpaid jobs like signpainting. He and Drina Gordon Sylvia Sidney who's deeply in love with him have been close friends since childhood but currently Dave only has eyes for Kay Burton Wendy Barrie an attractive blonde who enjoys his company but is also the mistress of a rich man who lives in one of the luxury apartments. Drina is a decent hardworking young woman who struggles to support herself and her younger brother Tommy Billy Halop. Tommy is the leader of the local gang of kids and so Drina has a constant struggle on her hands to keep him out of trouble.The main purpose of Martin's visit is to meet up again with his mother and his old girlfriend Francey Claire Trevor. Both of these meetings end badly because his mother is disgusted by everything he's done and turns him away and Francey who had worked as a prostitute for some years is now suffering from a disease which in her trade could be regarded as an occupational hazard. The deep sadness he feels then becomes mitigated to some extent by the fact that he's seen as a hero by the street kids who admire the fact that he got away from the neighbourhood and made a lot of money. Dave becomes concerned about Martin's continued presence and his growing influence on the local kids and this eventually leads to a violent conflict and a series of decisions which have a strong bearing on the futures of Dave Drina Kay and Tommy.Dead End is an interesting piece of social commentary that makes a number of valid observations about the links that have always existed between abject poverty and crime and does so in a way that's relatively wellbalanced. Examples of this are the ways in which Martin and Dave chose different ways to get out of the hardship that they'd been born into and similarly the very different ways in which Drina Francey and Kay tried to make their lives better. Similar balance is also shown in its depiction of the villain of the piece who has no redeeming qualities but still possesses sufficient humanity to feel deeply hurt by what happens when he finally reacquaints himself with his mother and Francey.The worst feature of this movie is its staginess which fortunately is compensated for to a great extent by the sheer power of its story Gregg Toland's terrific Oscarnominated cinematography and the excellent performances that bring the whole drama to life so convincingly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brilliant adaptation of a hit Broadway play about life in the slums of New York during the Great Depression. A gangster on the run from the law returns to the neighborhood he grew up in to plot his next move. Add to that a little romance and a gang of street kids getting into trouble and you've got a firstrate Warner Bros. urban drama picture only this wasn't made by Warners. Humphrey Bogart plays the gangster character 'Baby Face' Martin. In some ways it was a very familiar role to many others he'd played up to this point but this one was a bit more layered and gave him a chance to flex his acting muscles some. Solid turns from Joel McCrea Wendy Barrie Claire Trevor and Marjorie Main. Allen Jenkins is always fun to watch. Next to Bogart I'd have to say the standout is the lovely Sylvia Sidney one of my favorite actresses from this period. She had some of the most expressive eyes in the business.Among other things the film's notable for being the first screen appearance of the Dead End Kids who would go on to appear in several WB gangster pictures in basically the same roles as this before starring in a few series of their own under different names my favorite of which was the Bowery Boys. It's interesting to see them here looking and acting much more like roughneck teenagers than later where they were clearly adults behaving like overgrown kids. Directed by William Wyler this is a message movie from a time when those types of movies actually felt earnest and not phony or preachy. Yes it's pretty much a filmed stage play which was very common in the 1930s but the great cast excellent sets and Gregg Toland's beautiful photography goes a long way to bringing it all to life. Not one you'll want to pass up if you're a fan of the stars or the period.".

Which I am personally quite surprised at as me and my boyfriend found this film to be the best of the Cube series.I got the Cube box set for Christmas and I always look forward to watching a good movie. I had already seen Cube 1 so not much shocked me...bearing in mind the first time I watched it I was fairly disturbed...putting myself in their position...waking up in a huge cube not knowing how you got there.Then there was Cube 2 not much happened in this film...I didn't like the fact there weren't any traps as good as the first film.Then there is Cube Zero...a film that can get very confusing in places but pieces itself together gradually and actually explains WHY these people are in the cube how they got there and what happens whenif they get out. In Cube Zero there are 2 guys hired to watch over the people in the Cube...they have files on what looks like everyone who has ever been in the Cube...you ask yourself why would anyone want to watch over a bunch of people dieing in a cube?...well you find that out also.I personally think that the makers of the 'SAW' series got some of their ideas from the Cube series. I mean when you think about it...strangers waking up in a room not knowing how they got there at first having to find a way out of this rooms else they'll die. Pretty similar scenarios if you ask me.I'm not going to go into too much detail as I don't really want to confuse people...but it's advised that you definitely must see the first one to make a connection to Cube Zero.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Cube movie was an art movie. It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand. It was on the nonliteral level a man vs. cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face a new indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles a world where there were no more struggle but peace. I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels.The second movie Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. Still for being fairly entertaining I rated it a 5 out of 10.The third movie Cube Zero while ignoring the second plays like a vastly inferior commercial Bmovie rehash of the first sans the symbolism. There is no homage or tribute here there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes  an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a ripoff with absolutely no originality and nothing to say.That we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of. And in this movie those who get through to the exit like Kazan did at the end of the first movie are just killed  where the bleep is the sense in that?! That's just flippin' stupid. Pointless.The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.".

Things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen. Nevertheless there isn't a single original thing in this movie. While the first Cube was a nerdy horror movie which didn't make a whole lot of sense in the end cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoonfeed explanations for every detail that the first movie didn't answer. The comic thing is the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird and tries to explain them. But the scenes are just copied over there is no coherence whatsoever. This script is sooo pointless. I can imagine it being written by some halfwit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is in the end they cripple the 'good' wunderkind guy and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie and you see him when they find him 'this room is green..' in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie clap clap what a twist. First of all what about if you haven't seen the first one this doesn't make any sense you nitwit director. Oh another great idea instead of the numbers to identify xyz coordinates of the room cube 1997 this time it is 3 letters each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except now permutations don't make much sense anymore..so he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use them..I want my money back.I guess I had to write this down since there are just so many bad inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie. Directorswriters should be required to possess some talent.".

The introduction of religion while subtle is one of the better points as well.The writerdirector attributes his ideas more to City of Lost Children and Brazil than the previous Cube films. This is a sad comparison to brilliant films. There is a feeble attempt at showing the humanity behind the people who run the Cube but it never feels fleshed out. It never progresses beyond a few hamhanded realizations that reminisce of the teenagers finding out the plot of Freddy vs. Jason. It feels like a rehash not even a sequel. The sad attempts at subtle references to communism and democracy and the shear bureaucracyfilingcabinet feeling of the observation room feels too forced. The ideas are presented but without the meat to fill its skin.Overall Cube Zero feels hollow and unnecessary but not without traces of the roots that made it a classic in my book.".

The removal of the paranoid absurdity of the whole situation leaves one feeling slightly deflated. I liked it better when the cube was explained as a cash guzzling project that had spun out of control and had no overall purpose apart from to justify its own existence. In essence the cube was a gravy train without a driver  it had a kind of perverse logic to it that you can see in many misguided projects today.It's difficult to care for any of the characters either. None of them are allowed to develop as there are two separate plot lines that only come together at the end. Each plot line tries to establish itself but neither has the time. This leads to the film feeling stretched and cut short.The 'lab rats' that are in the cube are a bunch of cardboard cut outs who we hardly get to know before the inevitable happens. The guys working outside of the cube are the same. It's a shame as all of the characters had potential just not the time to realise it.The worst thing of all is the character of Mr Jax who is a ridiculous parody of a Nazi commanding officer mixed with Mr Bean and Basil Fawlty. This character is impossible to take seriously but is also completely unfunny. I actually found myself grimacing when he was on screen and half expected him to come out with lines like 'vee have vays of making you talk!' Absolutely dire  it practically ruined the movie. At first I thought it was the British comedian Rik Mayall with a joke plastic eye stuck to his face. That would have been preferable.To round things off the ending was poor with a stupid terminator style villain and a 'was it all a dream' sequence.

For starters they take away the aura of mystery of the first cubes by promoting the viewpoint of two 'inside' workers. While the first two cubes was about confused people trying to get out of a deathtrap this one concentrates more on the dealings of the two workers operating it. They also don't know how they got there never go out and operate a deathtrap killing people against their own wish? Not very plausible. It makes sense for the victims of the cube but is pretty hard to swallow for the personnel. The local boss who comes along when things go wrong reminded me of doctor gadget. And don't get me started about the pointless inclusion of a 'cyber soldier'. All this takes away from the brutal simplicity of the first two movies. Also i feel the interaction between the persons inside the cube is lacking. The first cubes had a way out or at least you were lead to believe that but in this one there supposedly isn't and you get fried at the end. They actually cheat to get out. It makes the purpose of the cube there endeavors to get out and in fact the entire movie pointless and provides a weak ending. I would have loved a better connection between the movies. They should have rehired the retarded guy from cube 1 and given him the role in cube 0 where at the end he gets to walk out of the cube alone. Hypercube cube 2 was a good movie that respected the cube concept with a new twist but in cube 0 it gets abandoned unfortunately.".

I wrote a comment about this which triggered a couple dozen messages among the editor of a film magazine myself and the original author of Hypercube.As it happens the original script was more true to what made the first one work but it was coopted and changed by the same hack behind this.So once again here we have some sort of evil experiment by some agency. In the last one that was actually a major weapons company. The one clever idea is similar to Saw where we watch the watchers of watchers watch. This folding is supposed to impute an evil to us that we see in the maniacal Dennis Hopper impersonator.One of the intermediate watchers draws comics. This is textbook folding.

It takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is  something that was never revealed in the first movie  but since said explanation is bland I'd rather it was kept a secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of politicalreligious totalitarian state. So what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocused.What works? Basically nothing. The acting is purely amateur hour the pacing is slow how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen? and the gore effects while revolting fail to convince. In short Cube Zero reminded me of a Cube fanfic a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel.".

Gore is back together with much darker atmosphere and at least apparently gone is all ambiguous silliness about alternative universes from Cube 2. I did appreciate the idea but did someone really think it worked? Someone complained that this does nothing but recycle ideas of Cube 1  2. This couldn't be further from truth I think the movie goes into a very interesting direction. The fact that the beginning is identical to Cube 1 is just a homage I guess it tries to say that you should forget about Cube 2 at this point  this is no PG ride. It ignores Cube 2 completely why should be obvious after seeing the ending and goes back to what worked in the original.It would've been easy for this movie to be a complete disaster. The trailer certainly did not look as good as the movie ended up being. Sure some performances aren't that great but then again look at Cube 1! and some cgi seems to be recycled from Cube 1 but then again look at the budget!.However I think Cube Zero expands the Cubeverse in an interesting way and still keeps a lot of mysteries. Who are these people? The ending itself is so great that if you liked Cube 1 at all you should watch this movie.Cube 2 certainly didn't give the viewer anything new except a silly ending that could mean anything. This one on the other hand is consistent with the premise of Cube 1 and just lays out some new rules.A great ride with a very nice payoff! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "One question I always have about these cube movies is how does throwing a boot into the empty room tell you it's safe or not? This feels like rehash from the other sequels. But in those films we discover some traps are triggered by other things not by weight or movement or sound but heat.After this scene one man exclaims perhaps it was triggered by heat or sound but that isn't possible because the boot hitting the floor was pretty loud. Most likely it was triggered by a camera picking up a human form in the middle of the room.After being disappointed by the follow through of part 1 and 2 I looked forward to a prequel finally making some sense of all this and being a enjoyable film. Kind of like what Hellraiser 3 Bloodline did for that series.Now we have 2 workers overseeing this project to some capacity. We never see their higher ups but we do see a higher level of command in part 2.They seem to not mind too much what is going on for they believe they men and women inside the cube are convicted criminals.We know this to not be the truth at all.The fact that in part 1 they followed a puzzle of numbers primes in particular in part 2 well I don't remember what they followed then 5 dimensional cubes are funny that way. BUt in this one they find a similar puzzle but this time in sets of letters.For lack of ingenuity and originality I scoff at the simplicity of the parallel plots at this point but I trudge on without judgment... keeping my mind on the third exit.When the rooms align what's the first thing that happens? Clean Sweep Which is what we saw at the very end of part 2... you ever wonder why at the end of part 2 when the girl company employee plant in the cube escapes the cube with some sort of plumb device around her neck intact as the cube seems to clean sweep itself into oblivion they kill her? Did you think that question was going to be answered in the next movie? Do you still think it's going to be answered in Cube Zero? Owen reaching the exit room reminds me a lot of the ending of Cube 1 I suppose that was the point.Exit Procedure is very Nazism isn't it.Anyways I noticed later on they weren't even waiting for the boot to hit the floor before entering a new room that didn't make a whole lot of sense although the sound vibration death was quite cool.Pretty nice ending the way Wynn becomes Kazanized. Makes you wonder just how Kazan got the way he was doesn't it? People ask what is the point of this movie or this trilogy or franchise... and to my knowledge there is no point. Unless you look for a more anamorphic point. And that is the point within.There is no great moral here no blatant and obvious tell tale morality. No be good or this could happen to you there is no rhyme nor reason. Perhaps the only point to be gleamed from such an adventure is thus.The CUBE is the mind. The traps are desires ignorance apathy and the like. We are lab rats in consciousness trying to get from birth to the white light at the end without falling into the traps of our own egos if you will.At least that is my perspective.".

The other comment about how it's the same stuff isn't entirely accurate. There's plenty of mind twisting gut wrenching moments to occupy even the most jaded horrorscifi fan.

Sure there's sort of an explanation in there but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film.Cube Zero looks rather cheap as did its predecessors and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling. I also fell pretty confident in saying that there's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future. They have brought back the traps from Cube 1 though by that I mean that they're almost the same ones which is a bit of a shame.I know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one but I just feel that it's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't that great to begin with. 110".

Kathy Ireland rounds out the cast as the place kicker and kick she does! If your ready for a some rowdy radical comedy on the gridiron then make sure you add this little gem to your your collection de excellance.

The film actually predates Quantum Leap a television show that features the star in this one Scott Bakula. Speaking of Scott here is the case of a guy that just seems like he should of been a major star in Hollywood but it just never materialized for him. He is great in this one as an older man who returns to college because he had to leave college prematurely the previous time. A coach in charge of rebuilding the football program recruits him as the team has few players and no real quarterback. The dean of the school is against the coach the whole way and is sort of the villain of the piece but here is one of the kinks. I find it refreshing that a dean would want to focus on education rather than the gridiron. As much as I enjoy football to often the educational program takes a backseat to a bunch of jocks who should not even be at the college except they are good at sports. Meanwhile those who go to the school trying to pay their way and in the need of loans have to keep having their tuition raised to pay for things such as stadiums. Enough of my rant the film is rather good but is unbelievable. Suffice to say there is no way a team that has so few players that some have to play offense and defense is going to compete against the number one team in the country. So just think of it as a Hollywood sports comedy totally unrealistic but worth a few laughs unless of course it is Sinbad making the jokes.".

Scott Bakula is perfect in the role neither attempting to affect a fake Texas drawl nor over playing the role. Hector Elizondo and Robert Loggia two veteran actors who could easily dominate the film instead add their considerable talents to make the film believable. Several great touches are added including Rob Schneider as the announcer for the games and the appearance of a prison team arranged by Dean Elias Larry Miller the schmuck you love to hate adds an extreme and interesting comic scene. Dick Butkus Earl Campbell Roger Craig Ben Davidson Tony Dorsett Evander Holyfield Ed Too Tall Jones Jim Kelly Jerry Rice Hershel Walker and Randy White are the prison football players and if you have to ask who they are you need to head over to the NFL Hall of Fame Except for Evander Holyfield former Heavyweight Champion of the World. The film is cohesive the language is minimal and the violence is limited to the football field practice and a slight altercation between two teams at Billy Bob's. Collectible if you are a fan of good sports movies and definitely a great film for the family on a Saturday night.".

Wouldn't you know it though he soon has a runin with an attractive female professor Harley Jane Kozak who refuses to accept his growing interest in her. And with a ragtag roster of only 17 players playing both offense and defense can they win any games? This is a fine football flick with some elements of romance thrown in too to please any viewer. The cast is very nice with Bakula Elizondo Loggia Sinbad a tinybit pretentious Kozak a lovely Kathy Ireland a very funny Rob Schneider and a hilarious Larry Miller whooping it up all the way. The football scenes are quite fine as well which should please any true gridiron fan. Yes unfortunately the film looks dated with its out of fashion costumes and its mediocre camera work.

While few really appreciate this movie for what it is it is probably the last great film in a genre that is slowly being overtaken by raunchy teen comedies and pointless excursions into other subgenres";

	schema:reviewBody "Necessary Roughness is one of those football movies you can watch before College Football Season starts.  SPOILER ALERT!!! In 1990 The Texas State Fightin' Armadillos won the Division 1A National Championship at the Cotton Bowl and six months later Texas State were penalized with the Death Penalty by the NCAA for violating their policies which included illegal drug use illegal payments to the players from boosters grade tamperingand various recruting violations. Head Coach Ed Straight Arrow Gennaro Hector Elizondo is rehired by Texas State University President Carver Purcell United States Senator Fred Thompson. The old players were expelled and the old coaches were fired.  As a part of the Death Penalty probation Texas State loses all of their scholarships blacked out on Television and are banned from Bowl Games. Gennaro hires an assistant coach by the name of Wally Rig Riggendorf Robert Loggia and they conduct a open tryout to assemble a new team from the actual student body. Coach Rig drove 200 miles from campus to recruit Paul BlakeScott Bakula a 34year old Quarterback who did not play in college. Before the first game the team was cut down to only 17 players after the dean found out that some players did not make the grade. To field a full squad Coach Gennaro brought back Iron Man football where players play on both Offense and Defense.  After being blown out by Southwest Texas in the first game 650 the Armadillos lost eight games in a row all blow outs. In the ninth game of the season against the Kansas Jayhawks Kicker Lucy Draper Kathy Ireland kicked a gametying field goal at the end to tie Kansas three points apiece.  Two weeks before the final game the Armadillos get into a bar room brawl with the Texas Colts led by their captain Harlan Flat Top Myers. As for the game The Armadillos trailed 21 to 0 at halftime when Coach Rig gave a profanitylaced pep talk to the players and it worked. Before the end of third quarterDean Elias Larry Miller was fired when he tried to get the test scores from the players thrown out.  By the fourth quarter Texas State was down by 7 and made a big play on defense to get the ball back. The Armadillos move down field and scored a touchdown with no time remaining to cut the Colt lead to one. After scoring they decided to go for two on a fake field goal. Blake passes to Charlie Banks a player who was a walk on the previous year  but did not play who caught the gamewinning 2point conversion to win by one point 2221. The Texas State Fightin' Armadillos finished the season with one win eight losses and one tie.  This movie is a very funny sports comedy in it's uncensored form and like I said it is great when you need a laugh before Football season.".

It's not as concerned about being tough as it is about getting laughs.It all makes for a fun movie to watch. The jokes are awesome especially when they target football itself as a sport. And when they do so its a little more subtle it's more in the language you heard from your coaches the references that seem to travel from locker room to locker room across the country.BUT don't worry the bulk of the movie and the sense of humor comes from the characters in the film and not the game itself. You don't have to understand the lingo if you never had to take a knee and get screamed at by an old man with his pants hitched up too high it doesn't matter the movie can carry itself without appealing to sports fans.When you sit down for a movie it should entertain you.

I love a good sports movie and Scott Bakula can be terrific in the right role I wanted to like this movie but it just seemed to never end a sure sign that the film fails to entertain or inspire.";

	schema:reviewBody "So...is this an episode of 'Quantum Leap' following the constant adventures of 'Sam Beckett'?. No?! well it sure as hell seems like it as the ever cuddly Scott Bakula portrays the same character he's always ever portrayed with the exact same haircut too...geez dude!. So lets not beat around the bush here this is the late in the day 'Major League' clone that shamelessly rips every clichd idea from that film whilst attempting to look all innocent by turning it into a college football flick.The plot is different of course but end of the day it still involves a coach and his assistant trying to muster together a half decent team which ultimately ends up being a bunch of misfits freaks girls and Scott Bakula. From there on we get all the regular sports clichs and predictable fluff such as the team losing all the time losing faith in their coach a soppy romance a rival team of assholes the resurgence of the team and one man behind the scenes taking joy in the teams failure and trying to amplify it.I think the problem with this film other than the fact its a lame clone is they simply haven't created any fun characters to follow or care about. As I've already said Bakula plays the same character he always does then you have a bloke who thinks he's a samurai warrior the nerdy guy with specs a huge Samoan guy an Aussie?! why would an Aussie be there? a black guy who can't catch a exmilitary obsessed bloke a female kicker and finally the hilarious comedian Sinbad...add sarcastic quips here. There are of course other faceless jock meathead players also.Hell to even make sure they copied every single aspect of 'Major League' they even have a lighthearted announcer for the games...and its Rob Schneider! oh the quality. I really shouldn't keep going on about the similarities but its impossible not too! just look at the films poster its identical in every way! unbelievable!.The only big change in this film is the team doesn't actually win any league or championship in the end they lose a load tie a game and their final game of the season they manage to beat the top team but that's it. They presumably still end up near the bottom of their group or league so we don't get the obligatory montage of wins when they turn their game around. What we do get is a sickly bit of crap when their coach goes into hospital of a suspected heart attack just in time for the final big game against the top team. We then get a vomit inducing scene where second in command Loggia tells the team to go and win it for the coach possibly his last wish on Earth. Personally I thought this was all a set up to get the team to play well or at least Loggia's character was exaggerating the illness and the coaches last words on purpose. Nope it was all for real the illness isn't as bad as suspected but the shitty clichd corny attempt at a rousing emotional scene was indeed for real.This really is a prime example of an early 90's straight to the videoshop piece of turd trying to leech off the success of another earlier franchise. There are literately no redeeming features anywhere I can think of its not funny its not cheeky or rude as suggested by the poster you have no interest in any characters even the game sequences aren't very good or exciting...its just poorly made trash that didn't need to be made.210".

	schema:reviewBody "A three hour film about death. It doesn't sound like much when you say it like that but trust me Meet Joe Black is an outstanding film and is without doubt one of the most underrated little gems I have ever seen. The film is beautiful in every regards the photography the sets the music and the performances especially the performances. The last time Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were on screen together it was the equally sublime Legends of the Fall here it is another sublime film and once again they are putting in some of their best work. The characters that they play Bill Parrish and Death bring out a fantastic chemistry between the two performers especially in the more comedic moments when they two are getting to know each other. However while death is the main theme of the film director Martin Brest remembers to filter optimism into his wonderful tale in the shape of a love story between Parrish's daughter played by the beautiful Claire Forlani and Death himself. This results in one of the most gorgeous coupling in recent years as well as one of the most erotically intense love scenes I have ever watched.Director Brest presents the film in a more artistically filtered view than most other directors might have done. The love scene is done without nudity with close ups on the actors throughout. The striking presentation of the lighting in the film is also fantastic with a lovely golden glow pouring of the screen and lastly Thomas Newman's music is quite simply marvelous. Films like The Green Mile The Shawshank Redemption and American Beauty which have featured music by this outstanding composer have been enhanced by the haunting lyrical and moving melodies he has composed and this film is no exception. The mixture of piano and orchestra builds to an uplifting and emotional pull that cements his position as one of the best music composers working in modern film today.The three hour running time would appears to be problematic but alas it is not. In fact like another sweeping romantic epic Titanic you will not feel the time going in. The three hours fly by and not only that like the Oscar winning epic this is a film that makes one instantly want to rewatch it again and again. Meet Joe Black is a wonderful mixture of comedy romance and drama and is done exceedingly well. Brad Pitt puts in one of his finest performances as Death finds himself enchanted by human emotions and then finds himself making a deeply human choice at the end of the film and then there is Hopkins. One of cinema's finest actors no matter what he is in he shows with his complex range of emotions in his performance there is more to him  than playing Hannibal Lecter. His performance here restrained and quite frankly very well done. It is perhaps one of his best acting performances. His Shakespeare background obviously coming in handy for a film that contains many a Shakespearean like moment.The film while not a flop was not the box office hit that was expected especially considering the main casting but if you can make up your own mind do watch Meet Joe Black. This is a wonderful film and is a personal favorite of mine.".

Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves is it really all that bad?Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside but what it means what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter aka tossing the ball around with your kids aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.Brad Pitt is perfect absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love  if you are  good to want to be in love  if you are not already and good to be alive.See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.".

	schema:headline " A Minimalist Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere in the netherworld between being a remake and merely inspired by Mitchell Leisen's 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday Meet Joe Black is the story of Death personified. Death takes over the body of Brad Pitt's unnamed character later donned Joe Black by William Parrish Anthony Hopkins. Although the motivation isn't specified but implied in this film Death wishes to experience the life he normally takes awayhe wants to see what it's like to be human. He chooses Parrish to be his guide because Parrish is a hugely successful media mogul who has conviction strong moral fiber and insight on life. Compounding the situation Parrish's daughter Susan Claire Forlani is a woman whom Brad Pitt's unnamed character met in a coffee shop that morning and had an instant mutual attraction with. Black sticks close by William's side through much of the film creating difficult situations at a time when Parrish's company is trying to deal with a financially attractive but ethically unsavory takeover bid and he also puts the boil to somewhat strained familial relationships.First a word of warning. This is a very long film 3 hours and it tends to be very slowly paced. If you are averse to either or if you do not like any of the three principalsPitt Hopkins and ForlaniI'd advise you to avoid the film.For me I never think that a film's length is a problem in itself. As long as the film works I'd be happy with it lasting 4 5 even 12 hours or moreheck I even gladly sat through Gettysburg 1993 in the theater. There have been films I've thought were too long such as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane 1962 but it's contextual not related to actual running time.Helmer Martin Brest directs with a lot of deliberation. Lines of dialogue and responses are stretched out to infinity and taken to the depth of forever. The camera gives us lots of lingering gazes. There is little to no action in the film. Much of it is similar to David Lynch's famed pregnant pauses. Some people hate that style. I love it although I love other styles tooI like variety and for me the pacing makes this film seem much shorter than its actual running time. It's the complete opposite of the pacing of say Medallion 2003 which is interesting given that both films feature Forlani. It's also interesting to note that Brest's career seems to match the pacing of Meet Joe Black. He's taken 2 4 5 and 6 years between films. Obviously Brest is not in a rush.If you watch Meet Joe Black immediately after watching Death Takes a Holiday as I did this time around a few things might strike you as odd and slightly negative at first. The principal difference that had this initial effect on me was the change in the primary romantic relationshipbetween Joe and Susan and between Prince Sirki Frederic March and Grazia Evelyn Venable in the original. In the original it's ambiguous whether Grazia doesn't recognize Sirki for what he really is all along. She at least never meets him as Sirki rather than DeathasSirki. It creates interesting philosophical scenarios about humankind's conception and fear of death Grazia who is a bit aloof all along may be embracing death rather than fearing it not as something negative but more metaphysically as inherent in the idea of life.In Meet Joe Black Susan falls for Pitt as another character first. It removes all of the philosophical points about one's attitude towards death with the exception of William who is the only one who knows the truth even in the end and who implicitly goes through vacillating feelings about death. However despite my initial hesitation on the change I tried to remember my commitment to judge each film on its own terms rather than its relation to other works and I realized that the relationship set up here is interesting for another reasonit explores public identity in relationships and the tensions that arise through dynamicism of that public identity. That's a theme throughout the film not just in its romantic relationships.Pitt has often been criticized for his performance here but in my opinion it's perfect for the charactersjust as good in its own way as March's turn as Sirki in the original. Once Pitt as Death takes over Joe Black's body he must change his persona in the way he does. He's supposed to be a supernatural being who normally relates to the world in a completely different way but now he's suddenly made corporeal. He doesn't know what to do as a human. As an entity he's not daft lacking power or unknowledgeable about many things but he's incredibly nave and awkward as a thing of flesh. He's not used to relating to the world in that way. He's not used to making facial expressions. He's never tasted food and so on. The change he undergoes in the beginning and end of the film is amazing and shows just how skilled Pitt is.Hopkins and Forlani are of course no slouches either. Hopkins' ability to go from understated and elegant to manic is put to good use the role seems tailormade for him. Forlani who has a very unusual but intriguingly beautiful face that always looks a bit pouty gets to pout even more creating a bizarrely complex but effective character. The rest of the primary cast is just as good. The end result is a strangely dysfunctional family with a lot of depth.While I can see people preferring Death Takes a Holiday to this film for me Meet Joe Black is slightly better. It's much more epic of course and that scope plus the incredible score by Thomas Newman pushes its emotional effectiveness up a notch. But make sure you do not miss either film. Both are excellent and unusual.".

	onyx:emotionText "Somewhere in the netherworld between being a remake and merely inspired by Mitchell Leisen's 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday Meet Joe Black is the story of Death personified. Death takes over the body of Brad Pitt's unnamed character later donned Joe Black by William Parrish Anthony Hopkins. Although the motivation isn't specified but implied in this film Death wishes to experience the life he normally takes awayhe wants to see what it's like to be human. He chooses Parrish to be his guide because Parrish is a hugely successful media mogul who has conviction strong moral fiber and insight on life. Compounding the situation Parrish's daughter Susan Claire Forlani is a woman whom Brad Pitt's unnamed character met in a coffee shop that morning and had an instant mutual attraction with. Black sticks close by William's side through much of the film creating difficult situations at a time when Parrish's company is trying to deal with a financially attractive but ethically unsavory takeover bid and he also puts the boil to somewhat strained familial relationships.First a word of warning. This is a very long film 3 hours and it tends to be very slowly paced. If you are averse to either or if you do not like any of the three principalsPitt Hopkins and ForlaniI'd advise you to avoid the film.For me I never think that a film's length is a problem in itself. As long as the film works I'd be happy with it lasting 4 5 even 12 hours or moreheck I even gladly sat through Gettysburg 1993 in the theater. There have been films I've thought were too long such as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane 1962 but it's contextual not related to actual running time.Helmer Martin Brest directs with a lot of deliberation. Lines of dialogue and responses are stretched out to infinity and taken to the depth of forever. The camera gives us lots of lingering gazes. There is little to no action in the film. Much of it is similar to David Lynch's famed pregnant pauses. Some people hate that style. I love it although I love other styles tooI like variety and for me the pacing makes this film seem much shorter than its actual running time. It's the complete opposite of the pacing of say Medallion 2003 which is interesting given that both films feature Forlani. It's also interesting to note that Brest's career seems to match the pacing of Meet Joe Black. He's taken 2 4 5 and 6 years between films. Obviously Brest is not in a rush.If you watch Meet Joe Black immediately after watching Death Takes a Holiday as I did this time around a few things might strike you as odd and slightly negative at first. The principal difference that had this initial effect on me was the change in the primary romantic relationshipbetween Joe and Susan and between Prince Sirki Frederic March and Grazia Evelyn Venable in the original. In the original it's ambiguous whether Grazia doesn't recognize Sirki for what he really is all along. She at least never meets him as Sirki rather than DeathasSirki. It creates interesting philosophical scenarios about humankind's conception and fear of death Grazia who is a bit aloof all along may be embracing death rather than fearing it not as something negative but more metaphysically as inherent in the idea of life.In Meet Joe Black Susan falls for Pitt as another character first. It removes all of the philosophical points about one's attitude towards death with the exception of William who is the only one who knows the truth even in the end and who implicitly goes through vacillating feelings about death. However despite my initial hesitation on the change I tried to remember my commitment to judge each film on its own terms rather than its relation to other works and I realized that the relationship set up here is interesting for another reasonit explores public identity in relationships and the tensions that arise through dynamicism of that public identity. That's a theme throughout the film not just in its romantic relationships.Pitt has often been criticized for his performance here but in my opinion it's perfect for the charactersjust as good in its own way as March's turn as Sirki in the original. Once Pitt as Death takes over Joe Black's body he must change his persona in the way he does. He's supposed to be a supernatural being who normally relates to the world in a completely different way but now he's suddenly made corporeal. He doesn't know what to do as a human. As an entity he's not daft lacking power or unknowledgeable about many things but he's incredibly nave and awkward as a thing of flesh. He's not used to relating to the world in that way. He's not used to making facial expressions. He's never tasted food and so on. The change he undergoes in the beginning and end of the film is amazing and shows just how skilled Pitt is.Hopkins and Forlani are of course no slouches either. Hopkins' ability to go from understated and elegant to manic is put to good use the role seems tailormade for him. Forlani who has a very unusual but intriguingly beautiful face that always looks a bit pouty gets to pout even more creating a bizarrely complex but effective character. The rest of the primary cast is just as good. The end result is a strangely dysfunctional family with a lot of depth.While I can see people preferring Death Takes a Holiday to this film for me Meet Joe Black is slightly better. It's much more epic of course and that scope plus the incredible score by Thomas Newman pushes its emotional effectiveness up a notch. But make sure you do not miss either film. Both are excellent and unusual.";

There's something about the unique persona he brings upon any character he plays in a movie as if he leaves part of himself behind on the film reel each time. From psychological thrillers like The Silence of the Lambs to emotional dramas he also strikes me as a modest man and is in my eyes a true genius!Meet Joe Black is a strange tale that challenges our preconceptions of death. You come out of the film not so much enlightened but convinced that Bill Parrish is happy with the fate that comes upon him and that everyone else is too. It's immensely sad yet happy at the same time and thoughtprovoking. It is also a very long movie which I believe strengthens it as you feel you have a bond with the main characters having known them for a long time and thus share the highs and the lows emotionally throughout the plot. Providing you can stick to the 3hour film length it will truly be one of the most memorable films you'll ever watch. Excellent!".

But Meet Joe Black is anything but superficial and teen comedy does not describe this movie at all.Set in contemporary New York the film follows a wealthy family whose patriarchal sixtyfive year old head played by Anthony Hopkins is nearing the end of his life. Enter Joe Black Brad Pitt a handsome but enigmatic young man with an unusual agenda.This is a thoughtprovoking movie about mortality and emotional separation. It will appeal to viewers with a reflective and philosophical nature. But the film also has humor which keeps it from being grim. The pace is slow. There's lots of silence and stillness entirely appropriate given the subject matter. Among other things the film presents the novel idea that a supernatural being can be subject to human emotions and can make mistakes in judgment resulting from those emotions.The film is not perfect. The plot is a tad egocentric. There's no reference to the universality and ongoing occurrence of death outside the confines of this family. Also why now? Why does death choose to engage life in our present world why not five hundred years ago? Minor script changes could have addressed these issues. The initial meeting between Susan Claire Forlani and Joe Black seems a little too convenient but forms the basis for a plot twist that strengthens the overall story.The acting is excellent. Anthony Hopkins is as usual outstanding. I would not have cast Brad Pitt in the role he plays but he does a good job. Appropriate for this movie the acting style for both Pitt and Forlani is one wherein they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes which as taught by ancient philosophers are the windows of the soul.For viewers who liked The Sixth Sense another serious film with depth of meaning I recommend Meet Joe Black most highly.".

A bit deep for your kids I guess I tried watching it with my niece but she ruined it slightly by everlasting flow of questions.I'm giving it a 1010 for it being emotional and funny at times.

Surely you can express your opinion about a film without maligning the intelligence of those who don't share it.I saw Meet Joe Black in the theater when it came out which was a grave error. By the last third of the movie I was literally banging my head on the back of the chair in frustration. I came close to walking out but damn me I had to see how it all turned out. At this point that wasn't even worth the time really because I can look back and say with certainty who cares!. If I were Anthony Hopkins I would have told Death to kill me now rather than living the rest of my life if it was going to be so excruciatingly dull! Please note that when I say that the best part is when Brad Pitt gets run over with the car and thrown through the air it's not because I want more action in a film. Action films are by far not my favorite genre. I'll take character development over explosions any day. It's simply because the ridiculousness of that moment sums up the whole futile effort that is this film! That moment actually made me laugh and not because I'm cold hearted  I've cried at many a film  but simply because like everything else in this film it was badly done and elicited the opposite effect that it was attempting to achieve. My dislike of the movie had nothing to do with my ability to grasp it's subtlety. It was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Actors staring at each other with cow eyes and waiting a minute between ever line of dialogue doesn't make that dialogue any more meaningful just spectacularly boring.As other reviewers have noted excising these excruciating pregnant pauses from many of the scenes might have made the film more tolerable. I definitely wish I had a fast forward button. If I had it to do all over again I would have just walked out and rented it later to watch the end and not wasted another second of my life. One other reviewer asked what else could we have been doing with our time. It's not what one does with one's time it's whether one enjoys it or not or actually does something productive. The three hours I wasted on Meet Joe Black were neither enjoyable nor productive. Maybe your time isn't precious to you but mine is to me and at the very least I could have been watching a better movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was not at all surprised to see four writers on the credits for this film as it is such an inconstant mishmash of one illdefined character after another. There was no way only one thinking person wrote this film. The film moves ponderously from one glacially paced scene after another. I saw this movie at 800 in the evening and by 900 my son had to shake me because I was snoring in the theater. I don't recall ever falling asleep during a movie before but Meet Joe Black did it to me. It is hard to say how long I was out for. The same scene I was watching when I lost consciousness was still on when I was awakened. In this film that could mean I was out for a second or two or for 10 minutes. The scenes just go on and on and on with not much of anything being said.My wife was crying through the whole picture and was deeply moved by the whole affair. When I asked her why she said the truths of the movie touched her. To save you from three hours of trite tediousness I present those truths to you now 1. Families should love one another 2 don't marry unless you are in love and 3 good people don't have to fear death. I would add to this list 1 You can fall in love with someone if he looks like Brad Pitt even though his personality changes repeatedly and you have no idea who he is 2 death does not know what peanut butter is but can slip in and out of a Jamaican riff at the drop of a hat and 3 overly contrived plotting is not the dead art we all hoped it would be by now.Now before I start hearing the obvious This guy just hates Brad Pitt' remarks you should know that I am the Brad Pitt fan in my house. I think Brad is a wonderful actor but he is so wasted in this drivel. Likewise Anthony Hopkins has nowhere to go with this script. Is he the harddriven businessman with a lust for life so great that he attracts the attention of death itself or is he the guy wasting away his few remaining hours on this planet playing solitaire? Is he the shrewd businessman who is in constant control of every situation fast thinking and powerful or is he a guy who stands there with a dumb dull look on his face when questioned about the mysterious Joe Black letting his company slip through his fingers? One minute he is calm and collected in his dealings with death the next he explodes saying he's fed up the next he's calm again and back and forth. Hopkins is a wonderful actor unfortunately this script asked him to play three or four different roles as the same character.My son is a good boy and a wonderful son. however if he were a great son he would have let me sleep through the rest of this film. I can tell it's getting close to Thanksgiving the turkey just arrived.".

How do you honestly answer a question you aren't supposed to yet answer the question honestly? This movie is full of nuances of such dialogue exchanges which contain a superficial yet profound undertone throughout.I also like the presence Anthony Hopkins Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani bring to the screen and the complementary performances that resemble a finelytuned symphony. The storyline dialogue and character development is beautifully crafted through a remarkable script  and very fine acting. The musical score is also well done in this film and is a true delight to hear.".

So for reasons unknown he has the time and ability to find out. Pitt is handsome and charming as a doomed young man in a coffee shop and handsome boring and charmless as Death. Hopkins can do great work even in a flawed film. Forlani is believable and beautiful despite looking as though she is about to fall asleep every five to ten minutes. Not a good quality for a character in a nearly three hour movie. Harden and Tambor both wonderful talents long before Larry Sanders existed do some topquality film work. The message seems to be that family is most important lots and lots of money is really good and that death and taxes are still inevitable. I think they also ask the cinematic question Just how long can we get away with keeping the camera focused on a wellgroomed Brad Pitt in total silence?".

	schema:reviewBody "Preamble  I started watching this movie on TV about 20 minutes in  just after the helicopter ride into NYC and I had no idea what I was watching or what to expect...but here goes...While I can understand where people might like this movie because of the whole death dealing with life angle and whatever else people can pull from this three hour waste of time there are several things that make absolutely NO SENSE and require the viewer to abandon any sense of logic which for me totally destroys this movie.1 After what'shername meets that incredibly charming young man in the coffee shop they go their separate ways. While they each take turns looking back at each other that charming young man gets plowed into by several cars an accident he cannot possibly have survived. This totally rules out the chance of him meeting what'shername in the hospital. Next scene is Hopkins hearing and talking to some strange voice. That voice turns out to be the voice of Death who takes the form of that charming young man from the coffee shop!!! Turns out Death needed a body and took the poor soul from the car accident  without a bruise scrape or injury of any kind. Which makes me ask what the hell? Where did he get this body? What happened to the original body that no doubt would have been picked up by the coroner and locked up in a morgue? Is that body still there? Or is it merely a facsimile of the body which makes me ask where and at what time was this copy made? Pray to God that Death doesn't happen to run into the poor guy's friends or family.2 Death then gets to have dinner with Hopkins and meets his family and in walks what'shername. Death is NOTHING like the charming young man in the coffee shop and is actually kind of annoying. Yet what'shername manages to fall in love with him. How?!? Based on WHAT exactly?!?! It certainly isn't his charming demeanor  which leads me to conclude that it can only be pure lust.3 When it's finally time for Death to take Hopkins they walk over a bridge and Death is replaced by the charming guy from the coffee shop who simply snaps out of it somehow and is back to his old self. What'shername runs over and seems to understand that her father is gone. So. Question 1  what happens to Hopkins' body? Question 2  how on earth do you explain the fact that this guy comes back to life? And how does what'shername explain and deal with the apparently massive personality disorder this guy must have since the guy she fell in love with Death is in NO WAY like the guy from the coffee shop before the accident and after he gets resurrected? Awful movie. Terrible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a little hesitant to watch this movie seeing as how it was 3 hours long but I decided to give it a try. As I sort of expected much of the first part was fairly slow moving and a bit boring. But if you stick with MEET JOE BLACK it gets a little more exciting and you'll find the story a bit more interesting.William Parrish Anthony Hopkins is a very successful businessman who has raised a good family had a good career and has lead a good life. Then one day Death Brad Pitt comes to William and offers him more time to be alive in exchange for Parrish showing him around life. Death using the name Joe Black really starts to enjoy life and fall in love with Parrish's daughter Susan Claire Forlani. When this happens he considers changing the rules of life  death.The plot is very original and fairly interesting. I think it would have been a little less boring if there wasn't a dramatic pause between every sentence. The beginning of this movie is actually pretty good but the rest of the first half tends to drag a bit. The second half still has similar flaws but because the characters have been set and the plot really starts to threaten it is a lot more interesting. I had mixed feelings for the ending. I thought it was OK but it could have been a little better. The ending was kind of predictable but not especially since it was hard to tell where they were going with it. Half of the movie is predictable and half of it wasn't.The acting was superb in this movie as expected with a veteran like Anthony Hopkins and a newer but talented face like Brad Pitt. Hopkins in my humble opinion stole the show right out from under Pitt who I think was meant to be the showcase. Claire Forlani did pretty well as the adorable girlfriend of Pitt and I thought the Jamaican Lady played by Lois KellyMiller and was both funny and noble. I loved the scenes between her and Pitt and I thought Pitt was very funny speaking a Jamaican accent.The character development in this movie was pretty good. It was pretty cool to see the Grim Reaper himself Joe BlackDeath have feelings and curiosity about life let alone fall in love with someone. You can relate to Parrish even though he plays an old fart because he knows that his death is coming and he is naturally trying to tie up loose knots. You would do this too if Death came to you and said Hey you're gonna die in a week. So how 'bout them Yankees? Both of Parrish's daughters represent two stereotype daughters. One was the older favorite daughter who is struggling with her feelings about love. The other is the younger daughter who is jealous of her older sister but is married. Again I loved the Jamaican Lady but I don't think I would have if it weren't for Pitt's excellent dialogue with her.If you don't like long movies you'd better stay away from this one. If you're a Pitt fan you'll love it because he is everywhere on this film. I'd still say this is one great film and that you should check it out but not if you have a bad attention span.".

If I ever earn the esteemed privilege of having one of my screenplays made into a movie someone PLEASE kill me if it turns out anything like Dramatic Long Pause. Its script was not penned by one or two but FOUR count em FOUR individuals. All of whom seemed to be oblivious to the concept of interesting dialogue.

The character development is virtually nonexistent with Joe Black Brad Pitt undergoing more personality changes than you can count the plot itself is melodramatic to the point of farce including an excruciatingly embarrassing scene where Brad Pitt puts on a poor Jamaican accent to talk to a dying old lady and the music so tedious that you will be wanting to scream by the time the credits roll.

	schema:reviewBody "Media magnate William Parrish is approaching his 65th birthday.  While dealing with his business problems he advises his youngest daughter Susan that she must find true love.  She meets a young man in a coffee shop and falls for his charms but leaves without him.  When the young man is hit by a bus and killed Death decides to use his body to visit earth.  He postpones the death of Parrish in return for experiencing life.  However his influence causes an impact on Parrish's business and on his daughter.This is a rework of 1934's Death Takes a Holiday'  four writers worked tirelessly to take that short charmer and spin it into a ponderous three hour slog.  The story is simple enough  Death comes to earth falls in love makes friends is a fish out of water but must eventually go back'  however it's seriously stretched and delivered in very slow chunks.  The various strands the business confrontation the romance etc don't sit well together and it's like the writers all took turns rather than working together.  At the start it is quite charming but the longer it goes on the less you care and the less charming it becomes.Why did it have to be so long?  There are so many elements of the story that could have been trimmed down.  So many scenes could have been told in a shorter time or removed totally.  It feels like nothing they shot ended up on the cutting room floor.  For example Pitt shares several scenes total about 10 minutes with an elderly Jamaican woman these scenes don't add anything to the film more than that they are terrible  Pitt does a horrible horrible patwa accent.  Surely the editor should have removed these on quality alone!If this had been good then it wouldn't matter if it was so long  but there's only enough to last for 2 hours at most.  That's 60 minutes worth of filler that could have been lost.  The performances are mixed but are mainly as heavy and unwieldy as the film itself.  Pitt starts well  his human' role is really charming and I thought that he was already Death and thought he'd be that way for the whole film.  However when he becomes death he is totally flat and lifeless  obviously that's how Death would be but it makes him really dull and wastes the charm that has made him a star.  His Jamaican accent is absolutely terrible and just shows he has no judgement. Forlani holds her own well beside an experienced cast but the romance between her and death is unbelievable due to Pitt's stony performance. Hopkins is good throughout and shows Pitt up to be a star rather than an actor.  The support is mostly good  but that old Jamaican lady has got to go!The film is far too long  at one point I thought it was winding up and that the end must be 10 minutes away  it was winding up and did what I thought it would but instead of 10 minutes it took 45!  Such luxurious running times should only be permitted to films that can sustain them.Overall this could have been a charming little film.  Instead it buries that charm in a three hour running time that it can't sustain.  I liked it but I wished it would end after the first 120 minutes.  Somewhere out there  it is still going!".

	schema:headline " Not quite enough to be enough";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sleeping Dictionary should be noted mostly for being the biggest missed opportunity of shooting star Jessica Alba. This film was her only film project between the first and second seasons of Dark Angel' the show that turned her into a sensation but quickly died a network death at the end of season 2 and thus ending the heat index on the lovely Miss Alba. The tragedy is this film a good showcase of her and her abilities rather than just her was inexplicably delayed pushed off and kept from theater screens only to be released directto video far too long after her star dimmed.As with any product here you can get the synopsis elsewhere so don't look for it here.  I'll try not to spoil anything but take note if you read this then watch the movie you may get tipped off as to what I'm vaguely referencing.  If that bothers you come back after you watch!This is a film that had a good idea and good execution of what the idea turned into. Unfortunately a little bit more planning would have helped. At 109 minutes this film won't bore you but it could have been rightfully intriguing with 2030 minutes of good plot added.The film is carried on the sound filmmaking and charm of it's actors. In particular Alba is enchanting. She plays the part with the seriousness it was intended and never lets her intentionally accented English fall into 'stupid foreigner' stereotype a tough job for many young actors and actresses who have attempted the same. Her partner Hugh Dancy is good enough. He channels a little bit like a scrawny Heath Ledger but never quite gets rugged enough.The other joy of the cast is the everunderrated Bob Hoskins. By coincidence I saw 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' just hours before watching 'Sleeping Dictionary' and am never let down by his appearances in films. He plays a character who isn't written subtly enough still he acts it. The endless looks of Damn bloody fool. Good for him the wer scattered through the film isn't enough for a man of his caliber but we'll take what we can get.Their performances are weaved together well by WriterDirector Guy Jenkin who is making his big screen debut as a director though his writing career goes back to the late '70's without much acclaim. Directingwise he knows what he is doing. The camera work is graceful and beautiful and he compliments the fantastic elements of the story well. As a writer well there are things left to be desired.Most of all this film seems too short. The story is predictable but it never drags. The love scenes are contrived as is the underdeveloped climax but that's not where the film is weak. The characters are cleverly set up to be mirrors and the overlapping triangles are so complex they rival those brainteasers that ask 'how many triangles are in this picture?' The problem is the most important one is never realized because of the lack of development between Dancy and his best friend within the tribe. Without much difficulty and a little more time that relationship alone would have lifted this film from not quite enough to a good if not better movie.As a result you're left with a film that doesn't challenge anything because it just challenges the same old things. But it is romantic and has much more spark than many other movies you may see of this type. For that and a young actress who has way too much fire to just disappear at this point of her career this film is worth seeing.".

At 109 minutes this film won't bore you but it could have been rightfully intriguing with 2030 minutes of good plot added.The film is carried on the sound filmmaking and charm of it's actors. In particular Alba is enchanting. She plays the part with the seriousness it was intended and never lets her intentionally accented English fall into 'stupid foreigner' stereotype a tough job for many young actors and actresses who have attempted the same. Her partner Hugh Dancy is good enough. He channels a little bit like a scrawny Heath Ledger but never quite gets rugged enough.The other joy of the cast is the everunderrated Bob Hoskins. By coincidence I saw 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' just hours before watching 'Sleeping Dictionary' and am never let down by his appearances in films. He plays a character who isn't written subtly enough still he acts it. The endless looks of Damn bloody fool. Good for him the wer scattered through the film isn't enough for a man of his caliber but we'll take what we can get.Their performances are weaved together well by WriterDirector Guy Jenkin who is making his big screen debut as a director though his writing career goes back to the late '70's without much acclaim. Directingwise he knows what he is doing. The camera work is graceful and beautiful and he compliments the fantastic elements of the story well. As a writer well there are things left to be desired.Most of all this film seems too short. The story is predictable but it never drags. The love scenes are contrived as is the underdeveloped climax but that's not where the film is weak. The characters are cleverly set up to be mirrors and the overlapping triangles are so complex they rival those brainteasers that ask 'how many triangles are in this picture?' The problem is the most important one is never realized because of the lack of development between Dancy and his best friend within the tribe. Without much difficulty and a little more time that relationship alone would have lifted this film from not quite enough to a good if not better movie.As a result you're left with a film that doesn't challenge anything because it just challenges the same old things. But it is romantic and has much more spark than many other movies you may see of this type. For that and a young actress who has way too much fire to just disappear at this point of her career this film is worth seeing.";

It would have been far better for Cecil to push a reluctant Truscutt away.Still these plot issues are relatively small in comparison to a film cast and cinematography that rose well above the small budget and unheralded distribution.

While that may sound as contrived a plot as you could find it is probably grounded in fact and certainly grounded in solid British upper class hypocrisy of that day which taking into account the fact that he'll be there for three years sees no reason why he can't avail himself of the local talent to satisfy his sexual needs.  In fact when he initially rejects the beautiful Jessica Alba they offer him a young man he being the product of British boys schools and all that.After a very brief period of conflict Dancey and Alba fall head over heels for each other decide they want to marry and find themselves in hot water from that point on.  The film goes on to rightfully bash British upper class racial prejudice but never quite deals with the key issue facing Dancey's character.  Does he ever catch on that the education he wanted to bring to the natives is the same education that says one Englishman is worth a thousand natives?Anyway the film written and directed by Guy Jenkin is fairly well scripted well directed and absolutely beautifully shot.  Word is it cost just 15 million but it has the look of a much more expensive picture definitely not some cut rate direct to video thriller.  This is not some prison women in cages film shot in the Philippines.There are some good characterizations here.  Bob Hoskins starts out very strong as the cynical governor of this province but then is very under utilized.  Brenda Blethyn is fantasic as Hoskins wife a manipulative upper class snob who is the real villain of the story.But there are script problems here.  Dancey and Alba fall in love far too quickly skipping over a lot of character build up which would have made us care for them a lot more than we wind up doing.  There is sympathy for them though because of the obvious class and racial biases in the British empire. But you get the feeling there are a lot of missed opportunities here.Perhaps the biggest flaw the film has are its two stars though. Danceypretty much unknown in America seems only adequate to me. He brings no real passion to the role of the young idealist.The real enigma of course is Jessica Alba.  Although as beautiful as any young actress in Hollywood today she has yet to prove that she can actually act and with every successive missed opportunity she is building up a body of work that says maybe she can't. Her first feature staring role was in a flic called Paranoid in which she was frankly just plain dreadful. She has had supporting roles in a couple of other films but the pictures were so dreadful you couldn't hang much of the blame on her except maybe in her choice of roles.  Her big break came in the James Cameron produced TV series Dark Angel which got its wings clipped after two seasons.  In it Abla was forced to play a rather depressing character in a depressing show and she could not get deep enough into it to make it the kind of hit that Jennifer Garner became in Alias.In Sleeping Dictionary Alba definitely looks like someone any man would want to sleep with but other than that seems in many ways miscast completely.  I read one review here that mistakenly places this movie in South America.  I wonder if the producers made the same mistake.  The days when any dark skinned actress can play any dark skinned character from Latino to Asian to Arabic appear to be over to me.  Alba didn't seem like a resident of Borneo.  She in many ways seemed like a wise ass girl from East Los Angeles.Then there's the main problem her delivery of lines.  Alba is excellent when she keeps her mouth shut.  No really she does reaction shots extremely well.  Her emotions play out beautifully on her face.  It's when she has to talk that she often finds herself in trouble.  In this film much of her delivery of her lines was just short of bad.More importantly it wasn't good and that makes this film another big missed chance for Jessica Alba.  It's too bad because she was in part hampered by an under developed character which may have been hampered by a restricted budget.  Ten more minutes showing us who the main characters really were might have made all the difference in this film. But Alba still would have had to be good enough to handle the added material and I still don't know if she is.She supposedly has another film in the works in which she plays some kind of hiphop dancer.  Hopefully at least playing the right race she'll shine. But she just misses the mark for me in Sleeping Dictionary as she has missed it in everything she's done since Flipper.".

The days when any dark skinned actress can play any dark skinned character from Latino to Asian to Arabic appear to be over to me.  Alba didn't seem like a resident of Borneo.  She in many ways seemed like a wise ass girl from East Los Angeles.Then there's the main problem her delivery of lines.  Alba is excellent when she keeps her mouth shut.  No really she does reaction shots extremely well.  Her emotions play out beautifully on her face.  It's when she has to talk that she often finds herself in trouble.  In this film much of her delivery of her lines was just short of bad.More importantly it wasn't good and that makes this film another big missed chance for Jessica Alba.  It's too bad because she was in part hampered by an under developed character which may have been hampered by a restricted budget.  Ten more minutes showing us who the main characters really were might have made all the difference in this film. But Alba still would have had to be good enough to handle the added material and I still don't know if she is.She supposedly has another film in the works in which she plays some kind of hiphop dancer.  Hopefully at least playing the right race she'll shine. But she just misses the mark for me in Sleeping Dictionary as she has missed it in everything she's done since Flipper.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEADFirst of all I really liked the general concept of this film. The idea of a young Englishmen falling in love with a native girl from a British colony surely isn't that original but it hasn't been overused either.Furthermore I hoped to get a glimpse of the life in British colonies at that time especially the social interacting between the British colonial rulers and the native people and of course Jessica Alba.Well for those primarily interested in the latter one Yes her character has nude scenes but no they obviously aren't performed by Jessica Alba. Speaking of that In my opinion the body double did not even fit Jessica's size they could have done a lot better at this point.As I stated initially I really liked this films premise but the execution comes close to the worst you could have made out of it.First of all The movie is fractioned. While this doesn't has to be necessarily bad each fraction gets it's own little climax whilst there's nowhere a main climax on sight. Even that could work if those little climax' would do their job unfortunately they don't. That's mainly because the film doesn't spend the time to develop them instead it rushes to get a climax done in order to start another one. For example John's I don't want to have sex unmarrieddance at the very beginning lasted maybe 5 minutes and was resolved by pure horniness their trip to the dying jungle people oh look it's because of the poison let's tell them and go home the matter of John's first departure from Sarawak his relation to his wife the attempted murder and death trial afterwards Henry's relation to Selima and so on and so on. Everything seemed flat rushed and undeveloped. For no obvious they made a plotdriven film out of a peoplestory. That can't work out. The ending concludes this greatly you virtually could hear the director's thoughts Oh well we've 2 minutes and some budget left. Let's bring in the bad guy with a gun.On the proside the nativeEnglishmen relations are done quiet nicely and not every character is stereotypical I especially enjoyed the role of Cecil for that matter. The cinematography could've been worse but never reached the potential it doubtlessly had. I'd rank Simon Boswell's score slightly but definitely above average. Speaking of Jessica Alba's performance well Her role consists mainly of walking around and looking pretty she did that without getting injured and if you've seen her in Idle Hands that's worth something.At the end I saw a movie whose creators couldn't fill the very solid plot with life. That's particularly sad since I'd could've been a great film.".

Things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets compounded by her culture his soap opera domestic situation and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film.So yes the movie has some major flaws but on the other hand it delivered exactly the two things I rented it for in the first place a beautifully photographed exotic location and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping dictionary Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right. She's not a great actress and doesn't quite pass for Malaysian and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity but who cares? Jessica Alba has that rare face and figure that's more than just sexy but also beautiful in the way that a Vivaldi violin concerto or a Rembrandt painting is.P.S.

The new bright eyed and bushy tailed new English wouldbe colonial future governor refuses to sleep with native language tutor Jessica Alba even when she says she has been allocated to sleep with him. OK religious beliefs can be strong but could any religious belief be THAT strong?

The new bright eyed and bushy tailed new English wouldbe colonial future governor refuses to sleep with native language tutor Jessica Alba even when she says she has been allocated to sleep with him. OK religious beliefs can be strong but could any religious belief be THAT strong? Eventually the resident English tribe in this part of 1938 Sarawak ship over a suitable English virgin for the young rookie to marry. Alas by then he has cast off his religious convictions and started shagging Jessica. But he still marries the virgin English rose and is shipped back to England for a year to get over his local passions. On his return both the women he has slept with are either pregnant or bringing up his baby with the help of another man. How does it all shake out? Well to find that out you'll have to watch it. 9 out of 10. A mark is lost because as we all know they weren't Jessica tits. I bet she has inverted nipples.";

I got the feeling throughout it was poorly written with uninteresting characters abound doing unexciting things... there was no sparkling dialogue and nothing to get me engaged with them whatsoever.

For instance the central pair fall in love at the drop of a hat after spending most of first part arguing. And what a vanilla pair they make. They're welcome to each other.Set in an old British territory just 2 years before the Second World War it's a lot more involving to admire the wonderful scenery and the costumes of the tribespeople than the dullasditchwater romance. Everything is predictable to the Nth degree... you could stop watching after 20 minutes and fill in the rest of the blanks yourself. In fact don't even bother doing that.

	schema:reviewBody "I LOVE this movie! This movie took me on a rollercoaster of emotions. It made me laugh and cry I really had a good cathartic cry towards the end. Jessica Alba is AMAZING as Selima she really shines! I found myself thinking about the characters long after the movie was over. There should be a sequel because the end leaves some unanswered questions lingering on my mind. This movie is a perfect romantic date movie just cuddle up on the loveseat with a big bowl of buttery popcorn  an ice cold drink...suspend your disbelief for the time being 'cause it's only a movie not the History Channel...and travel back in time to when England ruled the world. I really like the lush and exotic scenerybackground it really takes me away to a faraway jungletropical paradise. The movie brings up several issues I'm not going to discuss them all just a few. It makes one question exactly what defines savages indigenous peoples primitive locals. You can observe the welltodo proper EnglishmenEnglishwomen and compare their behavior to the uncivilized natives and see who behaves as a savage and who behaves as a member of the human race. How do we define what is or is not taboo? This movie really touches my heart...similar to Frances Hodgson Burnett's A Little Princess  The Secret Garden Alex Haley's Queen and Anna  the King.SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! PLEASE DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE!!!Another issue I truly enjoy masticating on is the issue of Selima and her relationship with held Cecilia. Cecilia was sent away to boarding school at the tender age of 5 years old. Her mother Aggie never came to see her not even on Christmas Scroogey isn't it?. Aggie was too concerned about her husband Henry and his love affair with his sleeping dictionary to worry about her own daughter. Cecilia did not have the time she felt cheated of to spend with her parents. Cecilia grew up to be quite an independent woman because of this. Selima on the other hand was right there in the same little village as Henry who lived in a great big home upstream uphill  reminiscent of Alex Haley's Queen and the big plantation house that Queen's biological father lived on. Even though she lived so close to him she was just as far away as Cecilia was in boarding school back in England. Selima's father told her mother his sleeping dictionary to tell little 4 year old Selima that he had gone back to England. She always remembered her dear old dad...eventually she figured out on her own.. Luke Skywalker...Darth Vader...I AM your father... OOOh..Aggie is a character I love to despise. She is truly a savage beneath her vapid visage. In the end Cecilia did what her mother could not do...let go. Sometimes you just have to L.I.G. it let it go like Ice Cube said on Next Friday. When you really love someone you can let them go. Unrequited love is no love at all and it is sometimes better to be alone than to be with someone who is in love with someone else. I do believe that Cecilia will be a better mother to her child than Aggie ever was towards Cecilia. Cecilia seems more focused on what truly should be her priorities than Aggie. So what if John runs off with the headhuntress she has her baby to live for. She deserves to have the same love and passion as Selima  John have for one another.".

The movie was beautifully shot and the music was in great taste. I had never heard of sleeping dictionaries so it was an interesting lesson. At first Jessica didn't seem to fit the look of the other natives but it made sense when she was mixed and I could see where her complexion played in. Her accent was surprisingly believable. Hugh was adorable as the sheepish leader of the community. It made all the sense in the world that they would fall for each other. I liked the angle of the British hypocrisy. It was alright to sleep with the people the ruled or civilized but not good enough to marry them or acknowledge the children they had with these people. It resonated with me because the same thing happened with slavery in America. I thought that angle was well played out. I do agree with some other users that they fell in love too quickly and they weren't together enough for the audience to see that dynamic. They spent far too much of the movie apart for it to be so dramatic and love at all costs type of love. It was weird that he left his wife who was pregnant for Selima but I guess Cecil knew he wouldn't be happy with their little family. I identified with her struggle to please her husband and hold onto him. Imagine that many wives of the colonialism era probably felt that way when their husbands desired not just another woman but a woman they felt was inferior. It was a great movie. Watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I admit that many romancethemed movies usually get to me. I saw City Of Angels back in 1998 and wept my head off at the corny ending at the end of that movie unfortunately. Since then I've found myself watching less romanced themed comedies or dramas and stuck with straight drama or action. As I surfed through the TV channels on a lazy night I passed through the Sundance Channel or IFC one of those two and saw Ms. Jessica Alba steaming it up with this blonde guy. I checked on the info to see what the movie was and it was The Sleeping Dictionary. Surprised as I was to see actual nudity which wasn't hers as I quickly found out it stuck on my mind. But it wasn't until just a month ago when I saw Ms. Jessica Alba in Sin City that I decided to give her other flicks a viewing. One of them flicks being this one.This is an okay movie. Not much plot is revealed throughout the course of the movie so it's unclear what exactly the movie is trying to say. My summary of the plot? A young Brit goes to teach a bunch of savages the ways of the Western World and falls head over heels for the accentbroken waytoohottobetrue Jessica Alba on the way. It doesn't get much complicated from there but it doesn't get any better either.As great as Jessica looks its her accent that kinda gets the best of me. Her East L.A. accent becomes Asian and she ALMOST pulls it off. Bob Hoskins and Brenda Blethyn are riots to watch! It's so good to see them on screen after having to watch mediocre scenes previous. Hugh Dancy the main character and Freddie Prinze lookalike does the meek and fishoutofwater act for almost the entire film and it STILL bothers me that this guy was able to score with Jessica.It's great to see all the physical work from Dark Angel pay off in this movie. Whenever Jessica is in almost practically nothing you can see those muscles on that body just ready to kick your ass. Okay enough about Jessica lets discuss this film.This movie tries to pull off the forbidden by tradition boundaries and kinda doesn't succeed. First of all was it EVER a tradition for the native women to sleep with the foreigners just to teach them the language? That's the main plot that baffles me. The plot goes off into other directions like the mining subplot and it just kills the mood of the film. I wish I could explain more but it would only spoil it.The only reason to see this film was to see Jessica's sex scenes. As steamy as they are it's only shown in the middle of the film and that's it! The forbidden by traditions subplot kicks in and the film's plot goes haywire from there. Everything to the abusive bad guy to the who'sbabyisitreally? subplot it's just hard to describe what the plot really is. BUT...that doesn't stop the film from being enjoyable in a way. I urge you to rent this film and watch it with a ladyfriend. You may not like it but it's a definite guarantee that she will. All in all I only recommend watching this flick ONLY if you are a Jessica Alba fan OR if you want to romance your loved one with a typical romance film this movie is great both ways.".

The plot goes off into other directions like the mining subplot and it just kills the mood of the film. I wish I could explain more but it would only spoil it.The only reason to see this film was to see Jessica's sex scenes. As steamy as they are it's only shown in the middle of the film and that's it! The forbidden by traditions subplot kicks in and the film's plot goes haywire from there. Everything to the abusive bad guy to the who'sbabyisitreally? subplot it's just hard to describe what the plot really is. BUT...that doesn't stop the film from being enjoyable in a way. I urge you to rent this film and watch it with a ladyfriend. You may not like it but it's a definite guarantee that she will. All in all I only recommend watching this flick ONLY if you are a Jessica Alba fan OR if you want to romance your loved one with a typical romance film this movie is great both ways.";

Their film was extremely well received in many countries save Italy where only the southern part of the country received it very openly while the north where they thought would have had the best reception was rather aloof and cold.I lived both in Italy and Spain and was always amazed at the different mentality of these two Latin countries when it comes to sexual issues the Spaniards are incredibly open spontaneous and free while the Italians clam up the moment you touch the subject.

	schema:reviewBody "If Fate would have it I would have the opportunity to go to Tokyo for this year's Japanese International Film Festival and watched this as the closing film. Initially I had mixed this up with Atonement also starring Keira Knightley in a period romance story except that this one had shades of The Last Samurai thrown in with the love triangle moments with the involvement of a Japanese girl.Based on the novel by Alessandro Baricco Silk takes its name from the Silk trade where a French village looks to having its economy hit if not for Alfred Monlina's Baldabiou who ventures into opening a silk mill and employing the townsfolk. However in need of untainted silkworm eggs free from an epidemic striking Europe he sends overseas one of his staff Herve Joncour Michael Pitt whom is indebted to him for arranging his marriage with Knightley's Helene and off he goes on the arduous journey first to Africa then to the land of the rising sun now in the impending stage of internal strife.The journeys are probably the best bits in the movie with lush landscapes filling the screen in all serenity of the turmoils that are yet to come. I thought director Francois Girard tried to ape Terence Mallick's direction with lush natural beauty punctuated with voice over narration of the character's innermost thoughts. We learn a lot of what's going on in Herve's mind as he tells us the story of his being and the conflict he faces when he gets tempted to committing adultery never forgetting about his tryst overseas when back home he has a lovely wife to go home to.While the movie has that central conflict that provides the fuel to propel the movie forward somehow it never gets utilized having the story and characters dance around on the sidelines of the issue never to take it head on. This adds to the frustration of watching the deliberations that they have made worse as the movie chooses to unfold itself extremely slowly taking too much of its own sweet time. Fans of Keira Knightley would have watched this movie solely to see her performance after the Pirates double bill but sadly even though she's given top billing her screen time is limited as the spotlight falls on Michael Pitt's Herve and we are told of this story through his eyes.What adds to the annoyance as well is that the movie is sans English subtitles. Having it set in France but the characters speaking in English is understandable after all Pitt is American and Knightley is English but having the Japanese speak in their native tongue and not providing the subtitles removes a layer that would have provided probably a deeper understanding of the movie. Yes granted we are supposed to feel the pain of Herve in his inability to connect with the people and the one he loves but I don't feel that this should be done at the expense of understanding especially for nonJapanese speaking folks.However despite its obvious flaws the movie redeems itself with a powerful end packing quite a punch especially when you think it's headed nowhere and probably into mediocrity. Suddenly you discover that things are again not always what they seem and wonder just who the bigger fool is. But the bottomline if there's a message to be taken away from this movie is again never to give in to temptation and truly treasure your loved ones. Tried and tested clichd but true.".

While the action actually bad choice of word takes place in two places the protagonist's home town in France and a village in Japan the journey in between is handled with brevity just something that needs to be covered but not dwelled on. What we have is a very intimate story of when happens to the protagonist in these two places or to make it even more intimate what happened in the MIND of the protagonist. I'll come back to this.The plot is actually quite simple. A somewhat undistinguished young man in a small town in 19th century France English is the proxy language for the movie falls in love and marries an attractive young woman. At the same time he becomes quite unintentionally a trader commissioned by a silk manufacturer to go to Japan to buy the best quality silkworm eggs to ensure that they will not be infected before hedging. Right away you can see the dramatic elements  risks of financial disaster political intrigues in Japan risks if personal safety. While all of these are used in the movie they are not what the movie is about.The story told entirely through voice over of the protagonist Herve is about an intimate emotional inside his mind. At the end we find that there is an actual audience who is however quite inconsequential to the story. Except for a livelihood that takes him away for a couple of month each year there seems nothing lacking in Herve's life. He has grown rich through the trade. His lovely wife Helene is understanding and loving. It is indeed a setback that they have not been able to have any children but they have learned to live with it. But then the journeys to Japan has given rise to something deeply disturbing an infatuation with a mysterious young woman that soon turns into an obsession an obsession to such an extent that it begins to gnaw his soul even when he is back home.Additional spoiler warning Many people have expressed dissatisfaction with the movie's apparent failure to explain many things about this mysterious woman in Japan. But towards the end of the movie it will gradually dawn on you that this movie have little to do with what happens in Japan and a lot to do with what happens back home. The one twist close to the end which can almost be described as a delightful surprise makes it all too clear. What we are dealing with the whole time is what happens in Herve's mind and there the mysterious Japanese woman could very well be a figment of his imagination.The vote seems unanimous that Michael Pitt who plays Herves is the weakest link. He sleepwalks and murmurs through the movie as if his is playing the main character of Dicken's last unfinished novel The mystery of Edwin Drood someone who is in an opium hallucination half the time. I appreciate that he is trying to portrayed Herves as imagined by the author of the book and screenwriter. But he has not been successful.The rest of the cast fortunately is redeeming. Keira Knightley does not seem too impressive until towards the end. Then you begin to see why she was selected for the role Helene who has more than meets the eyes. Alfred Molina adds more to the role of the trade manufacturer than it would suggest as he always does with any role he plays. Koji Yakusho probably the best known Japanese actor today to anyone who follows the Japanese cinema not Hollywood Japanese plays the nobleman who trades with Herves. A delightful surprise is seeing Miki Nakatani who played the young woman Hermes in Densha Otoko Train man 2005. In Silk she is the enchanting Madame Blanche who translates the Japanese letter for Herves.There are some fine cinematography in Silk in both the snowbound Japanese landscape and the hauntingly beautiful forest Herve's hometown.".

Admittedly the issue with the subtitles would have made the movie easier to understand. In the middle of the movie there is some confusion about what exactly has transpired between Pitt and his Japanese contact and why the initial interlude between Pitt and the Japanese concubine occurs in the first place but these don't seem to be so dear to the plot that you can't remain in the dark and still get the point of the movie.The landscape is breathtaking the acting was great by every member of the supporting cast. I like Michael Pitt but it seems like he can only play one character and it's the throaty sensitive guy. I was surprised that Keira Knightley took such a minor role but the punch at the end gives her character quite a bit of intrigue. As always she is wonderful and I liked Alfred Molina as well.The cinematography was good and understated. The script was simple and it didn't seem like they wasted any words. Quite the opposite in fact.I understand why others didn't like it but I get the impression that this is due to a lack of patience on their part.Good movie. Try it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Herve Joncour a young man in France fresh from the army receives a proposal he cannot refuse he must go to Japan to collect silk worms and bring them to France where the silk industry has been dying because of a plague that has affected them. Before he undertakes the trip to the East he marries the beautiful woman he loves Helene. Since the action takes place in the middle of the XIX century such an endeavor was not without its risks.When Herve gets to Japan he encounters an exotic place where he is made to go blindfolded to an unknown area searching for the worms. As he deals with the ruthless man that is key to selling the treasure to bring back he meets a mysterious woman who captures his imagination and gets the best of him. Since they don't exchange a word Herve's mind is full of her exotic beauty.He returns to France and becomes rich from the silk that is produced using the worms he has brought back. Helene has waited for him but her only regret is that she never conceives a child to make her complete. Herve has no problem adapting himself to the duplicity within his heart.On the second trip to Japan Herve receives a note from the woman that dominates his thoughts. Since it's written in Japanese characters he has no way of knowing what she meant. For that he must secure the help of a Madame of a house of ill repute in Lyons. The message when is read by the lady confounds him completely. What is he to make out of the strange message? Something happened to Alessandro Baricco's novel Silk on the way to the movies. The novel one of the best narratives by the author was a pleasure to read. The screen adaptation by its director Francois Girard and Michael Golding is not as poetic as this team probably intended to. Where the book felt almost like a poem the film doesn't do the same for us who have admired Mr. Baricco's work. It deserved better.The problem appears to be in the casting the role of Herve. Michael Pitt mumbles most of his way throughout the film. His take on the character is what in our humble opinion derails the film. This part needed someone who could make the viewer believe Herve's passion going on in his head but unfortunately being because of Mr. Girard's direction or Mr. Pitt's inability to make Herve come alive one doesn't get that impression.Kira Knightly has a small role as Helene. Ms. Knightly doesn't show much chemistry with Mr. Pitt thus their scenes feel flat. Sei Ashina who is seen as the object of desire gives the right tone to her performance. Alfred Molina appears as the sponsor of Herve.The best thing in the film is the cinematography of Alain Dostie who photograph the beautiful backgrounds with loving care. Visually the film will please the viewer going without having read the novel. The Japanese and Italian natural settings worked miracles for a film that shows almost no substance.".

He is not particularly handsome or charismatic he can't even speak English but the town leader's vivacious sultry wife played by Keira Knightley falls in love with the Japanese man and urges him to take her away. Why? Because any Japanese man who turns up has to be better than what the British male has to offer. The Japanese man is haunted by a glimpse he caught of Keira naked slowly immersing herself in river water. Finally he realises it is all an illusion and that the woman he truly loves is his recently deceased Japanese wife. His wife then replaces Keira in his dreams of the river but decently clothed...You don't buy it do you? Then why are we expected to swallow it in reverse? This is a lusciously shot lyrical understated piece of orientalist claptrap. Michael Pitt takes insipid to new levels and Sei Ashina has to put up with a credit as 'The Girl' probably because they couldn't get away with calling her 'Asian Eye Candy.' Not surprisingly Sei Ashina is a newcomer  no experienced Japanese actress worth her salt would have taken on such a demeaning role. Ashina will forever live down her involvement in this film I fear.This should have been a breakout film for the wonderful Miki Nakatani but she is lost in a stilted role. Koji Yakusho is as forceful as ever and as such is miscast  why would any woman leave this guy especially for a simpering Eurobrat? The reveal at the end shows ironically the film this should have been. The woman wronged the woman whose love should define this film is Hlne. The whole thing should have been rewritten from her perspective. Herv's infatuation with a pretty girl he saw on his travels should have been just that a minor issue in a great love story. Focussing on Herv's delusional obsession is regrettable. Implying that the Japanese woman had reciprocal feelings is feebleminded.In sum great actors in cinematic locations and a story with bags of potential wasted by mindless Eurocentrics.".

It has been severely misjudged here by many people who are desperately in effort to make film critics out of themselves.When I tried to read comments on this film I saw Soooo Slowwwwww and White Man Saves Asian Women Again. That did not feel so good but I hope those who love this film or want to know about it read my comment too.The beauty of this film is not in the advancement of story or in dialogue but in visual narration accompanied by very well chosen musical score. If you have read many classic novels written in the good old days the pattern of story development will not look radically unique to you.Herv Joncour is a man living in a remote village in France in middle nineteenth century. People are out of work there they have not seen much of industry if any at all. Only a small scale revolution could save the village from extinction. And a man with wild but nottooimpractical ideas came to the village one day and things were never the same again for people there. He renovated the silkmill. But he needed silk eggs entirely untouched by the unknown disease. He sent Herv first to Africa and then to Japan away from his sweetheart. Herv became quite an adventurer and procurer. And then he met The Girl in the world of mysticism and snow.The story that was advancing till now in a pace swifter than anything suddenly became extremely slow developing. The girl's gaze her eyes her lips her breath her hair lock her silence her kneeling pose her slow turn way of looking back the way she bathed the way she walked the way she touched and the wind the mist the snow the sky that lights up before everywhere else everything became an obsession to him. But he could not speak Japanese. He could not find out if she felt the same for him. Then after one visit he received a note. He could not ask someone to translate it there so he had to come back to have it translated later. He found out it said Come back or I shall die.Silk is not a story that gives you adrenaline rush. It is not really a classic either. The director's orientation was rather one sided. He showed some things in great detail leaving some things ridiculously out of focus. But he showed perfectly what he wanted to show. The curiosity the undeniable pull toward the heart of a woman. The little he knew the bigger became his obsession. They say a woman's heart is an ocean of mysteries. He was very close to the shore yet it proved to be too far afterwards.Would I recommend this film? Hard to say. It is definitely not a feel good film. But yes it is a work of art. Those who take deep pleasure in relishing cinema this is for them. But if you are looking for a good time a nice time an easy time and you are renting this one don't come here afterwards to blame it on the film. Art is made for art's sake. Appreciate it or don't but show respect.".

But he needed silk eggs entirely untouched by the unknown disease. He sent Herv first to Africa and then to Japan away from his sweetheart. Herv became quite an adventurer and procurer. And then he met The Girl in the world of mysticism and snow.The story that was advancing till now in a pace swifter than anything suddenly became extremely slow developing. The girl's gaze her eyes her lips her breath her hair lock her silence her kneeling pose her slow turn way of looking back the way she bathed the way she walked the way she touched and the wind the mist the snow the sky that lights up before everywhere else everything became an obsession to him. But he could not speak Japanese. He could not find out if she felt the same for him. Then after one visit he received a note. He could not ask someone to translate it there so he had to come back to have it translated later. He found out it said Come back or I shall die.Silk is not a story that gives you adrenaline rush. It is not really a classic either. The director's orientation was rather one sided. He showed some things in great detail leaving some things ridiculously out of focus. But he showed perfectly what he wanted to show. The curiosity the undeniable pull toward the heart of a woman. The little he knew the bigger became his obsession. They say a woman's heart is an ocean of mysteries. He was very close to the shore yet it proved to be too far afterwards.Would I recommend this film? Hard to say. It is definitely not a feel good film. But yes it is a work of art. Those who take deep pleasure in relishing cinema this is for them. But if you are looking for a good time a nice time an easy time and you are renting this one don't come here afterwards to blame it on the film. Art is made for art's sake. Appreciate it or don't but show respect.";

Personally I just got terribly bored less than halfway through the movie. Yes it is visually compelling. And yes there are some fine moments in the acting especially from Alfred Molina. But as a whole this leaves with quite a disappointing feeling in the viewer the feeling that with all that money and resources and brilliant actors perhaps they could have come up with something a bit different.

But these flaws are minor when the scope of the film is viewed in full. It is a beautiful work and one that will satisfy the readers of the novel from which it was adapted. Grady Harp".

The dialogue is wholly unconvincing but sadly only occasionally risibly so.There were a couple of highlights. In one scene there's an interestingly designed basket of lemons hanging on the wall  I had time to commit to memory and it might work well as a wire basket. There are also numerous scenes of somebody playing billiards with himself no not pocket billiards! on a real billiard table. You don't see many of those about these days.They don't seem to have been clear about what language the film was supposed to be spoken in. It mainly has rhotic 'r's but not always. It is beyond me why when they were supposed to be French they didn't just hire real French actors and actresses  even if they then tried to speak English it would have been more authentic sounding. It would have been better in the original language with subtitles.The garden looked just like you'd expect a hastily prepared filmset garden to look  quite unconvincing.The beard continuity is all over the place. The lead robot grows several beards that all look different.On top of all these failings it is nastily gooilly sickly sentimental. Mawkishness drives almost every scene.I wish somebody had told me to avoid this film. See it only if you want a kip.Somebody must have bribed somebody a vast amount not to have this sent straight to DVD.Amazingly the director also directed 'The Red Violin' a first rate film in almost every way  he must have been drinking himself into a coma every day since then or had a nasty accident that damaged his brain.

Even the central question of why Helene did what she did and how she knew who he was obsessed with was never answered. And how did they both know to go to the Japanese prostitute? Alfred Molina's character must have had something to do with it? The childlessness and long illness seemed tacked onif they had something to do with Helene's weird behavior I could have accepted it.

Like some users have said before this is a work of art. The scenarios the colors the sounds  the silence itself which seems to bother so many people in today's society  are what makes Silk a great movie. Yes I would have gone and seen this in a movie theater one way or another because I've been highly interested in checking out as many performances from Keira Knightley as possible since Pride  Prejudice but the truth is by the time I finally got to I was terribly afraid it would be a regretful mistake. Turns out it certainly truly wasn't.Everyone mentions how aesthetically gorgeous this film is even I have said so already earlier in this review but what many fail to see is that beauty is not its main trait  it is not even its best one. To me Silk is about how irrational passion can drive you away from the straight lines in life as Alfred Molina's character hints in a beautiful metaphor near the end. I don't mean this in a bad way and certainly not in a moralist one on the contrary what our protagonist goes through is far too human to be detestable or harshly judged. He's beautifully stupid humanly blind. Choosing an irrational mirage over devoted love is something we have all done once or will or at least consider and think about and if you don't have a life of your own to be sure you can trust me on this one. Passion just has a way of making you clueless... and well Knightley's character is truly admirable and a great human being in the foreverdevoted way she deals with the dark reality she's subject to.This and not just nice scenarios is what Silk is about the most normal of men dealing the most normal of lives falls in love with a beautiful loving woman whom he marries yet he's bored like so many of us are. He leaves in business to a faraway country  Japan  to a remote village he's only allowed to reach blindfolded and he's caught under the spell of the forbidden unreachable exotic feeling about this place from the strange trees to a certain woman he never actually gets to touch at least in a satisfactory way. He becomes obsessed with this woman and irrationally proceeds to ignore his quiet life and devoted wife back in France instead attempting to get as close to this mysterious woman as possible. In the process a child is murdered and more than just a couple of people get hurt over our lead character's lack of common sense. But who can blame him? He's not a likable character not in my book but his many flaws are human. When he finally comes to his senses and learns to value what he's been lucky to have in the first place terrible circumstances cut his newlyfound mature happiness back at home unfairly short. In addition to all this a final unexpected revelation will turn Hlne into an even more awedeserving character as well as make this film worth your while if it still hadn't by then.Herv's trip  from boredom to lack of rational thought and pursuit of an unattainable mirage and finally to mature grounds of happiness  is one most of us have to overcome when we first engage into a serious relationship and a settled lifestyle even if we don't go through all that in Japan  and the fact that we all have or have had our life derail at one point or another is what makes this film so easy to relate to in its essence not necessarily on the more shallow levels of course.This is a wonderful work of art. Yes it's slow and you need patience if you plan to watch it  oh and a brain too. And on top of all that feelings. A life. The acting is pretty good the characters are all unique in a way or another and the idea behind all this is beautifully true. So if you think you fit the requirements do yourself and your many senses a favor and go watch Silk and soon as you can.".

Can she feel Helene's plight?The only character I really liked was Afred Molina's Baldabiou. He's an entrepreneur with flavour for life. Likable tough but sensitive. A father figure to Herve who sorely needs one with such a bore of a father! Herve's attitude to life was a bit strange to me. My friend said something that's always been there he never smiles. True he barely winces never seems to be happy just like drowsily fulfilling a desk job. Schuyler was great in his small role. How a street smart adversary can become a restrained source of practical wisdom! Madame Blanche is also a necessary small role but that has the life experience Herve will always lack. He surely got sympathy from smart strangers! I didn't get involved in Ludovic Berbek's story although it's there with the clear intention of moving us. I also thought all this story of marital unhappiness infertility and she crying as they made love was a bit contrived. I will never like Keira but at least she doesn't look like a tomboy beanpole ! as she said on one interview. Which wouldn't be becoming for her modest wife role. She's not as good as her Guinevere but at least she does her rather plain role without showing off. She doesn't look anorexic like in other roles. Maybe she didn't endure wearing a corset like on Pirates of the Caribbean.The best review I read was Grady Harp from United States. I think it deserves to be the one you read first.My favourite scene is when the local baron shows cold Herve the peaceful place he and his ancestors enjoy for watching nature and connecting with nature. I also wanted to have a garden after watching this thou I content myself with some plants in the balcony ! And Japan shows itself like a harsh country both geographically and with respect to the Japanese. An ancient land with rules hard to understand by any westerner. I did like the fact that the Japanese dialogues weren't subtitled. Unlike Memoirs of a Geisha  even the last Samurai I think that made us feel a bit like it must have been. The sort of ostrananie experience that the Russian formalist extolled as Art.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silk was a flop not the international success its backers had hoped for after the director's The Red Violin made such a splash a decade earlier. It is worthy of attention in pinpointing some cautionary messages to other wouldbe Visionary that recently overworked term filmmakers.1. TRAVELOGUE Film is unfortunately a highly literal through visuals medium and it is easy to become mesmerized by the shots. Mature directors scrupulously avoid this pitfall but perhaps Canadian director Francois Girard has subconsciously assimilated the approach of Terrence Malick. Like Malick he only ventures forth from his artistic cave once a decade and feels compelled to make each shot the most perfect and beautiful of all time. This is not cinema this is how I spent my vacation a 20000000 slide show.2. FOOLED BY THE RUSHES It could be a byproduct of the farflung coproduction status Silk is structured officially as a CanadianItalianJapanese project an unusual combo but the movie displays an ageold problem of Hollywood caused by overmonitoring of the rushes. Many a stiff stolid film result has looked marvelous in the dailies. Studios traditionally made decisions like director firings or bringing in a troubleshooter to haul in the reins on a project based on the quality of the rushes. This makes sense in a beancounter universe but has nothing to do with the ultimate movie which as Hitchcock noted is stored in the director's head. Watching Silk I was struck that the rushes coming back from the various locations truly must have looked fabulous but that is no indicator that they would ultimately amount to anything in a gestalt sense. Only the director and his editors know what will be needed in terms of coverage and how the pieces might mesh into a whole. It's easy to get bamboozled by striking shots just as at the other extreme it's easy to assume the worst when a neophyte director falls behind schedule and isn't giving the execs their daily meters of processed celluloid.3. DISTANCING Brecht and Godard have long been the inspiration for film directors to keep the audience at a safe distance break up the naturally hypnotic effect that a movie has for the viewer which Hitchcock exploited to a faretheewell. In Silk Girard uses the crutch of voiceover narration to sabotage one's involvement in the actiondialogstory. Like Zentropa another pretentious exercise by a wannabe visionary director the somnolent narration literally puts the viewer to sleep. His insistence on oftcriticized bland American accents for French characters further abstracts the story and makes it nearimpossible to smoothly enter into the life of the protagonists. Low affect is the instruction to lead Michael Pitt and even Alfred Molina the latter bringing professional life to his rattled off exposition and even some wit. Keira Knightley gets to actually emote in her patented shybuteffusive manner but I noticed the director cutting away from her as quickly as possible and even though she is the key central figure of the story's romantic theme her overall screen time is reduced to the bare minimum. The dialog by Girard and Michael Golding is almost all in the form of recitations never sounding natural or using vernacular. That's as big a mistake as the bland American accents.4. CRYPTIC Adapting a novel is difficult perhaps this is why the Academy gives a separate Oscar category for adaptations as opposed to the Original Screenplay niche for the Woody Allens of the world. Too often a film or TV adaptation REQUIRES that the viewer be not just conversant but wellnigh totally immersed in the source work in order to appreciate the film. I recently watched the British TV series A Dance to the Music of Time via Netflix after a marathon reading of all 12 Powell novels it's based upon and the damn thing would have made no sense whatsoever without having the books fresh in my mind. For Silk many basic and virtually all nuanced elements are lost without knowledge of the source a damning fault. The intended purity of not subtitling the Japanese dialog segments falls squarely into this problem area too. The movie should stand alone and if it can't why bother? It's not impossible everybody's favorite of alltime The Godfather saw Coppola creating a work of art that never requires one to go back and read Mario Puzo's pulp novel.5. THE PITT FACTOR Folks love to criticize young Mr. Pitt an actor who future generations will scratch their heads over how did he get into so many films?. Pauly Shore Phillips Holmes in the '30s and many 4F performers like Sonny Tufts and William Prince during WW II come to mind. Following the death of James Dean for over a decade innumerable folks imitated his breakthrough persona of which I recall Michael Parks and Christopher Jones becoming the most typecast. Now we have Mr. Pitt the lookalike thespian doomed to live in the shadow of Leonardo DiCaprio let alone his equally handsome namesake Brad. What a cross to bear! 6. UNLOCKING THE MYSTERY I was reminded of Werner Herzog's overlooked classic Heart of Glass while watching Silk. Both films have transcendentally beautiful landscapes. Underneath the main romantic and crosscultural themes they have the same core parable a oneindustry community Glassblowing in Herzog Silk creation here poised on the edge of disaster. Herzog hypnotized his cast to get a unique otherworldly effect. Girard has Pitt  most others sleepwalking to null effect.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed nearly every moment of the film. But it just lacked substance.At the end of the movie I felt that its reason for being was to depict a voice from the grave. It did that not badly. But it did nothing else.Things I liked Atmosphere. Pace. Images. Touches of cultural differences all of which might just as well have been learned by the filmmakers in other movies. Seeing Keira Knightley in bed yes that bed. Woo woo. Seeing the Mogami River I have my reasons.Things I didn't like The typical Hollywood depiction of a yearslongmarried couple acting like they are on an eternal honeymoon well maybe not eternal. Ha ha. They act always just as enamored of each other as when they were first seeing each other romantically premarriage. Except Herve does get the occasional glazed look just before he passionately takes her in his arms kisses her with considerable verve and professes undying love for her. Bad editing That woman whom we don't know suddenly having the baby we tend to assume is the Joncour's but isn't.He mentions that the lilies bloomed a few days after she died but we had seen white lilies blooming in profusion near their house long before that. So big deal.PuzzlesThe broken glasses of the Dutch guy which mean? Not a clue. Oh he was killed? So what? It had zero relevance.The onearmed billiard shot and the guy packing up all and leaving town. So what? Zero significance and no sense.Why did the Japanese master guy not kill Herve with his rifle? He was afraid of some CSI team being kicked into action in the remote mountains of Northern Japan in the late 19th century that would somehow incriminate him? Not likely is it? After all we have the broken glasses which show what he is capable of. Not to mention the boy. So why didn't he? No clue. Was it just to show his subordinate warriors how weak he was?It's a pity Herve couldn't have fallen into lust with a young and attractive wife of a local French nobleman. It sure could have saved him a lot of travel time and expense.Basically the story is no different apart from cinematic exaggerations than some happily married man developing a crush on and fantasizing about a local grocery store clerk. After all the movie made it clear that his relationship with the Japanese exotic mystery woman went unconsummated. What a naive jerk. I'm getting a little horny for some strange. Even though I haven't yet scored with her I think I'll go off on a month's long horrendously grueling and perilous trek risking my life and livelihood at every moment and every turn and leave my young horny KeiraKnightley wife who is avid to become with child alone to stew in her desperately lonely bed during the dark and bleak nights of my interminably long absence like none of the fathers of her pupils in this small village are going to notice her situation and seek numerous consultations onetoone with her over their kids' academic progress. And I'm going to journey to the far side of the Earth to the distant mountains of Japan where I can diddle around and not actually do anything with that exotic woman except possibly again wait for two days while I get nothing but stood up by her not appearing at all even once like in those last two days. And as if she wasn't in a frighteningly dangerous liaison of her own lethally dangerous to us both. But you know I kinda like that free chick she or her master pimped me. Hope I can get some of that again. Yep total jerk which by association implicates this movie.The second letter that was read by the madam was written in a too direct way betraying its nonJapanese orientation and as well mimicked the earlier stated opinion of the madam. I thought the madam was making up the words she was saying and not telling the truth about what was written. A purveyor of commercial sex might be jealous of someone who had found something she no longer could ever find a profound emotional attachment with a true lover which in this case wasn't true because the infatuation was unconsummated. I figured Herve was going to have to get a second opinion about what was written in the letter which would be shocking and deeply moving. In fact we have only the madam's word for what was contained in the letter. The madam a woman who by running a brothel lived a life of lies and illusion dominated by commercial sex may have found the true contents of the letter so contrary to her jaded world view that she felt compelled to lie to and somehow injure Herve was what I was thinking. When he found out the truth we would be off on a journey now of passionate adventure and connection. I guess the movie was already supposed to be that. It wasn't.So when the letter was said by the madam who could make up anything she wanted because no one else could verify what she said she being the only person in the movie who could decipher the unreadable cryptic Japanese to be written by Helene I accepted that as the shocking and deeply moving aspect of the true meaning of the letter. But the story told by Herve to Ludovic may not be the true story. We have only the manhating madam's words that it is so. And Herve is a man.".

It did that not badly. But it did nothing else.Things I liked Atmosphere. Pace. Images. Touches of cultural differences all of which might just as well have been learned by the filmmakers in other movies. Seeing Keira Knightley in bed yes that bed. Woo woo. Seeing the Mogami River I have my reasons.Things I didn't like The typical Hollywood depiction of a yearslongmarried couple acting like they are on an eternal honeymoon well maybe not eternal. Ha ha. They act always just as enamored of each other as when they were first seeing each other romantically premarriage. Except Herve does get the occasional glazed look just before he passionately takes her in his arms kisses her with considerable verve and professes undying love for her. Bad editing That woman whom we don't know suddenly having the baby we tend to assume is the Joncour's but isn't.He mentions that the lilies bloomed a few days after she died but we had seen white lilies blooming in profusion near their house long before that. So big deal.PuzzlesThe broken glasses of the Dutch guy which mean? Not a clue. Oh he was killed? So what? It had zero relevance.The onearmed billiard shot and the guy packing up all and leaving town. So what? Zero significance and no sense.Why did the Japanese master guy not kill Herve with his rifle? He was afraid of some CSI team being kicked into action in the remote mountains of Northern Japan in the late 19th century that would somehow incriminate him? Not likely is it? After all we have the broken glasses which show what he is capable of. Not to mention the boy. So why didn't he? No clue. Was it just to show his subordinate warriors how weak he was?It's a pity Herve couldn't have fallen into lust with a young and attractive wife of a local French nobleman. It sure could have saved him a lot of travel time and expense.Basically the story is no different apart from cinematic exaggerations than some happily married man developing a crush on and fantasizing about a local grocery store clerk. After all the movie made it clear that his relationship with the Japanese exotic mystery woman went unconsummated. What a naive jerk. I'm getting a little horny for some strange. Even though I haven't yet scored with her I think I'll go off on a month's long horrendously grueling and perilous trek risking my life and livelihood at every moment and every turn and leave my young horny KeiraKnightley wife who is avid to become with child alone to stew in her desperately lonely bed during the dark and bleak nights of my interminably long absence like none of the fathers of her pupils in this small village are going to notice her situation and seek numerous consultations onetoone with her over their kids' academic progress. And I'm going to journey to the far side of the Earth to the distant mountains of Japan where I can diddle around and not actually do anything with that exotic woman except possibly again wait for two days while I get nothing but stood up by her not appearing at all even once like in those last two days. And as if she wasn't in a frighteningly dangerous liaison of her own lethally dangerous to us both. But you know I kinda like that free chick she or her master pimped me. Hope I can get some of that again. Yep total jerk which by association implicates this movie.The second letter that was read by the madam was written in a too direct way betraying its nonJapanese orientation and as well mimicked the earlier stated opinion of the madam. I thought the madam was making up the words she was saying and not telling the truth about what was written. A purveyor of commercial sex might be jealous of someone who had found something she no longer could ever find a profound emotional attachment with a true lover which in this case wasn't true because the infatuation was unconsummated. I figured Herve was going to have to get a second opinion about what was written in the letter which would be shocking and deeply moving. In fact we have only the madam's word for what was contained in the letter. The madam a woman who by running a brothel lived a life of lies and illusion dominated by commercial sex may have found the true contents of the letter so contrary to her jaded world view that she felt compelled to lie to and somehow injure Herve was what I was thinking. When he found out the truth we would be off on a journey now of passionate adventure and connection. I guess the movie was already supposed to be that. It wasn't.So when the letter was said by the madam who could make up anything she wanted because no one else could verify what she said she being the only person in the movie who could decipher the unreadable cryptic Japanese to be written by Helene I accepted that as the shocking and deeply moving aspect of the true meaning of the letter. But the story told by Herve to Ludovic may not be the true story. We have only the manhating madam's words that it is so. And Herve is a man.";

He looks good but seriously lacks in acting chops at least in this one. The chemistry between the actors was also severely lacking. The pace was slow which can sometimes work in period pieces to improve the atmosphere but unfortunately here it was mostly a detriment.

	schema:reviewBody "Slight spoilersLight Sleeper is one of a related group of films either written or directed by Schrader in which the principal is typically a spiritual insomniac sleepwalking through life. It includes Taxi Driver 1976 American Gigolo 1980 and more recently Bringing Out The Dead 1999. They are notable in the way interior states are portrayed rather than the dynamics of plot as is so often the case with conventional Hollywood product. Characteristic of this is the way criticism of the present film for instance has often focussed around the peremptory nature of the final gunplay. In most of this group of films the pivotal scene is at the end in the form of a cinematic 'epilogue' inspired by the transcendental conclusion of Bresson's Pickpocket 1950. Schrader has written a book on a small group of directors Ozu Dreyer and Bresson who have a particular world vision.Typically Schrader's most successful films have at their centre a social outsider each of who needs to justify themselves or to be justified. An unstable war veteran a male prostitute a burnt out paramedic in turn they stumble through an insecure world a personal earthbound hell or a world on fire. Schrader's cinematic somnambulists ultimately find belated grace in the eyes of providence. But when it arrives it is inevitably achieved through the catharsis of violence deliberately initiated or not.Light Sleeper focuses on the midlife crisis of a drugs dealer named John LeTour Willem Dafoe. Although he is now 'clean' and dreaming of breaking away from his profession into a music career LeTour is still travelling the city delivering narcotics and working for his boss Ann Susan Sarandon. Ann also dreams of escape although in her case it is into a career in cosmetics  apt as such items work in covering up people's real appearances. During one of his lonely chauffeurdriven dropoffs through the night rain he meets a woman he was deeply involved with a few years back. Later he meets her again this time with her sister as they watch over their dying mother in hospital. Meanwhile back in his flat LeTour sleeplessly completes a journal I fill up one book throw it out start another and contemplates his drifting existence. As one deal follows another his foreboding and pining for what might have been increases until high on drugs he has just delivered a woman is thrown from a window...This is Schrader's favourite film perhaps his most personal. Full of religious overtones it reflects his background and upbringing in ways that are less explicit in his other films. His parents were strict Calvinists such was the home regime that it was not until he was 17 that he saw his first film. During his early years before his big break with the sale of Taxi Driver he himself faced the spectre of drug abuse. He apparently spent long nights awake in porno theatres and overate wildly. While LeTour is not a personal portrait it is clear that the dealer is someone with whose moral crisis the director has much sympathy as he faces selfdisgust.As the hero the gaptoothed haunted Dafoe is perfectly cast. Critics have remarked upon his white pruneskinned horsetoothed beauty the paleness of his flesh suggesting that he can only function at night. As he visits the hotel rooms and penthouse suites of addicts passing through streets filled with the bagged garbage of the city he does indeed seem damned condemning himself over and over. Apparently doomed he also fulfils the role of confessor. People he notices think they can tell a DD anything  things they wouldn't tell anyone else. His fondness for cheap cologne evident at key moments suggests the act of anointing. In the excellent commentary that accompanies the film on the DVD the director recounts how LeTour drifts round society a 'peeper' a figure as anxious as Travis was angry in Taxi Driver or as narcissistic as Julian Kay was in American Gigolo. For Schrader this is essentially the same figure but one facing a mid life crisis of the soul. We can see the success of Schrader's approach by comparing his work to Landis' underrated Into The Night 1985 which takes sleeplessness as a theme and in which the hero also ventures out into the unforgiving night. Landis' film is successful in its own terms but lacks Schrader's moral rigour. The elegance and cool classicism of Light Sleeper produces a style characteristic of the director that matches content. There are no jump cuts or abruptness. Instead the director lets his camera remain at a distance or glide suggestively through the streets and corridors of LeTour's world as if assessing events with a deliberation of its own. Much of the exterior work recalls Taxi Driver notably when LeTour is being driven through the rain swept streets although here the position is reversed. The driver in the earlier film has become the driven perhaps reflecting the dealer's inability to overcome his present moral inertia. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent notably Sarandon who did the film as a favour to the director ensuring its finance. Apparently based on a real acquaintance of Schrader Ann is a notably glamorous supplier one who remains unbesmirched by the nature of her business. Unlike LeTour she survives the ups and downs of her profession to presumably start her new life. It is her hand that offers LeTour moral succour in the notable final scene. The epilogue of Light Sleeper is the most important part of the film. One and a half hours blithely remarks the director in his commentary just to get to one shot. It's a shot that haunts Schrader as already mentioned and echoes down his work. LeTour has been concerned throughout the film that his luck is holding even consulting a psychic to get favourable readings. By 'luck' Schrader really means grace and his hero's final scene is as moving and as effective as the parallel one in American Gigolo. Perhaps more so as here the religious allegory has been so thoroughgoing. Sharpeyed viewers of the present title will see a very young David Spade playing the 'Theological Cokehead' sparking off blurry philosophy during one of LeTour's earlier deliveries. The director admits with amusing candour that this character is he himself the one who got high and talked about God. This is closer to the truth than he modestly suggests. In Light Sleeper his best film he reaches a career high detailing providence in a way both stylish and characteristic of his talents. Amazingly a decade on from this film Schrader is now in postproduction on Exorcist The Beginning.".

With Dafoe I bought it completely. I was even rooting for him to get back with his former junkie lover Dana Delany. Delany and Susan Sarandon give major performances Sarandon as a major supplier also looking to go straight as a cosmetic maven. This is a major manual on acting....look learn and enjoy.".

Often touted as a modern noir movie I really don't consider it in that genre at all.The heart of the film is a reworking of the themes embodied in Schrader's earlier film American Gigolo where a man is forced to confront the fact that the life he is leading is fundamentally unsatisfying reassess what he wants to do find out who his real friends are and ultimately get redeemed through love.Willem Dafoe's character Le Tour's journey is a slow but inevitable one as his drugdealing days are numbered due to his boss Susan Sarandon also splendid going straight. Most of the scenes take place at night hence the noir tag but this is partly a consequence of the drugdealing aspect and partly to capture the unreal mood of a man who doesn't know where he fits in to normal life. The device whereby Le Tour spends many hours writing his thoughts in an exercise book throwing it away when he fills it then starting another one is so strong and startling that I put aside my usual dislike of narration. The soundtrack is also excellent and fits and expands the mood very well.The best scene is probably the one in the hospital cafeteria where Le Tour has a conversation with his exgirlfriend that he hasn't seen for a long time  immaculately acted tremendously understated with so many things going unsaid... The final scene although Schrader nicked it from a French film and used it before in Gigolo is still very powerful based on the idea that whether a man is in prison or not is completely unrelated to whether he is free.".

	schema:headline " Engaging frightening and somewhat saddening account of a NYC man in crisis amidst all the negative elements of death gloom and isolation.";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Schrader's lovehate relationship with close to downandout male individuals living in New York City continues in 1992's Light Sleeper. Schrader casts a dim eye on most of the proceedings in the place but his revisiting of New York City in Light Sleeper and whatever knowledge past you have of 1976's Taxi Driver shows a clear fondness for the place a fondness to keep going back and exploring new characters operating under new situations and working with new problems floating around inside of their heads. In Light Sleeper's case it is Willem Dafoe's John LeTour a middle aged man whom deals drugs meets some pretty desperate individuals in the process cannot connect that well with the women he wants most is stalked by police men and generally tries to balance his ongoing loneliness with his inability to really find his place in life.Light Sleeper is a wonderfully down to Earth and thoroughly intense film. With hindsight one might think of it as a Trainspotting without all the hyperkinetic energy. The film begins quite literally with a focusing on a road as we flow through New York this is before developing into a ground level documentation of life flitting between streets apartments that inhabit drug users and dealers grotty nightclubs that house further users plus hotel suites which spell danger. The easy way to summarise the male lead we're given in Light Sleeper would be a comparison to Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle as penned by Schrader. LeTour is a loner he keeps a diary although possesses better handwriting skills attempts to talk and follow women he simply cannot have and generally wanders. There is even room for the characters to pay reference to the rain at certain times and its importance. Like Taxi Driver the film is a gathering only not of an individual's visions of what's around him but of the interactions and of the people that exist around him.This idea is best explored in a scene set in a hospital. LeTour is visiting the mother of a certain Marianne Jost Delany as another relative whilst in the intensive care room sits asleep in a chair. LeTour walks in and sits down. The camera freezes on him sitting there almost certain death in the air by way of the dying mother and the fact there are those he hands drugs out to whom will perish at some point in the near future. It's only after a while that he glances over at the relative and it's only then that the camera will slowly track left to encompass indeed recognise she's even sitting there. It's an interesting touch by Schrader and reminiscent of Taxi Driver by being a sort of polar opposite we see indeed recognise what LeTour sees but only until HE does so first. We do not get it in that raw unflinching and 1st person style the 1976 masterpiece delivers but we do get it in some manner of speaking.Light Sleeper knows what it is and knows exactly how it wants to unfold. The film isn't a conventional thriller of sorts about a drug dealer and a world of crime and the interactions that go on even if it does end in a conventional manner by way of a bloody shootout. Rather the film is a stark character study of a man on the way out of a man wasting his life away through drugs not as a junkie  something LeTour stresses to certain people he meets but as a dealer and that any relation you might have to the stuff will most probably end you up in very bad shape. As a raw character study we pick the lead up in his late thirties and cover him for about a fortnight. The damage has been done we learn of his past troubles and whatever backstory we require by way of speech to other people and we learn it all at regular very well spaced intervals.The film's attention to LeTour's element of unrequited love in his life is additionally well handled somewhat seamlessly incorporated into the text by way of a series of nervous and unfortunate encounters. We first meet the aforementioned Marianne when LeTour's chauffeur driven saloon stops to pick her up out of the wet. By way of Dafoe's wonderful acting LeTour is juddery and the professionalism driven image that we have of him up to this point by way of short sharp encounters and knowing exactly what to say to different sorts of lowlifes is shattered somewhat when he lies to her about continuing dealing drugs and screws up the whole interaction. The lyrics in the music and the manner in which the character regresses over a photoalbum in the following scene could have been explored and executed in a far worsea manner. The film's remaining scenes of obsession and rejection surrounding these two are well incorporated into the text.I think Light Sleeper's crowning glory is its real attention to the finer things. There's a scene in which LeTour's consistently outrageously dressed female drug contact Ann Susan Sarandon fresh off a wonderful role in Thelma and Louise who is the the person that supplies all of the drugs to LeTour along with Robert Clennon from their pseudoupper class decorated apartment asks LeTour for a lunch meeting the following day. I got an odd sensation after the interaction had ended that a lesser film would cut straight to the lunch person 'A' proposes something to person 'B' person 'B' accepts and then we cut to the rendezvous. Light Sleeper rejects the causality opting for notions interactions and ideas to rest on the backburner whilst the lead carries on for a while interacting further with other people before the day is out. Make no mistake there'll be no light napping during this picture.".

I have occasionally looked for copies of this movie in small town rental stores and discount bins to no avail.I finally broke down and bought Light Sleeper on DVD and I am very happy I did. This is one of Dafoe's better roles  his performance is almost always very good but let's face it he's taken on a few weak roles in the past Clear and Present Danger springs to mind here. Not much script to work with.But then there's Affliction same screenwriter as Light Sleeper LTofC Platoon an overdramatic production IMHO Triumph of the Spirit To Live and Die in L.A. good fun for Michael Mann and William Peterson fans...so that's why I finally bought this DVD.Anyways I think Willem Dafoe's performance was comparable to Triumph of the Spirit as was the script and production. Susan Sarandon was a pleasant surprise  I thought she might bring the movie down by being too dramatic or sex kitteny but this is right around the period she began to play the role of a woman and not a girl.As far as Michael Been's songs in the soundtrack are concerned I'm a modest fan of The Call and I rather enjoyed the soundtrack. It is a movie of its time in that the songs are featured more prominently in the mixing level and duration than one would expect of today.I found the story compelling I cared what happened to the characters next. In my opinion if a movie can't do that it's wasting precious minutes of my life. I donate exceptional movie DVDs to our local small town library collection and this will be one of them.".

	schema:headline " Rare work of genius from erratic maverick Schraeder";
	schema:reviewBody "I've never cared for his work before but Schraeder made an outstanding and penetrating lowbudget feature with 'light Sleeper.' It's script is detailed and exceptional in it's depiction of people you can believe are real. It's perhaps too sympathetic towards drug pushers people I usually have contempt for but the lead character LeTour finds nothing but grief through his involvement. It dares to depict them not as cold assassins but people who need each other and fall in love. LeTour's repetitive playing back of his estranged girlfriend's answer machine voice is particularly poignant. Not many film's tackle the issue of encroaching middle age and it's financial uncertainties although many may find the depiction of drug dealing as 'just another job' offensive. Since being arrested may be a matter of unrelated chance the characters rely on astral charts crystal ball gurus and 'aura' specialists. This being refugees from the mystical sixties counter culture gives them a spurious sense of security. It's this very superstitious belief that his luck may be running out that drives LeTour into paranoia and his own eventual downfall.The weakness of this film is it's familiarity with Schraeder's other films especially the diary almost to the point of being a greatest hits tour. The ending is a straight lift from his own 'American Gigolo' and rather lazy redemption. The musical accompaniment to the action throughout is also not to my tastes artistically but does not damage the picture. Performances even to the smallest parts are excellent. Willem DaFoe an underused resource in Hollywood gives an emotional and gifted performance and Sarandon is superlative as ever.".

Two have been directed by Scorsese and one by Schrader himself. Scorsese is by far the more competent director but I like Schrader's approach better.Scorsese selects actors that are full of energy and encouraged to radiate.

This fullness of energy and exchange drives Scorsese projects. Cage in Bring out the Dead.'That's despite the fact that what Schrader had in mind was something different. In every one of his scripts he creates a world that moves on its own and pulls energy out of his hapless hero always a man except when he tried it with his lover.The correct type of actor for this is one that can create negative energy someone who visibly sucks life from outside forces. Scorsese cannot do this but he came close with Dafoe in Temptation.'The final scenes in Temptation' are informed by Michelangelo's Pieta an amazing statue of the slain Christ in Mary's lap. She is alive  all the forms of her face and body are constructed in such a way to contain her. Jesus on the other hand is more than simply desiccated. Every form in his being comes not from what is contained within but what has been taken by the environment. He is defined by negative form. Not quite scallops and scoops but their more subtle and devilish cousins.Dafoe pulled this off in spite of Scorsese's meddling. Schrader was there in Morroco and saw this so commandeered Dafoe for this project. Here Dafoe sucks energy from what surrounds him. His character doesn't understand why he is so jinxed but he is. A locomotive of removal a hollow man hollowing out the space around him.Sarandon is merely furniture and does the job adequately. Her role is to give an excuse for talk about karma and akashic records.

At the time I remember liking it a lot more than most of my friends and most of the critics. I'm a sucker for redemption stories I guess. In any case I've long since forgotten the ending so that may explain why I found myself so moved by the ending of Light Sleeper.I also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't easy to see where things were heading either in terms of plot or emotions.But the tradition of rather strange flaws in Schrader's movies continues this time a godawful musical score sort of 90's eraSpringsteen mixed with Robbie Robertson but in a bad bad way that could have destroyed the movie for me  if it weren't so superb in every other way.The cast is consistently good and it's nice to see Mr. Intensity Willem Dafoe portray an essentially sweet natured though intense person for a change  but I was especially entranced by Susan Sarandon's work toward the end of the film.I understand that idea of the drug dealer with heart of gold may seem like an oxymoron  but that's part of the point of the film that our commonplace ways of characterizing our fellow man may not be all that terribly accurate in all situations.In this light there's an interesting scene about halfway through the film where a homicide detective questions Dafoe. The dialogue and even the acting could have been taken from a thousand movie scenes where a detective questions a sleazy dope peddler  Dafoe even takes on the traditional body language that we associate with such characters. It's almost as if Dafoe wandered into a more traditional movie starring the detective.But knowing what we do about Dafoe's character and why he's not being forthcoming changes entirely the way we view the scene.Good stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "As with many of Paul Schrader's less commercial films of the 1990's Light Sleeper came and went without much box office fanfare. However it enjoyed some critical success before fading into the emerging universe of video and later DVD. Willem Dafoe Susan Sarandon and Dana Delany star in a film about losers losers' dilemmas second chances and redemption. Many of Schrader's other films touch upon similar themes and moods. In Light Sleeper Schrader combines the nuances of Film Noir with realism and once again good dialog. Ed Lachman's sleek night cinematography is punctuated by an unobtrusive Noirlike soundtrack. Dafoe's voiceover narration is never awkward or clichd despite it being a wellworn tactic in these type of films.Dafoe is perfectly cast as John LeTour a has been druggie trying to eke out an existence selling drugs while maintaining a facade of steering clear of trouble and lying to himself and others around him. Susan Sarandon is good as Ann the has been drug baroness considering turning to a cosmetics business while rapidly approaching middle age. Delany is Marianne LeTour's last great love who is both attracted to and repelled by what LeTour represents. Also as with most of Schrader's films there's excellent support in this film from Victor Garber Mary Beth Hurt Jane Adams Paul Jabara in his last film before succumbing to AIDSrelated Lymphoma Sam Rockwell and look for David Spade as a cocaine addict.Schrader covers familiar territory with the loner protagonist faced with the dilemma of being lured into decadence vs. breaking free of the life he's led by living up to a personal moral code of his own. None of Schrader's characters are ever black and white and those who inhabit the world of Light Sleeper are no exception. He alternates scenes of each character displaying both good and bad traits to show the humanity of each. LeTour is seen treating addict Jabara with utter contempt kicking him down on a kitchen floor while Jabara is strung out. Later we see LeTour's compassion for the dying mother of his former significant other. Schrader's other main characters display similar emotions proportionate to a scale ranging from self interest to empathy. Sarandon is caught between continuing the risky life of an aging drug baroness and starting a legitimate business. Delany is trapped between being lured into using vs. finding the empathy and stability she desperately wants and needs. Schrader shows us as he did with several of his previous films American Gigolo Hardcore and Taxi Driver which he wrote that what matters most in life are the people that fill a need each of us has. For LeTour Marianne represented respectability rising above his circumstances and feeling needed. However consistent with the dilemmas Schrader's characters face is the fact that they never seem to find anyone to fill all their needs completely. Hence Schrader leads us through LeTour in this case to a catharsis simultaneously resolving both the plot and the protagonist's emotional dilemma just as he did with Taxi Driver and Hardcore especially. This is probably Schrader's best directed film up to this point in time.  of 4 stars.".

Most of us haven't sold drugs but most of us will be able to relate to the torment that the character is going through. Its like being immersed in a sin knowing that it is bad and still doing it. As for cinematography I enjoyed to see an urban setting full of electric lights and the various people who cannot give the main character any relief for his loneliness. I did not care much for the Susan Surandon character in light of Willem Defoe's performance she is sort of out of the picture. In the end I had a good emotional resolution.

	schema:reviewBody "Having been a Willem Dafoe fan for several years I was more than pleasantly surprised to see his amazing performance in this film. There were some priceless moments in which Dafoe made the art of acting appear effortless. This is pure joy for a film fan. Sarandon was superb in a role which I think was a departure for her.

In one instance Dafoe's character relates White drugs for white people. Also Dana Delaney puts in a good performance but definitely second to Dafoe's  her performance is not quite complete and I was left feeling as though the film just had that extra something missing.This is a brilliant film. The raw humane unvarnished look at the life of a mid level drug dealer in Manhattan is uniquely captivating and Willem Defoe plays the part to perfection. The story itself is underwhelming common real. The protagonist's struggles through life are much like anyone else's. Anyone else's in New York at least. But the context of his life the rhythms of it are very different. The random encounters with love and violence touch him as arbitrarily as they touch each of us and he reacts to them with the same confusion elation and pain. This is the film's genius and it allows an unusually close emotional bond to develop between the protagonist and the audience.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

Willem Dafoe's performance is brilliant and is characterised by his desire to end his drug dealing days yet not knowing how to break out of the cycle. That is all he knows to do and it will take a great tradgedy to force him to act. It is easy to draw superficial connections between this film and Taxi Driver yet for me it is the insistance on slowly following Dafoe as he attempts to correct his life that is a powerful film experience. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can imagine the pitch for Reindeer Games being thrown at the execs behind the picture...Okay it's about this guy who's not who he says he is who everybody thinks he is who fools these guys who thinks he is falls in love with this girl who thinks he is even though he isn't and they try to pull a heist with his expertise even though he has none.Nick Ben Affleck has just been released from jail for defending his girlfriend in a fight prior to being thrown into the slammer. Upon his release a longtime pen pal named Ashley Charlize Theron greets him and they immediately hit the sack. However her brother Gary Sinise wants Nick to help them pull a heist on Christmas Eve at a local Indian casino which is run by a money hungry wannabe Dennis Farina. Her brother kidnaps Nick holds a gun to his head and commands him to draw up a sketch of the security points in the casino since he used to work there and knows all there is to know about the casino. There is one minor detail however that may hinder their plan.Nick is not Nick.Nick is really a car jacker who overheard his jail cellmate Nick reading his letters from a penpal named Ashley aloud. Nick was killed before his release in the jail cafeteria and so Nick took his identity so that he could meet up with the infamous Ashley he kept hearing about forming a mental picture of her in his head.If you stop to take the time and think through all the minor details of the film's plot especially given the twist ending you'll probably arive upon the conclusion that it's all a bunch of bull. It simply doesn't make sense if you really take the time to think it through.If you don't put your brain to work however you'll find yourself having fun watching director John Frankenheimer's last film. Frankenheimer was a talented director the man behind such films as The Manchurian Candidate Seconds and Ronin.

She's the film's high point and though people criticize the plot I found Reindeer Games mildly inventive with its shifting twists and turns even if they aren't always so believable.The film's downfall is its ending which feels as if the filmmakers got caught up in all their twists and turns and unconsciously wrote themselves into a wall then suddenly slapped on a cheesy cliched ending with a sentimental good guy closing scene. It's rushed silly and doesn't fit in with the rest of the film.Irregardless of its uncountable flaws Reindeer Games or Deception as it is called in the UK is a fun film John Frankenheimer's final movie. Reindeer Games is often linked as Frankenheimer's longtime dream picture much like Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America. Like a dying man's final words perhaps it conveyed some hidden meaning to Frankenheimer. Or maybe everyone was wrong. Maybe Reindeer Games is nothing but another Frankenheimer film this one not as good as most of his others.But Rosebud didn't mean anything to anyone except Charles Foster Kane. Maybe Reindeer Games meant something to John Frankenheimer. However as anyone who has ever seen Citizen Kane probably knows it's not likely that we'll ever find out what it means even if we try.35 stars. Enjoyable if you don't put your brain to work.John Ulmer".

	onyx:emotionText "I can imagine the pitch for Reindeer Games being thrown at the execs behind the picture...Okay it's about this guy who's not who he says he is who everybody thinks he is who fools these guys who thinks he is falls in love with this girl who thinks he is even though he isn't and they try to pull a heist with his expertise even though he has none.Nick Ben Affleck has just been released from jail for defending his girlfriend in a fight prior to being thrown into the slammer. Upon his release a longtime pen pal named Ashley Charlize Theron greets him and they immediately hit the sack. However her brother Gary Sinise wants Nick to help them pull a heist on Christmas Eve at a local Indian casino which is run by a money hungry wannabe Dennis Farina. Her brother kidnaps Nick holds a gun to his head and commands him to draw up a sketch of the security points in the casino since he used to work there and knows all there is to know about the casino. There is one minor detail however that may hinder their plan.Nick is not Nick.Nick is really a car jacker who overheard his jail cellmate Nick reading his letters from a penpal named Ashley aloud. Nick was killed before his release in the jail cafeteria and so Nick took his identity so that he could meet up with the infamous Ashley he kept hearing about forming a mental picture of her in his head.If you stop to take the time and think through all the minor details of the film's plot especially given the twist ending you'll probably arive upon the conclusion that it's all a bunch of bull. It simply doesn't make sense if you really take the time to think it through.If you don't put your brain to work however you'll find yourself having fun watching director John Frankenheimer's last film. Frankenheimer was a talented director the man behind such films as The Manchurian Candidate Seconds and Ronin.

Otherwise settle in for a smooth ride.My favorite part of this movie are the prison sequences at the start and the final scenes. The prison sequence was very well done and Affleck is immediately identifiable as the likable car jacker. The final scenes are a great touch after the explosions a nice touch to an enjoyable film. Sinise's fellow gang members are excellent as well their intimidation tactics and craziness well transmitted to the screen.See this movie around Christmas time. It may hold some more value.".

When Nick is killed during a prison riot Rudy decides to assume Nick's identity upon release from prison and meet up with the unknown woman. Burdened with a base knowledge of Nick's Indian casino employment past Rudy finds himself in too deep with Ashley's brother Gabriel Gary Sinise and is violently forced to cooperate with a casino robbery that Gabriel and his gang have been planning with Nick in mind.From an original screenplay by Ehren Kruger REINDEER is very much in the same vein as his last script ARLINGTON ROAD. While much more of an action film than the paranoia drenched ROAD REINDEER holds it's deceptions very close to it's heart as well. Who can you trust and for how long? Helmed by esteemed director John Frankenheimer THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE RONIN REINDEER seems keenly aware of it's inane story yet he keeps pushing the proceedings along briskly trying to keep this casino heist plot afloat with good actors and a passable script. It's fun just to watch this tale unfold. All the professionals involved know this material isn't CITIZEN KANE but as action films go nowadays REINDEER's restraint is it's most endearing aspect. No pop culture references not too many exploding fireballs and Frankenheimer keeps the edit count down. REINDEER GAMES is a far more classy film than it's brethren.It takes some time to get used to Ben Affleck as a tough excon. His baby face and peanut brittle voice do little to sell him as an action hero. As REINDEER trudges along you get used to watching him act tough. It isn't the best performance that's come out of him I'll save that honor for DOGMA but Affleck is a likable enough guy and makes Rudy a character you want to see save the day. Imagine an aging lead vocalist for a Black Sabbath cover band and you'll have an idea what Gary Sinse looks like in REINDEER. He always makes a great passionate villain but this time he takes his appearance one step further and actually looks like a threat. Charlize Theron keeps improving as an actress but it is her new brunette look and honey smile that one takes away from her performance. She looks lovely in the snow but not too much presence beyond that. The whole cast is somewhat stuck with Kruger's elementary script and they all try hard to overcome it. It ends up being their individual charms that make REINDEER come out a winner.I liked REINDEER GAMES for the throwaway Christmas thriller that it is. Taking advantage of the topical Native American casino boom and deliberately waltzing away from many clichs GAMES is a pleasure to enjoy. We need more of these.  8".

	schema:reviewBody "I though REINDEER GAMES was a pretty good movie especially compared to some other movies of the year 2000 so far but I think there should have been a little more action than there actually was. There was quite a lot of buildup to the casino robbery but when it finally got there not much happened. The ending was very good. Just when you think you've identified all the twists there's another one right there.Rudy Ben Affleck a carthief and his cellmate Nick James Frain a guy who killed another man while defending his girlfriend are both about to be freed from jail when Nick is murdered during a lunch fight. Rudy decides to pretend to be him when his penpallike girlfriend Ashley Charlize Theron who never met Nick before comes to find him. The two really hit it off and things are going well until Ashley's brother Gabriel Gary Sinise finds Rudy and threatens to kill him if he doesn't help them get into and rob a casino which the real Nick previously worked at.The plot is actually pretty cool but it's hard to believe that this bunch of idiotthieves would really believe that this was the real Nick even after he told them time after time that he wasn't. There are many great twists at the end which leads to an unpredictable although somewhat unbelievable ending. The characters are pretty cool about half of which turn out to be different from whom you originally thought.Ben Affleck new to the action genre did a pretty good job. After proving himself to be able to play very different parts like in Dogma Armageddon and now this I think he is really going places. Charlize Theron did an OK job as well as the mysterious girlfriend of Nick. Gary Sinise stole the show. I really like this guy. Boy can he act! He's played so many different characters very well. Gary doesn't do as well as the villain as he did in SNAKE EYES or RANSOM but he still did a very good and believable job.The main flaw in this movie was the lack of action until the end. The casino robbery itself should've been more actionpacked like it seemed on the commercial. Even in the ending there was more irony and surprise than there was action. But the story and was action was there was still very well done. I'd recommend this movie over many of the movies out now.".

Only at the end it really failed there were just too many explosions who aren't really doing any good to the rest of the story if you ask me.But no problem at least it's something different than The Sound of Music or Home Alone which you'll normally see around Christmas.

The ruse goes awry when he is also mistaken for Nick by a gang of thugs headed by Gary Sinise who recruit him in their planned heist of an Indian casino at which Nick had been employed.Like 52 PickUp Reindeer Games has a central character whose flawed behavior puts him at the mercy of dangerous individuals who conceive a scheme that spins out of control.  52 PickUp was successful because the entire cast beginning with Roy Scheider as the trapped hero was equal to the task of bringing the grittiness of the material to the screen.  The one significant problem with Reindeer Games is the casting of squeakyclean Affleck as its central character.  Through no fault of his own Affleck looks like a lightweight alongside a supporting cast that includes Sinise Clarence Williams III Danny Trejo and Dennis Farina  all actors who look like they have lived a little.  Affleck cuts a profile similar to that of Scheider but without the livedin look that made him convincing as someone who would be able to go toe to toe with his tormentors.Reindeer is helped greatly by the performance of Theron who while also young always has been able to project a more adult presence like the young Kathleen Turner.  Credited more for her on and offscreen glamour Theron often is underrated as an actress.  Here she conveys equal parts sweetness intelligence dismay and ferocity.  Of course she also livens up her sensual scenes.  For many actresses nudity itself is the extent of their sexuality but Theron generates heat simply by looking comfortable and bringing an unforced quality to the proceedings.The other major plus is Frankenheimer's direction which turns an adequate screenplay into a solid thriller.

	schema:reviewBody " out of Reindeer Games is a semiguilty pleasure to be sure.  I don't feel it's one of those sobadit'sgood sort of movies but the script relies quite a bit on chance and one of the plot twists though quite fun and unpredictable is a bit on the implausible side.  The likelihood of this situation panning itself out the way it did here isn't very high but the film works because of John Frankenheimer's direction the charismatic cast and the dark humor.Rudy Duncan Ben Affleck a car thief and his cellmate and best friend Nick Cassidy James Frain are two days away from being released from prison.  Rudy just wants to return home to his family while Nick plans on meeting with his penpal girlfriend a beautiful woman named Ashley Charlize Theron.  Unfortunately a food fight breaks out in the prison cafeteria and Nick is killed leaving Rudy with a dilemma.  When he's released at the last moment he decides to pose as Nick to Ashley.For the first few days this is Heaven for Rudy.  He and Ashley click immediately and they make love in a motel.  However returning back to the motel from some shopping he's ambushed and beaten by Ashley's brother Gabriel Gary Sinise and his men.  Having read Nick's letters and discovering he'd worked as a security guard at the Tomahawk Casino he plans to use Rudy whom he thinks is Nick to help him rob the casino.  Rudy has to now find a way to convince everyone he's Nick and get out of this situation alive.From the opening scene featuring five dead Santas in the snow Reindeer Games had me riveted.  It's a fine way to open the film giving the feeling that something disastrous has just occured and it piqued my interest. Using the flashback method in this film is effective which may now be considered tiresome in films overall but it works here.After The Island of Dr. Moreau it looked as if though director Frankenheimer's career was almost over then came Ronin an action thriller that featured some exciting shootouts and one of the most brilliant car chases ever filmed.  Reindeer Games still features Frankenheimer doing a firstrate job.  While his direction is far from flawless he has a pesky insistence to shoot many many closeups he does an excellent job creating suspense and believable action scenes.Reindeer Games tries to work as both action and suspense and for the most part it succeeds.  The action is refreshingly not overthetop in the how do we top the next stunt style seen in so many Jerry Bruckheimer or Joel Silver blockbuster films.  Frankenheimer injects tension into the gunplay fistfights and chases and these scenes work better than they probably could have in another less talented director's hands.Ehren Kruger wrote the script and he puts in a lot of dark humor.  There are a lot of funny moments due mostly to Affleck trying to adlib and convince everyone he's actually Nick.  Of course Kruger is also infamous for plot twists that just about nobody can predict but are also wildly improbable.  Actually Reindeer Games' final plot twist is perhaps more likely to occur than the twists in Kruger's other scripts Scream 3 and Arlington Road.  Speaking of that twist let me just say that you might or might not figure it out almost exactly a minute before it happens.  Unlikely or not there's no denying that last twist is a lot of fun.Director Frankenheimer and screenwriter Kruger also seem to know what the audience wants from this sort of movie and they fill it with everything they can including violent action the dark humor the twists and turns as well as a good dose of sex and nudity provided mostly by Charlize Theron. The fact that she's a lovely woman doesn't hurt matters at all.The cast plays a major part in the film's success.  Ben Affleck has proven he's one of cinema's most charismatic young actors.  His Rudy Duncan is character you can root for the whole way through because Affleck molds him into a likable and energetically funny persona.  Gary Sinise chews the scenery bigtime as the villain.  Let's face it he's easily one of the best actors around and it's somewhat of a shame to see him play a role like this when he's easily suited for something more complex but he has so much fun in the role it's hard not to feel his enthusiasm.  Charlize Theron doesn't really get a whole lot to work with.  She has only a few modes mostly just relegated to smiling or crying or looking lost or angry.  The supporting cast mostly consists of Gabriel's henchmen which include Clarence William III Donal Logue and Danny Trejo all of whom deliver okay performances. The only other cast member with signifcant screen time is Dennis Farina who tries to chew the scenery like Sinise but isn't half as effective or memorable.Of course not everything in the film is effective.  The film has a dark tone and atmosphere almost the whole way through and it creates more unpleasant scenes than are welcome.  You also have to wonder about the intelligence of Gabriel and his men they simply don't have a lot of it. They get fooled by Rudy a little too easily and after a while it feels like they give him too many chances.But ultimately those are my only true gripes with the movie.  Reindeer Games hardly takes itself ultraseriously and as a result it's a fun ride virtually the whole way through.  There's nothing truly innovative or brilliant at work here and the film's certainly not saying anything deep it's just for entertainment value and all the elements work together well to create an enjoyable and fastpaced thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "A laughable thriller with a plethora of idiotic twists.Recently I watched a documentary about Frankenheimer in which he said that he still has a dream of making the perfect movie like his favourite Citizen Kane. So obviously he went ahead with something like Reindeer Games. Clearly this must be the Citizen Kane of the 21st century everyone's been waiting for. It was just a matter of time. The movie works well on so many levels it's frightening. We all knew deep down in our hearts that the old geezer still had it in him. Bravo.First of all this reminds me a lot of Long Kiss Goodnight plenty of snow plenty of the Christmas spirit plenty of idiocy. It's almost macabre how dumb the plot and the plot twists of this movie are. So basically this whole huge elaborate scheme was designed by Theron and her excon boyfriend so that someone else would rob the casino?! Could a heist be any more complicatedly planned?!! This is one of the most farfetched laughinducing premises since Dressed To Kill! There are so many logic problems with it that there is absolutely no point in going into detail. And the logic is just one of the problems the movie has.The casting insane absurd laughable. Affleck as a prisoner in a jail?? I don't think so. Affleck as an inmate who taunts a big black convict??? I think not. Affleck the tough guy who cracks jokes every time Sinise's gang break a couple of his ribs???? Surely not. Affleck might steal his mommy's chewinggum but you don't go to jail for that. Theron as a sly evil scheming genial criminal mind?? Maybe in Citizen Kane's Blood The Fantasy Continues II. And what's with Sinise with long hair again... He was funny with long hair in Forrest Gump. Wasn't that enough? A repeated joke is never as funny the second time around. What kind of instructions did they get from Frankenheimer? Okay Gary you will be a smiling sneering psycho in an action thriller. You Charlize you shall be a sniveling broad in a romance movie and then you'll overact your way as a sinister criminal genius through a dumb Depalmesqian thrillercomedy. And you Ben you will play it for laughs you are in a comedy. You're not funny but who cares. This is basically the first half of the movie Affleck cracks joke. Sinise hits him. Theron cries. Sinise asks if he is the real Nick. Affleck lies. Affleck cracks joke. Sinise hits Affleck. Theron sobs. Affleck runs away. Sinise catches Affleck. Sinise asks Affleck if he is the real Nick. Affleck cracks joke. Sinise hits Affleck. Theron cries. Sinise hits Affleck. Affleck cracks joke. Sinise hits Affleck. Affleck cracks joke. Theron cries. Etc. The second half is like this dumb surprise twist. Another dumb surprise twist. Action. More dumb twists. Dumb action scenes. A twist. Absurd action scenes. Final twist. Affleck gets revenge. Everyone's dead. Affleck is happy. At the end there is even Affleck moralizing in an attempt to make Theron the Evil Bitch feel guilty about everything! And the worst thing is that it succeeds she actually starts justifying herself to him! They're all like little five yearolds here! This is just too dumb for words.No doubt that Frankenheimer can make the next Citizen Kane but only in his dreams whenever he is lying next to a swimming pool on a Hollywood partyorgy all doped up with heroin. Is this movie a comedy a parody a thriller or what? None of the above. It is a piece of s however. A special movie category suitable only for those rare works of utter crap.I think Frankenheimer did the right thing by casting Charlize Themoron. She is infamous for saying how much she enjoyed Turkey when she was in its city of Budapest. Such a tiny mind is an ideal match for this dumb movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ben Affleck plays Rudy a con just trying to go straight are there other kinds in the movies? waiting for his imminent release. He and his cellmate Nick each have plans of enjoying themselves once they get out of stir. Nick's involves meeting and spending the rest of his life with a woman he's never met a pen pal named Ashley Charlize Theron. Ah but the bestlaid plans and all that go horribly awry when Nick is slain a few days before they're both due to be sprung. What a coincidence! Naturally Rudy pretends to be Nick to Ashley discovering her to be quite the cutie. You see he's just gotten out of prison hasn't been with a woman in years and.... Well anyway he hooks up with the gorgeous Ashley and all is well  for a few hours anyway until Ashley's brother Gabriel Gary Sinise shows up and demands RudyNicky help him and his gang  who have never robbed anyone  pull off a heist of a local Indian casino. Of course Rudy being Rudy and not Nick doesn't know a thing about the casino Nick was a guard there years ago. And he tries to tell Gabriel that. But wouldn't you know it the creep just won't listen! Bad guys are like that. So your basic plot involves Rudy trying to helpnot help these guys with their evil plan and of course they'll stop at nothing and of course things go wrong etc. Oh sure there are a few plot twists and some will have you guessing but my bet is there's going to be a lot in this movie that you've seen before. And if you think the plot's relatively hohum with few surprises then you're left with the performances of the three main leads.Ben Affleck is miscast in my opinion. His character's not terribly likeable I mean he DOES lie to Charlize Theron after all but that's not his fault. Affleck's problem is that he combines arrogance with toughguy attitude and thinks it makes him multifaceted. No Ben it makes you look like a jerk. A better choice for this role might have been Edward Norton Fight Club. Norton can play tough with foibles and I don't think Affleck has that ability.Charlize Theron is outstanding. She delivers a deep stunning performance that produces new wrinkles with each scene. Much like Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity Theron is crafty essaying more in those bewitching eyes than most actors can in an entire soliloquy.And Gary Sinise? He's Gary Sinise. He's sinister he's meanspirited....he's the heavy. He's the bad guy folks and Sinise has played this role a few times so he knows what he's doing. Oh sure maybe his character is nothing more than a cardboard Bad Guy role but hey that's more the fault of the screenwriting than it is of the actor so I won't blame him. I've seen his talent range and I know he's got some. See Of Mice and Men or The Green Mile or Ransom.Bottom line  it's not exactly filled with the kind of twists that'll keep you guessing but it's not too bad. It is however a bit of a comedown from the director of The Manchurian Candidate. But fret not friends  it is after all a rental at this point and it's worth the 3.50 or so.".

	schema:headline " I can't believe this is from the director of The Manchurian Candidate!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a movie full of twists and turns which gets worse at every twist and turn. It's sad that John Frankenheimer who directed the brilliant movie The Manchurian Candidate ended his career with this trash.In it Nick and Rudy are in prison about to be released. Nick has a girlfriend named Ashley who he has never actually met. Before the release there is a fight and Nick appears to die. Rudy meets Ashley upon getting out of prison... and claims to be Nick. He begins an affair with the girl which seems to disturb him slightly. This might not be the greatest of story lines but it was interesting and there were Christmas references thrown in that were enjoyable. It would have been interesting to see Rudy struggle with his conscience and how Ashley would have reacted to the truth. But then comes the first twist Ashley's brother Gabriel arrives with a plot to rob a native casino and he forces Ashley and Nick to become part of the plot. This while no masterpiece could have been an okay Bmovie. But there are still more tedious twists and turns Ashley and Gabriel are lovers instead of siblings Ashley was in charge of the plot to rob the casino etc. And it comes to an ending with Nick still being alive and the brains behind the whole operation which is completely unrealistic. Poor performances to boot.".

One prime problem is that Afflick is just never convincing as a joint hardened car thief.  When he is inside prison he looks like a nice suburban kid acting like he is in prison.  He is almost never convincing in this role.But ultimately the problem with this movie is in the number of plot twists that Frankenheimer throws at the audience.  Rather than build a plot all too often when interest begins to lag Frankenheimer introduces a double cross a character who was already killed or some such nonsense.

Thriller with Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron  . Instantly I thought I would be watching something similar to NIGHT OF THE HUNTER  yeah okay Ben Affleck sure ain't Robert Mitchum but the plot sounded very similar . Unfortunately what let's this movie down is the script along with the star So I should have guessed that Affleck wasn't going to play a bad guy  but let's face it he can't play good guys either  he is a very poor actor who only became famous because of his connection with Matt Damon which goes to prove it's not what you know  it's who you know that's the key to success . Pain  mortal fear  angst  Affleck is unable to portray any of these negative emotions and considering his character RudyNick spends much of the movie getting beaten up and threatened this is a major draw back to the movie . Nice to know we won't be seeing him in too many movies in the future and if Matt Damon is looking for a new best friend I'd happily nominate myself . Let's do lunch Matt . Thankfully Gary Sinese and Danny Trejo  Check out this guy's bio  manage to carry the film with their performances The screenplay by Ehron Kruger doesn't play out like NIGHT OF THE HUNTER  the  Man stealing the identity of his dead cellmate  subplot is just used to set up the story and if anything resembles CLIFFHANGER with a bunch of bad ass gangsters holding their victim hostage to get what they want . There's lots of chases in the snow and the occasional passer by getting bumped off but there's some ridiculous plot holes . For example Rudy and his girlfriend are drowning under the ice so Rudy uses his gun to shoot his way out of a watery grave . What he can fire a gun under water ? And there's a scene where Rudy is shackled to a bed . He then manages to break free  go to a swimming pool to discover a plot twist  go back to the hotel room he is held hostage and dupe one of the bad guys into believing he's still shackled to the bed by having the bed rest on his foot  then the action cuts to the morning where Rudy is taken out to the villains' van . It's just that come the morning none of the baddies has noticed that Rudy has dismantled the bed to escape his shackles . Little things like this ruin the DECEPTION's thriller elements . I know in these type of movies you have to suspend disbelief sometimes but here you have to suspend it a little too much for the movie to be effective . And because it's John Frankenheimer's last movie many of the reviewers seem to slightly more forgiving about this thriller's faults than I am".

	schema:reviewBody "The action in Reindeer Games takes place at Christmastime and this is also probably the best time of the year to watch the movie as it's funny entertaining and best appreciated at a time when your critical faculties are not at their sharpest!! This slick thriller is actionpacked and fast moving but also tense and very violent at times. The plot is complicated by numerous twists mistaken identities and doublecrosses and also a bunch of characters that are often very unpredictable. Characters called Rudy and Nick and a soundtrack full of Christmas songs contribute to the strong Christmas theme which is maintained throughout and the regular humorous moments provide an effective counterpoint to some of the more unsavoury things that happen on screen.Rudy Ben Affleck and Nick James Frain are a couple of cellmates who are serving out their final few days in prison. Nick has for some time been corresponding with a young woman called Ashley Charlize Theron and tells Rudy how much he's looking forward to meeting up with her when he's released. Rudy replies that he's simply looking forward to going home and enjoying some pecan pie and hot chocolate.Shortly before he's due to leave prison Nick gets killed in a mass brawl during which he also saves Rudy's life but as Ashley knows nothing of this she waits outside the prison for him on the day when he's scheduled to be released. When Rudy leaves the prison and sees the beautiful Ashley he decides to assume Nick's identity and the two of them then leave for a passionate evening at a nearby motel. Their fun soon comes to an abrupt end however when Ashley's psychopathic brother Gabriel Gary Sinise and his gang suddenly turn up.Gabriel knows from reading Nick's correspondence that he used to work at a casino and now wants to make use of his knowledge of the business to enable him and his gang to rob the place. Rudy tries to explain that he's not Nick but Gabriel won't believe him and Rudy soon realises that even if he convinces Gabriel that he's not Nick he will probably be shot because as Rudy he would be of no value to Gabriel. A series of rapid developments follow and Rudy winds up participating in the casino heist with the rest of the gang who are all dressed in Santa Claus outfits. Further surprises then follow before Rudy's nightmare finally comes to an end.Reindeer Games gets off to a really intriguing start when the dead bodies of a number of Santa Clauses are seen lying in the snow and the story that led up to this situation is then told in flashback. The plot twists that follow produce a number of funny and surprising situations until the story finally concludes in a way which doesn't really bear too much scrutiny.Ben Affleck is tremendous as the unfortunate Rudy who after making a bad decision to impersonate Nick finds himself in more trouble and danger than he could ever have imagined. Charlize Theron is consistently good as the femme fatale who goes through a number of shocking changes and Gary Sinise looks incredibly evil and menacing as the villain of the piece.".

Reindeer Games lacks brains lacks credibility lacks fun and lacks energy. It has nothing but an ending of blatantly moronic twists straight out of an episode of ScoobyDoo.Long story short it's a Razzie nominee if there ever was one.

So seldom are action movies invested with any sort of novelty or wit nowadays that it is sad to imagine some people may actually enjoy this film.  After solid work on RONIN another John Frankenheimer thriller seemed promising but it is every bit as bad as his ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU.  Crude unnatural camera angles.  Awkward performances from all involved and a sloppy repetitive plot that exploits its audience in the most insulting way.  Why does Chelize Theron take her clothes off twice in this movie?  Why is it that Gary Sinise is walking around in sleeveless shirts all the time in the middle of Winter?  Perhaps because he appears to have been working out and wanted to show off?  The entire plot consists of a juvenile mistaken identity gag played over and over as Sinise holds a gun to Affleck's head every fifteen minutes and threatens to kill him before instead changing his mind and agreeing to let him live.  The entire movie is one big mess penned by the writer of Arlington Road and Scream 3.  Ehren Kreuger is shaping up to be Hollywood's king of plot holes just the same way Akiva Goldsman became the king of bad Hollywood oneliners.  But the biggest letdown is Frankenheimer who should have known better than to take on this pathetic project.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unbelievably implausible action crime thriller where Affleck the film's hero seems to be the luckiest released convict on the planet considering how much time he spends with a gun pointed at him always escaping a sure bullet to the head must help a group of nasty vile thugs Gary Sinise Danny Trejo Clarence William III and Donal Logue rob the wintry casino of Dennis Farina his recent death was the reason I watched this again to tell you the truth. All of this comes about when Affleck substituting for a man played by James Frain stabbed with a shiv in prison who was his cellmate meets the author Charlize Theron of letters pinned for Frain read to him. Affleck himself fell in love with Theron through those letters but it isn't long before he's accosted by Sinise's brood and expected to help them rob a casino. This film has twothree twists that challenge any existing credibility that remains left over from entire ridiculous sequences that rescue Affleck from certain death and there are multiple longwinded expository backandforths between heavies and Affleck endlessly explaining Haha I got you! The last one involving Frain and Theron was the straw that broke the camels back for me. I could barely swallow the James Bond delays in killing off Affleck with the film's villains finding convoluted means to bump him off just so the screenplay could allow him plenty of time to come up with an escape plan. All of this said time has mellowed me quite a bit towards Affleck. I like him a lot now and his performance in the film didn't bother me at all. He has some fun actors to work off of. Sinise lays it on mighty thick but the part requires lots of psychopathic tendencies. Of course Clarence seemed to remain in employment just because he could play with relative ease those coldblooded heels that accompany the likes of Sinise's ringleaderhe always had the look casting director's must relish when a human monster is required. Logue seems out of place if we look at his career after this particular film while Trejo can just appear and convince as a bruiser willingly following this rogue's gallery of homicidal scumbags. Thankfully Frankenheimer's direction has lots of energy and pizazz attempting to compensate for a screenplay that tests our tolerance for character stupidity. Theron like she was in 2 Days in the Valley 1996 is a feast for the eyes and libido at this point in her career but the twists regarding her ulterior motives as it pertains to the heist were just too much for me personally. She can play the bitch though there's no denying that. At least the ending is gratifying in that all the criminals get their just desserts and they all deserve what they get for being so dumb.".

There are so many good things about Reindeer Games I don't know where to begin.The script was well done because it kept me guessing as to what will happen next and who might be the real villain. The plot is enticing and the direction is so good that I had to remember it was a movie. It seemed very real and they were shooting it as it was occurring. The best part about Reindeer Games is that it is not all action or all drama or even romance but that it is an equal balance of all three which is very nice to see in a movie like this.I was extremely impressed with Charlize Theron's performance because she proved she had the stuff to make it on her own. With every scene she was in Theron brought a presence that most actresses don't have. She is an actress that will cause everyone to sit up and take notice and hang on her every word.Gary Sinise plays a man intent on robbing a casino however he needs Affleck's expertise. Sinise was one reason I wanted to watch Reindeer Games.Reindeer Games is filled with action twists turns and strong performances that is sure to stay in my mind forever.

	schema:reviewBody "A well filmed movie of the tense contest for the World Championship between Soviet player Akiva Liebeskind undoubtedly modeled after International Grandmaster Akiba Rubenstein a magnificent master of the endgame originally a rabbinical student in Poland who never quite made it to the World Championship level and declined into mental illness and Liebeskind's challenger Grandmaster Pavius Fromm almost certainly named after From of the From's Gambit in chess.  Fromm a Lithuanian political exile from behind the Iron Curtain is an arrogant dislikeable pawn of the Soviets who have kept his wife prisoner.  Virtually unrecognizable are their wives the once lovely Leslie Caron and Swedish star Liv Ullman who have little more than bit parts.Personally as a chessplayer who has been struggling to find the secret of chess for almost 30 years it was made clear that Grandmasters of chess see farther than us ordinary mortals when Liebeskind analyzes his strategy to win the next game with the final coup by moving a Rook to the square G10! The chessboard has only 8x8 squares.  Many incidents from the real history of chess are keyed into the script.  When analyzing a game with his team he objects to a player putting a cigarette to his mouth.  But it is not lit! his friend replies.  Yes says Liebeskind but it is well known that in chess the threat is greater than the execution.  A quote right from Emmanuel Lasker World Champion for 27 years.  And this actualy occurred in a top level chess match when a player put an unlit cigar in his mouth and his opponent protested.When each player's team brings in a parapsychologist to stare down or even hypnotize his the opponent there are vigorous protests.  Exactly what happened in a match in Baguio City the Phillipines when World Champion Anatoly Karpov's team brought parapsychologist Dr. Zharkov from Moscow to stare down the challenger dissident and escapee from the Soviet Union Viktor Korchnoi.  Korchnoi lost the match.In the end I found the script of this move poorly written disappointing in the ending well acted and portraying the world of chess and a World Championship contest reasonably well.  One jarring note was the large number and rows of empty seats in the auditorium where the World Championship was being played.  In the real world every seat would have been taken and overflow audiences would have been in auxiliary rooms watching on TV with commentary from other GM's unheard by the players.  Did the producers just try to save a few pennies but not hiring enough extras to fill the seats? Hard to understand when clearly this was an expensive and lavish film portrayal of a World Chess Championship.Almost a good movie. As a long time chessplayer I am glad I watched it. I cannot recommend it as worthwhile for general audiences.".

It is based around a very simple storyline. A chess match. The two main players in the world. Both russians. Two generations fighting against each other and also two visions of the world. The oldest generation who stayed and endured the last 50 years of Russian history. The younger one who left but not unscathed. For them only one thing matters  Chess but for the outside world and their entourage many other things come into account propaganda money etc... From the actors to the plot I cannot find any default with it. It is soberly and superbly played by Michel Piccoli it is probably the only film where I really liked him and the whole cast is a marvel. To be seen absolutely !!!".

The main characters are hard to like due to little construction and the acting is way over the top with Paviusthe young one. The personal dramas were interesting but presented in a sort of confusing way that there was not time to understand what was going on. Frankly if you are interested in chess and films you may see it for curiosity but not for quality or entertainment. Chess is fascinating and Im sure that you could a good movie out of this one maybe a remake?".

One can read it as a brilliant chapter in the cold war's time the original Soviet communist vs. the Lithuanian enemy of the proletarian revolution. As if it's the eastern block vs. the western world. Then it's a battle of minds between the old generation who believed in something and fought for it and the young one who rebelled against the first fighting for the opposite. So it is as well the wise old vs. the riotous young. The differences between the 2 main characters are catchy and wellmade. One is mystic who loves to unite with nature great scene with only music for him enjoying sailing as if it's a spiritual fun. And the other is more materialistic with hot pace and temper enough to remember his leather jacket and motorcycle. I loved the pace it's meditative and exciting in the same time which is very hard to achieve by the way. Still the scene of seeking help by external factors to affect the players is smartly comic to the max that Indian guru who controls minds is pure comedy. The 2 lead actors played their roles in iconic way if you will. However nothing is better than the end of it. Simply this film wins immortality by not relaying only on the cold war situation back then yet it dives into deeper layer to make it essentially a conflict between just humans who wants to assure themselves in the thing they love. Notice well how it doesn't eventually choose a winner or a loser too because the game is on and the conflict is forever between the older and the younger. It's how the film  so intelligently  will live for more and more being suitable to watch anytime or anyplace it outlived the cold war itself already. So it is satisfying whether as politically philosophically or  and that's the most important  as a good effective drama in the first place where you can watch it only as a thrilling movie about a crucial game of chess between the smartest 2 guys on earth!

Il tuo Vizio... has quite daring visuals for one hour Martino's usual trademark in his early 70's works  wild camera angles edgy editing. Then it suddendly cools down as the story sticks around with the Black Cat thing.The screenplay developped a maniac on the loose killing young girls again in a very nasty way gore galore! while Anita Strindberg fights with drunken  debauched husband Luigi Pistilli. he's a no good writer who writes all night...only one sentence over and over. Then comes sexy Edwige Fenech who stands for Strinberg's cause...before sleeping with her husband and the delivery man. Lesbian scenes straight scenes stuntsssex scenes murders scenes sex again then murders...this is a very well known territory that brings up finally some good surprises in the end.This is definitely Anita Strindberg's best work to date. She is absolutely fantastic as the cheated wife who goes over the edge showing every human emotion with a professionalism rarely seen on the screen. Too bad her career went dry after 1975 she was a real winner here with great acting capabilities. Miss Fenech got a THEOREMlike character but still very eager to drop every clothes she got. She gets a very bitchy part here which is very unsual in her career as she went along either with victims characters or sexy ones. Oh and there's still weird Ivan Rassimov as the mysterious stranger as usual snooping around Strindberg's house  he was already  in Martino's previous TUTTI I COLORI DEL BUIO.Apart from the screenplay's weaknesses and incapacity of bringing something fresh and new to the Poe's story this Martino flick is quite memorable and fun to watch.But as it tries to link several genres it really doesn't know where to go and who to please and finally ends up as a curisoity from the 70's.

	schema:headline " Definitely Sergio Martino's most memorable Giallo";
	schema:reviewBody "From 1970 to 1973 Sergio Martino directed fife Gialli. The best known of the bunch certainly is I Corpi Presentano Tracce di Violenza Carnale better known as Torso. La Code dello Scorpione aka The Case of the Scorpion's Tail is also quite well known among fans. Lo Strano Vizio della Signora Wardh aka Blade of the Ripper is less known as is the psychedelic Tutti i Colori del Buio aka They're Coming to Get You and Day of the Maniac.But the least known and also rarest of the bunch is Il Tuo Vizio... known also under its English titles Gently Before She Dies Excite Me and Eye of the Black Cat. It's really a shame that this fine effort hasn't reached a broad audience of Giallo admirers yet. Because it's a masterly and highly original Giallo whose plot mixes the two types of Giallo a mysterious killer murders one victim after the other in order to keep his or her secret  a troubled couple from which one half  mostly together with his or her lover  wants to get rid of the other permanently which spawns intrigues distrust and of course murder with elements of Edgar Allan Poe's probably most filmed story the thoroughly Gothic The Black Cat.The result is astonishing It works perfectly. Even towards the climax which is more Poeoriented Martino manages to startle the audience with extremely surprising for the genre typical twists. And the twists work very well. The first half is more Giallooriented and delivers some gory murder scenes and the unevitable tickling sexy moments.The cast is also excellent consisting of a group of Giallo regulars. Anita Strindberg and Edwige Fenech the latter in an unusual genre role for her lead the female cast Luigi Pistilli giving an outrageously daring performance and Ivan Rassimov lead the male. They all fit perfectly into their roles. Not to forget Bruno Nicolai's score which probably marks his most versatile sound track ever.All in all a wonderful genre outing a unique thriller using all wellknown rules of the Giallo and yet giving them fresh turns and twists. An easy 10 out of 10 highly recommended.".

Lo Strano Vizio della Signora Wardh aka Blade of the Ripper is less known as is the psychedelic Tutti i Colori del Buio aka They're Coming to Get You and Day of the Maniac.But the least known and also rarest of the bunch is Il Tuo Vizio... known also under its English titles Gently Before She Dies Excite Me and Eye of the Black Cat. It's really a shame that this fine effort hasn't reached a broad audience of Giallo admirers yet. Because it's a masterly and highly original Giallo whose plot mixes the two types of Giallo a mysterious killer murders one victim after the other in order to keep his or her secret  a troubled couple from which one half  mostly together with his or her lover  wants to get rid of the other permanently which spawns intrigues distrust and of course murder with elements of Edgar Allan Poe's probably most filmed story the thoroughly Gothic The Black Cat.The result is astonishing It works perfectly. Even towards the climax which is more Poeoriented Martino manages to startle the audience with extremely surprising for the genre typical twists. And the twists work very well. The first half is more Giallooriented and delivers some gory murder scenes and the unevitable tickling sexy moments.The cast is also excellent consisting of a group of Giallo regulars. Anita Strindberg and Edwige Fenech the latter in an unusual genre role for her lead the female cast Luigi Pistilli giving an outrageously daring performance and Ivan Rassimov lead the male. They all fit perfectly into their roles. Not to forget Bruno Nicolai's score which probably marks his most versatile sound track ever.All in all a wonderful genre outing a unique thriller using all wellknown rules of the Giallo and yet giving them fresh turns and twists. An easy 10 out of 10 highly recommended.";

Like most Poe adaptations the film shares little with its source material apart from the presence of the titular black cat here named Satan. While it is chocked full of narrative stumbles and frustrating red herrings Martino's refusal to bend to the genre rules of the giallo makes Your Vice an extremely interesting entry into the genre avoiding being bogged down with drawnout set pieces and mindbending visuals and instead focusing on the psychological  and physical  interplay between its two leads.Bored writer Oliviero Luigi Pistilli spends the majority of his time throwing drug and alcoholfuelled parties for the local hippies and enjoys mentally and physically abusing his long suffering wife Irina Anita Strindberg in front of them. When a young student is brutally murdered on the night she had arranged to meet Oliviero the wifebeating pig naturally becomes the prime suspect and withdraws into a state of deep paranoia at his labyrinthine mansion. When their maid also shows up dead Oliviero and Irina hide the body just before the arrival of his niece Floriana Edwige Fenech. Floriana is a confident and wise young woman and hatches a plan with Irina to deal with her abusive husband. But not all is as it seems and just who is the handsome greyhaired man lurking behind every corner?Far from your average giallo Your Vice... doesn't subvert the genre but frequently surprises. The plot and ludicrous climax like most gialli seem not be taken from the yellowcovered pulp fiction they are normally adapted from but something akin to an episode of Scooby Doo. While that may seem like a criticism it really isn't  it's the type of insanity that makes these movies so much fun to watch. Bolstered by a fantastic score by Bruno Nicolai and lavish cinematography by Giancarlo Ferrando they are nonetheless overshadowed by Fenech surely one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the screen. Floriana is a nononsense welltravelled lady and just when you think you have her worked out the film throws in a surprising if in no way believable twist. It may not be remembered as Martino's best entry into the genre 1973's Torso is certainly up there but Your Vice... throws in enough twists and turns to keep it consistently entertaining and occasionally disturbing.".

Indeed this film's title was copped from a line of dialogue in Mrs. Wardh. This time around though the story mainly concerns a decadent writer Oliviero well played by Luigi Pistilli who spends most of his days drinking booze and abusing his wife giallo regular Anita Strindberg both physically and emotionally. While a wave of murders sweeps through their small town Oliviero's niece pays a visit and so we finally get to see our Edwige a full 12 hour into the picture. Gorgeous as always Edwige here sports a shorthaired bob for a change but looks smashing still. Anyway truth to tell I had no idea where this picture was going for at least the first hour. The film concludes very neatly though with some nifty surprises and always keeps the viewer intrigued by combining a truly decadent atmosphere with bits of Poe's The Black Cat echoes of Clouzot's Diabolique 1955 some jolting murders softcore lesbianism and typical for gialli some red herrings. The fine folks at No Shame have come up with yet another greatlooking DVD package containing recent interviews with both Martino and Fenech. Edwige's interview suggests that the woman has made some kind of unholy pact with the devil himself no woman could possibly look as beautiful at 57 as she does today. Just remarkable!".

When one of his mistresses is found brutally murdered the suspicions of both the police and his wife fall on Oliviero whose problems are confounded by the arrival of Floriana Edwige Fenech his young and beautiful niece with an unclear agenda.Following on from the success of his earlier gialli with the name being a reference to 'The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh 1971' director Sergio Martino presents this sleazy violent and thoroughly nasty film which experiments with new ideas and style while remaining true to the elements of his previous work that yielded such positive results. The story is awash with complexity and subtext lacking the famed ambiguity of some similar films yet with a unique and pronounced outlandishness that serves to augment the resplendent qualities by providing distraction from the more orthodox traits of the story. Perhaps unusually for the genre characterisation is fundamental as each character becomes progressively defined and both their motivations and psychological status come to be analysed and as such this aspect is as integral to the film as any other. Themes such as misogynism sadomasochism the treatment of sex as a weapon voyeurism and most notably a trenchant concentration on the Oedipuscomplex add substance and depth to the characters and story in an area of cinema often criticised for not having such and even the motivations of an ominous cat fittingly named Satan become important as the events unfurl. The narrative moves at a slow deliberate pace perpetually ripening twisting and turning leading us to believe one thing before proving the untruth and even changing genres to a point. All of this builds up to a rapid chain of events towards the end that seek to overturn everything we already know and this leads to a mostly satisfying if somewhat predictable climax.'Vice' is also a stylistic treat. Martino collaborates with cinematographer Giancarlo Ferrando and composer Bruno Nicolai and the three ensure that the visual and audible elements of the film are near perfect. The beauty of the film is predominantly founded upon the malevolent aspects of the storyline. The chronic use of darkness and shadow help to create a mesmerising yet distinctly intimidating and alarming atmosphere invoking uncomfortable feelings of trepidation while the tension and suspense is allowed to build to boiling point. Violence is filmed in such a way that the loathsome nature of the act is harnessed with erratic camerawork and quick splices of cruelty while the bloody aftermaths are displayed to full gruesome effect. Sex is treated ostensibly and despite a poetic presentation there is often an unquestionably vile and repugnant aura to the act which becomes more discernible as events progress. One particular stylistic flourish sees a quick insertion of the menacing cat's eyes during scenes becoming more frequent to the end and perhaps used symbolically to represent the mental breakdowns of the characters and the relationship breakdown between Oliviero and Irina. Furthermore these quick flashes of menace coupled with several darkened sequences involving the snarling and vicious cat add a disorienting effect and engender yet more discomfort from the viewer. The subtle use of the soundtrack which mostly comprises soft unostentatiously elegant music blends with the visuals in a pleasing manner and helps to control the ambiance unobtrusively.The somewhat predictable conclusion is perhaps the most glaring shortcoming. Those who have seen Martino's earlier gialli may regard one particular aspect of the end as indicative of being formulaic while those who recognise the principal influence for the story will be less surprised at the eventual outcome. These are minor complaints but worthy of note. Vice could also be criticised for being a characterdriven film that leaves several key questions unanswered. One could theorise as to why this is but perhaps the most likely explanation is that Martino wished for there to remain an element of mystery. Whether this is welcome or unwelcome will no doubt depend on the subjectivity of the audience. Criticisms aside 'Vice' is fine filmmaking and certainly ranks amongst the genres elite as Sergio Martino once again excels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even by gialli standards this movie is pretty offthewall but it is also strangely enough probably the most faithful adaption of the Edgar Allen Poe story The Black Cat that I have ever seen. There is a bit of a gender role reversal where it is the wife who is tormented by the black cat named Satan which is the cherished pet of her cruel alcoholic husband. The motherobsessed husband takes out his writer's block on his longsuffering spouse and may be responsible for a string of serial killings. Thrown into the mix is a black maid who seems to only be in the movie so the sleazy characters can make a lot of racist offensive comments about heroh yeah and also so she can get naked. And speaking of getting naked Edwige Fenech also shows up as the husband's sexy conniving niece and demonstrates once again her extreme aversion to wearing clothes. In between nude scenes however Fenech really seems to be doing some acting this time and she plays against type here as a villain rather than a victim. She seduces both her uncle AND her aunt and pretty much everyone else in the movie with the possible exception of Satan the cat.Not that this is a good movie. It has an idiotic subplot where Fenech has an affair with a goofylooking motorcross racer for no apparent reason other than to pad the running length with some racing footage that would do a lot better in a sports video than in a giallo. The movie also isn't nearly as well directed as some of Sergio Martino's other gialli like Torso or All the Colors of Darkness also with Fenech. And Martinoregular Ivan Rassimov is tragically wasted in a perfunctory role. Still even a bad MartinoFenech giallo is not without its charms. And if you're an Edgar Allen Poe fan you'll especially enjoy this one.".

She seduces both her uncle AND her aunt and pretty much everyone else in the movie with the possible exception of Satan the cat.Not that this is a good movie. It has an idiotic subplot where Fenech has an affair with a goofylooking motorcross racer for no apparent reason other than to pad the running length with some racing footage that would do a lot better in a sports video than in a giallo. The movie also isn't nearly as well directed as some of Sergio Martino's other gialli like Torso or All the Colors of Darkness also with Fenech. And Martinoregular Ivan Rassimov is tragically wasted in a perfunctory role. Still even a bad MartinoFenech giallo is not without its charms. And if you're an Edgar Allen Poe fan you'll especially enjoy this one.";

	schema:reviewBody "Before I first saw Sergio Martino's masterpiece Il Tuo vizio  una stanza chiusa e solo io ne ho la chiave aka. Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key of 1972 my expectations were already high. I already was a great fan of director Martino whose other Gialli The Strange Vice Of Mrs Wardh Torso The Scorpion's Tail and All Colors Of The Dark were entirely fantastic films and since this film is a Giallo loosely based on the writings of the almighty Edgar Alan Poe I was sure it would be excellent. Even so this brilliant gem surpassed my greatest hopes. Not only is Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key a film with an awesome title and by far Martino's greatest film. This instant personal favorite is an absolutely ingenious and astonishing masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest Gialli ever brought to screen. The beauty of The Strange Vice Of Mrs. Wardh the compelling plot of The Scorpion's Tail the genuine nastiness of Torso or the delightful insanity of All Colors Of The Night...  Your Vice Is A Locked Room... combines all the great elements of Martino's other films and even improves on them. This film is brilliant in all aspects and an absolute mustsee that no lover of Italian Genrecinema or Horrorfan in general could possibly afford to miss.Oliviero Rouvigni played by the great Luigi Pistilli a burnedout and alcoholic writer lives in a rural mansion with his beautiful wife Irina Anita Strindberg whom he likes to maltreat and publicly humiliate in front of his eccentric friends. After one of their decadent parties a girl gets brutally butchered in the small nearby town...I would love to further discuss the compelling plot of this ingenious film but the film is simply too precious a gem for any Horror fan to spoil even a tiny bit of it. The film has one of the most excellent ensemble casts ever in a Giallo. Luigi Pistilli doubtlessly one of the greatest character actors in Italian genrecinema delivers one of his most brilliant performances as the drunken and rude writer. Equally great is Anita Strindberg as his intimidated and submissive wife. None other than the ravishing genregoddess Edwige Fenech shines in the role of Oliviero's sexy niece Floriana. Fenech is probably the most important siren of 70s Eurocult and she is once again stunningly beautiful irresistibly seductive and just plain brilliant in this film in my opinion the greatest she has ever been part of. Furtermore the cast includes the alwayssinister Ivan Rassimov in a supporting role. All of the aforementioned actors also worked with director Martino on other occasions and this collaboration gets the best out of all of them. Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key is a film that should appeal to all fans of Italian cultcinema be it lovers of the more artistic or the sleazier kind of films I tend to like the combination of both best. The film is full of delightful sleaze. The sadomasochistic relationship between Oliviero and Irina is perverted and demented the female cast members all have a tendency to get naked and the gruesome murders are genuinely nasty and gory. The film also has a delightfully creepy atmosphere and is brilliantly photographed. The settings are beautiful and often eerie alike the mesmerizing score by Bruno Nicolai is sublime and the performances are among the best ever in Italian Horror cinema. The story is fascinating from the first minute and the film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning to the end. One of the finest examples of Giallo this film is full of clever unpredictable twists and the suspense does not stop for a second. In short Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key is a masterpiece in all regards an absolute priority for every Horror fan and lover of Cultcinema to see and without exaggeration one of the most essential and brilliant Gialli ever made! 1010!".

	schema:reviewBody "Uniquely bizarre and experimental giallo from the masterful hand of Sergio Martino who delivered 4 other gialloclassics in only 3 years time The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh Case of the Scorpion's Tail All the Colors of the Dark and Torso. This gem is perhaps the least overwhelming one of the bunch but it definitely is the most dared film and probably also the most intelligent one since Martino mixed the passionatemurder plot with Edgar Allen Poe's legendary story The Black Cat. The result is a stylish oldfashioned giallo with clever twists and genuine suspense. Oliviero Rouvigny is a hateful unsuccessful writer who enjoys humiliating his wife Irena in public and to openly cheat on her with multiple mistresses. When one of these girls is found brutally murdered Oliviery becomes the prime suspect. When another girl turns up dead even inside Oliviery's mansion it gets really difficult to believe in his innocence. The fragile relationship between Oliviery and Irene is brought down even further when attractive niece Floriana comes to visit. She plays the married couple off against each other by seducing them both. Despite a couple of graphically illustrated murders Your Vice is a Locked Room etc... mostly depends on the uncanny atmosphere and the disturbing sub themes. Oliviery suffers from a mild Oedipus complex whereas Irena has a severe phobia for her hubbie's black cat. The acting performances are fantastic notably because this type of cinema isn't exactly known for its splendid acting. Edwige Fenech stars in an unusual role as shrew but she's terrific and looks ultimately sexy. Fenech is somewhat a gialloregular and worked with some of the most eminent directors in the field like Mario Bava 5 Dolls for an August Moon Andrea Bianchi Strip Nude for your Killer and twice more with Sergio Martino All the Colors of the Dark The Strange Case of Mrs. Wardh. Luigi Pistilli Bay of Blood Iguana with the Tongue of Fire is particularly impressive in the ungrateful role of sadistic macho Oliviery and Anita Strindberg Who Saw Her Die? Lizard in Woman's Skin is equally convincing as his tormented wife. The camerawork is enchanting with a some truly imaginative angles and the musical guidance by Bruno Nicolai sends extra chills down your spine. Highly recommended!".

In this respect it recalls The House with Laughing Windows 1976 although this movie is a more straightahead giallo in its execution. I would say it's probably a third giallo thriller a third intense melodrama and a third erotica. In truth the mysterythriller aspect is quite low in the mix for a film of this type with the melodrama getting at least as much attention. The sensual side of things is ramped up here as well with a particularly ravishing turn from giallo queen Edwige Fenech as a visiting niece who is a bit of a bad girl. It is also not above simply being nuts a good example of this being the freelove hippy gathering at the beginning complete with a bizarre singalong. Typically though for a Martino giallo the murders are pretty violent and the look of the film is pretty lush. On occasion he delivers something especially memorable my favourite being the bike crash which is expertly shot and unusually edited. One slight weakness is perhaps the score by the normally reliable Bruno Nicolai it has its moments for sure but is often a little ponderous.This is good stuff really. It definitely feels a little different to the average giallo in the way it focuses on slightly different things yet at the same time still falling squarely into the realm of the subgenre so it essentially delivers what you want but with a twist.".

	schema:reviewBody "This the fourth Giallo to be directed by Sergio Martino between the years 1971 and 1973 is one of the best Italian horror films that I've seen and a must for cult fans! I saw Sergio Martino's excellent The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh recently and although I wasn't expecting as much from Your Vice is a Locked Door and Only I Have the Key I was surprised to find that it might even be better than the aforementioned Giallo classic! The film takes it's ridiculously long title from a written phrase in The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh but it's plot comes mostly from Edgar Allen Poe's classic story 'The Black Cat'. The way that the film uses Poe's story is unlike any other film that's used it before and that is one of the reasons why this is such a great film. Sergio Martino fuses Poe's backdrop with a ruralset Giallo plot line which follows burnt out alcoholic writer Oliviero Rouvigny as he starts a decent into madness when one of his mistresses is found brutally slaughtered. Things heat up again when his niece Floriana turns up and ends up pitting him against his wife Irena in order for her to get what she came for.Edwige Fenech is undoubtedly a beautiful woman and that has never been truer than in this film! I've seen her in a few films but her short hair cut here puts her on a whole different level and even if she'd never made another film she'd be one of the stars of cult cinema just for her appearance here. The cute little actress is more than just a pretty face too as she more than holds her own in the excellent central trio. Luigi Pistilli from Mario Bava's Bay of Blood is great as the lead male while Anita Strindberg 'Who Saw Her Die?' comes out of nowhere and ends taking the lead in the final third. It's not just Edwige providing the beauty here either the cinematography is incredible and Sergio Martino ensures that Your Vice looks gorgeous throughout and the music courtesy of Bruno Nicolai completes the assault on the senses. The plot is very open with most of it coming from character interactions rather than actual plot points. This actually does the film a favour however as the characters are well defined and all their motives make sense. It's not all that bloody...but Your Vice is so invigorating that it hardly matters. If you're into cult films  don't miss this one!".

In fact about 80 of the film is scenes of the husband slapping around or otherwise abusing and humiliating his wife. There's also some serious Freudian issues going on in this household as DrunkWriter also has some sort of strange fixation on his dead mother and it is inferred that their relationship was a little deeper that your average motherson familial bonds. To make matters sleazier Drunky's smokin' hot niece who also plays the title role in Martino's THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH comes to town and starts sleeping with both Drunky and Mrs. PunchingBag to further her own ends. Throw in some murders that happen in and around the happy couple's home including their maid and one of Drunky's mistresses... some prying cops a few redherrings and some obvious nod to Edgar Allen Poe's THE BLACK CAT and THE TELLTALE HEART and there ya have it...YOUR VICE...isn't as good as THE STRANGE VICE but still has a lot going for it. Decent story some but not nearly enough... tits and ass and a few decent kill scenes. Definitely recommended for the giallo fan and another strong entry from Martino. 810".

Throw in some murders that happen in and around the happy couple's home including their maid and one of Drunky's mistresses... some prying cops a few redherrings and some obvious nod to Edgar Allen Poe's THE BLACK CAT and THE TELLTALE HEART and there ya have it...YOUR VICE...isn't as good as THE STRANGE VICE but still has a lot going for it. Decent story some but not nearly enough... tits and ass and a few decent kill scenes. Definitely recommended for the giallo fan and another strong entry from Martino. 810";

'The Black Cat' is a horrifying tale on a sidenote Norwegian cartoonist Steffen Kverneland made a wonderful adaptation of and mixing it with two subplots is only partly successful really. Nice try though.Whats good about this is the two female leads Edwige Fenech is the most sexy woman outside Russ Meyers films and she does a good job here. Anita Strindberg who plays the agonized wife on the other hand truly excels in the role playing well on all the strings her role requires. The way she is treated by her husband got me real angry so I guess he did a good role as well if not unsympatethic.Oh and the score by Bruno Nicolai ain't bad either.".

All the major players are jerks so you don't feel too bad when they each meet their own welldeserved fatenot that this necessarily means they all die. However you have to laugh at an inspector working with a patrolman to learn the nature of a complaint about possible cat abusethat's a sorry way to move a story along.The gore effects are more bloody than gory but they're not bad. I was disappointed when the plot hit the fork in the road and went down the wrong trail. But this is still a good film to see if you're into gialli as I am.".

Plus Edwige Fenech! Anita Strinberg is the bitter abused wife of drunken novelist Luigi Pistilli and often suffers from his violence and humiliation mostly in front of a bunch of hippy jerks from a nearby commune. Luigi has recently lost his mum and is a bit messed up about it even though local folklore has her as a whore who loved to receive expensive jewellery from her lovers. Luigi also likes to get it on with his black maid and a young chick from the local bookstore.Further troubles to add to Anita's miserable life is the black cat that Luigi owns called Satan who constantly follows Anita around and attacks her plus the sickle wielding murderer who is now slashing his way through the female cast. Worst still Luigi's niece Edwige Fenech turns up as a randy hippy! Look out Luigi! And Anita! And the local delivery guy! I forgot to mention Ivan Rassimov who is hanging around staring at things and has white hair which is never explained.This is a very well handled film that balances Luigi Pistilli's madness and violent abuse of Anita with a giallo plot which is solved well before the end! plus other elements of the old 'inheritance' plot. It's not overly violent but Edwige Fenech adds to the sleaze with her everything goes character and I'm sure Luigi never regretted 'mashing her paps' as it were.There's much more going on here than I'm letting on. Martino seems to grasp what folks want from a giallo and duly provides but it's his next film that almost reaches perfection which is the film Torso.".

There's even an acknowledgment that the film is inspired by The Black Cat in the opening credits.. His wife Irina Anita Strindberg from Lizard in a Woman's Skin and Who Saw Her Die? suffers his abuses but never more so than when he gathers hippies together for confrontational parties. He makes everyone pour all of their wine into a bowl and forces her to drink it then humiliates their black servant Brenda until one of the party goers starts singing and everyone joins in then gets naked. This scene is beyond strange and must be experienced. Luckily I found the link for you but trust me  it's NSFW.The only person that Oliviero seems to love is Satan the cat that belonged to his dead mother. A black cat that talks throughout every scene he's in his constant meows led to my cats communicating with the TV. God only knows what a 1970's giallo cat said but it seems like his words spoke directly to their hearts.One of Oliviero's mistresses is found dead near the house but he hides her body. The police suspect him as does his wife. Adding to the tension is the fact that Irina hates Satan who only seems to care about messing with her beloved birds.Remember that servant? Well she's dead now but not before she walks around half naked in Oliviero's mother's dress while he watches from the other room. She barely makes it to Irina's room before she collapses covered in blood. Blood that Satan the cat has no problem walking through! He refuses to call the police as he doesn't want any more suspicion. He asks his wife to help him get rid of the body.Oliviero's niece Floriana Edwige Fenech pretty much the queen of the giallo is in town for a visit learning how Oliviero hasn't been able to write one sentence over and over again for three years stuck in writer's block and predating The Shining by 5 years in book form and 8 years away from Kubrick's film. Unlike everyone else who tolerates Oliviero's behavior or ignores it Floriana sees right through the bullshit. The writer is used to seducing every woman he meets and she initially rebuffs him even asking if it's true that Oliviero used to sleep with his mother. He angrily asks if it's true that she's a twobit whore. Those would be two bits worth spending is her caustic reply.Irina confides all of her pain to Floriana as the two become lovers. And another girl gets murdered  perhaps by Oliviero. Then a dirt bike racer comes to drop off milk and hit on Floriana.

Luigi Pistilli A Bay of Blood plays Oliviero a washed up author living on a villa with his very put upon and frazzled wife Irina Anita Strindberg. Irinas' neuroses soon manifest themselves in her antagonistic relationship with Olivieros' black cat amusingly named Satan while assorted characters occasionally get murdered on or around the premises. Complicating matters is the arrival of Olivieros' sultry niece Floriana genre star Edwige Fenech.Martinos' film does go on longer than it needs to with a subplot about Florianas' romance with a delivery man  motorbike racer not really adding anything to the story. It might disappoint viewers hoping for more sleaze or a higher body count or more flamboyant stylistics. It actually functions more as a character study and portrait of a descent into debauchery for Oliviero and madness for Irina. This domestic drama is interesting stuff with some pointed dialogue but the film is never more fun than when it's giving in to the more exploitative tendencies of the genre. To that end viewers will be satisfied with some lesbian sex and nudity and some pretty good but never overdone gore. Bruno Nicolai composed the wonderful music score and this benefits further from the location shooting and photography. Those opening credits are particularly well done. This definitely hits its stride once Fenech shows up and the story more closely follows the classic Poe tale.The acting is solid from all concerned Ivan Rassimov plays a mystery man named Walter Franco Nebbia the standard police inspector character you always get in this sort of entertainment with special mention going out to Ms. Strindberg. You do feel pretty bad for this lady given the treatment that she must put up with. Fenech is at her absolute sexiest.Enjoyable for fans of the genre.Seven out of 10.".

Martino's stylish direction is one of the film's strengths but the script is a little sub par particularly in the middle section of the movie which seems to be propelled by endless sex scenes more than anything else. Things do pick up the last half hour where it gets very good with some shocking plot twists and turns and it's a pity the rest of the film wasn't of the same quality.As with so many productions the script is based on Poe's short story THE BLACK CAT although this is only an incidental part of the narrative as these things go. There's a cast here who give fine performances particularly the stylish and sultry Edwige Fenech who captivates the screen throughout and keeps the viewer guessing as to her character's motivations. Anita Strindberg is an arresting presence as the abused wife while Luigi Pistilli is thoroughly horrible as her cruel husband. Genre favourite Ivan Rassimov also has a small but pivotal role.".

A wonderful combination of Martino's previous Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh and Poe's The Black Cat. It's more along the lines of a Hammer Horror film with brooding Gothic atmosphere and suspense that will keep the viewers on the edge of their seat all the way to the heart stopping climax. The film also counts with a haunting score by Bruno Nicolai as well as the presence of Edwige Fenech who again seems reluctant to keep her clothes on for at least 3 minutes. Still it is Anita Strindberg who steals the scene as a traumatized hysterical housewife and her lesbian love scenes with Edwige doesn't hurt either. Overall 9.5  10 for me. Absolute classic.".

The opening scene of the shining with its long camera shot with haunting music can be seen here at the ending.It is pity that many of them in this world are not aware of this film. Also to be noted that this film came 8 years before The Shining was released. This is a great movie for Martino because it has great score and has a classic horror movie atmosphere as it has been extensively shot inside an eerie mansion. I think it pays a great homage to Sir Alfred Hitchcock and Edgar Allen Poe. Apart from all these it contains all the other essentials like murdersex and suspense which completes a giallo. Overall an enjoyable giallo movie.".

Their beautiful niece Floriana Edwige Fenech a perfect cross of Audrey Hepburn and Natalie Portman then turns up uninvited to stay for a while and things get very twisted as the bodies pile up and a black cat called Satan watches from the shadows.It's an interesting movie that will keep you hooked as it glides from one overthetop scene to the next never crossing the line into camp while staying focused on a sinister trinity of characters each with their own agenda and motives without forgetting to build to a tuttut morality play climax in the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe and later Tales from the Crypt for that matter. It doesn't make complete sense if you try to put it together retroactively though I can forgive the movie for that.Bruno Nicolai's grand score ties it together nicely and Sergio Martino chooses some lovely locations in the Italian countryside both of which give YVIALRAOIHTK production value far above the usual schlocky nature of giallo. This can be enjoyed on many levels as a horror murder mystery and an erotic thriller with moments of very dark humor.".

They make the mistake of entrusting it to an adult whom they presume is a friend but is really a thief spends much of it and wants to take the whole amount. This is in spite some genuine fondness for the boys. Later the kids tire of living the dolce vita and start giving the money away to other needy children and buying them gifts. Jacques Sernas plays the greedy adult friend and Rossana Podesta' is a sympathetic lady of the neighborhood whom the thief falls for. When Sernas is sent to jail for a short time for previous thefts the boys decide to give away their money to the church. The kids and their naive and sometimes goofy antics are a delight to watch and they were well selected by director Carlo Borghesio who made the equally amusing Il monello della strada with comic actor Macario. Marisa Merlini plays Sernas' former flame and Virgilio Riento is a simpatico doorman. In short we have here a pleasant trifle aimed at the juvenile audience with the intention of teaching them Christian generosity but which is otherwise totally without pretension.

In some way that connects to 2 days in Paris which also dealt with the difficulties of love. The movie also had a feminist side to me on the one hand it deals with the obsession of beauty a kind of female issue also an issue that matters especially to actresses. The countess crosses ethic limits to gain or keep beauty and youth  maybe an analogy to plastic surgery. The murderers committed by the countess are also compared to war is it better to kill for power than for beauty? A political view is that the countess is not mainly sued because she has committed crimes but because her power is so huge that many people are happy to get rid of her which is how politic still sometimes works nowadays. Regarding these facets the countess is a parable to human behavior today. It does not want to be a historical movie. I still can see that especially Hungarians are annoyed when they see and hearnonHungarian actors in this movie speaking English even though the actors are not English and saying Hungarian names in a nonHungarian way. As i said before it is not a historical movie and the setting should just be regarded as a frame. I also remember reading an interview with Julie Delpy quite some years ago where she complains about not getting any roles in the US because her accent is too french. I think mixing actors from different countries she wants to show or find out that or if a movie can work even though there is an international cast. Regarding the countess as a parable i think that can work. But as my boyfriend does not like watching movies in English we watched the dubbed German version and i really don't know if the accents would have bothered me... Anyways i can see the movie does not really fit a genre so i understand people have troubles with it.

We are watching a fantasy of a noblewoman enacting a tale told by the victorsby the men who were enriched by her downfall and relieved too to be rid of the very possibility of an intelligent woman. The tale is told too by the peasants and others whose sons are fighting in her army. Yet the man who questions the gory story is her lover and he too may be deceived.

There is no simple answer to the question what really happened?no resolution.In short it's an intellectual and visual treat but it won't affect your blood sugar.";

Soon after Nadasdy's death Elizabeth begins a passionate relationship with Istvan Thurzo Daniel Bruhl who is nearly 20 years her junior. When Istvan leaves her she believes it is because of her age. This ultimately leads to her believing that the blood of virgin girls can help her remain youthful and Elizabeth starts a mysterious killing spree to satisfy her vanity.The issue surrounding Elizabeth Bathory makes for an interesting narrative in the cinematic format. The story is told in a rather linear fashion beginning with Elizabeth as a child and how politics deemed who she should marry in her older age. Politics is perhaps the best dealt with theme in the film while not shown in a refreshing manner politics still has an overriding importance into understanding how arranged marriages were so important for families in regards to gaining new ties and allies and more importantly how these marriages ultimately develop characters in order to enrich the story. Yet it is disappointing that nothing helps strengthen the plot the life of Elizabeth Bathory is open to much speculation with there being a debate as to whether she really is the 'Blood Countess' or whether she was trapped in a political conspiracy. But none of this is even questioned until the very end of the story but by then it is so incredibly obvious that the filmmakers have wanted to portray Elizabeth as a coldhearted murderer that the alternate paradigm briefly introduced serves little purpose. Another problem with the narrative is how the film's underlying philosophy as emphasized by a voice over from Istvan at the very start of the film is in conflict with the film's main story. Istvan believes that the true story of Elizabeth was never revealed but as shown from the films intention it clearly is.There is a reasonably strong cast in the film but it never shows. Both Delpy and Bruhl lack emotion and their portrayed relationship is not any better. In Delpy's defence it can be argued that her character lacked any real emotion but nevertheless there is nothing really compelling about the performance. William Hurt features at points throughout the film but he rarely makes much of an impact. The best of the lot is Annamaria Marcina who feels more believable then her costars and does a good job as a supporting actress.Julie Delpy does shine in her role as director with the film being for the most part eloquently shot. There are some interesting scenes of symbolism with the heightened ominous atmosphere of the film starting off early and is carried along until the end. Considering the subject matter the film is neither as gory or bloody as you would expect but the acts of cruelness still have a haunting presence to them and Delpy must be congratulated for this. Likewise the musical score appears to compliment the film though is forgettable by the end and the costume design has a real sense of reality to them though they lack extravagance as shown in other similar period films.Sex is implied with upper female nudity appearing at times in the first half of the narrative. Language is almost unheard of but violence is shown in various manners there is some decapitation and piercing of skin from sharp items. None of the violence is lingered upon but their buildup has a threatening quality to them blood does appear throughout.The Countess is a surprisingly average film with a good sense of technical techniques being weighed down by some weak showcases of acting and a confused directional narrative. The beginning attempts to setup the film as a mystery thriller something to get audiences debating the accuracy of events but ultimately the film is so conclusive with what it wants audiences to believe that the film gets muddled up in its own creative process. It is an interesting movie with an exciting subject at its helm but it is nonetheless a flawed film that just never gets going.Durban International Film Festival 2009".

	schema:reviewBody "If one could rate a film owing entirely to the versatility of its creator The Countess would be 10 out of 10. Julie Delpy didn't just helm her most ambitious project to date she gives a carefully reserved effective performance she composed a befitting score she had an active part in costume design and her script gives the right angles at the right places. Why then does the final result impress so little unlike her wonderful debut 2 Days in Paris? Reason One Insufficient voice coaching. You may think that's a minor detail  wait until you've watched this film in its original English. With the four main characters coming from four different countries one would assume that their English accents would be balanced by someone  nope. The dialogue sounds awkward and sort of trashy. Julie Delpy's own cute FrenchAmerican sounds odd in this somber tale Daniel Brhl's GermanAmerican accent is so ridiculous that one expects him to pronounce 'I vont tu sukk ur bluhd' any second. William Hurt being the seasoned pro that he is smoothed his own accent to fit into his morose cunning character making him sound more European than the Europeans. Anamaria Marinca obviously had some serious vocal training which elevates her performance whereas Delpy and Brhl's romance scenes give off a feeling of unbalance and weirdness.Reason Two Daniel Brhl. Well this is a FrenchGerman coproduction so I guess that as the unwritten rules of Eurofilm prescribe there has to be a German lead. And Brhl could be considered a star. Yet he does not have the stamina to carry such a part he mostly acts as a bystander. He's not even pretty as he looks quite sick. And according to an interview I've read Delpy isn't totally innocent of Brhl's look since she mentioned that she didn't want him to shape up.Reason Three German production values. The main production company involved in this project is Tom Tykwer's XFilme so this movie feels very German. If you've watched The Perfume you know what that means for dramas like this one a certain stiffness in tackling emotional content and rather Spartan set design. The Iron Maiden which the Countess uses to bleed her virgin victims dry is about the only visually interesting detail. The continuity is muffled too for instance the escape scene of a little girl one of the rare moments of suspense is almost instantly killed off quite literally not allowing for goosebumps to build.It's OK that Julie Delpy makes a clear departure from the romantic fluffy stuff of her past. It's impressive how versatile she's become as a film maker. But given her talent for intelligent comedy I wonder if a less serious subject wouldn't have benefited her versatility more. This notreally period piece and notreally horror flick will satisfy nobody and keep audiences wonder how much more it could have been with another approach.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirectorproducermusical scoreractress Julie Delpy brings to the screen a character from history that few know. The film is based on the true history of the woman known as The Blood Countess but after viewing this film it is obvious that the actual figure on whom the story is based was a brilliant political mind a woman of noble breeding who could read and write in four languages who once widowed was able to successfully defend her lands from the warring Turks and exact control over the reigning Hungarian King Matthias. But back to the history of the character as written by Delpy. 'Countess Elizabeth Bthory de Ecsed Bthory Erzsbet in Hungarian 1560  1614 was a countess from the renowned Bthory family of Hungarian nobility. She is considered the most prolific female serial killer in history and possibly the most prolific of any gender. She and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls with one witness attributing to them over 650 victims though the number for which they were convicted was 80. Erzsbet herself was neither tried nor convicted. In 1610 however she was imprisoned in the Csejte Castle where she remained bricked in a set of rooms until her death four years later. Later writings about the case have led to legendary accounts of the Countess bathing in the blood of virgins in order to retain her youth.' The film opens with voice over by Istvn Thurz Daniel Brhl who relates the story of his only love. We are privy to the strange behaviors of the young Erzsbet who had a sadistic streak and was at birth promised to be the bride of Ferenc Ndasdy Charly Hbner. She became a beautiful woman and Erzsbet Julie Delpy married General Ndasdy gave birth to children and together they were the power couple of Hungary. When Ndasdy dies Erzsbet meets and falls passionately in love with Istvn Thurz Daniel Brhl a many 19 years her junior but Istvan's father Gyrgy Thurz William Hurt prevents Istvan from remaining with Erzsbet. Left alone Erzsbet remains a powerful warrior dallies with the sadomasochistic Dominic Vizakna Sebastian Blomberg but fears her young lover will forget her if she ages. She discovers that the blood from virgins will restore her youth and thus begins the serial killings to support her vanity. As questions of debts owed to her by the King there is an investigation of her personal history led by Gyrgy Thurz and without proper trial she is condemned to house arrest in darkened sealed rooms in her own Csejte Castle where her fate is sealed. The film is beautifully designed costumed photographed and scored and Delpy manages to pace her story credibly and well. For this viewer there is an absence of gritty passion that would make the history more indelible Delpy and the remainder of the cast fail to create fiery onscreen chemistry that would have brought a sense of stronger impetus to the heinous acts that occur. But as a piece of rarely known history it is a fascinating film about a strong woman of the past and the impact she had on her country ... and on legends! Grady Harp".

The characters were not even similar to Hungarians. So basically if I didn't know she was Hungarian I wouldn't even have recognised the place or country it related to. Apart from that the story is unusual the movie is an art. But if you watch it do not think this is the real 17th century in Hungary.".

The challenge is to make something new with this ancient legend and to try to be equal to the great directors who brilliantly tackled the subject. Julie Delpy likes challenges of this kind. Not only did she write the script direct act and compose the music but her adaptation can compete with what I thought was the best previous film adaptation of the legend by Walerian Borowczyk from the collection called Immoral Tales and with Paloma Picasso. Delpy acknowledges her debt to this director through a number of details that those familiar with Borowczyk's works can recognize. Another great reference is Coppola's Dracula of which Delpy borrowed the lyrical and tragic tones. Of coursethis can only situate Delpy's aesthetic choices and much of her originality rests in her interpretation of the legend. Here she blends her own speculations about the Countess's character and motivation with historical facts to make a new and provocative statement about the legend. The best way to see this film is to compare it with the other adaptations not as much to see who spent the money the most intelligently but what each director has to say through the same legend.".

The acting between herself and her lover was cold wooden and completely unbelievable. The acting itself is strictly 3rd rate at best. The pace of the movie is very mechanical. I'm not sure if it's the acting itself or the storyline that makes it close to impossible to connect with or empathize with any character involved. Her lover's feeble declarations in and out of bed had me reaching for the fastforward remote each and every time. Monotonous tedious poorly scripted and badly acted.

I've thoroughly enjoyed Julie Delpy's acting in Linklater's Before trilogy and in her own directorial efforts such as 2 Days in Paris and 2 Days in New York. But The Countess didn't do enough to grab me. The premise was enough to interest me but there was something about its execution the pacing of the film and how the story was presented that just didn't make it for me. The acting was good nothing spectacular but passable. No standouts everyone did just okay.I believe that so much more could have been done with such an interesting story and this effort just fell short on its own feet. I know that we are not dealing with a horror movie but some horror elements could have beenadded to the mix which would have made it much more appealing to me because in some way it's kinda like the story of Countess Bathory itself is asking for those elements.Nevertheless I felt mildly entertained in some small passages of the film. And I appreciate Delpy's intention and portrayal of the character. William Hurt and Daniel Brhl put on acceptable performances the costumes and the sets are done very well.I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie to anyone if anything I would recommend Delpy's other feature films which are a lot better than The Countess.".

Two shipwrecked sailors played by blond hero Nikolai Kryuchkov and clownish Lev Sverdlin are washed up on an island in the Caspian Sea. Fortunately it's not only inhabited but has a small fishing cooperative headed by Semyon Svashenko so our boys soon find work. But more importantly  at least so far as Nikolai and Lev are concerned  the island boasts a female doer and leader in the lovely form at least to the eyes of two shipwrecked sailors of Yelena Kuzmina.But don't pay too much mind to the forever blustering hero or the pitiable selfpitying droopyeyed clown or even the passably attractive but somewhat careworn and definitely no glamour model heroine. It's the photography that counts the mise en scne the surge of the waves the tilting sky the sunlit sands.

Lisa captures perfectly that nightmarish atmosphere that Italian filmmakers such as Bava and Argento seem to have such a knack for creating. This is one of the first films I ever saw that relied on visual narrative instead of a solid script to make its point and even at an early age this really held my interest. Of course the argument could also be made that this film suffers from slow pacing and a telegraphed conclusion but I still think the movie is gorgeous and Elke Sommer is a delight.But don't let that stop you from checking out House of Exorcism either! This takes the film to the other end of the spectrum exploiting the loose narrative by forcing a possession plot that finds Elke's character now confined to a hospital bed doing her best Linda Blair impression. Everyone involved with the making of these scenes had to have known they were trashy including Elke herself so it's a riot to see how game she was to go over the top. She just cuts loose  goes for it mugging for the camera vomiting toads and dripping lots of green bile natch.Compared to Lisa and the Devil House of Exorcism is an absolute abomination but the producer was a demented genius in forcing the issue of the possession subplot since the film in its original form was far too art house to make any money on the drivein circuit. If you get ahold of the special edition DVD with both cuts of the film on it be sure to listen in to the commentary track which features some great chat from Alfred Leone the film's producer and Elke Sommer herself. The opportunity to view both versions of the film gives the viewer a unique opportunity to experience two radically different visions of one film first as a sumptuously filmed dreamlike masterpiece then as a masterpiece defiled hacked to pieces for an exploitation thrill.".

It's surreal touches and foreboding feel with probably appeal to fans of David Lynch or Herk Harvey's 'Carnival Of Souls' more than hardcore horror nuts. The cast are all good but Telly Savalas gives a standout performance just on the right side of over the top and Elke Sommer appears much more believable as the confused protagonist of this movie rather than the unconvincing Linda Blair wannabe of 'House Of Exorcism'.

I picked up Lisa and the Devil on DVD and then realized that the House of Exorcism is a reedited totally different version of Lisa and the Devil. I feel like I need to see the House of Exorcism now. If you like Bava films then you will surely enjoy Lisa and the Devil. This is a surreal piece of film making in that you are not quite sure what is reality and what is in the mind of the characters. There is no over the top gore but Bava uses camera work and generates a creepy atmosphere. I may not reccomendthis film to Mario Bava first timers or gore hounds. While I love to watch a Fulci or Bruno Mattei zombie fest anyday I still enjoy a classic Bava film the same way I enjoy classical music. They both hit a chord but a different chord.".

I picked up Lisa and the Devil on DVD and then realized that the House of Exorcism is a reedited totally different version of Lisa and the Devil. I feel like I need to see the House of Exorcism now. If you like Bava films then you will surely enjoy Lisa and the Devil. This is a surreal piece of film making in that you are not quite sure what is reality and what is in the mind of the characters. There is no over the top gore but Bava uses camera work and generates a creepy atmosphere. I may not reccomendthis film to Mario Bava first timers or gore hounds. While I love to watch a Fulci or Bruno Mattei zombie fest anyday I still enjoy a classic Bava film the same way I enjoy classical music. They both hit a chord but a different chord.";

When the unexpected death of George occurs the group is rocked in fear. Maximilian like the previous strange gentleman she met in the last city responds to Lisa as if he knows her. He wishes to passionately embrace Lisa but she has no idea how to react to all the strange happenings upon her. In a dream sequence Lisa reminisces a past life where she was embracing the first gentleman who now has a nameCarloEspartaco Santoni..here's the kicker Carlo is actually Max's mother's husband who had ran off with a woman named Helen who seemed to have been attached to Max. All this drama with Sophia in deep mourning over her beloved George's death and how Lisa reminds others of Helena spirals out of control as a sneering Leandro the butler looks on in cheeky delight often mumbling about the situational developments as they occur.Bava as Gothic as ever has lots of stylish camera tricks up his sleeveparticularly how he frames reflections of faces using such items as a cigarette case with a mirror wine spill reflecting Savalas's face etc. And his use of the fisheye lens is astounding. And that ending which might dismay many I felt was a knockout. Like the fresco containing the devil carrying a dead man no one can escape fate. Within the film there's a killer on the loose bashing heads in with a canewith blood splattering like spilled paint on the camera lensso Bava also lets his grisly side run rampant. Bava injects his film with the sordid history of two families..Max and his mother's and Sophia  Frank. These elements add spice to the proceedings as a victim is run over numerous times by a vehicle and tragic consequences await others at the hands of a very unbalanced Maximilian who will do whatever it takes to not lose Lisa like he lost Helena. I really got a kick out of Savales and his behavior towards the mannequins and just the delight he carries when around potential victims. It seems Bava and Savales both knew how to relate their macabre joy to the viewer and their collaborative efforts go noticed. They understand what lies within the framework of the story..these characters and how they are doomed destined for tragic endsand have fun with the material presenting to us in only the grandest way possible from start to finish. These two were made for each other.House of Exorcism is basically a travesty an abomination where a coproducer..this being Alfred Leonetakes a perfectly fine film well visualized by a true master of the macabre and creates instead a ludicrous unnecessary rehash of The Exorcist adding material with Robert Alda..attempting desperately to bring sincerity and dignity to his role as a wounded priest despite the hilariously profane gibberish coming from a possessed Elke Sommer's mouth splicing in footage from Lisa and the Devil to pad everything out to cash in on another religious shocker's success. Also added that you won't see in Bava's finished product of Lisa and the Devil are scenes of Sommer and Koscina's nice breasts being fondled and kissed..Sommer's by Orano during the notorious lovemaking scene where an unconscious Lisa has been drugged by Maximilian who subsequently disrobes her as his imprisoned former flame Helena's skeletal corpse lies a few feet awayKoscina's by Tinti during their sordid sex scene while hubby Fajardo is away looking for a tub to bathe in. And one nasty aftermath of Koscina's demise displaying the spikedend of a cane buried in her skull. But a great deal of House of Exorcism displays the ugly side of a demon inside Lisa causing her to move and convulse her body wildly while saying vulgar comments toward the priest. There's even a scene where the demon takes the shape of the priest's naked wife who we see dying in a burning car in a haunting flashback. But all this is quite an embarrassment especially if you have just finished the elegant romantic yet lurid and morbid Lisa and the Devil. Sommer sure commits to the role of possessed innocent really piling on the histrionics. Stick with a true artist's vision and watch House of Exorcism for laughs if you're really bored. I can't even imagine what it must feel like to have your film butchered in such a way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lisa Elke Sommer who is a tourist gets lost from her group in an ancient Spanish city but she come across a couple Mr Frank Lehar his wife Sofia and chauffeur and gets a lift off them. Though its shortlived as the car breaks down near an old villa. So they are invited to spend the night in the old dark villa. The mansion's occupants are acting all strange and the dreary atmosphere takes hold. One by one they meet their doom and Leandro Telly Savalas the villa's butler seems to have something to do with it. Could he be the devil himself who's toying with these guests or is it all a nightmare?Well this was the first film I've seen of directorwriter Mario Bava and I got to say I was truly amazed by it. Bava's Lisa and the devil is a slickly wellcrafted surreal thriller that messes with our minds with its simply fetching details and a disquietingly grim atmosphere. It's one very picturesque film that holds superb composition and such flair in the lighting backdrop score and atmosphere. From the elegant scenery of the ancient city to the old fancy villa that holds such a morbid awe and to what builds on that is a strikingly eerie but delicate score. While the brood atmosphere is sheer alienating and the fluid camerawork truly does capture that disorientating mood. The villa is covered with colourful artwork and luxurious furniture which fills every room. The film is gracefully shot with plenty of zooms and also catching reflections and silhouettes. The location photography was excellent. These sublime images and score really built on the absorbing texture and peculiar state of the film. Plus under all that are an elegantly erotic undertone and a film that flows with pure originality.Premise is incredibly absurd and there's hardly no characterisation. Maybe there was too much going on in the flawed story as it was downright confusing at times to know what was actually happening because the story would lead to a dead end. Overall it just felt like a blur. Though yet again maybe it was meant to be like that? You are definitely lost and put offbalance just like Lisa is to what's reality and what's not. It's a baffling mystery that you could say comes across as rich poetry and art and you also pick up on little subtle hints throughout the story. The dialogue is rather sparse but interesting if a little cheesy at times. You could probably say not much is going on with Lisa just wandering around the villa and there's a fairly slow pace to it all to begin with but this is an atmospheric and physiological builder. Some scenes did drag on for too long and sometimes it gets a bit too sappy but these things didn't take away from the film. The horror isn't that horrific but it plays more on the images sounds and atmosphere. Definitely the second half of the film is when it starts to get exciting and even more unnerving. This is when Bava tightens the screws with some welldesigned shocks and jolts. By achieving some haunting images and a heartstopping finale literally. As each one the characters give into jealousy hatred lust and finally into their own demise. The characters turn out to be nothing more than pawns in this story and you question who's pulling whose strings. Most of the acting does come across as rather onenote or melodramatic. Telly Savalas steals the film as a lollipop sucking butler who seems to have some hidden agenda and playing with these people's souls. His performance is sinisterly impressive in a manipulative nature and his dialogue is always a play on words. The gorgeous Elke Sommer shines in her role. Her dialogue might be pretty limited but her presence is enough to fit the bill.Incredibly lavish filmmaking that is particularly dreamlike and a marvel to look at. When it ends you'll be left scratching your head.".

Later she gets a lift with the wealthy Francis Lehar Eduardo Fajardo and his wife Sophia Sylva Koscina. However their car breaks and stops in front of an old manor.

During the dinner they are served by the butler Leandro Telly Savalas that resembles the image of the devil of the painting. Lisa seems to be living a strange nightmare recalling her love from a past life and trapped in the house with that bizarre family. The stylish and surrealistic Lisa and the Devil is a weird and spooky ghost story developed in a nightmarish atmosphere. The movie is visually very impressive and despite of the flaws and inconsistencies in the ambiguous screenplay it startles many times. Elke Sommer is extremely sexy and Telly Savalas is very frightening. The conclusion is a little disappointing. My vote is seven.Fortunately I saw Lisa and the Devil first the opportunist commercial version released in USA with the title The House of the Exorcism on the trail of the success of The Exorcist is terrible and destroys the creepy atmosphere of the original movie. The good thing is the greater eroticism and exposure of the naked body of Elke Sommer. My vote is four.Title Brazil Lisa e o Diabo Lisa and the DevilNote On 11 June 2015 I saw this movie again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Small spoilers included According to the title I'm reviewing the House of Exorcism here but I better start by saying that the below discussed version is Lisa and the Devil' in all the glory like Mario Bava intended it! The House of Exorcism adds a whole bunch of needless elements and it doesn't even credit Bava as a director! Talking about blasphemy! Lisa and the Devil however is a pure Bava masterpiece and one of the most beautiful horror movies ever made. Like only he can show it this film breathes a horrific atmosphere of mystery and morbidity. It's about the young American girl  Lisa  who's lost in the Spanish city of Toledo. She spends the night in a ghoulish and ancient house with the blind landlady her vicious son and the spooky housekeeper a terrific portrayal by Telly Savalas Lisa is seen as the reincarnation of the lost loveinterest of the son and he becomes possessive over her. Unfortunately the lost lover of son Maximillian wasn't very faithful and Lisa might take the punishment for that now  Once again Bava gives a nightmarish portrayal of a sinister setting filled with bizarre figures and religious themes. Unlike some of his other films Lisa and the Devil has an intelligent and compelling script that thrills you right from the first second and until the very last. You just stare at this film with wideopen eyes and huge fascination. Beautiful scenery stunning cinematography and magnificent makeup effectsall trademarks that make horror so great are present in Lisa and the Devil. If you're looking for breathtaking horror Mario Bava is the way!".

	schema:reviewBody "It becomes clear almost from the outset that with this film Bava is out to mess with our heads and narrative cohesion isn't a priority so it's best just to sit back and enjoy the ride knowing you're in good hands.While viewing a strange fresco in a town on holiday Lisa becomes distracted by the sound of music and in a small shop off the beaten track finds a music box with some creepy figurines spinning on top. She tries to buy it but learns that it belongs to the shop's only other customer Telly Savalas who greatly resembles a figure on the fresco that was described as the devil! Telly for some reason is carrying a lifesized figure of a man and finds it highly amusing when Lisa runs off.Lisa soon gets lost and after wandering around the strange streets has to ask someone for directions and that someone is Telly Savalas! This is where Bava starts really messing with us as the dummy in his hands is obviously actually played by an actor  but only in certain shots. Things get even more confusing when Lisa encounters a live version of the dummy who falls down a flight of stairs and dies.Eventually Lisa ends up getting a lift from a bickering couple the wife of whom is having an affair with her chauffer and they all end up at the usual huge mansioncastle inhabited by angry man Maximillian his blind mother Alida Valli and chirpy butler Telly Savalas complete with Kojack lollipop. The house is full of Bava's favourite prop creepy dolls and things just get stranger and stranger for here on out.There's no point in detailing any more of the plot but it involves murder mysterious characters locked in rooms surrounded by slices of cake people becoming dummies and Telly Savalas breaking the ankles of a corpse in order to fit it into a coffin. I was never really sure what was going on at all due to all the mind games Bava was playing. He even has certain characters follow the exact same path through the house using the exact same camera angles which just adds to the surrealism and through it all Telly Savalas acts like that whole thing is some bizarre comedy. It all works for me though!He also has the light shine deliberately off of Savalas' head quite often too films the action from above or below and uses an awful lot of colour wherever he can. My favourite set was the mockfuneral that is later smashed to pieces by one of the characters. I wasn't expecting the film to be off the wall as much as it was and was nicely surprised. Perhaps it was this film that Umberto Lenzi and Lucio Fulci had in mind when they directed the House of Doom series in the late Eighties? I was getting a severe House of Clocks vibe from this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lisa and the Devil features many of Bava's trademarks a devilish atmosphere superbly chilling use of lighting and a general foreboding feel to the movie that gives the impression that something bad will happen. However the movie is also fairly messy there are too many ideas in the film and all together it comes out more than a little confusingly. The version I saw was the Redemption release of Lisa and the Devil which is not to be confused with badly intercepted release The House of Exorcism. The plot follows the story of Lisa a young lady that gets lost in an ancient city in Spain. She then hitches a ride with a couple and their chauffeur but they end up breaking down and happening on a house inhabited by a blind woman her strange son and a creepy housekeeper. What follows is a nightmarish and morbid ride that touches on themes such as love lust and death. Mario Bava is a master of the horror genre many of his films have inspired whole areas of cinema most notably Bay of Blood to which slashers owe their existence and The Girl Who Knew Too much which is often credited as the first Giallo. But I feel that this is one of his lesser efforts. That's not to say that this is a bad film by any means it features a lot of nice elements particularly the spooky sequences with main characters and their dead exlovers which almost touches on necrophilia and therefore gives the film a very morbid and nasty feel. The actors in the movie are also fairly accomplished it features Elke Sommer who also starred in Bava's atmospheric shocker Baron Blood among other films and Telly Savalas who gives a great turn as the creepy butler of the house. But it seems to have too many ideas going on and a lot of them aren't really explained which left me feeling confused. Overall Lisa and the Devil is a good horror movie with much to admire most notably the superb creation of atmosphere from Mario Bava but I feel that if it had concentrated less on putting lots of ideas into it and more on concentrating on the ones it already had then it would have been a better film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lisa and the Devil follows a woman touring Spain who wanders from her tour group she becomes transfixed by a portrait of the devil in a fresco and begins to lose sense of herself time and space as she seems to enter a waking nightmare.Perhaps Mario Bava's most surrealist offering Lisa and the Devil was reedited and grossly manipulated with reshoots upon its U.S. release ending up with an entirely new title House of Exorcism. The differences between the two versions are so extreme that they literally are completely different films in both tone and narrative. You may be wondering how a film can so easily be reworked in such a way but Bava's loose and unanchored narrative makes it fairly easy.Lisa and the Devil is a legitimately engrossing epic fantasy that is both unnerving and aesthetically gorgeous. Anyone who knows Bava knows the visual flair of his films and this one is no exception. The film retains a kitschy late sixties look to it and in some ways reminds me of Jess Franco's Succubus which was made several years priorI do think Lisa and the Devil is ultimately the better film no question but they both share in common the floaty dreamscape backdrops in which a woman finds herself.The film is genuinely weird and disorienting at times but never in a way that disenfranchises the viewer what's perhaps most intriguing is that it essentially begins in medias res taking a fairly mundane situation a woman touring a city and throwing it straight down the rabbit hole. Even at its most incoherent the film maintains a spellbinding quality about it. Elke Sommer has a transfixing screen presence as the titular Lisa while Telly Savalas is appropriately creepy as the devilish figure of Leandro. The film's conclusion is downbeat and fairly unexpected the final plane scene is inventive and phenomenally nightmarish. All in all Lisa and the Devil is a great surrealist horror film and a steadfast example of Bava's later more narratively playful offerings. The film has aged fairly well and retained a heady European Gothic atmosphere. The viewer really feels enough perturbation in the thick of the nightmare that it remains an overall effective film to this day and at the very least it is a visually sharp detour into an unexpected hell. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "warning contains spoiler  Here we have a case where the creators own artistic genius has worked against him at least in the business end of film making process that is. there is a lot of controversy surrounding this movie because it is two films in one. the first is Lisa and the Devil which is the Godiva chocolate end of this cup with Bava's trademark lush cinematography and atmosphere. while art is always subjective here is my take on Lisa. many people have complained about a lack of plot to this film but that is because it does not have a linear narrative. to make a long story short it is a game of cat and mouse between Lisa and the devil. Lisa portrayed by the beautiful Elke Sommer is a soul actually named Elanor that has escaped from hell and is reincarnated as Lisa but has no conscious memory of it. she does not know that the devil Telly Savalas has allowed this to happen because he enjoys playing these games as a form of amusement. Lisa is led to a picturesque villa where all the other characters while unknown to her are the living dead. this is illustrated when we see them as mannequins or the devils dolls when handled by the devil and in contrast as living beings when seen by Lisa who is herself one of them. these trapped souls are forced to play the game and also live out their own personal hell for all eternity at the villa. so if you look at it from the perspective that this is a life size doll house in Hell the film might make more sense to you. of course in the end it all comes full circle and the devil reclaims her and this is when you find out that she really is Elanor because the devil speaks her name. now for the peanut butter end of the cup which is The House of Exorcism. while Lisa was liked by the distributors they understood it was not commercially viable as a general audience film so they passed on it. producer Alfredo Leone in an effort to recoup his investment had new sequences shot and integrated them with Lisa. while it is commonly believed and somewhat understandable people think that this was a cash in film on The Exorcist it is not. had the original story been written solely as a response to The Exorcist then yes it would be but that is not the case. I believe it was more along the lines of desperate opportunism rather than just a blatant tailcoat ride. Bava of course was upset that this had happened to his most personal work but in the end he privately told Leone that considering the circumstances he approved of the film after he had time to calm down and look at it objectively. in the end films are entertainment as well as art. Lisa is art and House of Exorcism is entertainment. I think it's cool that you get two great tastes out of one film.".

	schema:headline " LISA AND THE DEVIL Mario Bava 1973 ";
	schema:reviewBody "This was my third time watching this most personal of Bava's works whether it is due to the fact that the last two occasions proved problematic the original Image Entertainment DVD experienced an audio glitch during playback that nearly blasted my TV speakers while there were constant audiorelated issues on the Italianlanguage track of the copy I acquired of the movie's Raro Video edition! or the shadow that always loomed large over it in the shape of the execrable reedit THE HOUSE OF EXORCISM 1975 I have never been really taken with the film as many others seem to be!! Truth be told watching the featurette EXORCISING LISA soon after I was sort of glad to realize that I was not quite alone in this  as both assistant director and the director's own son Lamberto Bava who always felt the end result even in its true incarnation was impenetrable and somewhat unresolved! and Bava scholar Alberto Pezzotta suggesting that the time of Gothic Horror had passed and that other than merely ethereal it was elegiac and selfreferential! disclaim its masterpiece status!! Incidentally though the script is attributed to the elder Bava and producer Alfred Leone on foreign prints as a matter of fact throughout my ongoing Bava centenary tribute it has been a constant irritation to find English credits on Italianlanguage editions of his pictures! it was actually penned by other hands  including Roberto Natale who also puts in an appearance in the 25minute doc!! Incidentally while ostensibly an original elements from it could be traced to several short stories dutifully namechecked during said featurette as well as Tim Lucas' audio commentary Mind you the movie is undeniably intriguing in my review of the director's KILL BABYKILL! 1966 also cowritten by Natale and a film whose stature seems to grow with each viewing I mention how LISA owes a debt to it in the desolate narrow streetsdecaying villa settings and the general nightmarish vibe and yet it comes off as strangely aloof one does not really connect with any of the characters throughoutespecially as with A BAY OF BLOOD 1971 these largely seem to be on hand merely to ratchet up the 'body count' department did we really need an additional love triangle to the mindboggling quintet  taking into consideration that Elke Sommer here undertakes a dual role  already involved?!. The score by Carlo Savina with generous but effective sprinklings of Joaquin Rodrigo's famous Concierto De Aranjuez is a major asset as is the bemused presence of Telly Savalas obviously assuming the latter half of the titular parts scheming and manipulating the various figures around  in both their human form and lookalike mannequins  as if they were pieces on an invisible chess boardwhile under the guise of an overworked and seminally lollipopsucking butler!.

	onyx:emotionText "This was my third time watching this most personal of Bava's works whether it is due to the fact that the last two occasions proved problematic the original Image Entertainment DVD experienced an audio glitch during playback that nearly blasted my TV speakers while there were constant audiorelated issues on the Italianlanguage track of the copy I acquired of the movie's Raro Video edition! or the shadow that always loomed large over it in the shape of the execrable reedit THE HOUSE OF EXORCISM 1975 I have never been really taken with the film as many others seem to be!! Truth be told watching the featurette EXORCISING LISA soon after I was sort of glad to realize that I was not quite alone in this  as both assistant director and the director's own son Lamberto Bava who always felt the end result even in its true incarnation was impenetrable and somewhat unresolved! and Bava scholar Alberto Pezzotta suggesting that the time of Gothic Horror had passed and that other than merely ethereal it was elegiac and selfreferential! disclaim its masterpiece status!! Incidentally though the script is attributed to the elder Bava and producer Alfred Leone on foreign prints as a matter of fact throughout my ongoing Bava centenary tribute it has been a constant irritation to find English credits on Italianlanguage editions of his pictures! it was actually penned by other hands  including Roberto Natale who also puts in an appearance in the 25minute doc!! Incidentally while ostensibly an original elements from it could be traced to several short stories dutifully namechecked during said featurette as well as Tim Lucas' audio commentary Mind you the movie is undeniably intriguing in my review of the director's KILL BABYKILL! 1966 also cowritten by Natale and a film whose stature seems to grow with each viewing I mention how LISA owes a debt to it in the desolate narrow streetsdecaying villa settings and the general nightmarish vibe and yet it comes off as strangely aloof one does not really connect with any of the characters throughoutespecially as with A BAY OF BLOOD 1971 these largely seem to be on hand merely to ratchet up the 'body count' department did we really need an additional love triangle to the mindboggling quintet  taking into consideration that Elke Sommer here undertakes a dual role  already involved?!. The score by Carlo Savina with generous but effective sprinklings of Joaquin Rodrigo's famous Concierto De Aranjuez is a major asset as is the bemused presence of Telly Savalas obviously assuming the latter half of the titular parts scheming and manipulating the various figures around  in both their human form and lookalike mannequins  as if they were pieces on an invisible chess boardwhile under the guise of an overworked and seminally lollipopsucking butler!. The rest of the cast however are only soso Alessio Orano is fatally unsympathetic as an impotent necrophile!

The Bava parts of the film were pretty stylish and well made and yes we get to see both Elke sommer's and Sylvia Kscina's boobs but all in all the script has the inherent silliness of most bava movies.

Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought  a vagrant thought a useless thought a homeless thought wandering forlorn among the empty eternities! from Mark Twain's Number 44 the Mysterious Stranger This is often listed as Mario Bava's bestfilm and it's pretty good. There is a cosmologicalhorror here that mirrors Lovecraft and predates a similarapproach that Lucio Fulci would employa kind of ubiquitoushorror that has consumed everything. A place of noescape. If this sounds like a Michele Soavi film you're correct! I think Cemetery ManDellamore Dellamorte owes a greatdebt to this film as well as a few others from Bava's bodyofwork. If you've ever had a feeling that dreamreality is more concrete than our own this one is for you. The subconscious runsriot in most of Bava's films and his producer Alfred Leone let him do whatever he wanted here. The results are impressive though the film suffers from a tedious middle. Alas when it was screened at Cannes in 1973 nobody was offering much for a distributiondeal so Leone had Bava shoot additions that would remake Lisa  the Devil into House of Exorcism. The stories that Bava didn't shoot any of the retakes and additionalfootage are untrue he did. 1975 rolledaround and House of Exorcism got a good distrodeal and is cited as one of the mostsuccessful Exorcistripoffs.But the originalcut by Bava somehow survived in TVsyndication copies and was relocated in the 1980s. Finally in the 1990s Anchor Bay released VHSversions of bothcuts to addtotheconfusion. But atleast Lisa  the Devil was now available to the fans which was something even Bava was unable to enjoy in his lifetime. He died believing his cut had been lost forgotten forever. Mario Bava thought all of his films would be forgotten. It's nosecret that without the championing of Tim Lucas and even Joe Dante and Martin Scorsese most of Bava's films would probably have met the fate he expected them to meet. So there is a confusion about these two films and they should be viewed as separate. Lisa  the Devil has nothing to do with possession or exorcism only House of Exorcism does. It is a recutversion of Lisa but it has its own merits another story.In the story Lisa Elke Sommer is a tourist to a small Spanish village one which she has becomeconvinced she has beento before. She views a Medievalpainting on her entry into the town which depicts the devil tormenting the souls of the damned. Throughout the film she encounters a mysteriousman played by Telly Savalas who is often seen carrying a mannequin of a mustachioedman in a suit. Othertimes the dummy seems alive a real body made of fleshandblood a nice touch of surrealistcinema. Beforelong Lisa has made her way to an old Spanish Manse populated by a demented aristocraticfamily with a butler named Landre who looksfamiliar...it's Savalas again. Is Lisa wrong? Did she see the Butler controlling the familymembers? Did she see the butler breaking the legs of a cadaver to fit it into a coffin a nod to Lovecraft one of Bava's favorite writers? Has the family's sole maleheir a fixation sexually on the dead? Is this life deathitself? Is Lisa alive? What is this place? What is this life? By the end you will know and it will make you despair.This is one creepy movie one that will haunt you for days maybe forever. In a way it's the last great Gothic horrorfilm. Very few movies say death this many times over and Lisa  the Devil is a film about the loneliness of the humancondition. Conveying the hell that is solitude it even has some echoes of Mark Twain's finalnovel Number 44 The Mysterious Stranger writtenfrom 1890 and 1910 where the maincharacter realizes he is a unitaryGod alone in the abyss. Everything in the storyall the characters eventswas partof a dream conjuredup to hide this fact.The best route for this film on DVD is to buy the doublefeature that includes House of Exorcism. Sadly Image didn't do a recut with Lisa  the Devil from the superior filmelements from House of Exorcism it's a little weaker in imagequality. Why they would make House lookbetter is a mystery but at least we have a fullcut of the film. There have been rumors that Anchor Bay is obtaining the rights to do fullyremastered versions of the Bavacatalog that Image has previouslyheld. If they do HDtransfers that would be great as most of the Imageversions have been from inferiormaterials. Bava's films are bestappreciated fullyrestored or at least from good elements. We'll see.".

The film was released in two versions one released only in Italy and Europe and another in America. The American release is known as Lisa and the Devil and it's very toned down from its original gore. In Lisa and the Devil actress Elke Sommer portrays American tourist Lisa Reiner. While visiting an Renaissance city in Catholic Spain she comes across an antique shop with startlingly disturbing death maks devil figures and torture instruments from the Inquisition. Eventually she becomes lost with her group of friends and their car breaks down on a rainy night in front of a magnificent but scarylooking mansion. An old blind countess Alida Vali her young son Espartaco Santoniand a sinister butler Leandro Telly Savalas live there. Mayhem murder lust and violence ensue in the course of their stay in the mansion. The difference between the Italian and American versions is that the Italian version is pure camp a typical style of filth that was actually very mainstream in Europe during the early to mid 70's. Eurotrash horror. Excessive violence and floods of blood does not make a good horror film. Nor does graphic and disturbing sex in the case of this film motherson incest and necrophilia The old blind countess may have sexual feelings for her son but in the American film this is implied and it seems to be the cause of her frustration and her violent nature. But the lingering dramatic suspense and the subtlety of it all is superior to the Italian gorefest. Also there is much more of a haunting quality to the American film even if the ending is not satisfactory and doesn't resolve anything. The creepy butler Leandro is played by Telly Savalas who at this time was very wellknown in America as Agent Kojax in the series Kojax. The cinematography of Cecilio Paniagua is really quite good. There's a hazy dreamy quality and surrealism which is effectively dramatic and haunting. This film has all the potential for a great film but the Italian version ruined it for everyone. Many find the American version to be dull and talky while the Italian edition is at the other extreme too violent too filthy.".

Eventually she becomes lost with her group of friends and their car breaks down on a rainy night in front of a magnificent but scarylooking mansion. An old blind countess Alida Vali her young son Espartaco Santoniand a sinister butler Leandro Telly Savalas live there. Mayhem murder lust and violence ensue in the course of their stay in the mansion. The difference between the Italian and American versions is that the Italian version is pure camp a typical style of filth that was actually very mainstream in Europe during the early to mid 70's. Eurotrash horror. Excessive violence and floods of blood does not make a good horror film. Nor does graphic and disturbing sex in the case of this film motherson incest and necrophilia The old blind countess may have sexual feelings for her son but in the American film this is implied and it seems to be the cause of her frustration and her violent nature. But the lingering dramatic suspense and the subtlety of it all is superior to the Italian gorefest. Also there is much more of a haunting quality to the American film even if the ending is not satisfactory and doesn't resolve anything. The creepy butler Leandro is played by Telly Savalas who at this time was very wellknown in America as Agent Kojax in the series Kojax. The cinematography of Cecilio Paniagua is really quite good. There's a hazy dreamy quality and surrealism which is effectively dramatic and haunting. This film has all the potential for a great film but the Italian version ruined it for everyone. Many find the American version to be dull and talky while the Italian edition is at the other extreme too violent too filthy.";

While traveling in Spain Lisa Reiner Elke Sommer gets lost. She hitches a ride with a couple and they end up in a house inhabited by a blind woman her strange son and the housekeeper Telly Savalas. Everything seems normal at first but bizarre things begin to happen and we eventually discover that there are many things about each character that we don't know.Much of the horror in La Casa dell'esorcismo the American title is Lisa and the Devil comes from camera angle and blurred shots creating the sense of descent into terror and madness. The whole movie was a little bit silly but it's actually quite interesting. Telly Savalas is lascivious as ever and Elke Sommer is really one hot babe. I definitely recommend this movie".

The movie is one that you have to pay VERY close attention to every scene has importance. I think everyone has their own opinion on the meaning of this film it's very fun to draw your own up.

To explain this movie's brilliance I should explain a little bit of backstory... This is the movie the director Mario Bava wanted to do for years but no studio wanted to pick this project up because the story is so open to interpretation and so nonlinear that they thought it would be a flop. Well he got what he wanted he could shoot the movie the problem is that when he finished the movie the producer said that it would be a flop convinced him to drop it out and turn the movie into a The Exorcist ripoff called House of Exorcism which I did not have the displeasure of see but based on what I read about the movie I can say that I'm not losing much. House of Exorcism was a critical and boxoffice fail. The thing is Lisa and the Devil is so good that before they blocked the movie the critics still got a screening. And the movie was a hit! Critics loved it. But thank god they restored this gem and now we get to see it in its integrity. This movie's script is genius because it truly looks and feels like a nightmare it's truly dreamlike not some Inception bullshit. And the art direction in this movie is truly fantastical. This is one of the best looking movies I've ever watched. And it's so opentointerpretation that you can make whatever you want from the story which is more simple as you think it is on first viewing. This movie should become a cultclassic and it should be watched many many times. I watched it three times already and I plan on watching many many more times...".

It's incoherent confusing and complex elements we didn't need because the script is pretty obvious Elke Sommers plays Lisa Telly Savalas is the villainous Devil and then the movie ends from the beginning.  Let me rephrase that  It's pretty obvious before the beginning I already knew who was who and who wanted everybody's souls when I read the box of the videotape!  So even the movie's trick ending was spotted a mile away.     People who like constant plot twists and an incredibly slowpaced approach may find something entertaining in this movie. LISA AND THE DEVIL did nothing for me because I was bored senseless.  I got frustrated early on because of the nonsensical approach for example  Some crazy guy goes around bludgeoning people to death at random and he also keeps a rotting corpse more of a skeleton actually upstairs in a bedroom.  And yet to contradict this he goes on about he hates this creepy house and is tired of all the death!  So needless to say there are plotholes a plenty which made trying to swallow this story a very frustrating experience.  After a while I found myself scanning past all the long dragging scenes which forever fade  pan I just wanted them to get on with it and cut to the pay off i.e. an explanation.     If nothing else this artsy farce offers a brief shot of Sommers in the nude and a rather sad injoke  Telly Savalas sucks lollypops!  I assume this was after his KOJACK years and this gimmick looks like they were rubbing hasbeen all over his face.  If there's nothing else to do and LISA AND THE DEVIL is on TV it might be worth a look but I paid to rent it the uncut version for what it's worth and would have rather used that money to go buy some fastfood.".
