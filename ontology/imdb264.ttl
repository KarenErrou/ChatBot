And there's a mood of furtiveness  of voyeurism  that remains arresting.For openers we witness a bank robbery where deaths result but the mastermind Paul Richards eludes the law. Next we watch Kim Novak in her movie debut exiting a cinema where It Should Happen to You and The Nebraskan constitute the double bill. Deftly she circumvents an opened ladder but still her car won't start. Luckily Fred MacMurray happens by to proffer his assistance. Soon they're enjoying cocktails in a cozy bar and later at his place Suprise me she tells him while waiting for her auto to be delivered from an allnight shop.Neither the pickup nor the malfunction underneath the hood was however quite a matter of chance.

But eventually he weakens and before you know it he's informing her that her phone is wire tapped and the two of them are just one step ahead of the police for the rest of the film.PHIL CAREY as a fellow officer and E.G. MARSHALL as the lead detective are excellent in supporting roles as is DOROTHY MALONE in a pivotal role as a girl occupying the apartment next to Novak in a Ushaped building that enables MacMurray and Carey to keep an eye on both gals through binoculars shades of REAR WINDOW.Conveniently no one ever draws the blinds in these sort of thrillers and spying is made so easy for the sake of plotting as the 24hour surveillance occupies much of the story. The noir elements are present throughout the dark rainy streets the shadowy photography during car chases the clipped delivery of lines the murder scheme gone awry the femme fatale angelic on the outside bad within.But somehow it never becomes a major film noir relegated to its place in obscurity over the years and not really a title that pops up when one speaks of film noirbut it does qualify as noir on a minor scale and it's given some taut direction and tight suspense by director Richard Quine.Kim is as easy as ever on the eyes although a bit robotic in her acting technique and never quite convincing as a mobster's moll. MacMurray has a less interesting more onedimensional role as a cop corrupted by beauty.All in all definitely worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is especially notable as being the first film of Kim Novak. She is already a sizzler from her very first scenes. The camera loves her and her career from this point on was inevitable. It was only the next year that she set all the men of America afire by her sensuous role in Bill Inge's 'Picnic' opposite William Holden. High cheekbones never hurt a gal in films and as Kim Novak must be of Czech descent judging from her name we have here the classic Slav look. It wasn't long before 'Vertigo' and by then Kim Novak had become an icon which she remains to this day. Fred MacMurray is the leading man in this film excellent as usual but really too old for someone like Novak to fall in love with at first sight as called for in this story. Oh well that's casting for you. Dorothy Malone appears in this as a sweetie. The film is gripping at the tail end of noir a mixture of crime cops and mystery. The postWar mood of sombre brooding is ending things are lightening up a bit and crime and corruption are no longer seen as an intrusive Dark Hand of Doom but as eruptions into daily life of natural human impulses of greed lust and evil which are as spontaneous as barbecues are in summer in Texas. These things 'just happen' and an end of the world scenario of being engulfed by wickedness is now seen more prosaically as 'oh no not another crook and another crime!' As crime keeps on happening you kind of get used to it and films like this take on an air of 'here we go again'. So it is no longer brooding atmosphere but gripping intrigue which makes the movies work by the mid1950s.".

Comparisons with Double Indemnity just can't be ignored. She is the vamp that Barbara Stanwyck could never be. She's softer and more feminine in that 50's style and less hardedged than Stanwyck which makes her much more dangerous. Novak's generally wooden acting style  flat affect gives way to a softer sexkitten demeanor. MacMurray's character is a more active participant in the events that unfold than in DD where he seemed to get his courage and strength from Stanwyck's cold  calculating personna. Billy Wilder could have made this a masterpiece but even without the guidance of the master's hand this one is definitely wellworth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pushover is directed by Richard Quine and adapted to screenplay by Roy Huggins from stories written by Bill S. Ballinger and Thomas Walsh. It stars Fred MacMurray Phillip Carey Kim Novak Dorothy Malone and E. G. Marshall. Music is scored by Arthur Morton and cinematography by Lester White.Straight cop Paul Sheridan MacMurray is on the trail of the loot stolen in a bank robbery where a guard was shot and killed. He is tasked with getting to know Lona McLane Novak the girlfriend of the chief suspect in the robbery. But once contact is made and surveillance set up over the road from her apartment complex Sheridan begins to fall in love and lust with the sultry femme.Comparisons with the superior Double Indemnity are fair enough but really there is enough here and considerable differences too for the film to rightfully be judged on its own merits. Also of note to point out is that one or two critics have questioned if Pushover is actually a film noir piece? Bizarre! Given that character motives destinies and thematics of plot are quintessential film noir.A good but weary guy is emotionally vulnerable and finds his life spun into a vortex of lust greed and murder. Yet the femme fatale responsible is not a rank and file manipulator she too has big issues to deal with a trophy girlfriend to a crook she coarsely resents this fact. The cop who never smiles and the girl who has forgotten how too is there hope there? Do they need the money that has weaved them together? What does that old devil called fate have in store for them? Classic noir traits do pulse from the plot. True the trajectory the pic takes had been a well trodden formula in noir by the mid fifties where noir as a strong force was on the wane but this holds up very well.It isn't just a piece solely relying on two characters either there's the concurrent tale of Sheridan's voyeuristic partner Rik McAllister Carey who has caught the eye of Lona's next door neighbour Ann Stewart Malone. Both these characters operate in a different world to the other two yet the question remains if a relationship can be born out from such shady beginnings? The presentation of relationships here is delightfully perverse. The visual style wrung out by Quine Drive a Crooked Road and White 5 Against the House is most assuredly noir with 99 of the film set at night with prominent shadows damp streets lit by bulbous lamps and roof top scenes decorated sparsely by jutting aerials. The L.A. backdrop a moody observer to the unwrapping of damaged human goods.Cast are very good all working well for their reliable director. Novak sizzles in what was her first credited starring role she perfectly embodies a gal that someone like Paul Sheridan could lose his soul for. MacMurray is suitably weary his lived in face telling of a life lacking in genuine moments of pleasure. Carey square jawed tall and handsome he is the perfect foil to MacMurray's woe. Malone offers the potential ray of light trying to break out in this dark part of America while Marshall as tough Lieutenant Eckstrom and Allen Nourse as a copper riding the noir train to sadness score favourably too.It opens with a daylight bank robbery and closes in true noir style on a cold and wet night time street. Pushover deserving to be viewed as one of the more interesting 1950s film noirs. 810".

MacMurray is suitably weary his lived in face telling of a life lacking in genuine moments of pleasure. Carey square jawed tall and handsome he is the perfect foil to MacMurray's woe. Malone offers the potential ray of light trying to break out in this dark part of America while Marshall as tough Lieutenant Eckstrom and Allen Nourse as a copper riding the noir train to sadness score favourably too.It opens with a daylight bank robbery and closes in true noir style on a cold and wet night time street. Pushover deserving to be viewed as one of the more interesting 1950s film noirs. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "Pushover 1954An early widescreen black and white film noir gem. It comes late in the noir cycle but it crackles with precision and sharp acting. Though the details of the plot differ it is an obvious echo of Double Indemnity with the leading man played again by Fred MacMurray sucked into a risky plot for big money and alluring love. And of course things don't go as planned.MacMurray is an interesting choice in both films because he really is more of an everyman than a noir type. Noir types are variable I know but you can range from Mitchum to Bogart to Dana Andrews to a whole bunch of minor actors who all have a kind of coolness or hardness to them and you never see a regular fellow like MacMurray the closest might be Mickey Rooney of all people in a neglected oddball noir the 1950 Quicksand. MacMurray would later find his true calling as the dad in My Three Sons but when you see him in these early film roles there is something wrong and some perfect about his presence.I don't mean to neglect the femme fatale here a young Kim Novak in her first full role. She's terrific really a bit cool which was her style but more convincing to me than her more famous appearance across from Sinatra in Man with the Golden Arm. Maybe it's partly how well matched she is as an actress to MacMurray though if there is a flaw to the film  it might be the unlikeness of these two falling in love even with 210000 to persuade them. But love is love and who's to say? The two of them often playing in separate scenes talking on the phone or MacMurray watching her through binoculars make this a full blooded drama as well as a crime noir.The pace and editing of this movie and the script and story are perfect. It's easily the kind of film you could study for its structure and for the writing which isn't filled with noir doozies but with believable fast lines between two people looking to get through a growing debacle. It's a conventional structure but its precision is comparable for its precision to The Killing that famous Stanley Kubrick film from 1956. And if it isn't as inventive and if it lacks that amazing ending Pushover is resilient because it is so reasonable. It could very well happen and these relatively ordinary types Novak being admired for her looks but there are lots of lookers like her out there especially gangster's girls make it all the more compelling.The filming is great Lester White not known in particular in the cinematography world but shot a whole slew of decent and unamazing westerns as well as the Ida Lupino Women's Prison which has it moments. Little known director Richard Quine made lots of lightweight and comic fare he worked a bit with both Blake Edwards and Mickey Rooney then later with Jack Lemmon and this might be his most serious 1950s film in tone. It's certainly the kind that you can't look away for a second because it clips along without a lull for an hour and a half.".

The temptation in his path is another dame in this case Kim Novak being 'introduced' in this film as Columbia's answer to Marilyn Monroe.MacMurray's a cop who is assigned to get close to gangster Paul Richards's moll Novak. Richards and his mob have pulled off a bank heist and if they had any sense they'd be out of the country and fleeing. But police captain E.G. Marshall reasons that Richards ain't going nowhere without Novak. Of course what he doesn't figure on MacMurray's libido as well as Richards. Novak's one cool ice princess in this one she's willing to spend the loot with one crook as another and one with a badge sounds pretty good to her. There's a side romance going as well with Novak's neighbor nurse Dorothy Malone and fellow officer Philip Carey. Malone gets innocently caught up in the intrigue. Carey while doing surveillance on Novak's apartment gets to peeping in on Malone next door. His little Rear Window act pays off in the end.Pushover is a fine noir drama and highly recommended for those who like myself know full well that Fred MacMurray is capable of a lot more than Disney films and My Three Sons which I think most know him for today. Novak makes a stunning debut as the ultimately luckless moll and the rest of the cast backs them up with a splendid ensemble effort.".

Its story about obsession betrayal and murder contains many familiar elements but remains thoroughly engrossing throughout because it's well paced frequently suspenseful and has a compelling plot. The atmosphere is claustrophobic and this is reinforced visually by the action being staged mostly in small often cramped rooms and dark rainy streets. The shadowy interiors are beautifully photographed and the ways in which the streetlights reflect on wet roads and illuminate raindrops on the cars are just a couple of examples of the superb quality of D.P. Lester White's work.Middleaged LAPD Detective Paul Sheridan Fred MacMurray makes the acquaintance of an attractive young blonde called Lona McLane Kim Novak after she has some problems with her car and the couple quickly become lovers when they spend some time together waiting for the necessary repairs to be carried out. All is not as it appears however because this apparently random meeting was set up by Paul who'd been assigned to the task by his boss because Lona is suspected of being the girlfriend of a wanted fugitive and Paul has been told to find out whether she knows her fianc's whereabouts. He soon reports back to Detective Lieutenant Carl Eckstrom E.G.Marshall that he's convinced that she is in a relationship with bank robber Harry Wheeler Paul Richards.Eckstrom feels confident that Wheeler will contact Lona at some point and so arranges for her phone to be tapped and for her apartment to be kept under constant surveillance. Paul and his fellow detective Rick McAllister Philip Carey are part of the stakeout team who occupy a room that overlooks Lona's apartment and together they wait for Wheeler to make his move. It's during this period that Lona suspects that Paul is a cop and when she confronts him on the issue he eventually admits that she's right but assures her that his interest in her is genuine. She remarks that the 200000 that had been stolen from the bank by Wheeler's gang could set them up nicely for the future if they could get their hands on it when Wheeler is eventually apprehended. Paul wants no part in that kind of scheme and soon returns to his stakeout duties.Rick starts to find his work becomes a little less tedious when he starts watching Lona's attractive neighbour Ann Stewart Dorothy Malone but also one of Paul's colleagues notices that he is steadily becoming more and more agitated. Completely obsessed by Lona Paul arranges to meet her again and together they agree to carry out her plan. A telephone call that she receives on the following day than sets Paul off in pursuit of the stolen money but the complications that follow soon lead him into desperation betrayals and murders when things suddenly start to spiral out of control.The sequences in which the detectives spy on the women through binoculars are uncomfortably voyeuristic and very similar to certain scenes in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window which was also released in the same year as this movie. The bank robbery and an episode that takes place in Ann Stewart's apartment are played out without any dialogue and as well as being well directed are also rather Hitchcockian in style.During his childhood Paul had frequently witnessed his parents arguing about money and this experience led him to believe that without plenty of cash a successful relationship with a woman would be completely impossible. As a result he was always more vulnerable than most to being corrupted by anyone with Lona's mindset and greed. Fred MacMurray does well at portraying his character's confident and competent exterior while also giving signs along the way of how he's gradually unravelling. Kim Novak in her first starring role is well cast as the seductive femme fatale and Philip Carey and Dorothy Malone also contribute a couple of really good supporting performances.".

Fred Mac Murray's cop starts out as a professional but ends up in a vortex of crime thanks to the compelling allure of the shapely Miss Novak. Good thing she's called on to do little more than stand around looking sexy because her bad breathy imitation of Marilyn M. in the opening garage scene had me reaching for the off button. I gather Columbia read Harry Cohn had high hopes of launching Novak's career with this role. Too bad she had to compete with a hundred other bosomy blonde Marilyn's for the honor. I like the seduction scene with its subtly unzipped zipper about as far as the screen could go at that time. The plot wrinkles get pretty complicated at times but the pace keeps moving nicely along. Then too the final line presents a poignant slice of ironic insight.There's the inevitable comparison here with the thematically similar Double Idemnity but then Novak is no Stanwyck and MacMurray is a ten dissipated years older. Still this little suspenser needs no help from the past and can stand firmly on its own.".

There are flashes of DOUBLE INDEMNITY 1944 as Fred MacMurray and a beautiful woman this time Kim Novak in her breakout role plot to get their hands on some money that isn't theirs but only if they act their parts right.The movie centers around an allnight police stakeout of Novak's apartment after her boyfriend robs a bank and takes it on the lam. MacMurray is a cop and figures his inside knowledge of both sides of the investigation should allow him to pull off the proverbial perfect crime lifting the loot while delivering the crook.There's some great suspense as things unravel and the 1950s black  white photography is great. There are hints of REAR WINDOW 1954 as the police watch the apartment during the stakeout. Dorothy Malone is adorable as Novak's nextdoor neighbor who catches the eye of one of the cops through his binoculars. It's a sweet romantic plot not a creepy one. E.G. Marshall heads a solid supporting cast. A very enjoyable film noir that may go under the radar. Check it out.".

I felt Paul Sheridan's MacMurry disgust with his life and his apparent loneliness could have used more development. He falls too easily for Kim Novak's character even if she is strikingly beautiful. She too easily goes with him the first night they meet. It would be more believable and more sensual if there were two meetings at least to pulse his desire for her. Now I don't particularly like films where the male star is a little long in the tooth for his paramour.This was common in the 50s and 60s when Male stars of the 30s and 40s were cast with much younger female leads presumably because of the men's star power. I put forward Bogartand Bill Holden with Audrey Hepburn totally unbelievable in Sabrina Bogart being 55 and Hepburn 25.Or Rear Window with an older Jimmy Stewart age 47 and Grace Kelly 25.With some suspended belief this is a very enjoyable movie. I love noir.The story lines of noir are simple and pure and the mood dark. I believe this movie pulls it off though it was the waning period of noir 1954".

Until he is introduced to a new patient he will be in charge of named Diane.

I must say that Orlando Bloom did a superb job portraying Martin as a fragile loner desperate for more at any cost. Riley Keough known for her previous role in The Runaways also did a fine job as Diane. Overall this did a very good job of building suspense  keeping it going through to the end. My only complaint is that I would have liked it to go a bit further with the story it seemed to wrap up too quickly  an extra fifteen minutes wouldn't have hurt. Still it exceeded my expectations  recommend to anyone looking for a well acted solidly written suspenseful story. 810".

There is no secret demonic conspiracy or medical coverup or madman trying to spread a virus that will kill every man taller than he is.Instead we have an ordinary internist at a big hospital the properly taciturn Orland Bloom who becomes so attracted to a young woman who is his patient that he goes to extraordinary lengths to keep her in the hospital. His plan to keep her in the hospital succeeds but her winding up in the morgue is extempore.Well Bloom is a good doctor with an otherwise unimpeachable reputation and her death affects him deeply. Ridden with guilt he's then approached by a vulgar orderly who has found the deceased's diary outlining much of what's been going on. The impertinent orderly Michael Pea demands a constant supply of dope from the doctor who when he discovers that the supply must be unending slips the arrogant underling a dose of KCN. That's potassium cyanide. I happen to remember it because late one night I released some of the gas when I worked in a tool and die shop just out of curiosity. It didn't smell like almonds but like peaches. The next day the boss carried on about the equipment somehow having gotten rustier overnight.I couldn't make out what other shenanigans the doc was up to. By this time his term of reference has been reduced in social value from the good doctor to doctor to just plain doc. Aside from the dope I did notice him snatch a vial or two of something from the supply room and he fiddled around the labels on some Petri plates  a very naughty thing to do as I recall. I don't claim to know much about medicine but I know what I like.At any rate it was a relief to watch a movie in which no one's head gets twisted off there is no highspeed pursuit ending in a cataclysm and no halfcaste zombies. Orlando Bloom is excellent in the role of the young earnest enthralled physician. He has all the expressiveness of a tax auditor. He takes his work and his ethics seriously. If only he hadn't fallen for that pretty blond Riley Keough with the woeful voice. She's not even phenomenally beautiful but rather her appeal lies in the fact that she projects the trust vulnerability and innocence of a child. Rob Morrow is memorable in a small part.Lance Daly's direction is straightforward and allows us to see what's going on. The camera does not wobble neither does it swish pan. There are though probably too many huge close ups for a movie made in this classic style. It is after all not a TV movie but a feature film designed to be seen in theaters and who needs J. K. Simmons' head to be sixteen feet tall? Even the title is nicely apt the good doctor ironic and yet descriptive. Bloom really IS a good doctor except that he's responsible for one accidental death and one deliberate murder. Doctors always get away with murder. A good friend who is a doctor was always late for appointments because he was disorganized but when he rushed into the examining room the patiently waiting patient would apologize to HIM because he knew how busy doctors were. The rest of us aren't so lucky.".

	schema:reviewBody "The irony of The Good Doctor is that its title character is anything but good. This would be Martin Blake Orlando Bloom a British medical student who has just transferred to a Los Angeles hospital to begin his residency. His initial scenes depict him as withdrawn from his colleagues and superiors who aren't hostile but certainly don't go out of their way to make him feel welcome. There's even a slight incident involving a Hispanic patient who doesn't speak English and may or may not be allergic to penicillin. But for the most part Blake is merely suffering from a bruised ego believing he isn't getting the respect he deserves. We don't see the full extent of his rotten personality until he's introduced to a teenage girl named Diane Nixon Riley Keough who's suffering from a kidney infection.He quickly picks up on the fact that she's attracted to him and longs for his medical care. He's more than happy to oblige. It's not so much that he's attracted to her physically even though she's indisputably beautiful like a rapist what he's really attracted to is the feeling of exerting power over someone vulnerable. Throughout the film Diane is unaware of the ways in which Blake is manipulating her. This has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence on her part. She's merely young and nave having only her current adolescent relationship with a teenage boy as a frame of reference. She now believes her boyfriend is a jerk and perhaps he is although that doesn't much matter. What does matter is that this is something else Blake picks up on. He now has one less person standing between him and his patient. If he ever does try to interfere Blake is well versed in all the medical rhetoric regarding visitors.Diane responds well to her antibiotic treatment and in due time she's well enough to be released. Surely Blake knew in the back of his mind that such a day would eventually come. But because his self esteem is dependent on being in control of others he cannot accept her departure on an emotional level. Luck intervenes allowing Blake to enter the Nixon residence twice. The first time is for a family dinner Blake having been invited by Diane's father Wade Williams out of appreciation. Although Diane isn't present during his visit the wheels in Blake's head start to turn. The second time is when he picks up a thankyou basket made by Diane's mother Molly Price. This is when Blake takes action he excuses himself to the bathroom retrieves Diane's prescription of antibiotics from the medicine cabinet and replaces the contents of the capsules with sugar from a packet.Inevitably Diane ends up back in the hospital. This time around Blake takes one extra step to ensure she will stay under his care for as long as possible namely the discrete replacement of the contents of her antibiotic IV bag with pure saline. Obviously this can only be done during the night shift Diane is more likely to be asleep and the floor is minimally staffed. It's at this point we're made more aware of an orderly named Jimmy Michael Pea who doesn't take his job seriously and yet is oddly observant of Blake's actions and behaviors. He will be the subject of the film's final act although I cannot reveal why. You're probably thinking that I shouldn't bother keeping anything secret as this review reads as if I've given away the entire film. You're wrong. Let it suffice to say that there's more to the plot that what I've described in excruciating detail.And what of the plot? Admittedly it pushes the limits of plausibility relying on the same conveniences technicalities and turns of events one would find in a detective story. The saving grace is that plot is not the film's real focus this is primarily a character study and a damn chilling one at that. Blake is a reprehensible human being willing to violate every ethical standard of medicine just to inflate his ego which is pathetically fragile. Nothing is known about his background but then again nothing needs to be known. That's because his actions in this one story speak for themselves. Although he's responsible for several unnerving moments the single most frightening scene is the last one for it asserts that some people are undeservedly lucky in life.Blake is an intriguing character and is closely examined. Unfortunately this comes at the expense of several side characters that are infrequently featured inadequately developed or both. These would include Nurse Theresa Taraji P. Henson who spends most of the film asking about illegible handwriting on medical reports Dr. Waylans Rob Morrow who's always asking Blake about how he's feeling physically and emotionally and a police detective J.K. Simmons who only appears during the final act and seems oddly detached. If you look at The Good Doctor from a technical standpoint it is noticeably flawed. The thing is I believe this film works on a purely emotional level. We don't like Blake and yet we watch with helpless fascination as he cuts away any remaining threads of morality. I'll bet he had his fingers crossed when he took the Hippocratic Oath. Chris Pandolfi".

	schema:reviewBody "The Good Doctor 2011 out of 4 Orlando Bloom plays Dr. Martin Blake a man with a good job a nice car a fine apartment and he appears to have anything you'd want but he's actually quite lonely. He thinks he finds someone special in a young patient Riley Keough who is suffering from a kidney disease but soon the doctor's kindness turns to obsession. THE GOOD DOCTOR has gotten some fairly negative reviews but I think they were a bit unfair. Yes if you're wanting a film that's going to explain everything to you then it's best to skip this one. In fact we never really learn why Martin is so lonely why he can't seem to connect with people and we really don't even get to know why he wants to be a doctor or why he becomes obsessed. This is one of those independent movies that wants to make the viewer do a lot of thinking and while it's not a complete success I still found the story compelling and the performances very good. Bloom was perfect in his role as the doctor and with the haircut and performance style I really couldn't help but think of Anthony Perkins in PSYCHO. The performance here certainly isn't legendary like that one but I found a lot of similarities between the characters. Bloom really does a great job at playing this lonely character and you believe it just by the sadness that his eyes carry. I always say that acting with your eyes can be the hardest thing to do yet Bloom gets so much across here. I also really liked Riley Keough in the role of the patient who forms this special bond with the doctor. The actors have some great chemistry together. Taraji P. Henson is excellent in her role as a nurse who doesn't get along with the doctor and we get nice support from Michael Pena and Rob Morrow. There are parts of the story that certainly don't work but I must admit that the film kept me on the edge of my seat because I was never quite certain where it was going to go or how everything was going to play out. I won't ruin the ending but I think it worked just fine but I'm sure everyone will take something different away from it.".

I thought Orlando Bloom was superb in the lead as a first year resident doctor at a hospital. On the surface he appears to be a shy nice guy who cares a lot for his patients. However there's a lot of darkness boiling over that no one can see.When a beautiful vulnerable young patient is admitted to the hospital for a rather routine kidney infection Bloom becomes obsessed and emotionally attached to her. The patient is played admirably by Riley Keough.Keough's family invites Bloom over to their house after she's released as a thank you to him for taking such good care of her. While at their home he steals a picture of her and takes it back to his apartment.From that point on he devises all kinds of devious methods to have her return to the hospital. In time these methods become more diabolical and dangerous. It all leads to a cascading of events which to me were riveting and spellbinding.A strong supporting cast includes Taraji P. Henson as a tough nurse who often conflicts with BloomRob Morrow as the supervisor of the residents who initially suspects something is going on with Bloomand Michael Pena as a conniving and amoral orderly.I wasn't expecting much from the film so I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it so much.".

	schema:reviewBody "To everyone that is ignorantly saying that they don't go into detail and explain why he does what he does ie. Kill his patients...I have to ask...disbyou not pay attention at all??? The doctor is lonely...no friends at work or outside of work because he is new. He became a doctor because he wanted the respect that came with the title he says so himself and he feels he isn't getting that from his fellow doctors or nurses. He takes a liking to his underage female patient. They share a lot of the same views and she gives him the respect attention and companionship during her stay at the hospital that he desperately wants. So after she gets better and goes home her father invites him over for dinner I felt that thecparents were trying to set him up with their oldervof age daughter. Skip forward a few scenes and the doctor goes back to the girls home and uses their restroom and switches her meds with sugar. She relapses and goes back to the hospital where he continues to pretend totreat her but actually isn't giving her meds. It is OBVIOUS that he is doing this to keep her sick so that she will stay in the hospital and they can spend more time together. You have to remember the girl is underage...he can't just ask her out. So he is keeping her there close at the hospital because he cares for her and she quite clearly cares for him too. But he goes too far and she doesn't get the Med or treatment she needs and she dies. He is clearly upset about it. However after only a day his coworkers begin to notice him and give him attention. Some even saying you aren't a doctor until you have lost a patient. Before this he really wasn't even being acknowledged as a doctor so this new respect he is getting is exactly what he has been wanting. He begins to grow confident. The other person he killed in order to hide the relationship he had with the patient. An orderly hooked on pills comes across the girl's diary after she died while cleaning her room and he decided to use it against the doc to get meds...the doc killed him so his secret wouldn't come out. All of this is completely obvious! I just had to explain after seeing so many bad reviews stating that they didn't explain the movie or the doctors intentions well enough...you can't get more obvious! The acting was spot on...story line awesome...movie was almost flawless...I had to give 9 stars only because the ending. The way it ends is abrupt that I kept rewinding the DVD thinking it skipped. I just would have liked to see a little more depth to the ending. Like someone else...another 15 minutes could have taken it to 11 stars. I definitely recommend it!".

He says he has become a doctor to receive respect like a family friend who was also a doctor. Dr. Blake is quickly disillusioned when he does not immediately get the utmost respect from the nursing staff.

Diane has had a bout of a fairly common but potentially deadly kidney infection. Dr. Blake's motivation is unclear as he soon sets out to cause a relapse of serious infection for Diane.The movie leaves viewers unsatisfied because there are not enough clues to explain the intent of the doctor or the intent of the movie's creators. Viewers are left with some big questions. Is the doctor so lonely as to want Diane to remain in the hospital indefinitely? Does Dr. Blake instead want Diane's respect or gratitude so that he would like to save her from a more serious condition? Or is Diane's case an experiment due to the doctor's obsession with infectious disease? Another big question the viewer is faced with comes at the very end. There are two ending scenes.

Basically Dr. Martin E. Blake Orlando Bloom is British and has transferred to a Southern California hospital but being arrogant and egocentric he alienates himself from the nurses he does not gain endearment from his first patients and his superiors are not all that happy with him. All he longs for is respect for his peers and one day the power of authority over others and he feels this when eighteen year old Diane Nixon Riley Keough who is suffering a kidney infection comes in for medical treatment she and her family see his good medical work as heroic. Her health slowly starts to improve but Martin longs to remain a hero and consist respect from fellow staff so selfishly he finds a way to slow down Diane's recovery changing her medication and botching other treatment and he maintains the illusion that he is doing everything he can to help her. He eventually lets this botching go too far and accidentally kills Diane her infection went beyond his control he is not suspected of any crime by the hospital staff but it is questionable what some of her family think. But then Martin has another problem when orderly Jimmy Million Dollar Baby's Michael Pea reads through Diane's diary she wrote her sexual fantasies about Martin of course the doctorpatient personal relationship implication would damage his career so he blackmails the doctor to give him narcotics. As long as he gets the drugs Jimmy says he will never give back the diary to Martin so he fills some of the pills he gives him with potassium cyanide which kills Jimmy and he steals the diary back. Jimmy's death is treated as suspicious and an criminal investigation is started Detective Krauss J.K. Simmons questions him on anything he may know he is visibly nervous and panicky so he goes to the bathroom and attempts to flush the diary but the toilet clogs. With the toilet flooded he climbs out the window and runs to the seaside he imagines drowning himself in the ocean but he runs back and after the detective leaves he throws the diary in the garbage he is not seen to be suspicious and some time later Martin assures while carrying out his duties that he is getting better all the time. Also starring The KTaraji P. Henson as Nurse Theresa Rob Morrow as Dr. Waylans Troy Garity as Dan Molly Price as Mrs. Nixon Wade Williams as Mr. Nixon Sorel Carradine as Valerie and Gary Carlos Cervantes as Mr. Sanchez. It is certainly good to see a good looking actor like Bloom playing against type and being the villain but the story is rather slow the dark moments aren't paced all that well and the script is full of clich and predictability a silly and hardly worth the effort thriller film. Adequate!".

It was only in theaters for a whopping 7 days.2. Oops...I thought Orlando was handsome. Apparently it depends on his haircut.3. The first half hour of the film drags along at a very boring pace. Yes I know in a suspense film even one that takes place in a hospital you have to build toward a climax. But my recent kidney surgery was more exciting than the first half of this film.4. Orlando Bloom can act and he does rather well here as a boring young hospital doctor who pervertedly decides to keep a patient close to him by finagling her medicines...until she dies. The good news is this is where the film finally begins to get a tad bit interesting. An orderly played well  but slightly creepily  by Michael Pena blackmails our doctor for a steady supply of drugs. So what is the GOOD DOCTOR to do...but murder him through poison.5. No one in this cast really stands out. Bloom is pretty good as is Pena. Taraji Henson as a nurse show promise.

I think you could put any actors in this even have Scorsese direct it and it would still be a yawning piece of junk.Thats not to say the acting was great because it was far from itam I in a minority here who thinks Orlando Bloom is a wooden mannequin of an actor? He may prove me wrong one day but I will be surprised although he wasn't too bad in the TV extras series. But to be fair De Niro would have struggled to bring much to this tripe Avoid".

From beginning to end this film kept me involved laughing at the many hilarious scenes and empathizing at the many dramatic scenes. Unlike many Miike films this movie carries with it a sense of innocence. Sure it has some outrageous violence but it is all in fun like kids playing. There is no nudity or sexual misconduct i.e. Visitor Q or Ichi the Killer just a pure heartfelt story of young adults growing up or refusing to grow up. Now that this movie is easily available thanks to the great folks at ArtsMagicDVD I would have expected more votes and reviews on here by now. I definitely recommend this film for Miike fans and haters alike. Just a great movie all around.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a pretty entertaining Miike film which suffers mainly from an anticlimatic and slow storyline. It is still quite entertaining and contains several distinct Miike touches but the compelling nature of the characters and their locale is somewhat hurt by the strange pacing and repetitive activity. The storyline centers around Riike and his relationship with his highschool sweetheart Ryoko soon after the two leave highschool. Riike is now a petty streetmobster who makes a living protecting street vendors and lowlevel gamblers while Ryoko works in a hair salon. The film investigates how the violent side of Riike's personality is necessary for him to maintain close relationships with his friends and girlfriend.The movie takes place in a neighborhood of Osaka Miike's hometown and is shot mostly with local actors. It's interesting that most of the guys in this film are notably unhandsome while the girls are typically attractive. The film actually comedically riffs on this a couple of times.And the comedy here is pretty good. The movie is a weird mix of slapstick and goofy comedy nonlethal violence and occasional tragedy  typically eccentric Miike. No single element is too affecting and perhaps that is why the movie falls a little short. I do admire Miike's versatility and ability to play each angle against each other  at times it is even reminiscent of Takeshi Kitano's direction. This is not a total surprise considering Kitano has appeared in at least a couple of Miike films.The acting here is competent but not exactly powerhouse stuff but then again I wouldn't expect that from the material. It's an entertaining look at the lives of several mischievous teens after they've left high school and the story contains some autobiographical elements of both the director and writer Osaka natives. It's entertaining but the pacing holds it back occasionally. Still Miike proves himself pretty versatile and the charming jokes and random Dadaesquire vignettes won me over the search for 67 degrees for instance. I'll certainly be interested in checking out the other films in the same series.".

Miike is good at making a movie that is serious but also looks like a manga characters getting their faces bloodied up only to cover their wounds with bandaids.The movie revolves around Koji Chihara's 1ichi 9 Souls character who becomes the towns enforcer right after highschool. Protecting small business's and helping people if they get screwed out of their money. Out of stupidity he cheats on his perfect girlfriend with a girl he knew from his childhood which becomes a big mistake. The hardest part about his new girlfriend is she doesn't want him to fight but that is how he makes his living. This allows the people that he beat up in the past to come and beat him up without him defending himself. After taking a bad beating he begins to realize how great his girlfriend was who used to look up too him when he got into fights.This movie shows the struggle he has wanting to return to his old girlfriend and how he realizes the mistake he made. The movie shows pictures of their past to give you the nostalgic feeling that the characters wish to return to but can't. It becomes very emotional until the Koji Chihara and his two friends go on a road trip which seems similer to the road trips you see in Beat Takeshi movies.The movie is a perfect mix of violence drama and comedy as Miike does best. With great music throughout the movie and in the credits. I personally like this one better than it's sequel Young Thugs Nostalgia which is not what the majority seems to think.".

I also think that some of it was some rather good decision making on his part because it's a coming of age story that seeks optimism beyond the perverse. However that does make the trademark violence and death stick out a little awkwardly in this particular one.Three friends graduate school after playing a prank on and robbing their teacher. One the firehearted Riichi basically drives the drama as a young man who doesn't fully understand himself and expresses himself with violence and a domineering attitude. After he breaks up with his longtime girlfriend the people who love and care for Riichi have to grow up and take care of themselves while looking out for Riichi who spirals through depression and passivity as he is finally confronted with life in the real world.This movie has some very unique use of music that I think is what really pulls it together. I also like how Riichi's violence is considered the optimistic and productive side of growing up as opposed to his reticence. Such a reversal of explicit content to reflect conservative values would later be put to an extremely higher level in the much more famous and much better done Visitor Q.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "I have just received both Young Thugs Innocent Blood and Young Thugs Nostalgia i have just watched Innocent Blood and have yet to see Nostalgia so that film may blow this one out of the water! hahaha! But yeah a brilliant film it's full of things of interest and is of the more 'nice' films that Miike does like DOA2. It's a really warm film with some really nice subtle cinematography that breathes life into the images that Miike constructs. It has a really nice golden colour through out which isn't too over the top that it gets in the way but clear enough as to explain the film on a purely colour basis this is a film of memory and childhood it really doesn't deserve the 18 rating it has it's insane that it has that to be honest! The one thing i'd say is a little off putting which is the music it's VERY cheesy and genetic and pulls the film down in respects but on the other hand it very much fits in with the innocence of the whole movie.It's a movie that although very 'easy' and innocent it has a lot of depth and aspects of interest such as the construction of the film and how it is told the editing the characters and how it relates to other films by the director. I'd really really really recommend this title to anyone who doesn't just take Miike as a place to be horrified he's never been about exploitation and hey this is pretty far away from that sort of thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the last 3 months I have bought and watched 21 Miike films. I am a FAN!! I just watched this one tonight and so far it and FULL METAL YAKUZA are my least favorites. In general I am not a fan of movies about the trials and tribulations of 1819 year olds and to my mind the ones in this film were more boring than most. Only a couple of them 2 of the guys had any real 'character' to speak of. While the girls were for the most part all hair and blank stares. Their lives started out 'no where' and ended 'no where' with very little in between. For a Miike film even the cinematography was rather boring. On the other and the use of 'Western' music to try and give some 'life' to all the nonaction was very well done. Miike uses Western music to great effect in many of his films. Which brings me to the one scene that totally transcended the rest of the film and made watching the whole thing worth the time spent. Having broken up with the least interesting of the 3 young men one of the girls is forlornly riding a street car to the sound of flamenco guitar. The scene cuts to the barcaf where one of the other young men works as a cook. An older woman we had seen incidentally early in the film comes out from behind a curtain dressed in black sequins and rhinestones and starts to dance to the guitar music which has continued to play much to the amazement of the others in the bar. Her moves are OK but not great. The scene continues to cut back and froth from the girl on the street car becoming more and more despondent to the woman dancing. Each time it cuts to the dancer her costume has become more and more authentic as does her dancing. Finally she has become totally transformed into an astonishing dancer of great power while the young girl has become totally lost. The finale of this sequence is classic Miike!!! The whole thing was mesmerizing! But then we are dropped right back into the land of the boring. For another 30 or 40 minutes. Towards the end Miike does throw in a moment of great fun a kind of gloss on the American wild boys in a car theme. But that then trails off into the sappiest ending one could possibly imagine. If you want to see Miike do 'young people' and do it brilliantly then watch LEY LINES CITY OF LOST SOULS and BLUES HARP. These are some of his best films. Only if you are a diehard Miike fanatic should you bother with this one.".

Menawhile keeping his promise to a dead client he cares for the wife and child of the dead naval officer.  The hitch is that he loves the beautiful widow and child.  Yet is constrained by social boundries from ever expressing it to them.Only Mifune could have turned in a performance such as this.Just wish they'd remaster this rascal and offer it as a DVD.".

Set in Japan at the turn of the 20th century it shows how a simple rickshaw man has to adjust to the modernization of his country. Menawhile keeping his promise to a dead client he cares for the wife and child of the dead naval officer.  The hitch is that he loves the beautiful widow and child.  Yet is constrained by social boundries from ever expressing it to them.Only Mifune could have turned in a performance such as this.Just wish they'd remaster this rascal and offer it as a DVD.";

Second this tale of a rickshaw man known at the Wild Matsu who helps a young boy named Toshio and becomes a part of his growing up is told vividly through numerous scenes over time. Ms. Takamine plays Yoshiko who was widowed soon after she met Matsu and her performance is understated but essential to the film. Mr. Mifune who is best remembered for works with the great Kurosawa stretches his acting muscles greatly here showing some vulnerability in a challenging role. There are so many films to recommend with Ms. Takamine and Mr. Mifune that are alternately entertaining and heartbreaking. This has both those elements and its a treasure of Japanese cinema.".

	schema:headline " Post War Cultural Change Encouraging more Equality";
	schema:reviewBody "Today it may be hard to understand the classed societies that prevailed pretty much everywhere before the 1800s and how slowly they changed to more egalitarian ones. Japan was a very class conscious society even up to WW II. There was a lot of imitation of the West but the attitudes towards the nobility changed very slowly. There were no peasants in the original stories Seven Samurai and the Samurai Trilogy were based on but peasant heroes of noble character were portrayed in their movies to make a point about human equality. Both of those stories were retold from many older versions Samurai trilogy was based on the real life of Miyamoto Musashi who was actually the son of a head of a fencing school and not a peasant at all as he is portrayed in the movie. Seven Samurai was also retelling though probably about how Samurai who had fallen on hard times retained their noble character. Even a very promising fighter would not have gotten a pass to join the group with a stolen birth record certainly not one that indicated he was 7 years old! Having to resort to working for peasants was lowering enough. Portraying the revelation of Mifune Toshiro's character's character and abilities his equality with his new comrades and their gradual acceptance of him makes the point.In Rickshaw Man we have a much more direct message piece a man of noble character whose position is way at the bottom of even the peasant class! I remember seeing this movie in the 1960s and it seemed obvious to me that it was set in the 1940s. The lady's officer husband officers were Samurai class went off to war and was killed. This was a common occurrence at several points between 1880 and 1945 and this makes her a very sympathetic character. She is also of course Samurai class. This gulf between their classes would have been unthinkable to cross for people who had grown up before 1940. S more so for any of the possible prior years. Stepping between rich middle class and modest Samurai class may have been happening but was still a big deal. Notice that by showing the Lady's husband as being generous and thoughtful in desiring to reward the rickshaw man for his help he is carefully preserved as noble also there is no making the upper classes villains here just showing that others are virtuous also.In 1959 when the heir to the Emperor married a commoner the daughter of the head of Nissan Flour Milling Ltd it was a very big deal indeed! Much was made about how her upbringing had been the equal of a Samurai daughter not by directly saying so but by describing it and her accomplishments in detail. However this too was obviously a message. The Emperor wanted attitudes to change.So in Rickshaw Man we have the title character established not only as lower class than farmers but a trouble maker as low as he could be without being a criminal or a traitor. Not only is he goodhearted he has tremendous joy in being alive. He is also virtuous in his respect for people who are supposed to be his betters and noble in not resenting his own status. As Mifune Toshiro portrays him he is positively inspiring. Clearly this is a movie intended to change peoples minds and hearts. I can't imagine anyone who saw it leaving the theater without thinking that maybe the lower classes might be okay at least some of them. Japanese culture was changing and these movies were helping it as much as they could. It was also inspiring news to all those not lucky enough to be born Samuraiwhich was maybe 90 so this message would be popular too.".

There are a few video artifacts with some scene changes when switching between reels?. Sound is strikingly clear. Set design is especially well done and looks spectacular in the widescreen format. Music is fine.

Mifune delivers his trademark physical role of Matsu the Outlawa title appropriated by Imamura in one of his documentaries a larger than life rickshaw man in Kokura Kyushu. Evidently this is a remake of an earlier film but i have never seen the previous film. Matsu befriends a small boy and becomes the surrogate father after the boy's father dies. He also carries a torch for the boy's mother played by Naruse regular Hideko Takamine. In this film we get to see Mifune win a running racebeat up several school boys in a big fight and expertly play the taiko drum.

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to MidWest Bank's helpful guide on how to use our ATM vestibules! Please follow these tips to make the most out of your cash wanting needs!1. We understand that the modern lifestyle leaves little time for exercise. To help you we recommend parking your car far from our vestibule and taking a walk across the car park. We even recommend this in subzero temperatures.2. Like all banks we're really only in it for profit. This means that we don't bother paying for locks on our doors. This has the handy benefit of saving you time getting in and out.3. Stay calm within our vestibules! Our security cameras are programmed to only film violent actions and gestures. At all other times they just don't work.4. We only install cameras inside the vestibule. There are none outside whatsoever so if you want to fight  please exit and we hope you win!5. We also don't install alarms in our vestibules. The absolute only way of setting off an alarm is by activating the firesprinkler system. Smash our machines all you want as there will be no alarm! Our cameras will activate however  see point 3 above.6. We pointlessly heat our vestibules at the moment. We don't build in any insulation so most of this heat leaves within minutes. To save costs we will probably be removing all heating soon.7. All our vestibules are in safe areas. Please feel free to leave your cars unlocked and valuables within including cell phones and handbags. 8. Our security guards are hired from the finest stock of fat men that couldn't pass the police exam. We realise they are stupid so we don't arm them either. But they do get a nice company car and a decent pension.9. We really don't want our alarm to go off so we install the sprinkler system high up and it can only be activated by heat. There is no way a solid blunt hit will smash the bauble and release the water and sound the alarm.10. If you withdraw the maximum of 500 in one go you will automatically be entered into our free prize draw! The prize is a stylish Parka Coat to help keep you warm in our vestibules! Latest winners have beenKiller of Winnipeg  he says he spends a lot of time at our vestibules and this coat has greatly improved his activity there!Janitor of Winnipeg  he often withdraws cash at our vestibules on his way to work. Just don't mistake him for Killer!Security Guard of Winnipeg  one of our own employees! We even emblazoned this one with SECURITY to help make him feel special!Banker of Winnipeg  however he busted up our vestibule so we will not be sending him his coat. Yeah I jest but this film is a joke. Don't bother with it. If like plenty of other people you're tempted by the trailer you've seen all the film has to offer.".

His story will actually make sense why would he drive two cars into an ATM while he's filling it with water? Why would they think he killed his friend even though you obviously see the girl helping out?And it goes ONNN and ONNN and ONNN.My biggest problem though is that the creators of this film are just laughing at us the viewers.

Everything the characters do is beyond stupid and if you have half a brain through the entire film you'll be asking yourself why they don't do the obvious. 1 Guy 3 of them...umm run in different directions? Maybe..for a start...Anyway the film is boring and predictable except that you're hoping for some sort of brilliant twist or SOMETHING worth your time at the end a modest 3M budget can't excuse a horrible script with horrible contrived plot manipulation  the one character randomly slips when he tries to run to get help? the camera only records 3 second intervals? they couldn't set off an alarm in the span of a full night between three brains at a mall parking lot? Are walk in ATM's randomly situated in the middle of parking lots away from everything else? Why wouldn't either guy decide to team up and go kick his ass it was apparent he had no gun as he didn't use it to kill the pedestrian and never at any point showed one I could go on forever. I've seen many many cheap films with much better outcomes.On the upside the design is fine the acting is fine but it doesn't account for the rest of it.

	schema:reviewBody "That's quite a claim I know. But bear with me... we all know from watching horror films that there's at least one moment where the hero knocks the evil killer to the floor then just runs off allowing him to get back up and chase them down all over again. We all scream No! Hit him again! And again! but they never do.That sort of thing normally happens once or twice in your average horror film. Not in the case of ATM though. You will find yourself screaming at the TV screen near constantly for about forty minutes of the film.ATM is about three friends who use an ATM or 'cash machine' as I always called them in the middle of the night. They go inside to withdraw some dollars only to find there's a psychotic killer who looks a bit like Kenny from South Park in my opinion waiting outside for them. And that's why he does  waits. He stands across the parking lot staring at them. They could just run away. They don't. It's also worth noting that these are the only three people in 2011 who don't have a single mobile phone between them. The killer then kills a passer by. While he's doing that they could just run away. They don't. The killer then ransacks their car which is parked right across the car park. They could just run away. They don't. The killer then wanders round the back of the ATM building they're in to hammer it a bit why?. During that time he's banging on the back they could just open then front door and run off without him seeing. They don't. And so it goes on.These are truly the stupidest three people in the world. I watched it to the end just to see if it got any better. It didn't really. And that was a shame as believe it or not the characters were actually quite wellwritten and funny. Plus the production values were quite high putting it above many other modern horrors.If you're expecting something clever and different like Phone Booth then you won't find it here.".

I'm not going to spoil it here but I promise it is not going to be a twist or stunt that blows you away. And in movies like this it is often frustrating to watch when you know what is going to happen anyway.While the plot does not have serious errors the story is an overall unsatisfactory work.

The thought process these 3 main characters go through trying to escape one man leads me to believe Poppa Smurf could have held them hostage at Disneyland. Successfully. Forever. Everything the ATM stalker villain does makes sense because the 3 captives simply have zero.Watch this flick if you're a fan of b movies or simply bored and want to pick it apart and cringe and a very bad script.

	schema:reviewBody "In all honesty I can really see why the filmmakers thought that this movie would be a good idea and something that could work out well. You can really tell that this movie had some good ideas in it but things aren't really thought out well enough and the movie is incredibly flawed mostly due to its story.These sort of thrillershorror movies set mostly at one location are somewhat popular now days and this movie obviously tried to have a go at it as well and ride on the success of the genre. Nothing wrong with that as long as the movie is good which obviously isn't the case with this movie.Problem is that its concept is ridiculously flawed and not thought out properly. The movie doesn't exactly feature what you could consider a tight plot. It's build around the concept of 3 people being stuck inside an ATM because outside there is an hooded maniac looking to kill them as soon as they get out. Now this is something that could had worked if things got written a bit more tight and complicated. But this is all there is to the movie really 3 people being stuck inside a small building with 1 guy lurking around outside. It's really silly once you really start thinking about it. First of all it's 3 versus 1 and it's not like the guy has some sort of superpowers or is armed to the teeth. I'm not saying that they should had taken on the guy but surely they could had ran out quite easily the moment the guy was at the back trying to break into the ATM. The movie is filled with moments like this that just are plain stupid. It just far too often doesn't make sense and because of that there also really is no true tension in this movie.The movie still thinks it's being really clever at times mostly toward its end when the 'twist' comes but let me just tell you the ending simply makes no sense at all and doesn't explain anything. It only makes things look more flawed and ridicules and besides forced. Why do these sort of movies often feel the need to have a 'surprise' ending in it? Sometimes a movie is simply better off when it's being more straightforward and not by trying to be clever and surprise its audience.This was an obvious low budget production which becomes apparent through its looks but also really its acting. No I definitely wasn't impressed by any of the acting in this movie which was perhaps another reason why I just wasn't taken at all by it.But it still wasn't a movie I hated watching. I guess it's too short and harmless for that. Maybe the more casual movie goer can still get some enjoyment and entertainment out of this movie as long as they don't spend too much time thinking about its plot. But even those people have to admit at the end that this is a far from great or effective enough movie.Really can't recommended it.510 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The killer is simply dumb and it is a fact that this dumb idiot could be caught way too easy. Fourth off The impression the movie gave that the man character was the killer?????

Come on we all know that there was more to be seen on the camera and that he could've never killed his friends and a complete supposedly innocent non speaking stranger made me realize again how fake it is that they killed the guy who entered the ATM because you always enter an ATM without saying a word and attack the other people inside when you are just an innocent bystander.People who give this movie a higher rating than a 3 must be sponsored because I just simply can't believe their words...".

	schema:reviewBody "After a party in the company David Hargrove Brian Geraghty gives a ride home to his colleagues Emily Brandt Alice Eve and Corey Thompson Josh Peck. Corey decides to have dinner and they go to an isolated ATM to withdraw cash. Soon they are threatened by an unknown man Mike O'Brian and they become trapped in the ATM trying to survive.ATM is among the worst movies that I have seen with an awful unrealistic moronic and illogical plot characters and plot point. The stupidity begins with David that has a crush on Emily but he is shy. When he finally has the chance to drive her home the douchebag Corey asks him to take him home instead of taking a taxi. Therefore the douche is not a real friend of David messing up David's flirtation with his dream girl and David is a sucker losing the chance to stay alone with Emily. Corey decides to eat a pizza in a location in the United States of America that does not accept credit card. I do not live in this country but I have never had trouble in using credit card in this country. Then they see a stranger menacing them. In my country ATMs have a hot line direct to the central of the bank to report problems but I do not know how it works in the United States of America if client has a problem. The trio never runs at the same time each one to one different direction instead of doing what they do. When David and Emily finally run out of the ATM they bring the wounded Corey back to the insecure ATM chamber. The stupid situations go on along 90 minutes running time. But the plot point with David becoming the prime suspect of the murders is laughable. My vote is two.Title Brazil Armadilha Trap".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not going to lieI was nervous going into this film. Not because of a disdain for horror mind you I'm a fan of the genre but rather due to the overwhelming amount of 1 and 2 star reviews the film has combined with the appalling critical reviews of the film. I can safely say I'm glad I checked this film out though. I'd be lying if I said the film didn't have a plot hole or two or even moments that are downright stupid for that matter but I enjoy it. One of the joys of being a horror fan is the diversity available to viewers. You're never locked in to what you have to watch but rather what you want to watch. This film isn't A Nightmare on Elm Street by any stretch. This film falls more inline with Nightmare on Elm Street 2meaning it has a lot of promise but fails the execution in various ways. Being someone who grew up watching Josh Peck in programs like The Amanda Show and Drake  Josh I was expecting a standard performance by Peck. I was rather pleased when I discovered that in this film he curses smokes and drinks a far cry from his early days. As for plot the story is simple three people are in ATM booth when a psychopath traps and tortures them. It doesn't cover any ground that Phonebooth didn't already tread just with a campier and more horrific execution. Going into this film expecting it to be a masterpiece on par with the works of Hitchcock or Craven will leave you sorely disappointed. You'll find a much more enjoyable time can be spent with the film when it's properly acknowledged as a fun slightly campy yet dark and serious horror flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "ATM David Brooks' first feature has everything that a first feature should have. One moderately big name actor a moderate budget and a storyline that is cute as a first attempt. ATM brings Nickelodeon's own Josh Peck further into the adult acting world not XXX and shows that with a little bit more practice Brooks might be able to make a name for himself.The film starts off cross cutting someone's hands drawing on blueprints of the aforementioned ATM and our protagonist David played by Brian Geraghty walking to work. As he continues his walk there is a different timeline the 'future' for our active audiences being spliced together as well. It has some remnants of Se7en itching to get out and the campy Christmas music doesn't help it one bit. As the intro fades out and we see that David is a young not very successful stockbroker of some sorts we are introduced quickly to Josh Peck's Corey a cocky shallow coworker that seems like fun.After being coerced into sticking around for a Christmas party in the office David eventually asks Emily played by Alice Eve if he can drive her home. Corey much to my lack of surprise decides to join. The movie then turns into what I like to call a 'bottle movie' where the rest of the movie due to lack in budget andor creativity stay in one location see Abed from Community talking about bottle episodes and you'll understand. David Corey and Emily are then terrorized by a hooded psychopath who is deciding to try to freeze them in an ATM in the height of the winter.The lack of knowing that the characters demonstrate of why they are being terrorized mirrors the quality that Saw made so famous and it serves as a point of thought for the audience to dwell on and an argument for the characters to have throughout the night. The scares and thrills however are no more than cheap Halloweenesque scares loud noises the hooded man coming from a corner and some excess blood that they wanted so desperately to garner their R rating.The ending for me was extremely disappointing and I won't spoil it for you god do I hate spoilers but it was a copout for everyone in not digging deeper into the material they had. They could've gone in a certain direction and make up for the weak moments in the rest of the film but they chose to take an easy way out. Very disappointing indeed.I think in order to truly enjoy this movie you should watch it by yourself at night and don't think too much about what you're watching. If you give it too much thought this movie will not take you by surprise and you will be severely disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off too many people thought this was gonna be a horrorslasher film. It truly is not one. This film deals with suspense and is a thinking man's thriller. Simply put what would you do if you were put in the situation that these characters were put into? For starters I watched the directors cut and I am not sure of any differences that may exist between this and the original theatrical version.ATM starts out kinda slow with a guy who is finally taking a chance on asking out a girl he has had his eye on for some time now. He offers to take her home from a Christmas party when his buddy reminds him that he is his ride home for the night. They end up stopping at an ATM to get some money and that is when the mayhem starts. A menacing figure begins to terrorize the ATM occupants and as the night wears on forced them into paranoid thoughts and acts of desperation.I don't wanna give too much away but I have read a few things up here that I would like to comment on. First off none of the three main characters are heroes. I read why not just beat him up...HE HAS A TIRE IRON IN HIS HAND. Are you gonna attack a weaponwielding guy especially if you don't know how to fight? Secondly some people have said why not run in three directions? Hmm interesting idea BUT here is some factors. One they have dress shoes on. Ever try to run in dress shoes or for the women's case heels? Two how many bad people are truly out there? Do you know if there is one two or maybe more? Of course you don't so you stay. Lastly if it is cold you are paranoid and beyond freaked and a guy has killed two people in front of your eyes you probably have NO DAMN IDEA what you would do.I loved how the killer pushes the cars up to the door to kinda lock them in. Adding the water was just another element of OMG what now??? He was not going for drowning there people the water would have caused hypothermia with the freezing temperatures. Loved the chair idea as well.Yes there were plot holes. Yes they could have parked closer to the ATM. Yes they could have opened the door a little when the water came in even with the cars in the way but remember hypothermia was what the killer was going for. main character even mentions this so people would get it. The acting is good not great but reminds you with someone you work with if you work at an office or cubicle. The ending seemed a little rushed together but it makes sense if you think about it. Good to see no excessive gore just for the sake of having it seems to be the norm nowadays and there truly is no need for it here.6.75 out of 10. Despite the horrible reviews up here check it out for yourself. Put on the actors shoes and ask yourself what you would do in each situation. Not a great film but good enough for a rental at least.".

Here's what I was able to figure out from watchingSundar Shahrukh Khan is a village schoolteacher who is tricked out of his property by an old friend who promises him a job in Dubai. The minute he gets off the train in Dubai he is conned out of all his luggage and then robbed of all his money. Arriving at his new job he finds instead that his friend has sent a letter explaining that there is no job.Broke and feeling sorry for himself he winds up that night in a cemetary where he inadvertently awakens the ghost of a murdered criminal named Marco Naseerudin Shah who engages his help to pay back the traitorous thugs who executed him 20 years before. Guided by Marco's ghost whom no one but Sundar can see Sundar gets a job at the college that is headed by Marco's fatherinlaw and helps Marco settle all his old scores and earn the right to go to heaven. But that's not all! This being a Hindi film there is of course plenty of music and romance involved when Sundar falls in love with Marco's daughter.Naseerudin Shah and Shah Rukh Khan are wonderful together in any language and this movie has some nifty songs and dances including a really enjoyable one when Sundar with the help of the invisible Marco does magic tricks for a crowd of people to raise money for a poor widow and her daughters a cute story as far as I can tell and forgivably bad special effects. There's a little bit of everything drama comedy romance action mystery but none of it is excessively overdone as is so often the case with Bollywood.Not at all a bad way to spend a couple of hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Chamatkar' is a charming and delightful fantasy comedy. It tells the story of a ghost who has some unfinished business that he must fulfil with the help of a noble young teacher. It's his only chance to redeem himself of his past sins to mend his relationship with his estranged daughter and fatherinlaw. The story isn't derived from a novel concept but 'Chamatkar' is treated with sincerity. Some may argue that the movie has a dated feel but for me it was fun to watch how people used to dress during the early 90s in India. I liked most of the songs but the fashion show sequence was unintentionally funny especially how the backup dancers performed and the way they dressed. Naseeruddin Shah is fantastic as Marco the ghost. Who says this man can't do comedy? The same question can be asked about Shahrukh Khan and Urmila Matondkar. It was really great to see these three actors whose comedic flair is underrated work together and make something so funny. Khan is stupendous as the good hearted but gullible school teacher and Matondkar is adorable and vivacious as Marco's daughter and Sunder's girlfriend. They make quite a cute pair and I wonder why these two highly talented actors have never worked together again. Of the supporting cast Shammi Kapoor stands out. 'Chamatkar' doesn't have the highly advanced special effects and style that could perhaps make it more visually appealing but that didn't bother me because there was plenty of other things that was enough to enjoy this movie.".

The film is interesting and flows very well despite a somewhat slow pacing. I found the film artfully intriguing and very well narrated. The film belongs to Kareena Kapoor who finally gave her first noteworthy performance. She does look a bit caricaturish in some scenes but overall she is very convincing charming and touching as a prostitute who is more of a prankster who somehow enjoys life and does not take it too seriously. Rahul Bose turns in a very fine and believable portrayal. The music is beautiful the cinematography is effective and the film is generally realistic and very entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was one of the best Indian films I have seen! I loved it. Such a well written film and so sensitively portrayed. The acting was superb. I adore Rahul Bohse he is always a delight to watch. I agree with another comment on this page that he would have been ideal for the role in Kal Ho Na Ho actually he would be ideal for many roles that I've seen being handed over to lesser actor's for their commercial appeal. He is a delight to watch no matter what character he plays. I first noticed him when he played Sunny in Thakshak. He managed to upstage Ajay Devgan who in my opinion is one of the best actor's in Bollywood. He proved he could do comedy too with his role in Jhankar Beats. As for Kareena Kapoor she was a pleasant surprise. I knew that she could actbut since she was always being typecast she couldn't do much with her roles. I think she bought a touching sensitivity to the character. The fact that it was Kareena Kapoor acting as Chameli somehow made her plight even more poignant because we know what she is like as a carefree character and this is a direct contrast from that. This adds to the pathos in my opinion. There was a lot of depth in her performance. Well done Kareena!As for story it attempts to realistically portray the lives of people in the red light districts and especially those of women and their plight. The two protagonists are both in pain. They are both going through different types of pain in their lives and for a moment they stop to share their plight with one another. It's the kind of encounter everyone dreams of. It's a very romantic meeting albeit in a very unromantic setting. At heart this movie is about finding love in the most unlikely places and how a women who has lost faith in men has it restored by a kind and handsome stranger who wanted to help her without wanting anything back. This movie makes you believe that chivalry is not dead after all!".

He is quite the actor and has done rather well for himself in the Art Cinema genre of Bollywood with film's such as Mr.  Mrs. Iyer Everybody Says I'm Fine to name a few.But I was mildly surprised with Kareena Kapoor's acting capabilities. I always pictured her as the scantly clad selfabsorbed and bitchy poo from the film Kabhie Kushe Kabhie Gham A movie I unfortunately sat through....my solace...I only saw it halfway  and thought of her as another shallow 20something actress. She fits the role like a glove and the film is cinematically appealing to the palate as well. Shot in the monsoon drenched locales of Bombay with catchy songs Bhaage Re Man Sajna Ve and the female rendition of Jaane being my favourites reminded me of good times spent in Bombay.The tale begins with a snippet into Aman Kapoor's played by Rahul Bose life. He is a 30something financial analyst of sorts at one of Bombay's Banks or something along those lines. A party is being thrown for him as he has successfully completed some sort of merger. Aman is prosperous he charges around RS. 10000 per hour for a private consultation but is not the partying sort. So he ends up leaving the bash and drives around Bombay until his car stalls at Fountain in the redlight district notoriously known to be a place frequented by whoremongers and is a place where whores and their pimps reside. As it's a stormy night business is dull. This is where we are introduced to Chameli a whore played by Kareena.Our protagonist Aman and Chameli get involved in conversation. What is the result of this association? I shall let the readers watch and find out.The film is presented as a narrative with Rahul Bose being the storyteller. As I stated before the film is delightful as it give us it certainly did me insight in to the reality of the shanty  shady areas of Bombay but in a more subtle way when compared to movies such as Chandani Bar or Market. This film is the meeting of two very different yet distinct methods of filmmaking in India...the commercial sing sing...dance dance...trees...snowy mountains and the Art House movies that touch sociopolitical issues and raise questionsarguments. A meeting that I thoroughly enjoyed.Now I rarely watch Indian films as most of them turn out to be a waste of three hours but I highly recommend this film to viewers. I give it an 8.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes even strangers can understand your pain better than your own family or friends. As they say everything happens for a reason. As cheesy as this quote is it proves to be true especially in movies. One night. Rain. Two strangers. What's next?First performances. Rahul Bose completely bowled me over as the heartbroken Aman Kapoor who blames himself for the death of his wife. He is humble and caring and has sympathy for the people that are forced into prostitution and moneylaundering. I wish he received the appreciation he deserves. But I really need to watch more of his movies!Kareena Kapoor as the vibrant Chameli is heartwarming though her dialogue delivery seems slightly robotic and rushed at times. She has her own philosophy on her filthy world and this was probably one of her strongest performances. The relationship that Aman and Chameli share is unusual yet understanding the two strangers seem to be interested in each other's worlds and pasts. There's no intimacy only conversations. No grand promises or gestures only talking and helping. And that's what makes this movie so special. It stays close to reality although one would wonder how such heavy rain lasts for so many hours haha. The music is soothing Sajna ve Sajna and Bhaage re Mann are classics. Although the movie is short the pace slows down dreadfully in the second half as happens with most Bollywood films. Nevertheless the proceedings kept my attention for the almost 2 hour runtime as I kept wondering How is this all going to end?And the end of the movie was perfect. It brought a smile to my face. An underrated movie please go watch it if you haven't already!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful movie. It's not a 'masala' type Hindi movie. It's a lovely character study mainly a two way dialog. I first saw that Kareena Kapoor had talent as an actor the initial time I viewed this many years ago. I had always assumed she was a one act wonder candy to look at and a reasonable to good dancer. But there was nuance to her acting in this and she played well against Rahul Bose who has the goods as an actor. I believe it is one of this director's best but it doesn't end on the harsh note that some of his things do. Though there is some ambiguity in the end we are not left holding our own mangled hearts and feeling despair which this director has shown himself quite capable of doing. This is for the most part a quiet movie and it pays close attention to the development of not only the characters but our investment in them. I went away invested in all of these characters and now own a copy to watch at will. Pay attention to Makarand Deshpande who is fantastic as the cab driver he also plays the wanderer who directs Shah Rukh's character in Swades again with an unforgettable flair.. I wish he had larger roles in more things as he is a delight to watch.".

All of the events happen in the course of one night.'Chameli' is a bad movie made worse by the treatment. There's not even a story in this film just character development. The director just introduces two characters to us and lets them talk throughout the movie. It gets horribly boring at a point.Kareena Kapoor tries hard to play the role of a sex worker. And she thinks she can pull it off by overacting. But mind you Ms. Kapoor it doesn't always work. Rahul Bose is mundane and appears lost in front of the camera. The rest of the cast don't do much since the film is just about the two characters.The music in the movie is quite pleasing though. 'Bhaage re mann bhaage' and 'Saajna ve saajna' are the best tracks in the movie.Overall a disappointing fare from Sudhir Mishra who gave us the brilliant 'Is Raat Ki Subaah Nahin' before. Avoid!".

The digitally restored version looks good and some improvements have been made where shots were obviously spliced out of sequence but since we now know that there are specific problems in this negative with poor editingpacing e.g. shots being held a little too long and the use of reaction shots that didn't originally make the grade it's hard to be sure how many of the film's issues are due to this fact and how many to an actually weak storyline. Given that the major problems are the complaint that the film seems to drag and that characters' reactions just don't seem to make sense I'm afraid that Champagne as originally released may well have been substantially superior to the only version that we will ever be able to see  This was apparently a case of a film where the title and star were decided upon in advance and then a scenario had to be constructed around them! Hitchcock's original plan was for a ragstorichesto rags plot as opposed to the richestoragstoriches version ultimately used in which a girl working at a rural champagne plant would go up to Paris and see for herself how the drink fuelled dissipated nightlife only to return disgusted to her poor but honest job. However it was felt that the great British public would much prefer to see glamour celebrated on the screen rather than have their illusions popped  cinema was an escapist medium for those whose life was hard  and so a completely different scenario was developed. It is interesting to wonder however how much of the cabaret sequence derives from this original concept.Like most of Hitchcock's early films this is not a typical Hitchcock production  the director was expected to do his job as paid by the studio rather than provide his own material  and is of interest to those who enjoy films of the era rather than to those who are looking for traces of The Master of Suspense. Betty Balfour is the quintessential Twenties Girl here wilful and bubbly with a Cupid'sbow pout cropped curls and the ambition to dictate her own life rather than acquiesce to the plans of the male half of the population. The plot is thin and in places rather contrived but as this is by no means rare in comedies of the period or later ones... I think the problem is with the handling of the material rather than with the storyline per se.The beginning is good I particularly liked the description of the young man as a 'cakehound'. a wonderfully period insult and the wordless comedy of seasickness is very well handled without being merely crude I love the way the Boy veers between outraged determination to confront his supposed rival and qualms from his uncertain stomach. The concept of forcing the spoilt flapper to fend for herself echoing Buster Keaton's hapless couple on board the Navigator is obviously intended as a major comedy hook for the plot although it's not played intensively for laughs. I have to say that this is the first time I've ever seen a director actually get comic business out of the actual process of cooking as opposed to simply miming that the rockcakes are rockhard and did wonder if it reflected an impressive degree of domestication on Mr Hitchcock's or Mr Stannard's part!The main problem with the film is I think the cabaret sequence and I do wonder if this is a leftover from the original scenario. Instead of developing the comedy inherent in a girl who 'makes a mess of everything she gets her hands on' including the back of her lover's jacket...! looking for a job we are plunged into what turns out to be a rather confusing and portentous sequence of events as her 'job' at the cabaret seems to get forgotten in favour of sexual innuendo the prostitutes the lesbians the wouldbe rapist... The plot becomes muddled not helped by what turns out to be an interpolated dreamnightmare sequence and ends up with the girl running off to throw herself on the mercy of a man she has previously  and soon again subsequently  seemed to be afraid of. Considered dispassionately much of this section seems to be a digression that neither develops the comedy nor furthers the plot mechanics although it is probably the most 'Hitchcockian' part of the picture!Having contorted the characters into the required situation to create the final comic setup  the showdown of mistaken intentions on board the returning liner  the film concludes fairly happily with some genuine laughter through unforced farce. The acting is by and large good  save for those moments when it is simply totally confusing!  and the basic plot is a promising setup for a typical light comedy of the period complete with showy costumes for the leading lady and a hint of slapstick.

Although it's mostly a comedic romance there are indications of Hitch things to come  in the cabaret staircase scenes and a 360 degree shot that I before thought was pioneered in Frankenheimer's Manchurian Candidate 1962.Betty was extremely charming and versatile here I'd love to see some Squibs her most famous movies... but after the introduction of talkies she was more Rain than Singing. Anyway this snapshot conserves special moments the dresschanging the rolling of the dough the chair dance ... Highly recommended if you go for museum pieces and read lips instead of waiting for intertitles. Not everybody's taste but surely mine ".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a real mixed bag of sorts. The film follows a woman named Betty who is in love with her rich boyfriend. However Betty also has a substantial amount of money and Betty's father believes that her boyfriend is a golddigger. Betty takes her father's plane and goes after her boyfriend anyway who is on a ship heading to France. Betty attempts to get married to her boyfriend but they get in an argument and separate after they reach France. After getting back together Betty's father tells her that they have lost all of their money in the stock market which causes Betty's boyfriend to leave again. Will her boyfriend return or is he really a golddigger? The story isn't very interesting when it comes down to it although I did enjoy the twist at the end of the film.As for the acting it's actually pretty good. Betty Balfour plays Betty and does a stupendous job at it. She seems to fit into the role very naturally and does a good job at not exaggerating emotions like in most silent films. Gordon Harker plays Betty's father Mark and seems to do a good job at seeming unpleased with his daughter's decision. And finally Jean Bradin plays Betty's boyfriend and he also does a good job in the role. While the acting is good it doesn't save the film.The special effects in the film are flawed and some of them seem obvious which isn't very good at all. However the music is stupendous here and does a great job at creating emotions which you don't normally get from films of this time period. The camera angles and shots being used are truly ahead of their time which helps the film.Even though I praised many aspects of the film the plot just feels so basic and uninteresting plus the poor quality of the special effects really hurt the atmosphere and immersion of the film. So while it has many positives it also has many negatives which causes it to equal out to a very mediocre film. Score 410".

She's completely out of control spending daddy's money with her lover Jean Bradin when Daddy Warbucks lowers the boom by telling her the champagne business is kaput. Some of the usual Hitch camera tricks keeps the plot interesting as the story moves from an ocean liner to Paris and back to the liner. It is fascinating to watch the photography and camera placements because at least one the view through the bottom of a glass would be reused by Hitchcock later in his career.Balfour is fine as the ditsy girl and she does show versatility going through a gamut of emotions. Harker who would continue his career in talkies is demonstrative to the nth degree and is this close to overacting. Ironically this film shows a Wall Street millionaire looking at the stock market tables constantly in 1928 and the great stock market crash does happen for real the next year.If for nothing else than the twisty ending this film does bear watching. That is if you are not expecting a suspenseful Hitchcockian thriller. There are a few laughs but the earth does not move and we are left with a glimpse of a slice of life from 80 years ago.".

She made her name in a series of popular comedies centred around Squibs a Piccadilly flower seller. Soon she was the most popular screen star in Britain popular enough to be given the lead in Champagne directed by up and coming director Alfred Hitchcock. He attempted this as a change of pace from his more recent somber films The Lodger 1927 and The Ring 1927 but Hitchcock didn't like it. Obviously with Miss Balfour as the star the film was tailored to her light hearted talent and Hitchcock was out of his element and refused to mold a film around a particular personality ever again. He wasn't the only one who wasn't impressed the movie wasn't well received by Variety who called the story of the weakest.I did like Betty Balfour. I had only seen her in Evergreen where she was distinctly matronly  it was so nice to see her at her best as a fun loving flapper even if the movie dragged. Millionaire Wall Street businessman Gordon Harker is so exasperated at his daughter's frivolous ways he is determined to teach her a lesson. He tells her he has lost all his money and forces her to face up to life's realities. Her fianc who has long wished that she would ditch some of her fair weather friends is the only person who stands by her. There is also a certain man about town waiting in the wings.Music is so important to me while watching silent movies and this was of the deadliest. It is like someone saw the name of Alfred Hitchcock in the credits and inserted the most dramatic symphonies they could find. It was for the most part a light hearted comedy and really needed some popular songs of the day. I also think more could have been done with Betty's job hunting  she answered an advertisement to demonstrate toothpaste but found herself in a cabaret selling boutonneires she couldn't escape from Squibs!!. Suddenly man about town turns up when she is at her lowest and falls in with her suggestion to whisk her off to New York but even in this early stage of his career Hitchcock had a surprise or two up his sleeve and the man about town is revealed as a good friend of her father's who has promised to keep an eye on her. But do those bedroom eyes that look at her over the glass of sparkling champagne mean business or pleasure. All will be revealed  but not in this movie!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Champagne was among the last of Hitchcock's silents and made at a period when Hollywood was already turning fast towards the talkies. Perhaps because of this the young and naive Hitchcock appears to be cramming in as much visual technique as possible.Right from his first picture Hitchcock had loved the pointofview shot. Champagne makes heavy use of what I call extreme pointofview shots  that is ones which really draw your attention to the fact that we are seeing a character'seyeview for example where we see the actor's hands in front of us or the camera moves as the character walks. To this end Hitchcock even had giant props built to wave in front of the lens. There are also copious other techniques which aim to literalise the experience of the characters  for example shaking the camera around when the ship is rocking. Although the later Hitchcock would sometimes use such tricks far more subtly to draw the audience into the character's world here and now it's just a bit of overt stylisation that in no way enhances the film.Trickery for trickery's sake is often worse than useless. When Betty Balfour is told her father has lost his fortune there is a superimposition of a room spinning. If Balfour is good enough she could convey what is going on inside her character's head. I think I speak for most audience members when I say I would rather look at a good acting performance than a postproduction special effect.It's a pity Hitch felt he needed to dress up his shots so much because even at this early stage he had good timing for basic pointofview and reaction shots allowing him to smoothly reveal intentions and opinions. His basic film grammar is good enough to keep down the number of intertitles. By the way the difference between a picture like this and those made around the same time in the US which tend to be very wordy is not that the Hollywood directors were bad at visual storytelling it's that their pictures were often full of unnecessary title cards whereas in Europe the goal was generally to keep them to a minimum.It's a mercy too that the acting in Champagne tends to be fairly naturalistic the only touches of theatricality being for the sake of comedy. None of them is exceptional but none of them is really bad either. I'm not quite convinced though by Gordon Harker as a millionaire but perhaps this is because I'm so used to seeing him playing earthy working class types.All else I have to say about Champagne is that it is just a bit dull  a comedy drama that is not enough of one thing or the other. A reasonable plot a handful of good gags but ultimately lifeless. At this point Hitchcock was really just saying through his camera Look at me! I'm the director! Look what I can do! when he should have been turning all those audienceinvolving techniques into gripping entertainment  as he later would.".

The view through the champagne glass was also a nice touch and decidedly novel way back in the silent era. What I found most disconcerting however were the abruptness of the moods and facial expressions of the central characters particularly Betty Betty Balfour and The Man Ferdinand Von Alten. Within seconds their demeanor would go from happy to grim or vice versa with no apparent change in circumstances within the scene. That only managed to convey an unusual amount of 'huh?' moments as I tried to imagine myself in the same situation. So a lot of the picture didn't work for me.There was also the simplistic set up of having Betty chase down her boyfriend aboard ship to Paris. Later it's learned that Betty's father is 'busted' due to his investment misfortunes and The Boy Jean Bradin declares that he'll get a job to help them out. Well then how did the well dressed impeccably groomed traveler afford to go on an ocean cruise? See what I mean? The continuity of what Hitchcock was trying to convey doesn't hold up under close inspection.And then there's The Man. Hired by Betty's father his on screen appearance suggested a lecherous womanizer who would use any means to conquer yet another victim. The scene in the cabaret that suggested just that turned out to be a mirage sequence of sorts with an abrupt turnabout. More confusing than necessary I thought and a curve ball thrown at the viewer.Say how did Father Gordon Harker get 'The New York Advertiser' to post a headline that he was teaching his daughter a lesson? I did get a kick out of his description of The Boy in the telegram he sent to The Man  it described The Boy as a 'boulevard sheik'.As for a recommendation  see it for an early Hitchcock effort and as a curiosity piece.

	schema:reviewBody "Long before he became known for the master of horror Sir Alfred Hitchcock did all kinds of films including this silent comedy starring Betty Balfour as a rich heiress who defies her father. This film is much lighter in tone than his others. Hitchcock dabbled in everything in film. Most of his early work is always worth viewing for study and entertainment. Balfour is the perfect leading lady. She is blonde beautiful and vivacious in her role here. This silent is different because the music are classical especially Ravel's Bolero. I knew this film was different by the music. Until I heard Ravel's Bolero I wasn't sure. Once I heard Bolero I knew the music was both familiar and classical to the audience. Unlike his other silent films this film is much shorter and a little over an hour for viewing but the worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best way to explain Champagne only makes it more confusing. It's a comedy that only works as a comedy when you watch it as a drama. Pull that off and you get some clever periodrich entertainment but only if you watch it again. That's something a first viewing may not entice you to do.The rich are different than you or me... F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that famous line around the same time young rich girl Betty Betty Balfour decides to board an ocean liner by ditching an airplane in the middle of the Atlantic. What a great way to sail away with her boyfriend Jean Bradin especially since their union is much opposed by her American plutocrat Daddy Gordon Harker! He sees the boy as a fortunehunter. But what if there is no fortune left to hunt?This Jazz Agespirited comedy of status and love is remembered today as an early silent effort from director Alfred Hitchcock who later dismissed it as his worst ever. But Champagne is better than most of his silent films and certainly way above later sound films of his like The Paradine Case and Jamaica Inn. It also rates better than the later Hitchcock comedies Mr. And Mrs. Smith and The Trouble With Harry.Champagne has technique coming out of its ears too from an opening shot of a party seen through the bottom of a champagne glass to a startling transition shot of a leap off a balcony. Balfour is a fun lead who draws a rooting interest a bit too smug in her wealth but with a palpably good heart. The ending is clever and quick in a very Hitchcockian way.What the film doesn't offer much in is laughs a problem for a comedy especially a light one like this. Instead you get rolling ship decks and overacting supporting actors. Harker ever the ham overdoes his cigar chewing and facial tics for lack of any substantive comic business while Marcel Vibert as a maitre d' rubs his hands and raises his eyebrows with antic abandon.Igenlode Wordsmith in an October 2012 review pointed up the problem of the second half of the film namely all the comic potential left on the table when Betty gets work at Vibert's cabaret. By this time we have a good idea that Betty's problems aren't as serious as they seem so we should be allowed to watch Betty cut loose and raise havoc. Instead Hitchcock works up the suspense with a character played by Ferdinand von Alten whose place in this film is reminiscent of Ivor Novello in The Lodger that of a sinister silent type always on the lookout...or something.I liked von Alten's performance quite a lot particularly the second time I saw it which is what makes a big difference. When you watch for the comedy you do see it. But it's in the background. In the foreground is the suspense element Hitchcock works and at times overworks in the second half.What compensates for this and raises Champagne to the level of a mild recommendation is how Balfour's character is used. She's both annoyingly carefree in her richgirl cocoon and admirably spirited and independent in her drive to be who she wants to be whatever the cost. Bradin ironically plays a bit of a stick who has more in common with Betty's father than she does but her devotion to both men makes us care for all three. It also a striking issue namely how much people can love one another when they not only fail to understand each other but don't see the need.Seeing them come to terms with this is what makes the film work as a comedy yet it's not enough unless you take their problem seriously which as a comedy this isn't geared to do. Balfour's engaging if light performance does all it can to square the circle and it's enough just. Champagne may not be that substantive otherwise but it's worth a sip.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying that Hitchcock is a master of suspense and was a great director. I always loved his better known movies such as The Birds Psycho and Rear Window. About a couple of years ago I came across a one dollar DVD entitled simply Alfred Hitchcock. It contained four films I haven't seen Jamacia Inn Sabotage The 39 Steps Which is very good. and Easy Virtue. They were for the most part good. Shortly after I found another Hitchcock dollar DVD entitled Alfred Hitchcock Classics Volume 1 which included Champagne and Murder!. So there's the intro. Now on to the review. Like I said Hitchcock was a great director and in this movie we see his greatness shine through. However the story is the problem I have with the movie. It's just boring. It has nothing to do with the fact that it's silent it is just a bad movie. I personally don't like movies about some spoiled rich girl who whines for most of the show. Which is why I never cared for Gone With the Wind. This movie is no exception. For an eightyfive minute movie it just dragged by. This story could have been told in twenty minutes. That's how simple the plot is. The reason I gave it a 2 and not a 1 is because of the direction. The direction is definitely there. My favorite shots are the shots through the champagne glass. However for the most part the rest of the movie sucked. Now I know this isn't Alfred's fault. When a director starts out he doesn't always get to pick and choose his movies but as a viewer that's not my problem. Hitchcock once said this is his worst movie. And that's coming from a master of suspense. So if that doesn't tell you something. So in conclusion I recommend this only to hardcore Hitchcock fans but the rest should steer clear.".

I will only comment on the ones that are not so popular.Anyways Champagne hardly kept my interest as it was a silent film with not enough written dialog for the viewer to see. I saw a few humorous scenes and two intense scenes and that's all. They weren't very long and the story I felt was weak. There was the man played by Theo Von Alten who looked through the champagne glass as was to introduce the story and really one of the few Hitchcock touches and it also ended with the man looking through the champagne glass to end the story.I wasn't sure if the man was going to rapekill the girl played by Betty Belfour which happened to be intense until she ran away. Also at the end where the man and the boy played by Jean Bradin were fighting and the boy tried strangling the man. That was short lived as it was explained the man was hired by the father played by Gordon Harker to prevent his daughter from eloping.The comedy scene was the drunkard not being affected by the waves below the ship but everyone else. Also the girl seeing everyone else have a good time and wanted to join with her big smile and fast moving hips but her boy wouldn't let her. Also when the father was reading the papers and smoking his cigar or pipe I can't remember he was hilarious I thought.The boy was always low key or pessimistic as he felt he was in control and wanted to arrange the wedding details. This always bothered the girl and always put tension between the girl and the boy. You can say it wasn't a match made in heaven.I only wish the dialog spoken in silence on the screen was displayed more in writing and we could have understood more of the story. Alfred Hitchcock said he believed Champagne was his worst movie and I tend to agree.".

Real star of this film is the old Ocean Liner SS United States.    1962 was the twilight of the big Transatlantic Ocean Liners and  The Big U shows herself in all her glory. Shot on location in Paris and the Riviera it gives us a look back at Paris back in the 60's with all the fads and fashions. A bit dated for today's tots. This film is probably better suited for adults looking for a nostalgic look back.".

Each of them has some issues to deal with.MacMurray just can't seem to do what he wants to do some family crisis is always interrupting. Walley has fallen for American playboy Michael Callan who is dying to get out from under his rich dowager mother Jessie RoyceLandis. Wyman has attracted the attention of a gigolo in Ivan Desnys. Kirk is having the old badger game run on him by Georgette Anys the mother of a girl he met on the Riviera beach. Only Kevin Corcoran seems to have no problems but he gets separated from MacMurray in a tour of the Paris sewer system.

That was a far better film and the Griswolds will linger in your memory way after the Willards have gone.In a recent biography of Fred MacMurray Tommy Kirk did not have fond memories of the film. His sexuality had come to light at the studio and Jane Wyman treated him horribly. As for Fred MacMurray he and Fred had a decent relationship from previous films but it was never quite the same after that.

Disney maverick's 'Tommy Kirk' and 'Kevin Anthony Moochie Corcoran' are on board as well. And then there is Deborah Walley who I never heard of before but she seems like she's a good actress.OK there is the wholesome Disney atmosphere some wacky situations one involving Fred getting lost in the sewers of Paris and other wacky things including Fred almost getting arrested from causing a scene at a restaurant. He has some other wacky conversations with some relatives who have never meet him but think it's horrible that Jane Whyman's character has marred of all things 'A plumber'. He slyly reveals that he is the plumber much to their shocked snobbery surprise. Overall there is the interesting sitcom concept and premise of a family taking a vacation in Europe.This concept was used in 'National Lampoon's European Vacation' and produced a rather funny film. The concept used in this film produced a rather dull and boring movie. Despite the cleaner friendly film it isn't a Disney film worth adding to your collection and I would have to say it isn't worth renting either. NLEV is crude in parts and is not worth letting your kids watch unless you find a way to severely edit out all the inappropriate parts.But 'Bon Voyage' is not the better equivalent. With Fred MacMurray you expect better work. His character is annoying. When a man hits on his wife instead of hitting him he guzzles down booze and gets upset at his wife because a guy is flirting with her. He does finally sock the guy so justice wins out in the end even though you have to wait for it to happen while enduring his whining about it. The melodrama that bubbles up from this film is also annoying and leaves you wondering about the deeper storyline that they never reveal. Even if they did you probably wouldn't care anyway.The Disney magic does not flow upon everything that it does. This is not the worst film ever made or the worst film Disney ever made it's just a rather boring dull film. So I say Bon Voyage 'Bon Voyage  and don't come back".

MacMurray does have a few good comedy scenes but there's not enough punch to make this more than an extended sitcom. The film won Oscar nominations for sound and the hideous costumes.";

The first half of the film drags terribly with the gags firing on only a couple of cylinders and there is a desperate need for some vim and vigour. Compared to James Stewart's wonderful 'Mr Hobbs takes a Vacation' made in the same year this film falls flat in most areas and even the usually excellent Sherman brothers music is uncharacteristically dull. There's a curious scene in which Dad finds himself alone in a streetside cafe and is approached by a pretty woman who seems to be an er.. 'escort'. It lasts only a couple of minutes and does not connect to anything else in the film except a little later we see the same woman trying to chat up the elder son. With an already long running time of 2hrs 12 minutes this scene could have easily been cut with no effect on the movie. The best thing I can say is that Fred McMurray does his best and Jane Wyman not my favourite actress looks quite nice as does the sunlit scenery.".

Like Spencer Tracy in Father of the Bride provider MacMurray is the most overlooked member of the family unappreciated by his two sons and daughter and overshadowed by the compassionate mom Wyman who sometimes seems to take him for granted. He is forced to put up with Wyman's family and friends from Boston at a sendoff party who don't understand why someone like Wyman would go off an marry some plummer from the midwest. Then on the ship he finds himself overwhelmed by his youngest son when everybody goes off to do their own thing. He realizes that as the older children find themselves involved in their own young romantic problems they prefer the tenderness of Wyman's motherly advice to his more direct approach in dealing with them. Daughter Deborah Walley falls in love with the neglected heir to a fortune who is the product of a broken home and prepares to have her heart broken while son Tommy Kirk makes plays for very single young woman he meets. Then when they get to Paris embarrassment after embarrassment befalls MacMurray first being lost in the sewers and seemingly never getting to the Louve then dealing with a caddish Hungarian who makes a pass at Wyman. It all falls apart at a party that Walley's boyfriend's mother Jessie Royce Landis gives where MacMurray gets drunk on a liquorish liqueur then creates a major disturbance in Monte Carlo that could result in an international incident.From the Absent Minded Professor to Son of Flubber to Father of Trouble MacMurray was Disney's everyman expected to keep the family together without actually really having any say. That's the lovely Wyman's job and she is the perfect wife and mom in every manner. MacMurray utilizes his massive talents of lighthearted comedy to keep your interest but the episodic situations and predictable outcomes make this situation comedy like Disney movie an overlong precursor to The Facts of Life Go to Paris. Disney seems to be taking over here where MGM had stopped after the last of the Andy Hardy movies were made several years before. Disney does raise a bit of an eyebrow by briefly introducing a character who is obviously a prostitute and a family of opportunistic Parisans who set their moneyhungry eyes on the not quite so rich Americans. But when you put it altogether what it seemingly comes down to was Disney was telling us that while it's nice to venture there's no place like home and the backyard you live in is the best place to hang your hat.".

The surprise is that the story is far from being original a young Arab sentenced to adult prison for the first time is forced by a Corsican mafia boss running the strings there to do his bidding. By and by he manages to use his underling position to his own advantage. So it's a typical hardboiled underdog story  what makes it so great then? 'Un Prophte' doesn't differ much in style from the French films of late which were often so hellbent on displaying life as a gritty and boring affair and resorted to radical violence to underscore this point that spectators were almost forced to feel disgusted which was then claimed to be a denominator of the film's artistic success. This phenomenon has been called 'New French Extremity'. What Jacques Audiard has done is to combine the aesthetics of this trend with the traditions which once made the French film industry the most power and meaningful in Europe namely to focus on the relationship of the leading actors. The result is a film that is totally engaging from the first minute because it entrusts the actors with the task of transforming the script into something of their own making.And boy oh boy Tahar Rahim does that job. A newcomer with a little bit of TV experience his performance carries 'Un Prophte' with amazing vigor. It's a big chance and he takes it. Would this be an Englishlanguage film he'd be a surefire contender for the awards. His nemesis is portrayed by Niels Arestrup in an equally flawless yet much more routinized way which juxtaposes the two characters perfectly. Add to this the sophisticated editing already present in Audiard's last film 'De battre mon coeur s'est arret' 2005 and you have the best European film of 2009 in spite of a story that you will most likely have seen dozens of times already.If you usually don't like European movies or if you have only time to see one a year watch this one  you won't regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Un Prophte  Jacques Audiard  France  2008  2h35A young man is being admitted into prison. The scars on his body and face betray a violent past. He can barely read and write. He has no friends. Malik Tahar Rahim is 19 years old. Out on the concrete courtyard he is recruited by the ruthless Corsican mafioso Csar Niels Arestrup to kill a rival passing through their prison. Malik is beaten into submission. His life could have ended right there and then. But that is not how it was to be. Malif comes out the corner fighting. Most of the film is concrete slabs and dirt. There is the constant murmur of the rumours passed around in Arabic and Corsican if it is not in banlieue slang French. And then there is the violence. Nobody gets punished because nobody interferes. Even when inmates get killed there is no indication that they are being investigated. The detainees are all on their own. We do see the state's legal machinery operating in the background with lawyers and judges shifting paper. We see the inmates work in the prison factory sowing clothes. We see the willing bullies being schooled. But the penitentiary staff shine mostly in their absence. Malik knows it is going to be a long 6 years. He takes what he can get and tries to make the best of himself. He could have made an excellent career for himself in the army if life had been different. He has the adaptability the patience the dedication the intelligence and the lack of moral restraint to make it far in the right framework. If only he had been in an organisation which could contain and direct him rather than unleash him as prison did. We see him slowly becoming a man to be reckoned with creating his own new order. Make no mistake this young man is taking you along to the bitter end. Un Prophte is a tough film to watch but immaculately constructed. I can not claim to have captured the full finesse of the all the criminal dealings but it does not matter. The audience is thrown into the story as the young Malik is. Thrown in to live it with him. And live it you will. It is a masterfully made film with a clever script an excellent cast and a surprising attention to detail. A rare pearl in the genre bound to be as rewarded as director Audiard's previous De Battre mon coeur s'est arrt which won no less than 8 Csars! incitatus.org".

	onyx:emotionText "Un Prophte  Jacques Audiard  France  2008  2h35A young man is being admitted into prison. The scars on his body and face betray a violent past. He can barely read and write. He has no friends. Malik Tahar Rahim is 19 years old. Out on the concrete courtyard he is recruited by the ruthless Corsican mafioso Csar Niels Arestrup to kill a rival passing through their prison. Malik is beaten into submission. His life could have ended right there and then. But that is not how it was to be. Malif comes out the corner fighting. Most of the film is concrete slabs and dirt. There is the constant murmur of the rumours passed around in Arabic and Corsican if it is not in banlieue slang French. And then there is the violence. Nobody gets punished because nobody interferes. Even when inmates get killed there is no indication that they are being investigated. The detainees are all on their own.

Though an Arab Malik becomes the cat'spaw for an aging Corsican mob boss named Cesar Luciani whose influence in the prison has begun to wane as more and more Muslims are brought in to swell the prisoner ranks. Eventually the everresourceful Malik finds a way to straddle the lines separating the various factions in the prison while at the same time partnering with his buddy to run a hashish operation when he's out on his frequent 24hour leaves.The beauty of A Prophet is that we really get the sense that had he been dealt a halfway decent hand in life Malik might have actually been a kind caring person instead of the lost soul that he's become. But the lack of any parental influence in his life his illiteracy and now his consignment to prison life have left him with few viable options other than to become involved in mayhem and crime. He's horrified by the fact that as a kind of loyalty test early on Luciani forces him to murder in cold blood a man he doesn't know and might even like under other circumstances. And there are heartbreaking moments throughout where we sense the goodness in Malik's tortured soul. His appreciation of simple kindnesses his attempts at learning to read his childlike wonder as he looks out of a plane window for the first time his tenderness with a buddy's newborn son  all go a long way towards mitigating some of the truly despicable acts of violence and murder he's called upon to do. The brilliant screenplay wisely refuses to judge Malik it simply presents the options and parameters that have been given to him by fate society nature what have you  and watches as he maneuvers through in and around them in order to survive.Harsh and brutal as this film can be at times  for it never shies away from portraying what life is like in a prison setting  it is in those more lyrical moments the ones in which we are allowed to see into the heart of this young man that A Prophet achieves true masterpiece status.Tahar Rahim rises to the challenge in a brilliantly understated awardworthy performance as Malik capturing our sympathy and concern throughout. Niels Arestrup is also outstanding as the brutal and demanding Luciani as is Adel Bencherif as Malik's one friend from prison who serves as both a positive and a negative influence on the young man.Directed with unerring conviction and power by Jacques Audiard A Prophet is a cinematic work of art  and a movie not to be missed.".

	schema:headline " One of the best films of 2009";
	schema:reviewBody "A 19yearold man of North African origin is sentenced to six years in prison for assaulting a police officer. When he enters prison he is nave shy and almost withdrawn and cannot read or write. When he leaves six years later he has become a self possessed educated individual capable of controlling his own destiny as well as that of others. Jacques Audiard's Read My Lips The Beat That My Heart Skipped A Prophet winner of the Grand Prix Award at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival is an engrossing comingofage drama set in a French prison in which Malik el Djebena Tahar Rahim a Muslim estranged from his own community is recruited into the ruling Corsican Mafia and eventually becomes a gang leader himself. Though deeply involved in nefarious and often bloody activities the genuineness of his personality makes him an appealing and sympathetic character and adds depth to a riveting experience.Based on a story by screenwriter Abdel Raouf Dafri the film clocks in at a lengthy 150 minutes but never feels padded or stretched out. Unable to film in an actual prison location because they were all being used Audiard had his own prison built in an industrial area of Paris. As he explains Watching it take shape helped us build the prison in our minds as well. When Malik first arrives he is singled out by Corsican Mafia boss Csar Luciani Niels Arestrup and told to kill a fellow Muslim prisoner Reyeb Hichem Yacoubi by slitting his throat with a razor blade. If he refuses he will be killed himself.Once the job is done in as brutal a killing scene as you will ever witness or want to witness Malik is put under Csar's protection becoming the Corsican's Arab who carries out menial tasks for him inside the prison. Beset by visions of the deceased Reyeb Malik however soon begins to educate himself on many levels not only learning to read but teaching himself Corsican and learning details of Luciani's business. More importantly for his survival he learns how to operate among the various prison subcultures with their various rituals and codes of honor though he is still an outsider not fully trusted by either group.There is no shortage in the film of details involving drug traffic sex payoffs and general prison corruption things we have seen before yet the level of our personal involvement remains high due to the heart pounding set pieces and the compelling performances of the lead actors. Slowly Csar raises the level of jobs given to Malik affording him the opportunity to leave the confinement of the prison on several day passes one involving his first ever flight to Marseilles to negotiate with another Mafia kingpin. Little by little Malik sets up his own enterprises with his friend Ryad Adel Bencherif who is suffering from cancer and begins to establish his independence from the Corsicans. He becomes known as a prophet when he survives a bizarre car crash an incident that has been foretold in a fantasy sequence.Supported by a compelling original score by Alexandre Desplat and brilliant cinematography by Stphane Fontaine A Prophet is violent often ugly and difficult to watch but is redeemed by the quality of the direction the outstanding performances by Rahim and Arestrup and the honesty in which it handles the conflicts among ethnic groups conflicts that mirror French society as a whole. Tahar Rahim is little more than a cipher at the beginning yet acquires considerable strength of character by the end of the film. According to Audiard When I looked into his eyes there was no melancholy no tragedy just someone very open very light very full of life. A mixture of gritty reality flights of fancy identity exploration and psychological character study A Prophet is one of the best films of 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I read that this movie has more nominations than any other film for the European Film Awards even more than Slumdog Millionaire I decided to go and see it. I don't regret this decision and I hope the movie wins all six awards it has been nominated for.This movie about a young hoodlum who in prison becomes a dangerous criminal is in the same league as last years's Gomorra. It shows the life of criminals as it is tough merciless and unscrupulous. This film is miles away from the romantic image of maffiastyle crime gangs we know from Hollywood. There is no honour here no attachments no loyalty. Only selfinterest. The style of the film reflects the rawness of its subject. The photography is meant to show life in a prison not to please our sense of aesthetics.Why is this such a good film? Because of the radical approach to show us nothing but the raw underbelly of France but also because of the story which has many aspects. Malik the central character has no true identity at all he is not a religious Muslim he eats pork but he is neither French nor Corsican. The members of the Corsican clan to which he is being attached despise him because he is not one of them and so do the religious Muslims 'les barbus'. Another interesting aspect is the development of the relationship between Malik en the Corsican capo Cesar with a very powerful apotheosis. And there is the changing of Malik himself of course who in the beginning of this film seems to be devoid of any emotion at all but in the end is capable of warm feelings towards his godson and the wife of his terminally ill friend.After having seen Un Prophte I regret not having seen Jacques Audiards other films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with praise is that so much is said and so much is built up that at times it can be quite imposing for me to approach a film to watch it for what it is. This happened with A Prophet which is why it took me over a year to get around to watching it. The uniformly great praise and the awards all built this film up in my head as something that would be worthy perhaps a little arty and maybe even deliberately inaccessible which can be the case with some films that critics gush over  partly I think it makes them appear smart. Also lest we forget it is also in French and runs to almost two and a half hours long. However I decided it had been on my queue for far too long as it was and recently I sat to watch it.What I found was not an art film not a pretentious film not a foreign film but rather just a really well told story of a young man falling into a life of crime but then climbing and scheming his way up it. The rather breathless manner in which the film has been discussed doesn't do it any favours because if you ignore all the words the film is just this and it does it very well indeed. The Malik at the start of the film is very different from the Malik in the later stages even though only a few years have passed. The difference is very well handled and we see him grow in his abilities his confidence and also his ruthlessness. All of this occurs in a consistent flow of narrative that begins with him being forced into a violent act one that stays with him but then making himself useful and starting his own things on the side. In terms of narrative events it is very well structured and easy to follow but it is the emotional journey that adds layers to it.I read one critic compare the journey from comparative innocence to that taken by Michael Corleone in The Godfather and while the details are more lowkey and grubby it is a fair comparison. Malik is fascinating as he stresses himself sick over his first kill but just as fascinating when playing the odds with the various factions he straddles with influence. He is never free of beatings or risk but he engages in the way he deals with it all with confidence and a growing willingness to do what is required. Director Audiard delivers it all with a range of styles  most of which work. At times it feels very seedy and grey in colour particularly at the start and the camera sits in corners and watches from afar this then contrasts with other scenes where it owes a debt to Scorsese in the use of music and montages Malik being put in role of porter to the sound of Nas being a sudden but effective change in style. I wasn't really feeling the use of words on the screen  it didn't seem to add much and it did feel a bit too derivative but other than this I had no complaints.The performances are mostly very strong. The standout is of course Rahim in the lead role he convinces in his journey and he pitches his development just right across the film  never going too far from who he is not becoming a different person but just showing growth and change in small but important ways. Arestrup is nearly as good as the cruel but fading lord of the prison while Bencherif Yacoubi and many others make convincing supports. The world of the prison also feels very real and very threatening and even the extras add to the feeling of the place.A Prophet is a great film a crime story with strong characters well developed plot and a constant feel of risk and threat without being over the top or losing touch with the gritty real feel of the prison world. Directed with style but not too much style the film uses the cast well and produces a roundly engaging and satisfying story. Perhaps a bit too overhyped and made out to be way more than it is it is still very much seeing and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Goodfellas and other such crime stories.".

	schema:headline " Represents gritty filmmaking at its most uncompromising";
	schema:reviewBody "Malik Tahar Rahim is a nineteenyearold Arab boy thrown into a French prison to serve a sixyear sentence. He is alone without any friends contacts or relatives. Inside the prison is an ongoing feud between the Corsican and the Arab prisoners. Malik cannot read or write but he is able to speak Arabic making him an asset to Csar Luciani Niels Arestrup a criminal who has the guards in his pocket and seemingly unlimited power in the prison. Csar wants to use Malik to infiltrate the Arab cellblock and kill someone. He offers him protection but also brutally threatens to kill him if he refuses or does not comply. Malik's attempts to escape his first assignment are futile because of the power the Corsican gangsters hold and ultimately his murder of the inmate becomes just one chapter in a lengthy career of organised crime.Last year director Jacques Audiard was awarded the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival for A Prophet and his film was also nominated for the Golden Palm as well. More recently the film was named Best Foreign Film at the BAFTA Awards certifying its contentions for Oscar glory too. There are enormous expectations when a film is surrounded by these sorts of accolades which makes it disappointing to say that this is film that one would like to love rather than having complete admiration for everything that it does. Regardless Audiard's film is still inspired by a number of qualities that immerse one into the callousness of gangsters and prison life. The film has been photographed for maximum authenticity and realism with the muted colours a reflection of the raw grittiness of the prison but also the isolation of Malik himself too. The attention to detail in each of the scenes from the containment of the tiny cells the graphic violence or even the way the guards thoroughly stripsearch prisoners represents gritty filmmaking at its most uncompromising.The films narrative commences in the most fascinating way demonstrating the unflinching power of the mob even in confinement. The tension that is developed from Malik's preparation of his first task is quite extraordinary. The vision of him holding a razor blade in his mouth and then spitting blood in a sink is filmed with such clarity and dread that it becomes mesmerising in its brutality. What climaxes at the end of this task is as suspenseful as it is disturbing. It is odd then that the rest of the film is muddy and fails to reach the heights of intensity of this previous scene. While there are some satisfying moments showing Malik growing in his stature the film becomes increasingly bogged down and confusing in its details about deals and doublecrosses and the business aspects of drug running. It is with this convoluted narrative a contrast to the early parts of the film that a lot of the power of A Prophet is diminished making it harder to care about what is going on.Aside from the confusing storytelling one of the most consistent aspects of the film is the very strong performance by Tahar Rahim as Malik. The decision to use a lesser known actor is a smart one because Rahim is able to build a completely assured reality about this character. His appearance convinces as much as his emotions. He has scars all over his back but one can also envision the internal trauma he suffers given the blood on his hands. He grieves prior to his assignment and then afterwards he is regularly plagued by the ghost of the man he murdered. He gradually grows in confidence over the years becoming a more efficient criminal but he is also frustrated by his feebleness at the hands of Csar. It is quite an accomplished performance for a relatively young actor. Csar is a thoroughly interesting character as well because while he is selfish brutal and intolerable to Malik there is also one part in the film where he shows a hint of vulnerability as he sits alone in his cell following the transfer of a number of his men. This is again another really strong performance by an actor who is not particularly recognisable allowing for a complete sense of immersion into the performance.A Prophet could be a film that improves on multiple viewings if one is able to obtain a greater understanding of the plot and the interplay between the gangs. On initial viewing some will feel they are completely out of the loop and others might be deterred by the infrequent but highly graphic violence and difficult subject matter. These issues aside though Audiard's film still possesses a gritty authentic visual style along with a complex and layered performance by Rahim who will in time become a powerful contributor to foreign cinema.".

	schema:headline " An example of how prison serves as an education for criminals";
	schema:reviewBody "In exchange I offer you protection If you don't kill him I'll kill you.  Jacques Audiard directs this great French prison film which is perhaps the best gangster movie I've seen since The Goodfellas. It has some great scenes combining violent action sequences with a character driven plot. Audiard has created a masterpiece the entire film takes place mostly in the prison and he worked with ex convicts in order to set the right mood. Un Prophete A Prophet was nominated for Best Foreign Film in the Oscars and lost to the Argentinean movie El Secreto de Sus Ojos which was also a great character driven film. Audiard not only directed the film but he also cowrote the adaptation of the script along with Thomas Bidegain. It is an interesting character study on how an innocent man gets involved with the wrong people and becomes entangled in a life of crime. There is something symbolic about his illiteracy as he learns how to read in prison and he also learns how the mob works by serving and getting involved with them therefore the prison became his school both in a positive and negative way. When I watched this movie I couldn't help but compare several scenes with such classic movies as Scarface The Godfather and The Goodfellas. This movie does have its flaws for instance women are depicted poorly as the few female characters are either prostitutes or weak minded but the story makes up for it along with the lead actors who give terrific performances.A nineteen year old FrancoArab named Malik El Djebena Tahar Rahim has just been sent to prison for six years in Brecourt for assaulting a police officer. He is alone in prison without any friends and has to learn how to survive. At first he tries to stay in the down low but solitary convicts are the easiest prey. The prisoners are divided in two groups the Muslims on the one hand and the Corsicans who seem to be in control of the prison because they have several connections with the guards on the other. Malik is an Arab but he doesn't practice their religion so he doesn't seem to fit with the Muslims and he isn't Corsican either. Cesar Luciani Niels Arestrup is the leader of the Corsicans inside the prison and after a new Arab prisoner arrives who happens to be a key witness against one of them Cesar has to find a way of killing him before the trial. The problem is that since he is an Arab he can't get to close to him and therefore realizes that Malik is the right person for the job. The Corsicans force Malik to kill him and offer protection in return although Malik doesn't really have an option because if he doesn't comply they will kill him. Malik despite being an Arab begins serving the Corsicans and little by little wins the confidence of Cesar although he is seen by the rest of the mobsters as a dirty Arab. Malik begins learning how to read and befriends his teacher Ryad Adel Bencherif and at the same time he begins learning Corsican and the mobster lifestyle. Little by little Malik begins to learn more about criminal life and slowly begins to rise. He is not the same person he was when he arrived at the prison.Un Prophete has a very interesting plot but it works in the most part because of the great performances given by the lead actors Tahir Rahim and Niels Arestrup who are just outstanding and very believable in their roles. The success of a character driven movie depends most of the time on the actors and newcomer Tahir Rahim gives an Oscar worthy performance. The movie is about two and a half hours long and requires your full attention because of the parallel action sequences but the movie doesn't seem to drag at any point and it never gets to a point where you begin to lose interest. Un Prophet is an excellent film and one you will enjoy. It is definitely worth your time so I recommend you check this movie out.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

I've seen of course Italian gangster movies Irish gangster movies Cuban and African American and Puerta Rican gangster movies but a Muslim gangster movie well how refreshing! The plot is thickened a little with just a touch of the supernatural prophesy of course to keep us interested for two and a half hours.

SCARFACE was somewhere a very moral film where the ending showed the audiences that crime never pays. In this movie that's just the contrary.

	schema:reviewBody "A very rewarding second viewing. On paper it's kind of a typical rise of a gangster story but when you get involved it's something entirely unique. Jacques Audiard is an immensely talented director and he creates an ambiance here that is chilling and intense all the way through. Few filmmakers can create action scenes that get a lump in your throat the way that he does here. Every time a knife or a gun comes on screen there's that feeling that anything can happen it's all so gritty and real. Even some of the most skilled directors can't manage to create something that feels so real in this current state of cinema where everything is so sensationalized and the most brutal violence has become commonplace. But it never feels like the stakes are low here and nothing feels run of the mill. From the first killing until that final shootout in the SUV every scene of violence had my blood pumping even on a second viewing.What's most impressive about the film though is the journey that Malik goes through. For a film that takes place primarily inside a prison the scope here is really epic. Spanning several years it takes us on Malik's journey from this scared uneducated thug with no friends into a bonafide crime lord with fleets at his back. It's a powerful tale there are so few films that have created such a transformation like this. Most powerful of all is the fact that you don't even realize the scope of that evolution of character until the very end. Audiard and Tahar Rahim in a breathtaking performance make this journey so authentic and genuine that you just coast on this path with him without even realizing how different he becomes by the end. When the final credits roll and you look back at the young man that we started the film with it's absolutely astonishing the evolution the character has gone through over the past two and a half hours. Audiard and Rahim create one of the finest character studies in one of the most impressive crime films of the past decade.".

	schema:reviewBody "Went to see this after the rave reviews. However it's actually not that great. In fact it's a very muddled film there's no sense of identification with the quiet cunning lead Malik. By the time he's released from prison at the end of the film he has a gang of henchman that follow him in a car and van at a respectable distance.What goes on in between is his rise to power playing off the Corsicans who he works for initially and the Arabs who are his kinsmen. It is definitely gritty and the scene that stands out most is him practising putting a razor blade in his mouth for one of the earlier scenes. The prison life is also 'grim grim' not 'clean grim' like The Shawshank Redemption!. It is also a crime film about the rise of a nobody through the ranks via his own ingenuity and networking.But so what? It's not as entertaining a crime film as many others. The actors aren't fleshed out memorably including the lead who broods a lot and talks little so who knows what he feels except for scenes when you see the first person he murdered haunt him again. It just isn't all that exciting after being told it was.One point that sums it up he is called a 'prophet' on his way to meet a drug dealer in a car when he shouts out to stop after seeing a warning sign by the roadside for deer. A deer then leaps out a second or two later and hits the car. That's it. No other explanation and one of the guys in the car nicknames him 'The Prophet'. It's not even alluded to again later on.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Prophet is a movie that really gives one a very dark and somewhat disturbing picture of prison life. Even if the story is pretty clearly fiction maybe something that doesn't make sense the settings and representation of the prison scenes feel very realistic. However does this make it a great film? I had heard how awesome it was that it had got several awards and praised by critics. Still I can't help but feel a bit disappointed.So the technical aspects are just brilliant. The feel one pretty soon gets is that this is not the usual prison movie experience. The scenes are so dirty and brutal to the level that one might get a unpleasant feel when seeing this picture of prison life. The violence is just as though bloody and brutal. Very impressive this is not a film for the weak.The sounds and music contribute well to create the right feel. Still the music is not that special on it's own I feel it's just the same over and over so afterwards I can't recall any of it.So the outside of the movie is just brilliant but still A Prophet doesn't grip hold of me like this kind of dramatic films should. The problem is that the story just feels far away from me as a viewer. Quite soon into the film it starts to get a bit hard to keep track of what is going on but it is not because it's flawed story telling sadly the reason is that the plot does just not grip my interest. Soon I'm just watching it with one eye. The acting is also very good Niels Arestrup was great. Though just like the plot I get no real relation to the characters which I guess should be blamed on the script. Some of the scenes where some character development is supposed to be done just feel kind of forced. When the ending comes I not much more than shrug the shoulders and consider it was a well made movie but nothing much more. This also brings me to the running time around 150 min which feel kind of long and even more so since I have a hard time keeping my interest up anyway.Maybe I'm alone in feeling A Prophet is somewhat overrated. It's technically brilliant and delivers a impressive experience. Still it lacks underneath in giving a interesting story and characters. It is a good film but it's not very good. 710".

He's drafted by a Corsican gang that practically runs the prison to kill a fellow Muslim inmate who plans to act as a witness as part of a plea bargain.

Mahim isn't educated but he's smart and he knows that to declare allegiance to either side is to limit his ultimate potential. Mahim gives an amazing unshowy performance it's largely because of him that the scene in which he carries out the hit is such a nail biter.One brief scene late in the film suggests that there might be a literal meaning to the film's title but overall the meaning is thematic  Malik becomes a prophet to his people but his story illustrates that not all messages carried to us from prophets are necessarily positive ones.Grade A".

Jacques Audiard's is not as technically inventive as Fernando Meirelle's movie but in its linear plot it also tells a brutal story about a man who has nothing else to hold on to other than a life of crime.Malik El Djebena is a young Arab man who arrives at a penitentiary without knowing anything about prison life without connections inside and without friends outside. In short prison is about to become a manual for life. And what he learns is how to kill people outguess inmates mediate between gangs set up his own drug business and other useful knowledge that will be useful in his future life of crime outside. Because in spite of his corruption Malik is an exemplary inmate protected by other inmates and with certain perks like having half a day outside prison to work in an honest job as part of his rehabilitation process.Outside prison he performs missions for the prison Kingpin a Corsican named Csar who's taken Malik under his wing after he killed a snitch for him. Csar like the other racist Corsicans who run the prison thinks Malik is just an ignorant Arab and yet as time goes by he becomes the only person the kingpin can trust. Entrusting him with secret knowledge about his operations Csar cannot see his impending downfall as Malik negotiates with his business partners.A Prophet portrays the world as a ruthless place without real friendship or love just business transactions fear useful alliances and the pretence of trust when it suits someone. It's a world where people have to be outsmarting each other all the time and it's a game at which Malik excels as he learns everything about everyone while keeping a low profile as a worthless dumb Arab. Finally it's a world where old debts aren't forgotten and where revenge is always at the back of one's mind.Tahar Rahim steals the show as the initially confused and fragile Malik who slowly becomes the ruthless hardened leader of a criminal organisation. Niels Arestrup plays the old Csar a top criminal who's slowly losing all the influence and power inside his prison without realising it. The two actors had an amazing chemistry and the viewer can't help wondering if there was any genuine trust or friendship between the two or if they simply used each other so complex and nuanced were their performances.A Prophet is an outstanding movie an example of the good cinema still made nowadays amidst all the mediocrity. It's intelligent brutal funny exciting and sad. In sum it's a complete and perfect cinematic experience.".

The two actors had an amazing chemistry and the viewer can't help wondering if there was any genuine trust or friendship between the two or if they simply used each other so complex and nuanced were their performances.A Prophet is an outstanding movie an example of the good cinema still made nowadays amidst all the mediocrity. It's intelligent brutal funny exciting and sad. In sum it's a complete and perfect cinematic experience.";

	schema:reviewBody "Un prophete released in the United Kingdom only this passed week is an epic crime drama told about a young Arab sent to prison who works fights and schemes his way to the top of the pecking order in a French prison. Expertly filmed by Jacques Audiard The Beat That My Heart Skipped it hallmarks a return to form for contemporary French cinema headed by a director who has carved himself quite the career with this being his magnum opus to date. Mesrine a French gangster film released in 2009 was a stylised tale of a mans descent into the criminal underworld but lacked a certain gravitas when needed to push itself into iconic status. Where Mesrine failed Un Prophete has excelled. The cinematography is a gritty affair told in faded greys and blues managing to highlight the drab and claustrophobic nature of incarceration. Jacques Audiard knows how to captivate his audience from the opening sequence of our protagonist Malik El Djebena being taken to jail peering out onto the world from behind the police vans bars to feeling surrounded by the prisons inmates he makes you feel as trapped as the one we are watching. The notable lack of primary colours while perhaps unoriginal is pivotal in hammering home the violence and its impact when it does start. Thankfully there aren't ridiculously over the top shootouts as there were in Mesrine which manages to maintain a sense of realism a sense of believability which in a film such as this the audience desperately needs to feel. Un prophete however is decidedly nonHollywood and will have many not used to European cinema claiming it to be a dull overlylong affair yet it is because of its more languid tendencies that it resonates more. None of the events in nor outside the prison would matter if Audiard did not develop the characters he has on screen sufficiently enough for us to connect with any of them on any emotional level. In The Beat That My Heart Skipped Romain Duris' performance carries what is a good yet occasionally uneven film so it comes as no surprise that the leading men in Un Prophete powerfully command the screen with their presences leaving the viewer in no doubt that Audiard has a gift as a director for bringing out an actors' full talent. Tahar Rahim Malik El Djebena and Niels Arestrup Cesar Luciani play their leading roles perfectly both carrying off the naivet and hauteur respectively required for their ying and yang roles.There are several themes running throughout Un Prophete the most obvious being a subtle social commentary on multiracial interaction in France. There is a keen sense of the director commenting on the strained relationships between the Caucasian French and their Arabic cohabitants deliberately remarking on the way the Arabic population are deliberately looked down upon as inferior beings. This is brought up on numerous occasions with the Corsicans open distaste for the Arabic inmates but Audiard shows their racial prejudice to be their downfall as the population swells and their faith becomes a binding force perhaps in itself a call to arms for French politicians to address what is a time bomb in their own country. Another theme is a keen sense of old replacing the new it terms of crime syndicate circles. Luciani is the Godfather of the Corsicans though is never called as such. His position and means of dictation hallmark Pacino's Godfather to a time of crime which in a contemporary setting seems outdated. This point is again made when Malik is asked to be the Godfather of his friend Reyeb's child yet the terminology is meant in its religious sense as opposed to the mafia one. Un Prophete is a stunningly good film full of crisp composed cinematography that moves at a good rate developing and fleshing out characters while being able to keep the story flowing. Audiard has his audience engrossed from the opening sequence and never lets go from Malik's induction into the Corsican camp through to the protagonist sense of bewilderment and awe on his first flight and visit to a beach that is almost childlike in its innocence. Unfortunately Un Prophete while making all the right critical noises will never have the same impact on the cinematic masses that films such as Avatar are having and is somewhat disheartening despite its Cannes Grand Prize de Jury. Purchasing a ticket for the screening I was warned the film was subtitled to which I replied do you have to warn us that it's not in 3D as well? which may have been a jokingly snide quip but is a sad indictment of the times. Nevertheless for those that get the opportunity to view this film you will not be disappointing as Un Prophete is a powerful production carrying some stellar performances from both cast and director. It is an engrossing crime drama that manages to be both brutal and shocking yet humane and heart warming that will convert even the most ardent disbeliever.".

After reading a positive review of MANOHLA DARGIS in the Times who's not often complementary and is not afraid of controversy I invested two and a half hours of my time and left disappointed. What Dargis praised is in the murder scene where main character notices fancy shoes in the vitrine while he should be preparing for the kill and his emergence after committing the murder as if being reborn being in a haze as if in the womb as a committed killer. This was indeed interesting solution but what about other 2 hours and 20 minutes? The film feels like an average student's work.There is an element of 'strangeness' in the film because of twice removed languageculture in the framework of French state and language we see FrenchArabs and FrenchCorsicans with Italian flavor and also some FrenchAfricans. This is unusual for average American viewer however overwhelming majority of action is taking place in the prison all you see is concrete of the cells and the shower room.Characters and action are very poorly developed. Malik's motivation is not clear. He does not seem at first to be a killer then succumbs to the pressure kills his fellow Arab then becomes good at scheming and moves into a leadership position. Interestingly the apparition of his fellow Arab he kills appears to him in the guise of a spiritual adviser and Koran teacher. As a result Malik emerges as a positive character finally becoming Arab again this is after all his betrayals and the wife of his deceased friend seems to offer herself and her child to him. The implication perhaps that Malik who was an animal now has connection with the child...? I give up.In summary the story line is a kind of lunacy amateurish and embarrassing.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Marquis de Sade's 'Justine'' 1968 is easily Jess Franco's most accomplished film esp. from a technical standpoint backed by the biggest budget he would ever have.  Rich brilliant colors skin aplenty a few perversities and strange performances from Klaus Kinski Jack Palance and Mercedes Mccambridge make for an entertaining but relatively tame Franco outing.  To boot Jack Palance's performance ranks as possibly the most bizarre ever seen on film.  The dvd includes a revealing 20minute 'making of' documentary featuring an extensive contemporary interview with director Franco and he doesn't hold back.  Franco states that Palance was sauced during the entire shoot drinking red wine all day each day starting around 7a.m.Kinski's role as de Sade was originally handed to Orson Welles but once Welles read the script he claimed that he simply could not play the part because it included scenes of erotica.  In reality Welles would have had to do a scene with several totally naked women and this may have made him uncomfortable and nervous.  Interestingly the de Sade character has no lines and Kinski's scenes are just a bunch of cutaways of him sittingpacing in a prison cell mentally tortured trying to write 'Justine'.Franco intended to create an explicitly nasty masochistic film faithful to de Sade's writing however according to Franco he was forced into a watereddown SnowWhitelostinthewoods' direction because of the producer's decision to cast Tyrone Power's daughter Romina Power in the title role.  She was a passenger wandering around' Franco scoffed. She was like a piece of furniture.  It was as if I was making Bambi 2'.  The role was intended for Rosemary Dexter who appears in the film in a lesser role.Franco's version of 'Justine' is not as grim or as depressing as Chris Boger's 'Cruel Passion' 1977 starring Koo Stark but it's also not as nasty or as perverse.  Too bad for Franco fans.     david ross smith".

They should have shown this at the Academy Awards the year after Palance won for City Slickers and the whole place would have fell down laughing.

	schema:reviewBody "Marquis De Sade Justine is a long way from being unwatchable as there are a number of things that are good. It is however a very strange film and not a very easy one to rate.Starting with what is good about Marquis De Sade Justine coming off best is the music score which is outstanding if on occasions overpowering very stirring and rich in sound and it fits the film very well. The film also looks good the sets are simply gorgeous the plentiful costumes are certainly attractive and a lot of care was clearly put into the cinematography which is beautiful. The crowd scenes are tense and rousing and while he sometimes overdoes with the fading in and out Jesse Franco does give some of his most competent directing ever though it does feel very different for him. While I was not very impressed with the acting generally the charming Maria Rohm makes the most out of her brief role and Mercedes Mccambridge is an absolute hoot.Romina Power is very wooden in the lead role on the other hand while Klaus Kinski is criminally underused and pretty much wasted spending his entire screen looking remote and Jack Palance is embarrassingly overthetop and out of place. I like Palance but not here he's not as bad as he was in Che! and Outlaw of Gor but this is one of his worst performances. While the film is undeniably fun there are too many times where the story is episodically disjointed and lethargically paced sometimes not as cohesive as it could be. It also feels very tame and toned down by today's standards and not sleazy or sensual enough the story is one where those qualities are necessary and it just felt bland and agreed too correct. The ending is very heavyhanded when you can actually hear the dialogue when it's not being drowned out the stilted way it's written and uninvolved line delivery from most makes it not really worth listening to.In conclusion not unwatchable but very strange and not easy to make of. 510 Bethany Cox".

I really wasn't expecting much going into this it IS Jess Franco after all... so I can't say I was that disappointed. I was expecting a pretty average sleaze film and that's what I got...Justine and her sister are banished from a private school when their father dies and leaves them no money for tuition. The one sister goes to a whorehouse to work Justine decides that ain't her thing. The rest of the film is pretty much comprised of Justine being subjected to different forms of exploitation that would have been way worse than what she would have experienced in the whorehouse...Nothing really notable about JUSTINE other than the beautiful women that show far too little skin. Don't get me wrong  there is nudity in the film  even some brief fullfrontal  but it's never long enough or in the right situation to be arousing or memorable. The acting is decent  the sets and costumes are very well done and the story is relatively entertaining  but it tends to drag. It actually took me three viewings to watch it all the way through because I kept falling asleep though I partially blame that on the bourbon.... Not a horrible film worth a look to exploit fans just don't expect too much...610".

The vicious writings of Marquis de Sade brought to the screen by no less a person then the Godfather of sleaze Jess Franco! And starring the fabulously outrageous Klaus Kinski as the Marquis. And there are several other aspects about this film that indicate that you're about to see a triumph in the euroexploitation field. Like the rather big budget. Franco normally makes the most out of small budgets but here he actually had the chance to work with decent set pieces costumes and actors. The cast is more than decent with Jack Palance Howard Vernon Franco regular and the ravishing Maria Rohm and Romina Power. This latter one plays the title role and  as well as the entire film  disappoints. The movie is a series of unspectacular events and I never saw Franco this tame! Marquis de Sade Justine is low on violence low on nudity and extremely low surprises. Kinski is dreadfully underused and the whole thing is just too correct! Which is NOT Franco's trademark Of course it's very stylish and guided by brilliant music. The sets are gorgeous and the two leading ladies remain a joy to stare preferably when they keep their mouths shut. This certainly isn't Franco's finest film but I'll still prefer it over 99 of the amateurish crap that is brought out nowadays. Franco rules but he had a bad day here!".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this last week my sixth Jess Franco movie. After the relative disappointment with EUGENIE DE SADE 1970 I had hoped that the next Franco would relight my initial admiration for his work. In this respect I was not a little wary of trying JUSTINE as its reception on the Internet since its DVD release has not been exactly positive! But since it was the only thing available at the moment Well I wasn't wrong about my reservations regarding this film as I must say that I found it truly abysmal! Not so much a waste of time as a wasted opportunity as Rod Barnett had said in the recent FEMALE VAMPIRE 1973 a film I haven't watched yet by the way thread I think that Franco fails even here to bring out the full potential of the definitely intriguing plot  despite having the biggest budget of his entire career to work with!Still what I find most disconcerting about the film is the ongoing parade of embarrassing performances from some interesting i.e. formerly respectable actors Akim Tamiroff Mercedes McCambridge and worst of all Jack Palance. The other notables from the cast  Klaus Kinski Sylva Koscina and Howard Vernon  acquit themselves far better also because they were already practiced at this sort of thing. McCambridge's raspy voice is given a thorough workout here as though she were already attempting to 'find' the demon voice for THE EXORCIST 1973! Palance on the other hand gives new meaning to the expression 'chewing up the scenery'  the fact that he was drunk all through the shooting of the picture could hardly bode well for some form of coherence in his performance  and while I couldn't help or indeed stop laughing when he was on screen deep down I felt really sorry for him as he clearly did not belong there!!Despite his brief and silent appearance Klaus Kinksi makes for an appropriately moody Marquis De Sade who grows increasingly paranoid as the story he is writing unfolds on the screen actually this linking sequence is quite atmospheric one online review even compares it to the Gothic horror films of Mario Bava and I can certainly see where he is coming from with such an argument. Maria Rohm again proves to be an asset to the film though she isn't nearly as effective here as she was in EUGENIETHE STORY OF HER JOURNEY INTO PERVERSION 1969 a clearly intelligent woman who possesses both great charisma and genuine sex appeal. Perhaps the film's best sequence is her heartless drowning of the Rosemary Dexter character formerly her mentor and lover needless to say the fact that both women go through the scene stark naked made it all the more memorable!.As for Romina Power this may come as a surprise to you but I didn't think she was as bad as most online reviews would have it. Of course apart from her constant innocent demeanor she never really captures Justine's essential personality especially her gradual acceptance of masochism. However you may remember that in my review of EUGENIE I had similar reservations about Marie Liljedahl  though to be fair to her she certainly came off as less 'wooden' then again most of the performances in JUSTINE are terrible anyway so it really doesn't matter! Perhaps for someone like Francesco and me we are more responsive to her 'acting' because we are used to watching her on Italian TV  whereas the rest of you will probably have to make do with this single admittedly unimpressive performance! Still echoing another review I read of the film I'm not sure that Rosemary Dexter apparently Franco's personal choice could have done much better with the title role though one cannot really judge her talent from the thankless role she was relegated to playing!Useless bit of trivia Romina Power regularly comes to Malta on holiday  perhaps the world's largest collection of her father Tyrone's ephemera resides in our country believe it or not!  and it is said that she often takes a villa at Naxxar to live in Naxxar of course is the village in Malta where I live!For me the best thing about the entire film is Bruno Nicolai's masterful score which is perhaps wasted here! At the very least however one could say that JUSTINE is good to look at and that it is packed with incident so it does not really feel slow like EUGENIE for instance throughout its lengthy durationif only what was on screen were more genuinely compelling!As of now I stand about 5050 on Franco from the very few titles that I have sampled and in all honesty I'm beginning to despair of ever finding another film to equal EUGENIE or THE DIABOLICAL DOCTOR Z 1965. Still I have high hopes for SUCCUBUS 1967  which will be my next venture into Franco's endless canon  as well as VENUS IN FURS 1968 and LORNA THE EXORCIST 1974 though I'll only be able to watch the last two if the local censors deign to release them from their clutches!".

According to Franco on the short interview included on the DVD Romina Power was basically forced on him to be the star and he does not hide his disgust at her performance in the interview.

If you're looking for nudity you will find it here but you quickly won't care. If you're interested in the Marquis de Sade you won't learn anything about him by watching this. If you're on Death Row with two hours left then this truly is the film for you but all others should really steer clear.Klaus Kinski was listed as the star of the film in Europe and yet he speaks no lines and interacts with none of the other characters in the film. The first few minutes of the film around 10 minutes but it seemed like 30 show Kinski as the Marquis. He appears to be swimming in a sea of writing compulsions and drifting beyond the bounds of reality or he's simply in dire need of a strong laxative. Either way his segments are interspersed throughout the film and they add absolutely nothing.Jack Palance is wildly flamboyant but it's hard to tell what the heck is going on with him anyway. In one particularly bizarre sequence he's gliding around on some sort of a wheeled dolly like a wax statue. According to Franco Palance was always drunk but he was pleased with his performance as Antonin. It's not erotic. It's not sensual. It's not alluring. My wife and I watched it anticipating something like The Story of O but ended up with The Story of O No. Definitely NOT recommended.".

Their father is sent to exile and they are each left a small amount of money to take care of themselves and are asked to leave the convent in which they had lived.  The bad sister tries to pursuade the other good sister to live with her in a whore house with her but the good sister would have nothing of that and she dicides to go off on her own away from her bad sister.  Like an Alice in Wonderland adventure the good sister goes from place to place in search for a place to live and at each doorstep awaits unspeakable tourture and mayhem.  Jack Palance plays a rather strange character as a leader of a sadistic cult that takes pleasure in watching and performing rituals of torture.  His performance was short in this film and I wish that it could have been a longer role not because he was good in it because he lacked in character  but because it could have made more sense with him in it.  Klaus Kinski who also has a short lived role in this movie as the Marquie De Sade is exiled in prison and does nothing but sit at a table and writes the whole story about the two sisters and their adventures. His role makes no sense as he just gets tired of writing all those pages and calapses.  The bad sister ends up getting hooked up with a rich Aristocrate and later finds her poor sister in a carnival in the midst of public humilitation after being branded a murderess by another person she seeked at one time in need for asylum.  The bad sister listens to her poor sisters story and takes care of her in the end.  There is a moral to this tale  You may endure many hardships but in the end you'll find the treasures you are given in the end.".

Erotic  NO Female nudity  Technically yes about 1 minute in total Sex  NO For practical purposes this was NOT based on the novel by the Marquis de Sade in fact in the interview the writer admits he rewrote the story to accommodate Tyrone Power's daughter who could not act. So there is no Black Mass or anything of the original book except the two sisters originally being taught by nuns in a convent. This was a shear waste of money on the part of Franco that could have been his masterpiece with the expensive sets and costumes that were absolutely splendid. Jack Palance was totally miscast even if he were sober it would have made little difference. The same was true with Klaus Kinski because his performance was too remote and did not narrate the story all the way through. Franco said he asked Orson Wells to play the part of the Marquis de Sade again totally wrong if you are going to make a porno movie. I have no idea what he was thinking. The story was so confused that it failed to make real sense because it deviated from the original novel so much. This movie was not a porno or anything else it was just a big nothing.".

His films in the 60s were Hitchokian thrillers and a few good erotic ones however by the 80s he had plummeted into making porn films fairly crappy at best compared to Joe D'Amatos Caribbean series. These films consisted of Lina Romay masturbating to sex acts purely vulgar Laura Gemser fair enough but her no way.Anyhow in the late 60s Franco worked with Harry Allan Towers and made about 8 damn good films such as The Bloody Judge 99 women less good and Venus in Furs.However Justine to me his nemesis is a good film. It boasts an all star cast such as Jack Palace who gives a good performance as a decadant monk and Klaus Kinski as De Sade just prancing around his cell being taunted by nude phantoms actually shot using good green lighting and shadow imagery.The film is not do depraved several nude scenes some mild sex scenes and some cat fighting but nothing too bad. Also the buildings soldiers and extras were fairly epic and in good standard with any epic historical film.The sets were brilliant hence they were all historical the film is well shot cue some blurs etc well lighted well cast and well made.Franco is a decent director here when he worked with Towers however in the 70s he declined sadly. When he worked with good budgets and actors he was a Ruggero Deodato but alas he failed cinema which he claimed to love...A good film give it a try! you will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scenes are like a parody. Klaus Kinski imprisoned dreams of shackled naked girls in a flurry of outoffocus zoomins courtesy of Director Jess Franco with a thumping grandiloquent musical score that quite defies the fact that nothing of any merit is actually happening. It is as if Bruno Nicolai's soundtrack has swept in from some spectacular epic to accompany these scenes a towering presence Kinski undoubtedly was but even he doesn't merit such extravagance when he is in effect doing nothing.Adding the usual spice to the cast are Franco friends Maria Rohm Howard Vernon and a seemingly inebriated Jack Palance. The performances here are larger than life and such a style befits this a huge expensive looking ribald romp full of exotic characters and costumes and locations where everyone we meet could conservatively be described as 'heightened'  except perhaps understandably for Romina Power daughter of Tyrone who gives a very grounded performance as Justine. Rather unkindly Jess Franco has made it clear her casting was forced on him and that he would have chosen someone else. Charisma she may lack compared to the extravagance of those around her but for the sake of contrast if nothing else her performance just about works. Most of the time Power didn't even know we were shooting Franco is quoted as saying.As for Kinski's appearances they are silent and they do not integrate with anyone else. The possibilities between the eccentricities of Kinski and Franco were never fully realised it seems to me. The closest we have come to realising the meeting of these two greats comes together in 1976's 'Jack the Ripper' but despite how enjoyable that film was one would have hoped for a less restrained teamup.'Justine' film has been heavily censored for some releases not for reasons of graphic nudity or gore at least I don't think so  it is very tame on that score but probably because the 124 minute version I have seen is way way too long to justify the character of Justine falling into one mishap after another which is the storyline in a nutshell.My favourite Franco take on this idea is 'Marquis de Sade's Philosophy in the Boudoir' 1970 which seems much more lowbudget but condenses the tale more successfully.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is yet another of the various exploitation flicks based on De Sade's Justine the best of which are credited to the prolific Jess Franco. This one is an English production starring Koo Stark onetime girlfriend of Prince Andrew.Set sometime in 18th Century England two sisters 16yearold Justine and 17yearold Juliette are expelled from their convent school after they are orphaned and can no longer afford the fees. Juliette comes up with the brilliant idea of going to the London whorehouse where their cousin works and learning the tricks of the trade regardless of the fact they are both still virgins.At the whorehouse the older and more worldly Juliette gets on fine and embraces the brothel lifestyle while the nave  innocent Justine can't handle it and runs away back to the convent into Pastor John's welcoming arms. Although after the good Pastor has had a few wines he can no longer contain his lecherous urges and attempts to rape poor pure Justine. Luckily she escapes with her virginity intact but Pastor John ends up dead and she is now wanted for murder.Whilst escaping through the church graveyard she encounters a gang of graverobbers who kidnap her and force her into their way of life  she becomes their bait for luring stagecoaches to a halt so the thieves can rob  murder the occupants. Meanwhile Juliette has become concerned by the absence of her sister and sends her heroic aristocrat boyfriend Lord Carlisle Martin Potter of Fellini's Satyricon fame out to search for her.Lord Carlisle eventually catches up with the thieves as they use their ploy to rob his stagecoach and murder all the occupants only sparing him after Justine's pleading. The two soon escape only to be hunted down by dogs and brutally slaughtered and in Justine's case gangraped.Compared to De Sade's original story and indeed even Jess Franco's adaptations Justine is pretty tame there's the odd splatter of blood infrequent nudity and even some nongraphic rape  necrophilia but overall  even with those acts included  there's still not much for exploitation aficionados to get excited about. The film focuses more on Justine's plight and the eventual tarnishing of her innocence.Strangely enough this film is included as part of Redemption's Nunsploitation box set but it's only really the first twenty to thirty minutes that are set in the convent  the rest is either in the countryside or the brothel  although aside from the downbeat ending and Justine's surreal catholic guilt nightmare sequences the convent scenes are the best  sleaziest parts of the film with the usual forced lesbianism and debauched Mother Superior.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a fan of director Jess Franco..but I am not a fan of this really awful film adaptation of the Marquis De Sade. The large budget was wasted and because of it otherwise creative director Jess Franco's hands were obviously tied making a film by other people's rules. first off the actress Rowina Powers delivered the most appalling rotgut performance I have EVER seen in ANY film ever. Franco said in an interview that Powers was like a piece of furniture and was forced upon him by the film's bankroller the father of this bimbo. When the director hates his own main actress you can't really expect a great product. A product that looks like a Benny Hill episode with all it's silly comedy. It does have it's moments and some nice sets. But the ending is wretched featuring not only a hammy embarrassing performance by Jack Palance who appeared drunk in every scene. but the final insult comes at the absolute castration of Sade's work. Removing the grim ending and replacing it with a happy ending where all the sinners congratulate Justine for being pure and virtuous and inform her that she is a better person for not giving into temptation?!? This is the exact polar opposite of Sade's philosophy. If he could see this rubbish he would surely despise it. I think the problem was that the budget was too big and therefore the story had to be sterilized and commercialized for mainstream consumption. Again something that it's author was anything but. Even though the story takes place during Victorian times the women all sport 60's hair and makeup and everything is played for laughs. And Klaus Kinski would have been excellent as the Marquis but every time he was on screen he was overpowered by the loudest most invasive musical score you could imagine. you will want to turn down the volume on your TV when he is on screen it is that irritating. For those interested in seeing a decent film version of Justine check out the 1977 adaptation. t preserves the mood and philosophy of Sade and features appropriate sets costumes and music. And it succeeds at being Gothic in tone instead of candy colored fluff it's no masterpiece but it is compared to this mess.".

Well one aspect careening out of control was definitely the compromise that comes with any international production the phenomenon disrespectfully if often accurately described as Europudding  another reason seems more endemic to Franco and similar cinastes whose bark is much worse than their bite screaming at the top of their lungs how they would be able to realize their potential if only ignorant money men would wise up and bankroll their pet project.

This only serves to make poor Romina Power daughter of Hollywood heartthrob Tyrone and a subsequent pop sensation with husband Al Bano in '80s Italy look ridiculously naive to the point of certifiable brain damage perhaps a deliberate move on the director's part as she was imposed by the producer as an eleventh hour replacement for his own choice of Rosemary Dexter now relegated to supporting duty playing Juliette's sister in slime Claudine.

Juliette becomes a prostitute but Justine doesn't want to be a part of it and leaves and thus the movie is basically about her turbulent and tumultuous life of running from the law and living the life of a poor girl on her own. Not very scary really. In fact the scenes where she is locked up in the sanctuary are quite bland themselves but are the only things resembling horror. But soon she escapes there and let me tell you this movie drags on and on and just when you think it's over...nope. Still going. Eventually it ends with quite a nice ending though but by then I was so lost in boredom and hate for this movie that I couldn't care. Avoid this movie at all costs.

And i did it not because i wanted something completely different but because i i was looking for some similarly different approach to film. Make no mistakes. Malick's film changed my life this is just deliberate and utter trash. But here and there we have directors filming what they want away from conventions. Both rely heavily on intuition in Malick's case supported by a heavy baggage of study and reflexion in Franco's case supported only by the pure pleasure of filming or else filming as a living attitude.Trash films are great because for a few moments we step outside any convention whatsoever. Sex is a given fact in most of these films it's called exploitation because we are supposed to be exploring bodies and sex as voyeurs. I would argue that i don't know where that differs from most of our mainstream these days and for a while now but that's a different talk. Anyway what we do have a certain guarantee that within the production constraints we'll see what some guy or a reduced number of people wanted to do. That's reassuring.Here we have probably the highest budget of any Franco film probably that in which he was more constrained at least in therms of casting. The result is not so visceral not so crazily hallucinating as some bits of others films can be but there are some rewarding featuresselfreflective filmmaking Kinski's character writes the story of both sisters as we go along. So we have a filmmaker making a film about a writer an imprisoned one who invents 2 parallel narratives about 2 helpless sisters who are supposed to mirror 2 distinct postures one is malicious the other learns to take pleasure out of humiliation. Justine is the one we follow the mostin her path along humiliation intrigue and all kinds of sexual covet by all kinds of people Justine walks around a number of sets. Some are forgettable mere trees in incompetently filmed bushes. Some are just ordinary some are well chosen places in Barcelona S.Felipe Neri square is the most seductive of them and some are Gaud. This is interesting because the cinematographers maybe Franco himself cared about these sets. Generally speaking the photography in this film is quite good for what we are used to in these films. In Gaud's places there is the intention to film space notice the highly denounced use of wide angle lenses in some places to the point of distorting the limits and focus of the image and in the parks' scenes to film the promenade along the several arches. Sex and space that's a fun and rewarding idea. But Romina Power doesn't have a clue and all falls to a walk in the park utterly unrewarding in its biggest promise.

	schema:reviewBody "Sisters raised in a convent Justine naive  virtuous innocent and Juliette wholeheartedly prepared for any wiles of carnal desire the world has to offer are sent out after the loss of their parents and finances run out. While Juliette dives in head first without a second thought into a wicked world embracing it to the fullest Justine is almost like a rabbit tossed into a den of lions. Her trust in people leads to being taken advantage of penniless destitute on the run for crimes she didn't commit and facing perilous situations towards her life and virginity seemingly always able just to escape by the skin of her teeth through fate and happenstance. Meanwhile Juliette commits the very atrocities Justine is accused of and rises through society living lavishly but never emotionally fulfilled. All the while the film returns to the Marquis De Sade..the always powerful Klaus Kinski showing a very tormented man seething with agony like an imprisoned zoo animal longing to escape his misfortune behind a jail cell alone and haunted by his muses the very creations of Justine and Juliette as their story unfolds.Essentially a series of misadventures as Justine seeks shelter from a world that wants to devour her..nearly every possible sanctuary from harm seems to hold someone..or multiple someoneswith sinister intent. Just when you think Justine might've finally escaped the evils of the world around her someone hostile spoils her happiness. While one is branded a thief and murderous who is not guilty of the crimes against her the other does commits these deeds and reaps the benefits substantially..perhaps the Marquis sees the world through a different pair of eyes as in his story those who take to committing wicked and carnal acts are rewarded while virtue and innocence leads to mistreatment and cruelty. Or in order to survive in such a harsh and barbarous environment one must succeed and triumph by being ever more treacherous sadistic and savage...obviously the examples of Madame DusboisMercedes McCambridge living it up in her role as one of those devouring lions who poses a major threat to Justine even after the poor girl helps her escape prison and a certain hanging for a list of deeds committed against mankindand Juliette work in this line of reasoning's favor. Yet by the end Justine is justified for hanging tough and enduring each and every hardship faced along life's way. Juliette sees that the lifestyle she has lived leaves her an empty void yet unfilled despite being where she is and Justine having found love through a kind handsome artist has come full circle understanding the world for what it is.I think the story of these two sisters is perfect material for a director like Jess Franco who operates without restraint working with more of a budget. While I believe many will find the film frustrating as Franco uses zoom and often toys with focus..although I think it works to great advantage in the opening as we see De Sade moving throughout his jail cell while the characters of Justine and Juliette take shape in his mind while also presenting themselves in person I think this is one of his best films using the locations at his disposal to full effect actually having the ability to establish time and place thanks to period costumes and lavish sets. I think many will find his cast rather average to hammy. I relished McCambridge and LOVED how Franco introduces her. The camera moves with her in frame as Dubois exposes the joy of being who she is..through McCambridge we can see that she basks in the lifestyle she has led up until this point not expecting to die. I thought Dubois was one of the most entertaining characters in the film far more lively and ferocious than Romina Power as Justine whose performance never dramatically cuts the mustard..it almost appears as if she's about to crack a smile even as her character faces dangerous situations remaining freshfaced and bubbly like a school girl. Franco mentions in an interview that he wanted Rosemary Dexterwho plays Juliette's murdering cohort and loverfor the role of Justine who could display the pleasures that were starting to form through the agonies occurring to her. I think one can see in her opening scene in the Paris brothel that this would've been more ideal casting..just the way she lies in a room presents something unique and interesting. Maria Rohm fits her seductive role as Juliette this type of casting works because she has the type of look the character needs. I did think Romina Power had this precocious childlike spirit that Franco elicits for the character of Justine and she certainly is a gorgeous creature young with a postcard beauty which photographs well but there's not an iota of depth. Franco admits that he often even shot Power's scenes as Justine when she had no idea they were for the movie! Fans of Jack Palance will revel in his deranged portrayal of a minister who operates a sect of monks who use females left behind by the world as examples of their doctrines of pleasure through pain..often almost a drunken buffoon spouting gibberish as if he were on the verge of a nervous breakdown this might also leave some who have seen Palance elsewhere burying their heads in their laps in embarrassment. I'm not sure if this is the user comment to read because I thoroughly enjoyed the film despite it's various weaknesses. Sure I agree that Franco doesn't tap into the beast as he could..because it's certain that there's room for some serious exploitation and brutality that goes unfurled but I found this film stylistically inspired specifically his use of color camerawork and setting. I do wonder what the film could've been if Franco had been able to use his choice for Justine.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sisters raised in a convent Justine naive  virtuous innocent and Juliette wholeheartedly prepared for any wiles of carnal desire the world has to offer are sent out after the loss of their parents and finances run out. While Juliette dives in head first without a second thought into a wicked world embracing it to the fullest Justine is almost like a rabbit tossed into a den of lions. Her trust in people leads to being taken advantage of penniless destitute on the run for crimes she didn't commit and facing perilous situations towards her life and virginity seemingly always able just to escape by the skin of her teeth through fate and happenstance. Meanwhile Juliette commits the very atrocities Justine is accused of and rises through society living lavishly but never emotionally fulfilled. All the while the film returns to the Marquis De Sade..the always powerful Klaus Kinski showing a very tormented man seething with agony like an imprisoned zoo animal longing to escape his misfortune behind a jail cell alone and haunted by his muses the very creations of Justine and Juliette as their story unfolds.Essentially a series of misadventures as Justine seeks shelter from a world that wants to devour her..nearly every possible sanctuary from harm seems to hold someone..or multiple someoneswith sinister intent. Just when you think Justine might've finally escaped the evils of the world around her someone hostile spoils her happiness. While one is branded a thief and murderous who is not guilty of the crimes against her the other does commits these deeds and reaps the benefits substantially..perhaps the Marquis sees the world through a different pair of eyes as in his story those who take to committing wicked and carnal acts are rewarded while virtue and innocence leads to mistreatment and cruelty. Or in order to survive in such a harsh and barbarous environment one must succeed and triumph by being ever more treacherous sadistic and savage...obviously the examples of Madame DusboisMercedes McCambridge living it up in her role as one of those devouring lions who poses a major threat to Justine even after the poor girl helps her escape prison and a certain hanging for a list of deeds committed against mankindand Juliette work in this line of reasoning's favor.

Before they marry the second guy meets the first guy who all of a sudden is no longer invalid and as expected they become friends. That's when we get a very typical love triangle and some annoyingly melodramatic proceedings more tears than real emotion. The climax and the ending are predictable to the core and in many instances throughout the film the dialogues are quite cheap Oh my love for her made me a normal person again.But the film is not that bad after all and has good points too. It flows well the music is beautiful and the film is welllocated. Sridevi is the main highlight of the film with her natural acting trademark saris and well danced song numbers. One particular instrumental dance number to which she dances in the fields is astonishing and she looks so smashing hot! The film is considered to be a classic today and I do understand why. This clearly is not because the film is exceptionally good but the fact that it brought a huge welcome change to commercial Hindi cinema after several years of mindless and violent action films. The film reintroduced romantic musicals which were endearing and visually beautiful and were somehow lost and assimilated in the 1980s. It's great that the one who reintroduced them is Yash Chopra the one who actually makes them best.".

	schema:headline " Chandni Birth of the Modern Romantic Archetype";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever the current crop of actresses is asked to list their dream roles Chandni is almost always included at or near the top of the list. And yet when one considers the possibility of the role being performed by any but Sridevi one cannot help but feel that she is the only one who could ever play the part with as much grace humor elegance and restraint. Sridevi is Chandni just as Dilip Kumar is Devdas Amitabh Bachchan is Don and Rekha is Umrao Jaan. These performances are so completely intertwined with the actors who embody the characters that it becomes all but impossible to imagine anyone else in the part. Because of this Chandni has become a romantic archetype one that would inspire the generation of romantic heroines who were to follow it will be obvious to anyone who has seen Juhi Chawla in Darr Madhuri Dixit in Dil To Pagal Hai Kajol in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge or even Preity Zinta in Veer Zaara that these characters are derived from the Chandni mold. It is interesting therefore to consider that in the career of a woman who has nearly always played largerthanlife characters she achieves one of her great successes in playing an average middleclass girl one who is not afflicted with any of the great dilemmas that burden her other characters like ravaging insanity Khudah Gawah diabolical egomania Laadla or matrimonial selfdestruction Judaai. Chandni is a typical Punjabi girl carefree and funloving who falls for Rohit Rishi Kapoor an upper class heir who defies his conservative family and marries the girl of his choice. All seems relatively pleasant until Rohit is paralyzed in a helicopter accident. This strains the relationship and Rohit declares that his love for Chandni has died. Thus the marriage is ended and Chandni is left to live the life of a single working class woman. Thrown for the first time into the whirlwind of economic independence she stumbles as she tries to relieve the tragedies of her past with the responsibility of the present. Eventually she catches the fancy of her boss Lalit Vinod Khanna whose advances she rejects until Rohit reenters her life. The structure of the plot is not unlike other love triangles where Chandni was different and magnificently so was in the way it presented this 'every woman' childlike but wise suffering but sexual this was a major multidimensional screen creation and Sridevi infused her with her own brand of quiet dignity raucous silliness and pert sexuality. Yash Chopra originally offered the role to Rekha who had played a woman named Chandni in Silisila nearly a decade earlier but she did not want to go back and play a character she thought she had already done. So she recommended Sridevi for the part. If the film proved one thing it was that even in the everywoman guise Sridevi cut a largerthanlife figure. She was not a Hema Malini or a Madhuri or even a Rekha. She inhabited the 'normal' woman in such an abnormal way that at once we knew that though she was real she would remain untouchable. 'Chandni' is a modern day icon to film actresses proving that one need not sacrifice novelty for the sake of normalcy. The film boasts of incredible chemistry between Sridevi and Rishi Kapoor especially in the first twenty minutes when Rohit romances Chandni revealing her inherent vivacity that later becomes tempered when Life interrupts her hitherto ideal love story. Chandni is also important in that it was during the shooting of the film that Yash Chopra also came to realize that he had at last discovered the actress who would make possible the realization of a film he had been planning to make for nearly two decades but had shelved the film because the theme was deemed too controversial. The film was Lamhe.".

	schema:headline " A tribute to Yash Chopra the Kind of Romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Yash Chopra passed away. The 80 years old moviemaking maestro whose last directorial venture  Jab Tak Hai Jaan is going to hit the screen shortly has left for his heavenly abode without seeing its release and public response. As my tribute to the great director who is better known as the King of Romance in the Indian cinecircles I am reviewing a superhit movie directed by him. It's Chaandni 1989.Chaandni is the story of a jovial but downtoearth girl who respects the elders and believes in the Indian social and family values. She is as the title is  Chaandni Sridevi who is a simple middle class girl living in Delhi and happens to come across a rich boy Rohit Rishi Kapoor. Love blossoms between them and despite his family members looking upon Chaandni in a derogatory way Rohit decides to unite with her. However destiny has other plans. Rohit meets with an accident and thereafter life is not the same either for himself or for the love of his life i.e. Chaandni. Adjusting with the completely negative attitude of Rohit's family members on one hand and now handicapped Rohit's depressive mindset on the other one day Chaandni gets fed up and gets out of Rohit's life as well as the city.Now in a different city Chaandni happens to get a job in a company whose boss Lalit Vinod Khanna is a widower. Lalit falls for Chaandni's charms and his mother Waheeda Rehman is also too happy to see this simple heartconquering girl as her wouldbe daughterinlaw. The thing that they are not aware of is that Chaandni's heart is not hers now. It's Rohit's. And a typical Indian girl cannot love again so easily and so soon. The memories of the first love are still fresh and she lives with them. However she gets ready to marry Lalit as a compromise with her life and not out of love for him. Here comes another twist in this lovetriangle.Rohit's friendcumrelative Ramesh Anupam Kher elevates his spirits and propels him to come out of his depressive shell. Once Rohit starts seeing the status of the things in a different way he gets ready for his proper medical treatment and after fully recovering to search his lost love i.e. Chaandni. While being abroad for different reasons Lalit and Rohit cross paths and become good friends. Now both have a sweetheart individually but don't know that it's the same girl. Rohit comes to attend the engagement ceremony of Lalit and stunned to find that Lalit's betrothed is Chaandni only. And Chaandni ? She is at a crossroad now. Whom to choose ? But destiny and heart work in tandem and allow the story to conclude in the desired way.Yash Chopra possessed the rare knack of portraying malefemale romance on the screen in the most realistic manner. We know that real life is quite different from reel life. However Yash Chopra was always able to make the audience believe that what's on the reel was close to the real. While watching the movie we love the lovers we love their inner feelings and external romance and we love their union in the end. At the same time we are also sympathetic towards the loser in love because the King of Romance has made us rely his sentiments and feel his grief and we wish that he gets another girl to apply the ointment of her true love on his wounds and heal them in due course of time.With technical superiority and high production value on one hand the movie scores very high on the music front on the other. Yash Ji availed the services of music maestros  Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma the eminent Santoor player and Pandit Hari Prasaad Chaurasiya the virtuoso flautist who made perhaps the best music album of their career as cinemusic directors. The movie contains nine songs and all boasts of superior quality. Chaandni O Meri Chaandni Mere Haathon Mein Nau Nau Choodiyaan and Main Sasuraal Nahin Jaaungi became chartbusters overnight. However the relatively less talked about songs viz. Tere Mere Hothon Pe Meethe Meethe Geet Mitwa Tere Kadmon Mein Saara Jahaan Rakh Doon and Parbat Se Kaali Ghata Takraai are also highly melodious and earsoothing. Male songs viz. Sheheron Mein Ek Sheher Mila Bhai Sheher Mila Tha Dilly and Tu Mujhe Suna Main Tujhe Sunaaun Apni Prem Kahaani are quite hilarious. My most favourite song from this album is Lagi Aaj Saawan Ki Phir Woh Jhadi Hai which has been sung by Suresh Waadkar with Anupama Deshpande. Whenever I listen to this song while being alone my tears refuse to stay in my eyes. The beautiful lyrics of this album have been penned by acelyricist Anand Bakshi.Rishi Kapoor was always at his best when he had to romance. None could beat him in romancing with lovely ladies on the screen. Even after 16 years from Bobby 1973 the romantic skills of Rishi Kapoor are the same as visible in Chaandni. I regard Vinod Khanna as one of the best actors of his time and he has delivered a mature performance in his lowfootage role. The supporting cast has also done well.But Chaandni is Sridevi's movie by all means. Right from the title the complete story belongs to her and her only and she is at the zenith of her career in this movie. Yash Ji brought the best out of this natural actress whose charms have always been able to knock out the males. She appears so gorgeous that it's difficult for any young male not to fall in love with her.Chaandni is a heartconquering love story with immense repeat value. Watch it again and again and you will never feel tired of watching it. It's an immortal romantic love story presented by the King of Romance in Hindi cinema Yash Chopra.

	onyx:emotionText "Yash Chopra passed away. The 80 years old moviemaking maestro whose last directorial venture  Jab Tak Hai Jaan is going to hit the screen shortly has left for his heavenly abode without seeing its release and public response. As my tribute to the great director who is better known as the King of Romance in the Indian cinecircles I am reviewing a superhit movie directed by him. It's Chaandni 1989.Chaandni is the story of a jovial but downtoearth girl who respects the elders and believes in the Indian social and family values. She is as the title is  Chaandni Sridevi who is a simple middle class girl living in Delhi and happens to come across a rich boy Rohit Rishi Kapoor. Love blossoms between them and despite his family members looking upon Chaandni in a derogatory way Rohit decides to unite with her. However destiny has other plans. Rohit meets with an accident and thereafter life is not the same either for himself or for the love of his life i.e. Chaandni. Adjusting with the completely negative attitude of Rohit's family members on one hand and now handicapped Rohit's depressive mindset on the other one day Chaandni gets fed up and gets out of Rohit's life as well as the city.Now in a different city Chaandni happens to get a job in a company whose boss Lalit Vinod Khanna is a widower. Lalit falls for Chaandni's charms and his mother Waheeda Rehman is also too happy to see this simple heartconquering girl as her wouldbe daughterinlaw. The thing that they are not aware of is that Chaandni's heart is not hers now. It's Rohit's. And a typical Indian girl cannot love again so easily and so soon. The memories of the first love are still fresh and she lives with them. However she gets ready to marry Lalit as a compromise with her life and not out of love for him. Here comes another twist in this lovetriangle.Rohit's friendcumrelative Ramesh Anupam Kher elevates his spirits and propels him to come out of his depressive shell. Once Rohit starts seeing the status of the things in a different way he gets ready for his proper medical treatment and after fully recovering to search his lost love i.e. Chaandni. While being abroad for different reasons Lalit and Rohit cross paths and become good friends. Now both have a sweetheart individually but don't know that it's the same girl. Rohit comes to attend the engagement ceremony of Lalit and stunned to find that Lalit's betrothed is Chaandni only. And Chaandni ? She is at a crossroad now. Whom to choose ? But destiny and heart work in tandem and allow the story to conclude in the desired way.Yash Chopra possessed the rare knack of portraying malefemale romance on the screen in the most realistic manner. We know that real life is quite different from reel life. However Yash Chopra was always able to make the audience believe that what's on the reel was close to the real. While watching the movie we love the lovers we love their inner feelings and external romance and we love their union in the end. At the same time we are also sympathetic towards the loser in love because the King of Romance has made us rely his sentiments and feel his grief and we wish that he gets another girl to apply the ointment of her true love on his wounds and heal them in due course of time.With technical superiority and high production value on one hand the movie scores very high on the music front on the other. Yash Ji availed the services of music maestros  Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma the eminent Santoor player and Pandit Hari Prasaad Chaurasiya the virtuoso flautist who made perhaps the best music album of their career as cinemusic directors. The movie contains nine songs and all boasts of superior quality. Chaandni O Meri Chaandni Mere Haathon Mein Nau Nau Choodiyaan and Main Sasuraal Nahin Jaaungi became chartbusters overnight. However the relatively less talked about songs viz. Tere Mere Hothon Pe Meethe Meethe Geet Mitwa Tere Kadmon Mein Saara Jahaan Rakh Doon and Parbat Se Kaali Ghata Takraai are also highly melodious and earsoothing. Male songs viz. Sheheron Mein Ek Sheher Mila Bhai Sheher Mila Tha Dilly and Tu Mujhe Suna Main Tujhe Sunaaun Apni Prem Kahaani are quite hilarious. My most favourite song from this album is Lagi Aaj Saawan Ki Phir Woh Jhadi Hai which has been sung by Suresh Waadkar with Anupama Deshpande. Whenever I listen to this song while being alone my tears refuse to stay in my eyes. The beautiful lyrics of this album have been penned by acelyricist Anand Bakshi.Rishi Kapoor was always at his best when he had to romance. None could beat him in romancing with lovely ladies on the screen. Even after 16 years from Bobby 1973 the romantic skills of Rishi Kapoor are the same as visible in Chaandni. I regard Vinod Khanna as one of the best actors of his time and he has delivered a mature performance in his lowfootage role. The supporting cast has also done well.But Chaandni is Sridevi's movie by all means. Right from the title the complete story belongs to her and her only and she is at the zenith of her career in this movie. Yash Ji brought the best out of this natural actress whose charms have always been able to knock out the males. She appears so gorgeous that it's difficult for any young male not to fall in love with her.Chaandni is a heartconquering love story with immense repeat value. Watch it again and again and you will never feel tired of watching it. It's an immortal romantic love story presented by the King of Romance in Hindi cinema Yash Chopra. May his soul rest in peace.";

Extremely visual images of Chandni are given to the viewer in the opening of the film as Chandni dances around in misty scenery. These continues during the film with the use of the photographs that Rohit takes and are posted up on his wall and through the songs that Rohit with Chandni and Lalit sing in the second half of the film it is rare to find this type of usage of songs in Indian films.

Be it a village belle a westernized dancing girl a assertive young women handling opponents as a matured adult she took the film acting at a different level. This is a movie about three people Chandni  Sridevi Rohit  Rishi Kapoor  and Lalit  Vonod Khanna  entangled in a triangular love story. Yash Chopra famous film maker and younger brother of the legendary B.R. Chopra created a masterpiece of a love story surrounding these three human beings. Both Chandni and Rohit's encounter at the beginning of the movie kept us entertained with some good songs and frolics of two young lovers the story took the turn to more serious situations with Rohits accident and eventual separation from Chandni. Sridevi showed some magnificent dance performance specially the one in white clothing in the open field without any song. That was a super show. The movie has quite a few songs but they were all very well placed in the story and performed very well both in playback and actual playing. Rishi Kapoor showed a lot of enthusiasm and zeal in portraying young Rohit as also Vinod Khanna in his more serious role. Sridevi expressed her self so well in all the different moods specially when she meets Rishi Kapoor at the door of her house first time after their separation she expressed her surprise and emotions extremely well. It was a special surprise to see Waheeda Rehman as the mother of Vinod Khanna in a very well deserved role. Overall this a great movie of the late eighties Bollywood and it is a must see for all Sridevi fans. I gave it a nine out of ten.".

Akshay Kumar is just funny as hell in this film playing his character Sidhu is just lol. I think he acted very well.Deepika Padukone is lovely as ever! Playing a double role again First being Om Shanti Om she was great. I liked her character Meow Meow i think that it is a cool name and a very cool character. Her action scenes at the airport was fantastic. She looked great in all her costumes and her hair makeup was very beautiful! Her other character was also funny Ms. TSM.Dada was great same as the other star cast in the film.The songs in CC2C was funny.

Akshay Kumar is just funny as hell in this film playing his character Sidhu is just lol. I think he acted very well.Deepika Padukone is lovely as ever! Playing a double role again First being Om Shanti Om she was great. I liked her character Meow Meow i think that it is a cool name and a very cool character. Her action scenes at the airport was fantastic. She looked great in all her costumes and her hair makeup was very beautiful! Her other character was also funny Ms. TSM.Dada was great same as the other star cast in the film.The songs in CC2C was funny. I love the title track Chandi Chowkt to China and Tere Naine The sky song...Overall this film is a great watch! My rating for Chandi Chowk to China 710";

And then something completely unexpected happens which changes his life and he becomes a real Indian movie hero. This movie has also got the same old formula but this time the comedy in the beginning is by far the worst in his last few movies. Specially the constant use of vulgar jokes like breaking his balls or eggs threatening to put a wooden stick into someone from behind etc don't help at all. Deepika has looked stunning in both the roles she has played. But apart from that its all the same as Welcome and Singh is King. The makers have tried to show some senseless and boring comedy. For example Akshay gets away from the attack of about 2530 enemies completely unaware of them during dancing in one of the songs. Also too many fighting sequences are just over the top. In short the movie is a complete disappointment!!".

Deepika is OK looks good as always. Most others well actually I'm being unfair on the actors as they were probably doing what they were told. And the songs were in keeping with the rest of the film.

Agreed you don't look for logic and reason in hardcore potboilers but the least the director and his team of writers could do is provide loads of entertainment. Sadly writers Shridhar Raghavan and Rajat Aroraa make mincemeat of a plot that had the potential to woo viewers from Chandni Chowk to China to Chicago to Cape Town.So what's the verdict then? Enjoy Chinese food instead. This one's a big big big letdown! Sidhu Akshay Kumar cuts vegetables at a roadside food stall in Chandni Chowk in Delhi. He longs to escape his dreary existence and looks for shortcuts  with astrologers tarot readers and fake fakirs  believing anything except himself despite his father figure Dada's Mithun Chakraborty best efforts.The story takes a turn when two strangers from China claim he's a reincarnation of a war hero and take him to China. Thanks to the devious translator a conman by the name Chopstick Ranvir Shorey little does he know that he is being taken to the Chinese village of vicious smuggler Hojo Gordon Liu.Therefore Sidhu blissfully sets forth to China with Chopstick who instigates dreams of a delicious future and forgets to reveal the perils which await him. Along the way he meets Sakhi Deepika Padukone who has embarked on a journey to pay homage to the land of her birth and her dead father and twin.Hojo catches up with Sidhu and eliminates Dada right in front of everyone. Sidhu seeks revenge and finds the one man who will make him a Kungfu expert and set the village free from Hojo's tyranny.On facevalue what do you expect from CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA? Laughter unlimited great martial arts a glimpse of China. But what's served on the platter is so insipid so lame so senseless that you wonder if there was a script in the first place. The comic scenes that make you laugh are few and far between. The scenes depicting martial arts are hardly exciting. Also barring the Great Wall of China don't expect China country tour here! There are big holes in the script. Sample these...  How and why do the two oppressed Chinese men suddenly land up in Chandni Chowk in Delhi? Also how do they zero on Ranvir Shorey? No explanations offered.  Deepika's track of visiting China is trite. Wasn't the twinsister an infant thrown off the Great Wall of China? How did Gordon Liu suddenly decide to bring her up?  Similarly Deepika's father was also pushed from the Great Wall but he survives. Akshay too is beaten black and blue and thrown off coincidentally from the same place  Great Wall but is rescued midair by Deepika's father. Miracles never cease to occur must add.Post interval Akshay undergoes a grueling training session but not once does the preparation give an impression that Akshay is seething with anger and vengeance. That's because the director has injected humor in these scenes and that takes away the seriousness from the plot. The climax is equally contrived and hence makes no impact whatsoever.Although the year 2009 has just begun this film is sure to be a strong contender in Razzies in two departments mainly  direction and writing. Nikhil Advani goes horribly wrong this time. As for the writers well they ought to take a crash course in film writing pronto. The songs are okay with the title track and 'Naam Hai Sidhu' being the pick of the lot. The stunts Dee Dee Ku are plain mediocre. Even the dated martial arts' movies produced in the East offered better stuff. Himman Dhamija's cinematography lacks the picture perfect look.Akshay Kumar is the sole saving grace but the director hasn't tapped his potential to the fullest. Deepika Padukone is passable. Gordon Liu is decent. Ranvir Shorey is functional. Mithun Chakraborty is bland. Roger Yuan Deepika's father in the film is fair.On the whole CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA is a brilliant opportunity gone appallingly wrong. The film falls way below expectations and is a major disappointment in all respects. At the boxoffice the hype might translate into a bountiful weekend that's it. Thumbs down!".

I didn't listen to her and didn't watch the film but realized my mistake after watching it on TV.I don't need to type the synopsis I'll just write my opinion to it. Here's what my point of view says Their work  FIRST Indian martial arts film. I say it was well presented and a fresh idea. They shoot in China used REAL Chinese not stupid fake characters like in some movies and good actors. Very impressive action scenes.Story idea  As said fresh idea. I really liked the theme. The reason why this film have flopped might be that the story is not very new and some things aren't too. BUT the only overused Martial arts theme typically are of some cop who fights a drug dealer or gangster as revenge for his family or something this is similar too but not completely. Slapstick comedies some hard parts and few might look meaningless but as long its entertainment. But do blend together well and is fine as long you cut stupid things.Acting  Akshay is good and maintains his comedy like always. I really liked Deepika in this film. She has a double roll not a spoiler and I personally liked the 2nd character she played. There's Ranvir Shorey who's fine and some unknown Chinese actors who're actually good.Music  Minimal songs but catchy enough. Songs From Chandi Chowk to China Tere Naina Sidhu theme and Fatte Chak Lende are energetic and probably the only used songs and have good timings.Direction  I don't know this director but I don't find him bad. I don't why this film completely flopped. If 'Dhamaal' was a hit then I supposed it to be at least an average grosser.Verdict  6 out of 10. Why? Because this isn't a serious film and 7 ratings are for really meaningful ones. 6 is just fine and its good.My opinion  I have seen this film like 56 times on TV and I always think what was that bad. If you're a fan of Akshay Deepika Martial Arts or just want a timepass film this is good for Home Video or even watching on internet. But AT LEAST watchable.".

	schema:headline " Too Much Hustling in this Kung Fu...";
	schema:reviewBody "When a Chinese village becomes fed up with the dictatorship of tyrant Hojo Gordon Liu they decide to free themselves by finding the reincarnation of a legendary Chinese warrior. Their search takes them to India where they stumble upon Sidhu Akshay Kumar who bears a similar resemblance to the warrior of old. Sidhu is looking for a way to turn around his poor luck but is tricked into going to China when Chopstick Ranvir Shorey purposely mistranslates what the Chinese have to say.You wouldn't be wrong if you think Chandni Chowk to China is akin to Kung Fu Hustle. Both are about martial arts and both are parody films that parody subject matter even outside that of martial arts. In fact Chandni Chowk mimics the story and various situations found in Kung Fu Hustle but it is not quite as masterfully conceived. The story is a fairly standard affair of martial arts films where the protagonist needs to rise to the occasion learn some killer moves and defeat the enemy. Luckily the scriptwriters did attempt to add some additional subplots to give the film some depth and in this regard it works but perhaps a little too well. Besides the journey which is undertaken by Sidhu there is a smaller plot regarding the character Chiang Kohung Roger Yuan who has been trying to bring down Hojo but met a sad fate in the process. Kohung's story is used to help Sidhu's along but by the film's end this subplot abundantly more interesting than the main plot. Sadly the characters lack the story's depth and are far more one dimensional except for would you believe it Kohung. In fact Kohung would not be such an amazing character if it were not for the equally amazing acting by Roger Yuan. Not only does he act confidently but his martial arts talent is fluid and precise. It's difficult to imagine that he has landed so few roles in his career and hopefully Chandni Chowk gets him more exposed. Yuan's opposite Gordon Liu shows off his abundant knowledge of the film industry with a performance that emphasizes his characters subdued evil. It becomes a strange occurrence indeed when these two Chinese actors have better performances in a Bollywood film than the two titles stars Akshay Kumar and Deepika Padukone. Padukone has a double role as both Sakhi and Meow Meow but her screen time is surprisingly limited and it's obvious that she is eager to explode her roles into something more then she is allowed. And then there is Kumar who does not perform badly for he is suited to his role but he overacts far too much. Presumably to heighten the comedy the problem Kumar faces by the films close is that he never has control of it. He is so busy trying to find ways to make people laugh that he forgets that he is playing what is possibly one of the most annoying characters ever to grace cinema. That said the humour is abundant regardless of whether Kumar exaggerates his role or not. But this is not to say that the humour is of a high level throughout for most of the time the humour is based on sheer stupidity. This is not exactly problematic but anyone expecting something akin to Kung Fu Hustle which itself also had its share of stupidity for laughs might be a little peeved at the little genuinely original comedy. Though what doesn't help matters is the poor implementation of CG. From the introduction showcasing the Great Wall of China to the water effects used for a special move Sidhu learns the CG is always out of place. The special effects tend to work better but are used sparingly.On top of that the music selection for the film is very poor and the dance sequences themselves are not any better. Sure Deepkia Padukone can look incredibly sexy during these sequences but the music is only goes to make the worse then what it actually is. Coupled with the fact that music is used inappropriately in some scenes such as in the final fight the end result is a Bollywood film which should have gone against the norm.Chandni Chowk is an all round family film with no sex nudity or language. Violence is mostly in the form of martial arts and one character does have a weapon that he uses to slice the neck of some victims but this is quite tame.Simply put Chandni Chowk to China is a disappointing film especially when its taken into consideration that it was delayed from its original release in October November last year. It is difficult to tell if any additions were made because nothing really gels well for the film as a whole. The acting is passable with the Chinese actors being the highlight the story is decent but is overshadowed by a mere subplot and the music selection is shocking. That said the film has some of the best action sequences in a Bollywood film with the martial arts being fun to watch and the film is comedic throughout. However it should be advised that one's enjoyment of the film depends merely on their temperament for stupidity.".

	onyx:emotionText "When a Chinese village becomes fed up with the dictatorship of tyrant Hojo Gordon Liu they decide to free themselves by finding the reincarnation of a legendary Chinese warrior. Their search takes them to India where they stumble upon Sidhu Akshay Kumar who bears a similar resemblance to the warrior of old. Sidhu is looking for a way to turn around his poor luck but is tricked into going to China when Chopstick Ranvir Shorey purposely mistranslates what the Chinese have to say.You wouldn't be wrong if you think Chandni Chowk to China is akin to Kung Fu Hustle. Both are about martial arts and both are parody films that parody subject matter even outside that of martial arts. In fact Chandni Chowk mimics the story and various situations found in Kung Fu Hustle but it is not quite as masterfully conceived. The story is a fairly standard affair of martial arts films where the protagonist needs to rise to the occasion learn some killer moves and defeat the enemy. Luckily the scriptwriters did attempt to add some additional subplots to give the film some depth and in this regard it works but perhaps a little too well.

	schema:headline " CC2C  Disappointing to the Core!";
	schema:reviewBody "The curtains finally rose on the all hyped Chandni Chowk to China which released yesterday the 16Th January worldwide. CC2C is an movie with an sincere and desperate attempt to tickle the funny bone but... it fails miserably. This movie Directed by Nikhil Advani goes impact less on the audience like his previous directorial venture SalaamEIshq in 2005. Now at that point you can actually feel a lot better after watching SalaamEIshq because of its music unlike CC2C whose music is pretty much ordinary. CC2C's protagonist SiddhuAkshaye Kumar is a petty vegetable cutter at a food stall at Chandni Chowk owned by DadaMithun Chakraborthy who's more like a father figure to Siddhu who was brought up by him after being abandoned as a baby . Siddhu is innocent yet dumbdesperate to earn money and become rich attempts some really weird things right from buying Lottery Tickets to seeking the help of astrologers and Palm readers to try change his luck. Fortunately or Unfortunately for him he's recognized as an reincarnated Chinese warrior and taken to China to fight for the people against Hojo Gordon Liu. And how circumstances lead to one another transforming him into a fighter is something to watch out for. In this very country he comes across the twin sisters Sakhi and SuzyBoth played by Deepika Padukone who have their own story recipe to be added into the already screwed up CC2C story dish.2009 for Bollywood has definitely started off on a real bad note with CC2C totally disappointing the audience and not even living up to half the level of its expectations. CC2C is clearly dumb illogical and funny is parts. What were the Sippy's Production House thinking when he approved of such a crap script from Nikhil Advani. After this movie it really makes you wonder on the fact  did Nikhil Advani actually make KHNH. To top off such a bad movie is that Warner Bros are the distributors for this movie that too first time in Bollywood. Don't think they'll come back again. For once The promos of CC2C are far better than the full length movie. Music of the movie again going unnoticed and has a reason for it. ShankarEhsaanLoy extremely disappointing music which is not even close to Rock On!!.But you cannot really take this off from Akshaye Kumar he's extremely hilarious but only in parts. And watching only these parts of the movie you actually feel like sitting through the complete movie. Deepika Padukone does justice to her role completelyacting out well both as Sakhi and Suzy. What can an actor or an actress probably do.. when the script itself is filled with such flaws. Can't believe Shriram Raghavan has written the screenplay of CC2C after the movie like Jhonny Gaddar which was an absolute perfection in the screenplay section.I heard Akshaye Kumar saying in one of his interview's Leave your brains at home when you come watch CC2C. After watching CC2C i seriously wished I should have left everything at home before watching or even probably stayed back at home totally.I'll go with 4 out of 10 for Nikhil Advani's CC2C. Ten Thumbs down for all the unnecessary hype.".

The film is subtitled and is clearly connected to Bollywood. There are a few moments that breakout into dance and song which might be something audiences are not used to seeing.The film also jumps to comedy and action. There are plenty of action scenes. the lead actor is quite funny in a jerry lewis sort of way. But at times he is quite serious. The main actress is excellent playing more than one part. The film is subtitled but that is easy to get used to reading. There are also a number of excellent lines concerning themes like honor and loyalty for those interested in those ideas. It is an amazing blend .that may not be for everyone but this is not cynical humor. It is just plain funny at times. Pretty good music except for the closing credits. This film has many scenes by the Great Wall of China which is very interesting. I have never seen a Bollywood film but this certainly at least seems related to Bollywood. it is interesting that this film influenced by Bollywood is out at the same time as the excellent adventure drama Slumdog Millionaire.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't know what had gotten to our producers directors and stars as most of their time is wasted on promoting movie for things that are either absent or not actually worthy of promotion. CC2C is doing the same thing again. There is no problem in promoting a movie but what actually hurts me most is that these movies creates so much hype that every movie going soul becomes eager to have a dekkho and after their tryst with the movie before they can forewarn any of the other people the movie collects a fortune and hailed as a commercial success. Now as you all know our beloved Bollywood is slave of box office thus before the janta can say that what a rubbish movie it was similar kind of movies will not only be announced but also will go on floor. this makes industry blind to good and experimental scripts and it keeps on churning out Hollywood's garbage with the thinking that our audience like this kind of movie.Now coming back to CC2C it is one of many travel stories in which Akki baba goes to Alien land to spread the great Indian culture. In Namste London he went to London to rescue a confused damsel in Sinng is Kinng he saved his friend from the clutches of organized crime and now he is saving a Chinese town from the wrath of a Villain named Hojo. What I am unable o understand is that why to set a movie in foreign location even if the same story can be told in India? Except making it sellable in foreign territories I don't see any benefit whatsoever.Apart from this the movie suffers from editorial negligence as at least 4045 mins of movie could have and should have been edited to make the film interesting. In absence of that after the initial 15 mins of movie the movie becomes repetitive and boring. The main reason behind that they had put the same people Akshay Deepika Ranbir and Hojo in various situations again and again that too in a non creative way. Apart from that movie has only 3 main locations Chinese village Hojo's Hideout and the Great Wall of China. Same people in same locations with a oneline story end product is a silly movie that takes itself very seriously.Another Low point of movie is its songs as non of them is too hummable and are forgotten along with the movie as soon as one walks out of theater. Amazingly the transformation and training of Akshay that has to be the highest point of the movie where audiences get connect with the anger. Frustration and emotions of the protagonist remember ROCKY SERIES IVI is the totally nonhappening last 12 hour where all of your hopes of compensating bad comedy with a good action vanishes. So all I want to say is that all those who are looking for action watch dubbed Chinese kangfoo I don't know why Akshay pronounce kunfu as kangfoo?.Actors like Ranbir Shauri and Mithun are completely wasted as their roles were stereotyped and boring. Deepika fought well and convincingly for a bollywood heroine but hers double role was a completely non starter and she could not impress me. Chinese Villain Hojo Chia Hui Liu was portrayed as menacing but nowhere he looked or acted that evil even his martial art skills were neither explored nor used. Both Chia Hui Liu and Roger Yuan Father of Deepika are very good Martial artist but Alas! What a Waste? Basically CC2C fails as a action movie also as most the stunts are visibly wired thus lacks authenticity. Above that the camera work was not that good as most of the time it fails to convey the ferocity or skill level of the fighters. On the other hand Akshay has limited talent for Action Comedy and Acting and by churning out movies after movies he is over stretching himself as well as his fan base. What he actually need is to take a rest and wait for a Script a real script.So my verdict is Do something else but don't go to theaters rather I have a better suggestion for you Watch Sita aur Gita Chaalbaaz along with a Chinese martial art movie Snake in Monkey's Shadow is my pick at the comfort of your home. I promise you'll thank me..".

What he actually need is to take a rest and wait for a Script a real script.So my verdict is Do something else but don't go to theaters rather I have a better suggestion for you Watch Sita aur Gita Chaalbaaz along with a Chinese martial art movie Snake in Monkey's Shadow is my pick at the comfort of your home. I promise you'll thank me..";

	schema:reviewBody "A Bollywood confection making a rare appearance on American shores Chandni Chowk to China is an excellent reason why many of these productions fail to breakout beyond India. A deafening slapstickdrenched exaggerated bit of hokum Chandni is an endurance test for the Bollywood uninitiated a curryflavored Three Stooges comedy via The Shaw Brothers play book with a healthy serving of Stephen Chow thrown in for taste. It's an attractive bundle but ultimately a punishing mess of a movie.Sidhu Akshay Kumar is a lowly vegetable chopper looking to change his miserable fortunes on the streets of Chandni Chowk Delhi. Fate comes calling when Sidhu is mistaken for an ancient Eastern warrior asked to travel to China to help stop a deadly crime boss named Hojo Gordon Liu from ruling the land. Frightened Sidhu accepts the journey finding the mythical terrain does nothing to boost his pathetic kungfu abilities. Caught in the middle of Hojo's grip attempting to decipher the mystery between nearidentical sisters named Sakhi and Meow Meow Deepika Padukone and roughed up under the tutelage of Chiang Roger Yuan Sidhu goes from boob to brawler as he begins to accept his destiny and learn the way of the fist.Touted as the first Bollywood film to shoot in China Chandni takes full advantage of the phenomenal location arranging fingersnaptight fight sequences on the hallowed brick of the Great Wall and taking an interest in classic martial art cinema revenge mechanics to lend this comedy an unusual edge. At the very least Chandni looks magnificent director Nikhil Advani soaks up the opportunities handed to him to create a largerthanlife feature bursting with expansive locations diverse special effects and a cast littered with genre legends.It's a crime Chandni doesn't jump off the screen with the same electricity the production is aching to convey. Part of the problem lies in the film's 155 minute running time which feels like an entire year once trapped in the thick of the fantasy. Nothing this slight should be allowed by law to pass 80 minutes but it wouldn't be lovable Bollywood if it showed concern for pace and hindquarter comfort. Instead the film spends most of the time drawing out every scene past its expiration date absurdly stalling to permit Chandni an unwelcome epic length. With Kumar tearing around the frame mugging like a lunatic slipping on banana peels and hoofing it up in the film's few dance numbers Chandni could pass as a goofball excursion with specific appeal. It comes as a shock when the laughs in the film are smothered at the midway point when Chandni suddenly asks the audience for acceptance as a genuine drama.Did I miss the point where I was supposed to care about these relentlessly cartoonish characters?As Chandni flails around for what feels like an eternity indulging Bollywood and martial art staples with gale farce sincerity the production's generous spirit is readily available just not properly timed. Chandni is certainly not a disastrous stab at crossculture entertainment value but it's hopelessly bloated to a point of screaming paralysis.".

Akshay Kumar has done brilliant job and i can proudly compare him with Jakie Chan say it comparison of Comic or Action or Style. He looks perfect in role of an innocent city boy cutting vegetables in 'dhaaba' located in Chandni Chowk. and also suits well as the Saviour of the Village of China. Akshay kumar is well known Comic as well as Action genre actor of Bollywood Industry. He has given one of the best performance of his life. Actress Deepika Padukone looks beautiful in both Indian as well as Chinese roles. She has carried away martial arts stunts and actions very well. Ranveer Shorey is brilliant. And all other actors have done great job. Songs are good too. Cinematography is top notch. Special effects and animation is goodlooking upon the bollywood level. I read some critics writing reviews and mentioning about FLAWS in this movie to be very clear Roger Yuan falls from the Great Wall of China and survives because he was expert in Martial Arts and knew way to land on his feet from great height. Second flaw was they didn't show how they brought up Meow Meow if they showed that viewers would have said this scene was not at all necessary it was boring etc etc. third flaw how did the Chinese villagers locate Ranveer Shorey. the answer is Akshay Kumar considered him GURUJI so he took them to Ranveer Shorey. Please Indian Critics get some life and stop looking at money... Viewers please view this fast track action comedy flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sciencefiction and fantasy are not exactly common genres in Bollywood but fortunately for us there are a few exceptions. And although the Mumbaibased film industry has grown pretty mature over the last ten years Chandra Mukhi is a cute example from well before that. It's one piece of work believe me. Don't expect a masterpiece if you decide to watch it but be in for a real treat.It all happens somewhere in East Africa although the only thing that adds some couleur locale are a few zebras giraffes and a lion at the very beginning of the movie because during the entire movie we won't encounter a single black person as if East Africa were inhabited exclusively by Hindispeaking Indians. The hero of our story is Raju an about 8 years old kid who spends most of his time playing around with his friends. Raju's grandfather is a rich businessman and Raju is the apple of his eye. However Raju's maternal uncle Madan and his wife Kamini are not pleased with Raju's privileged position at all. Madan and Kamini are evil people He could do harm to normal people but he can't do harm to us because we are EVIL PEOPLE mwahahahaaaaa!. Together they run a small gang of cartoonesque goons and their plan is to bump off grandpa and Raju in order to get hold of grandpa's huge property. However their plans don't work out as they should. Because what happens? Somewhere far far away in the universe lies a heavenly kingdom ruled by a severe but kindhearted queen. The queen has a beautiful daughter played by Sridevi with a peculiar hobby the princess enjoys floating ! over Earth and the queen cannot approve of that because Earth is a wicked and dangerous place. To prevent her from going there the queen entrusts the princess with a magical golden leaf the key to all power in the universe. But of course the princess goes anyway and stumbles upon Dhola a huge bald fellow in a superhero suit who wants to kill the princess steal the leaf and take over power so that she loses the leaf falls down and loses her power. Down on Earth she quickly makes friends with Raju and the other kids. They name her Chandra Mukhi after one of the Devdas characters. When Chanda Mukhi witnesses how bad poor Raju is treated by his evil uncle she decides to help him using all the power that is left in her to turn him into an adult muscleman overnight. Of course it won't last long before Raju played by Salman Khan and the sympathetic alien princess fall in love.These are the basic ingredients. Just add an evil sorcerer a tribe a village a lonely cannibal and a band of merry thieves  all this apparently within a radius of a few miles at most  to the mix and you'll get an idea. Those who enjoy watching Salman's naked chest will as usual not be disappointed either.Chandra Mukhi has lots of elements that would easily qualify it as a lowbudget movie of the so bad it's good genre. Yet that wouldn't entirely do justice to the movie. It has visibly been made with humor and an odd kind of love. Sridevi plays her role charmingly and decently and besides she's a terrific dancer. Salman may never have been a great actor but his acting still had some of the freshness that later got lost in mannerisms. Gulshan Grover is funny in the role of Madan. For the rest the whole thing is just incredibly naive and delightfully absurd  even for a children's movie.".

Yet that wouldn't entirely do justice to the movie. It has visibly been made with humor and an odd kind of love. Sridevi plays her role charmingly and decently and besides she's a terrific dancer. Salman may never have been a great actor but his acting still had some of the freshness that later got lost in mannerisms. Gulshan Grover is funny in the role of Madan. For the rest the whole thing is just incredibly naive and delightfully absurd  even for a children's movie.";

She meets Raja a boy of around 10 who is being abused by his stepuncle. To help Raja she uses the remains of her powers to age him so that he can defend himself. After this she and the adult Raja Salman Khan go on an adventure to find her leaf.This is a truly silly fantasy flick but mostly enjoyable nonetheless. While the songs are average the choreography is good and Sridevi is truly a fine dancer. Khan's part is odd in that at times Raja seems to have matured as he aged particularly when wooing Chandramuhki and at others seems to still have the mentality of a child. This made the romancing feel a bit awkward but nonetheless Khan and Sridevi had good chemistry. Khan was charming but overacted at times.

	schema:reviewBody "Elio Petri made a string of good and interesting movies from the '60s to the '70s. He tackled the Mafia fascist cops union strikes and deranged artists. Todo Modo although not his best and most entertaining movie may be the sum of all his sociopolitical interests. A dark satire about Italian politics based on Leonardo Sciascia's novel Todo Modo is a very bizarre movie that may not make a lot of sense unless the viewer knows a bit of what was going on in Italy in the 1970s.Gian Maria Volont plays a primeminister who enrolls in spiritual resort together with his cabinet of ministers and the opposition where under the guidance of Don Gaetano Marcello Mastroianni they attend lectures against sin vices money and the thirst for power. They're there to become better men while outside the city is being ravaged by an epidemic. But instead they use the spiritual retreat to scheme conspire and plan the future in order to maintain their tight grip on power which they've held for decades while the people suffer under their indifferent predatory rule.Then there's a murder and another and all hell breaks loose. The murder however doesn't turn into a classic police investigation especially because inspector Scalambri Renato Salvatori is out of his league investigating the government members. Sciascia's previous novel which was turned into 'Cadaveri Eccellenti' directed by Francesco Rosi treads similar ground with the same level of ambiguity and meditations on the structures of power. After watching Todo Modo everyone should give it a try. Instead of a police investigation Todo Modo shows ruthless treacherous men trying to backstab each other for survival. It's like a political version of Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None'. In one of the best scenes Scalambri attempts a reenactment of the first murder he tries to ascertain where each person was at the time of the murder which occurred in the middle of a crowd. But this appeal to justice is marred by the politicians' instincts never to be compromised in an investigation. As each man denies that he was to the right or left of someone else it becomes obvious left and right stop being directions and become political tendencies ending with the hilarious accusation Come off it! You've always been on the right! You were even to the right of Mussolini! The movie has a slow start but once the first murder occurs it picks up a gripping pace until culminating in an hecatomb in the end. Everyone's very good in this movie including Volont and Mastroianni. The cinematography of Luigi Kuveiller is at the peak of his talent. Even if it's not a masterpiece the talent concentrated in this movie makes it worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Guaranteed to make your nearest American Humane Society or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA member go into a coma";
	schema:reviewBody "Although they weren't born in that decade adventure documentaries were popular in the 1920s. The first big one was Robert J. Flaherty's Nanook of the North 1922 followed by films such as Ernest B. Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper's Grass 1925 and Flaherty's Moana 1926. Nanook of the North covered Inuit culture in the Canadian section of the Arctic Circle Grass followed the Bakhtiari tribe in Iran and Moana was shot in Samoa. Chang also directed by Schoedsack and Cooper is set in northern Siam or what is now known as Thailand.These films were an outgrowth of earlier works such as Martin E. and Osa Johnson's Cannibals of the South Seas 1912 and Paul J. Rainey's African Hunt 1912. Adventure documentaries were one of the more exciting things that could be done with film in its early yearstelevision didn't yet exist and we didn't have today's ease of travel so the cultures displayed were truly exotic for most audiences.These documentaries were always questionable as journalistic depictions of reality however as documentaries still often arethere are many fascinating philosophy of film issues surrounding this. Clearly some aspects of these works were staged. Chang was unique in that its overall content including characters plot and so forth was entirely made up. As Schoedsack said It was as carefully constructed as anything made in a studio only our raw material was not manufactured. It turns out that Chang A Drama of the Wilderness is as much fiction as Andy Tennant's Anna and the King 1999 or at least as fictional as Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust 1980 with which it also shares scenes that should make any selfrespecting PETA member go into a coma or pick up an automatic weapon. I'm not quite a member of PETA so no need to don your bulletproof vest.That the raw materials were not made up makes Chang unique. It's fiction shot in an authentic location using authentic people who were not actors and recreating largely authentic kinds of scenarios and settings. The star of the film Kru plays a man with the same name in the film. Kru's real life kids Nah and Ladah and pet Gibbon monkey Bimbo play his kids and monkey in the film. His wife in the film Chantui was really the wife of one of Kru's friends. The plot has Kru and his family as a bit more primitive than they really were trying to eke out a meager existence in the dense jungles of Northern Siam. The film opens by showing their daily routines then shows them their livestock and eventually their crops a rice field being threatened by leopards bears and eventually elephants. The film is largely about Kru and later his fellow villagers trying to rid themselves of these problems which often means trapping and killing animals and there is a lot of other animal handling in the film that would disturb modern western audiences. The plot isn't complex but the film is enrapturing to watch not only because it is so well made and still seems exotic but now because of the glimpse of reality it offers 80 years back in time.In real life Kru had been a fisherman a hunter a trapper an evangelist and a carpenter. And when Cooper and Schoedsack arrived he functioned on their expedition as their interpreter guide philosopher and he was in charge of finding the lions tigers bears and other wild animals that would be used in the film. Kru got the gig because he was a friend to some missionaries in the area.It took weeks to reach the remote jungle area where most of the film was shot. Prior to shooting Cooper and Schoedsack spent months studying natives and animals while they figured out the best way to film them basically making up their story on the fly and a lot of it was constructed via later editing and creative intertitling. Given the conditionswhich included just the twoman crew in high heat and humidity with relatively primitive cameras the cinematography in Chang is remarkably crisp. This is one of the first films to be shot on panchromatic rather than orthochromatic stock and this enabled finer more realistic gradations of gray in response to various filmed colors. They had no artificial lighting and had to shoot in thick jungles. The intense heat caused the animals to stay undercover so they had to shoot most of the film in early morning. Schoedsack would often be precariously perched on primitive platforms or sheltered in hides and pits that offered little protection. They would often trap animals then photograph them when they'd let them loose. Three men on the crew were bitten by pythons. Schoedsack had recurrent malaria and sunstroke and often worked while having a very high fever. The skillfully edited material tends to be exciting and dramatic on a surface level but when you think about Schoedsack being narrowly missed by tiger and elephants while filming it's that much more fascinating.Since Chang is of a different era the subtexts are very different than they would be if the film were made now. The jungle in the film is not an Edenic paradise but a menace to be conquered at best and tolerated at worst. This is amplified more than we might expect by showing the natives to be not very adept at safely building their homes and villages. It's difficult to believe that this wasn't exaggerated to amp up the drama but as drama it works even if it's not very truthful.It's also worth noting the score on the Image Entertainment DVD provided by Bruce Gaston's Fong Naam ensemble. They skillfully weave traditional and modern tonalities and instruments of the area to create charming music that often resembles Wendy Carlos' Balinese gamelaninfluenced pieces on works such as Beauty in the Beast.This is an entrancing historically intriguing film.".

It turns out that Chang A Drama of the Wilderness is as much fiction as Andy Tennant's Anna and the King 1999 or at least as fictional as Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust 1980 with which it also shares scenes that should make any selfrespecting PETA member go into a coma or pick up an automatic weapon. I'm not quite a member of PETA so no need to don your bulletproof vest.That the raw materials were not made up makes Chang unique. It's fiction shot in an authentic location using authentic people who were not actors and recreating largely authentic kinds of scenarios and settings. The star of the film Kru plays a man with the same name in the film. Kru's real life kids Nah and Ladah and pet Gibbon monkey Bimbo play his kids and monkey in the film. His wife in the film Chantui was really the wife of one of Kru's friends. The plot has Kru and his family as a bit more primitive than they really were trying to eke out a meager existence in the dense jungles of Northern Siam. The film opens by showing their daily routines then shows them their livestock and eventually their crops a rice field being threatened by leopards bears and eventually elephants. The film is largely about Kru and later his fellow villagers trying to rid themselves of these problems which often means trapping and killing animals and there is a lot of other animal handling in the film that would disturb modern western audiences. The plot isn't complex but the film is enrapturing to watch not only because it is so well made and still seems exotic but now because of the glimpse of reality it offers 80 years back in time.In real life Kru had been a fisherman a hunter a trapper an evangelist and a carpenter. And when Cooper and Schoedsack arrived he functioned on their expedition as their interpreter guide philosopher and he was in charge of finding the lions tigers bears and other wild animals that would be used in the film. Kru got the gig because he was a friend to some missionaries in the area.It took weeks to reach the remote jungle area where most of the film was shot. Prior to shooting Cooper and Schoedsack spent months studying natives and animals while they figured out the best way to film them basically making up their story on the fly and a lot of it was constructed via later editing and creative intertitling. Given the conditionswhich included just the twoman crew in high heat and humidity with relatively primitive cameras the cinematography in Chang is remarkably crisp. This is one of the first films to be shot on panchromatic rather than orthochromatic stock and this enabled finer more realistic gradations of gray in response to various filmed colors. They had no artificial lighting and had to shoot in thick jungles. The intense heat caused the animals to stay undercover so they had to shoot most of the film in early morning. Schoedsack would often be precariously perched on primitive platforms or sheltered in hides and pits that offered little protection. They would often trap animals then photograph them when they'd let them loose. Three men on the crew were bitten by pythons. Schoedsack had recurrent malaria and sunstroke and often worked while having a very high fever. The skillfully edited material tends to be exciting and dramatic on a surface level but when you think about Schoedsack being narrowly missed by tiger and elephants while filming it's that much more fascinating.Since Chang is of a different era the subtexts are very different than they would be if the film were made now. The jungle in the film is not an Edenic paradise but a menace to be conquered at best and tolerated at worst. This is amplified more than we might expect by showing the natives to be not very adept at safely building their homes and villages. It's difficult to believe that this wasn't exaggerated to amp up the drama but as drama it works even if it's not very truthful.It's also worth noting the score on the Image Entertainment DVD provided by Bruce Gaston's Fong Naam ensemble. They skillfully weave traditional and modern tonalities and instruments of the area to create charming music that often resembles Wendy Carlos' Balinese gamelaninfluenced pieces on works such as Beauty in the Beast.This is an entrancing historically intriguing film.";

I was either expecting a dull documentary or a fake film filled with White folks dressed like Asians and stock footage instead of real action. However I was very pleasantly surprised when the film turned out not to exactly be a documentary but had a surprisingly interesting story behind it as well as excellent writingmaking this a far from dull story indeed. In addition the film was not filmed on some back lot or crammed full of stock images but Paramount Studios went to a lot of troublegoing to Siam and using real Siamese not conjoined people. And these Asians were NOT White people acting like dumb lackeys like Charlie Chan or those in THE GOOD EARTH but real people that you cared about. So thanks to a good story decent characters and action as well as a sensitive portrayal in the jungle this is an excellent film and it occasionally had a nice sense of humor. It also helped that real elephants tigers leopards and other animals were usednot props or stuffed animals. However of all the animal stars I think I liked the gibbon bestyou'd have to see it to understand what I mean.For 1927 this is truly an amazing and modern film though modern sensitivities might be aroused. PETA members will no doubt cringe when much of the plot involves hunting and killing tigers and leopards and elephants! All these scenes are amazingly realistic and given that the villagers were being killed by these critters I could certainly understand the filmbut in the 21st century some people are bound to be shocked with the savagery of the action.".

The movie reflects a time period when enterprising and intrepid filmmakers like Cooper and Schoedsack were discovering the audience potential for semidocumentaries showing exotic peoples and locales. Here it's an adventure in northern Siam Thailand. The rough storyline follows a Laotian family and villagers as they compete against a fierce jungle for livelihood. As expected scenes are filled with wild beasts and clambering natives. Some scenes are obvious pandering the gamboling monkey the cute baby others are pure spectaclethe rampaging elephant herd the marauding big cats. Of course much of the animal spectacle though not the killing is familiar in our age of 24hour cable TV. Still seeing how the natives cope under primitive conditions remains fascinating.A couple points I think are worth noting. Though the exact locale is not pinpointed on a map the location appears roughly within what has since become known notoriously as The Golden Triangle northern convergence of Burma Thailand Laos and Vietnam. Whatever its status in 1927 the Triangle has grown into one of the world's biggest sources of heroingrade opium. I can't help wondering whether the advance of a money economy has since turned villagers like those of the movie into cashcrop farmers.Also the movie's theme writes confidently of the jungle's permanent presence. Eighty years later with new waves of extractive technology and I wonder if that permanence is as assured now as it was then. Looks to me like the rainforests are under industrial siege and may well be losing their presence in the face of human advancement. A rather ironical turn of events.Neither of these points is meant to detract from the overall excellence of the film. However I don't think the movie should be viewed as a dead historical document. Instead it can be used as an informative lens for looking at the ageold struggle between man and nature.".

I'm not one who normally rents silent movies but glad I did this one. Explores family life in the jungles of Siam Thailandin 1925.  The way the family interacts with an unbelieveable assortment of animals is astounding.  The scenes with tigers leopards bears snakes etc are not to be missed.  I venture to say that the elephant Chang stampede scene in this movie has never been done the way its done in this filmsimply fantastic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chang 1927  12 out of 4A rather remarkable and at times eyeopening documentary about a family living in the deep jungles of Northern Siam. The film follows their daily lives and shows us how they work live play and eventually hunt game. CHANG has been called a documentary but I do wonder how much story actually went on and it sure seems that a lot of the footage was probably shot and prepared in such a way that the filmmakers could tell a more dramatic story. That's certainly not a negative thing or a strike against the movie because there's no question this film is rather incredible considering when it was made and some of the footage that they gathered. I'm sure some people might be bothered by some of the animals that are killed but the way I look at it is that the people living in these villages were fighting for their lives so it's understandable that they'd kill the creatures that were trying to kill them. The filmmakers are quite respectful as we never see any of the actual deaths on screen so those sensitive to the material won't find anything graphic. I think the animal footage is some of the most amazing that I've seen. When you think of various animal footage from this era you think of poorly done stock footage but there were several times during the film that I was stumped as to how they got the shots that they did. The tiger hunt sequence is certainly one of the highlights of the film as it appears several times that the camera is right in the path of the beast. Another memorable moment comes at the end when the chang elephants stampede. There are countless animals on display from bears to snakes to anteaters to tigers and of course the elephants. Seeing these creatures in their natural homes was quite a bit of fun and it was also a reminder of how dangerous these things could be. The most interesting thing about this film is seeing how certain people lived during this time. Going into these jungles just makes one grateful that they weren't born there and at the same time you have to watch this and wonder if you could have done the things the people in these villages did.".

	schema:headline " Nice try to show a different kind of encounter of social outsiders";
	schema:reviewBody "Though being a hardcore Fanny Ardant fan I have to admit that this movie won't make it into my list of favorites. Fanny's acting nevertheless is absolutely flawless and shows again her huge spectrum as an actress. Also her counterpart Roschdy Zem convinces with a solid performance and transports the picture of a lost character with deep impact on the viewer. But the story doesn't keep up with the director's ambition. The plot runs short and flattens towards a strange and silly end. To me it seemed that they hadn't made up their mind about the movie's end until they had almost finished the shooting. It destroys the good impression of the numerous really touching and heart wrenching scenarios that carry this film. Another big weakness of the story lies in the lack of real peaks and highlights. A director or story board writer doesn't always have to follow the 2peakrule of course but if the viewer isn't shaken by some outstanding and most of all recognizable elements that break the strand boredom will be the inevitable result. These technical weaknesses have impeded the outcoming of a perhaps great movie because the topic and the characters lay the ground for the presentation of a rarely discussed social phenomenon the life of male prostitutes from the Magreb illegal emigrants living on the edge of French society their bonding and strategies of surviving their dreams and falls. The encounter of another outsider of society a rundown actress out of work physically of great beauty and most definitively an experienced and talented performer but too old for many directors and out of the business for too long could have resulted in a deeply shaking drama. Unfortunately the cast's great performance on screen isn't enough for that. On the list of positive features I must note that the director balanced scenes of sexual cruelty and humiliation with moments of soft romantic and tender love. But then stylistic elements to deliberately confuse the viewer are overused in the beginning and lose their effect or seem displaced e.g. Nina entering a taxi to run away from Sami followed by the scene of a man sitting in his car while somebody is doing a blow job on him and everybody thinks it must be Nina to pay the taxi ride some interesting characters aren't explored deeply enough and remain too superficial e.g. Fidele or the theater director. The relationship between Nina and the gallery owner who obviously finances her during her time of unemployment isn't explained satisfyingly and leaves too many questions open. Perhaps the movie's title should have been Je change ma vie I change my life instead of Change moi ma vie Change my life because the main characters actually don't change each other or wait passively for the other's help but receive an impulse by their mutual encounter so that they do something themselves about their specific situation  for the better or the worse.... Still the movie deserves a fairly good rating due to the daring topic the great acting of Fanny Ardant the perfectly matching soundtrack and the partly really realistic illustration of the social circumstances in which the characters live.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tchin once again at his notquitebest is once again better than just about anything else going on in movies. The Tangiers in which the film is set is one of cranes and bulldozers and exurban office blocks and urban blight as workinprogress. It could be any big hyperdeveloping city anywhere a point only emphasized by unglamourized shots of the spectacular bay and of the seashore along which African migrants crowd in search of a lift to Spain. Yet it is also a place where sheikhs still cast out demons at least on videotape in a very sharp and funny sequence and modern Westernized executive assistants must try hard not to act too irritated or insulted when their foreign charges ask to learn how folks here cast spells. No one who can help it speaks Arabic. This is the Morocco Paul Bowles really lived in not the one he wrote about. But in the gritty and astringently unsentimental world Tchin always gives us magic can and does happen just as he has always been telling us it does  when where and how we least expect it.Into all this he brings Depardieu and Deneuve well into late middle age and pointedly showing it. The actress the French press still ritually calls the Most Beautiful Woman In The World allows herself to be shot dowdy and wrinkled and Depardieu is a pathetic clutsy mastodontic wreck of a project engineer who's supposed to build things but who pulls them down around himself instead. Viewers who come to this film hoping for a glamorous Last Metro sequel will deservedly be sorely disappointed but it is in the interaction of these two as truthfully aging but only partly matured and not necessarily wiser human beings that much of the real magic of the film lies. The sequence of their first encounter is transcendental cinema Tchin paces lights andabove all frames it with as much mastery as you will see in any nonAsian film this year and the actors pour their lifetimes of experience into making it a moment of stunning deeply affecting comic understatement. With such consummate virtuosos in front of and behind the camera all you can do is purr.Balzac here meets the Thousand and One Nights with sudden clashes of culture and of personality and with acute squirminducingly true mixes of love and its opposite between friends lovers spouses and in bravura double casting of Lubna Azabal twins all real and raw all in quicksilver sequences with minimum exposition or narrative explication. The film looks as if it may have been done on a very tight schedule some of sequences show signs of overhasty rehearsal of cameras rolling before actors have gelled and mastered their scene.But Tchin is nonetheless a master who makes so many films that he is taken for granted and mistaken for a reliable journeyman. He probably longs for a breakthrough hit and may have been hoping for this finally to be the one. It won't be the French press comment has ranged from very enthusiastic to tepid to dismissive and as is so often the case he is up against newer and glitzier directors with films being released at roughly the same time. In 1991 for example it had been Olivier Assayas's Paris s'veille portentous and affected that had eclipsed Tchin's searing but as usual flawed J'embrasse pas this year it is Arnaud Desplechin's Rois et reine also featuring Deneuve that will doubtless outglitz Les temps qui changent without bettering it. But in Paris chic will always win over substance and Tchin will never be chic. This doubtless goes a long way to explaining why so many actors of the first rank Deneuve  long a synonym for chic  among them do some of their best work for him and come back to him time after time. They know something about Tchin that too many professional critics don't  and so by now should we.".

His ability to draw intensely personal performances from his actors makes him a director with a full heart and startling technique.Essentially a love story 'Les Temps qui changent' 'Changing Times' examines the lives of two people who fell in love in Paris 30 years ago but parted. Antoine Lavau Grard Depardieu has never married so in love with his original flame Ccile Catherine Deneuve that he is obsessed with winning her back. Ccile has married a younger man Natan Gilbert Melki who is a philandering physician and lives in Tangiers where she hosts a dowdy talk show on the radio to help support the family. The couple has a bisexual son Sami Malik Zidi who has returned to Tangiers with his drugaddled girlfriend Nadia Lubna Azabal and her son Sad Idir Elomri much to his parent's concern and takes up with his Moroccan lover Bilal Nadem Rachati. The family problems are further complicated by the fact that the Morroccan Nadia has a twin sister Acha also played by Lubna Azabal in Tangiers who is trying desperately to separate her life from her twin.Antoine an architect of means manages to land a job in Tangiers in hopes of rekindling his romance with Ccile but Ccile has become a feminist and a bitter woman who resents her younger husband's infidelity and wants nothing to do with love especially with the threat of depth of feeling that Antoine's new presence in her world presents. Antoine is persistent meets Ccile's husband for medical reasons and tries to woo Ccile in a close to stalking manner. Ccile's best friend Rachel Tanya Lopert convinces her that the only way to end the ardor of Antoine is to sleep with him which she finally does with unexpected results. While the dance between Ccile and Antoine progresses Natan meets Acha Sami and Bilal arouse old emotions and Nadia requires rehab for her out of control drug habits. How all of these coincidental occurrences coincide in an unexpected accident for Antoine is Andr Tchin's magical way of sharing the power of love in the most adverse of circumstances. The ending is surprising and thoughtprovoking and eminently satisfying.Depardieu and Deneuve are luminous in their roles adding yet other crowns to their careers of creating unforgettable subtle characterizations on film. The remainder of the cast is also superb and the cinematography and music and editing and direction make this a feast for the eyes and the brain. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

Gerard Depardieu also was outstanding as usual he is utterly amazing in his ability to portray vastly different characters despite his utterly distinctive physical presence.I regard any film that holds my attention throughout as being basically good and any that doesn't as basically bad. This one held my attention so it's good. I kept wanting to see what happened next.But there are degrees of goodness and this one was down near the bottom. At the end I thought Well what am I supposed to take out of all that? Two former lovers may or may not be reunited if they are it may or may not be the result of witchcraft the halfgay son's girlfriend is unhappy about something but I have no idea what it it is or if it's going to get better her sister is also troubled but I have no idea what about maybe something significant was said about the politics of Tangier andor Iraq but if so it went over my head.The handheld camera as always didn't make me think about the significance of the events that were unfolding it just unsettled my stomach by forcing me to adjust my field of vision every millisecond. When you think about it the basic rationale for constant use of handheld cameras is fundamentally stupid. It doesn't add realism it destroys it. When I observe people interacting I don't dance around them as photographers holding cameras seem compelled to do and if I do move my field of vision changes smoothly and to me unnoticeably. But when the handheld camera moves it jerks and the viewer has to adjust his field of vision and then absorb the sights he sees. Bring back the good old days where the images were the focus not the camerawork.".

Watching this I was very much reminded of his 1996 film Les Voleurs also starring Deneuve. Les Temps qui Changent is part comedy part family drama part romance and part political commentary. The film doesn't dragit simmers and feels very alive. Morocco is quite a setting. In such a contrast to the mainstream American films this film is subtle and unapologetic. The viewers come to care about not only the characters but their world as well. The subplots do not detract but only enhance the realistic and cultural quality of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Nominated for the Golden Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival Andr Techine's Changing Times reunites French superstars Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu for the seventh time. Set in Tangiers Morocco in the fifties the film tackles large topics temporary pleasure versus enduring commitment the status of women in Morocco bisexuality and the economic gap between wealthy European nations and the third world but none are fully developed. Along the way we see refugees waiting by the sea hoping for voyage to Europe Arabs slaughtering sheep in the desert and women afraid to be seen in public with men. The film has a fragmentary quality and in spite of some lyrical moments is mainly a star vehicle that cannot decide whether it wants to be a comedy a tragedy or political commentary. The film begins as a landslide buries Antoine Lavau Gerard Depardieu a supervisor inspecting a construction site and the film proceeds with flashbacks to Antoine's arrival in Tangiers and his subsequent life in Morocco. Lavau has come to Tangiers to expedite the building of an audiovisual center in the Tax Free Zone of Tangiers. Perhaps sexpedite might be more to the point as he has basically come to rekindle a romance with Cecile Deneueve his first love with whom he is still obsessed even though he has not tried to contact her during the last thirty years out of fear of rejection. Cecile is a radio announcer on a late night music and talk show. Antoine sends her flowers anonymously and spends his nights listening to her voice on the radio. In a scene played for laughs he even watches a video about voodoo so he can render her powerless to resist his advances. When the two finally meet it is only after Antoine runs into a glass wall breaking his nose.Cecile has changed greatly since coming to North Africa and has neither fond memories of Antoine nor any wish to rekindle their romance. She is remarried to Natan Gilbert Melki a Jewish doctor and they have one son Sami Malik Zidi a bisexual who has been living in Paris with his Moroccan girl friend Nadia Lubna Azubal and her son Said Idir Elomri.

	onyx:emotionText "Nominated for the Golden Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival Andr Techine's Changing Times reunites French superstars Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu for the seventh time. Set in Tangiers Morocco in the fifties the film tackles large topics temporary pleasure versus enduring commitment the status of women in Morocco bisexuality and the economic gap between wealthy European nations and the third world but none are fully developed. Along the way we see refugees waiting by the sea hoping for voyage to Europe Arabs slaughtering sheep in the desert and women afraid to be seen in public with men. The film has a fragmentary quality and in spite of some lyrical moments is mainly a star vehicle that cannot decide whether it wants to be a comedy a tragedy or political commentary. The film begins as a landslide buries Antoine Lavau Gerard Depardieu a supervisor inspecting a construction site and the film proceeds with flashbacks to Antoine's arrival in Tangiers and his subsequent life in Morocco. Lavau has come to Tangiers to expedite the building of an audiovisual center in the Tax Free Zone of Tangiers. Perhaps sexpedite might be more to the point as he has basically come to rekindle a romance with Cecile Deneueve his first love with whom he is still obsessed even though he has not tried to contact her during the last thirty years out of fear of rejection. Cecile is a radio announcer on a late night music and talk show. Antoine sends her flowers anonymously and spends his nights listening to her voice on the radio. In a scene played for laughs he even watches a video about voodoo so he can render her powerless to resist his advances. When the two finally meet it is only after Antoine runs into a glass wall breaking his nose.Cecile has changed greatly since coming to North Africa and has neither fond memories of Antoine nor any wish to rekindle their romance. She is remarried to Natan Gilbert Melki a Jewish doctor and they have one son Sami Malik Zidi a bisexual who has been living in Paris with his Moroccan girl friend Nadia Lubna Azubal and her son Said Idir Elomri. He is in Tangier visiting his family for the holidays and renewing acquaintances with his Moroccan lover Bilal Idir Rachati who lives in a country estate well protected by a pack of none too friendly dogs. Nadia who suffers from emotional problems and takes tranquilizers wants to visit her twin sister Aicha while in Tangiers whom she hasn't seen in six years but Aicha refuses to see her telling Nadia that it would complicate her life. These episodes have some tender moments but we do not learn enough about either sister or for that matter Sami or Bilal to have any emotional investment in their lives.As Cecile's relationship with Natan becomes more and more strained she begins to open up a little bit to Antoine and starts to show some affection but this is interrupted by Antoine's accident at the site leading to a contrived and predictable resolution of the plot.

Changing Times is more a study of the difference between love and companionship a question to be asked by the husband the wife and the son. The feeling of the realness of the plot and the characters Techine instills in the audience is what makes his drama alluring and unforgettable as opposed to mainstream Hollywood productions which never fail to extract themselves from the reality.Having said that is it just myself who thinks that despite the interesting stories of the characters Despardieu seems to be the least interesting or enchanting character among them followed by Denueve? Frankly I am way much more attracted to the son's and the husband's stories and their decisionmaking.Furthermore the conspicuous efforts to seep in the FrenchMorrocan ethnic tension from time to time in the movie seems to a bit out of place and distracting at times. Nonetheless it is still a very good piece of work with a unique realness and human tension which is now a trademark of Techine. Changing Times deserves more than a 6.2 rating definitely and don't be put off.".

	schema:reviewBody "Can this failed disjointed plot be saved? Is it is worth saving? I think so but I am probably in the minority. I suggest that the pivotal relationship between Antoine Lavau Depardieu and Cecile Deneuvre be resuscitated. There's enough integrity in the film's early going to inspire a reworking of two protagonists. I think the trick is to avoid at all costs stereotyping cynicism canned emotions and manipulative plot turns.First Antoine is singular original and he must stay in character. He is not some freak of nature who needs a Hollywood recast. There are shy and introverted men who often in their twenties will experience a breakup maybe from their first real love. A male of this mode may weather the storm but gradually his conviction grows that the initial lover was both rarer than what he imagined and possibly even irreplaceable. He may soon become convinced that he blew his one true chance at love. So his affective love gradually shifts back in her direction displacing thoughts of a new relationship. He may resurrect her photos be more cognizant of her life adopt her preferences and more rarely prefer to live in more physical proximity to her.To one degree or another such a man is under the influence of a romantic ideal. He needs to experience a sense of love so he returns to the woman who compelled his passion. He realizes that while remarriage is a mere dream her palpable presence gives pique to his life. He also understands that any obtrusion into her life would run counter to this new realization. It's not that she's an angel but rather that love put on hold or bracketed never really stops.In Changing Times a trite title Antoine initially appears to be this identical romantic lover. He's very singular and the not in the least unconvincing. His face is compelling as is the complexity of his thoughts the certainty of his emotions. He elicits interestthere is something of us in him something in him we can learn from something perhaps instructive in his loneliness. We sense that if he is to actually meet with this woman of his it will have to be by accident. I mean like why after thirty years of steady love would he suddenly thrust himself on a married woman? As to Cecile she too belongs here as the kind of woman who might inspire such memory and lasting love. Although in many ways typically middle class she projects an independence a worldweary sophistication and a realistic sense of her position in life. She hosts a radio show exercise authority over others and is selfdirected. She is no dreamer no romantic she grasps what a cad her younger husband is and deals with him as it suits her. When she meets Antoine she unhesitatingly sets her boundaries defuses his interest and projects him as a detail in a busy life.The movie's premise works. But the unfolding fails. It's as if these grownups morph into adolescents. Antoine slithers out of character as if he's suddenly aware of maleness and is amazed by it. He doesn't exactly stalk Cecile but his actions and words suggest that continuum. Now his mix of shy and bold seem like a sneaky maneuver and he can't seem to get enough of himself. In a tetea tete with Cecile's hunky husband he admits to having many affairs but of being only impersonally present in them. And as he takes on a more aggressive approach to this man's wife his singular anonymous lover image is certainly tarnished. And thus it is that he resorts to direct confrontation high drama and on shy naive guises to effectuate his tricks which serve both to ingratiate himself with Cecile and to insinuate himself into her life. And with the help of convenient plot accidents his assumption of access to his exlover is achieved in a manner hardly different than that of any other drippy dude.If his role is abandoned by Techine so too is Cecile's autonomy. She becomes the personification of access. There is no comedy here not initially and not now. When interrupted by a hapless Antoine during a radio broadcast her rage is over the topwhich in turn sets her up for an equally over the top contriteness. Which shatters her independence. And seems to rob her of her volition. Thus she becomes for Antoine a sex therapy operativeone that requires no desire will or suggestion on his part. And of course after his mud accident Cecile is then cast as a kind of madonna nurse and is returned to familial motherhood.So thanks to Techine's cop out direction and imagination breakdown two original and interesting characters who promises much in the way of subtle drama and character development are sacrificed. The unknown becomes the known. Antoine becomes everyman and Cecile is reduced to a mother and a mistress.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andre Techine's film LES TEMPS QUI CHANGENT CHANGING TIMES has been marketed as a romantic comedy that brings Gerard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve together again. He plays an architect who travels to Tangier for an assignment. It so happens that Deneuve who plays the woman with whom he had an affair with 30 years prior lives there with her husband and hosts a radio show. When they meet she's not exactly happy to cross paths  if anything this is something that progressively upsets her. Adding to this the appearance of subplots that are occurring around Deneuve's life her son Sami Malik Zidi shows up with his Moroccan wife Nadia Lubna Azabal. She has a sister Aicha also Lubna Azabal who wants nothing to do with her. Sami is also carrying on unbeknown to Nadia with a young Moroccan man. And Deneuve's husband has proclaimed he believes in variety instead of monogamy.Here is where CHANGING TIMES fails too many subplots detract from the main idea of the romance that would carry itself throughout the movie. None of these stories have anything to do with Deneuve and Depardieu other than provide filler and a forced third act where Depardieu gets caught in a construction accident foreshadowed in the beginning the movie is mainly an extended flashback leading to this crucial moment is only an excuse to get Deneuve to step down from her temple of frigidity and become a human being. Now if Depardieu had not acted in such a way that would seem increasingly creepy instead of endearing there would be a reason to expect some form of romantic resolution to this. Deneuve's ultimate resolve once it comes is so completely out of character like the short wig she is wearing at the end that it denies everything that has up to then been an okay drama and robs the movie of its credibility.CHANGING TIMES is something of a misguided misdirected mess that has some good moments and an intriguing premise but would have fared better had it not been sold as a romantic comedy. It's worth seeing if for its two leads but other than that it's rather forgettable.".

What I did know was that Terence Hill and Ernest Borgnine made for a lot of laughs. The film was never meant to be taken seriously. That should be obvious from the title alone. It's a parody. It's slapstick. It's fun.If you're not into that sort of thing you probably won't like the film. Of course if you're not into that sort of thing I don't know why you'd be watching a film called Super Fuzz to begin with.

I remember playing Super Fuzz myself and running around the house until I saw the color red  then I'd slow down and fall to the ground or take a dive into our big couch.

Now in my late 20s my opinion has softened. I even enjoy this film now. The super super early 80's synthesized voices in the background are hokey and fun. The plot is light enjoyable and not that important. They don't make 'em like this anymore and you ought to know that going in. A child today seeing this may scoff at the special effects. Effects? I think it was all just camera tricks. I'm not sure how to rate this one from 1 to 10. I'm not even sure if some of the scenes I laugh at were intended to be funny in a tongueincheek sort of way or not. Like the clothing of three thugs.

	schema:reviewBody "Well this film may not have won any Oscars or been top of the line in continuity but it is a good time. I remember this flick from my childhood watching HBO. Perhaps it is why I have an affinity for becoming a retiree in Miami one day to watch Rosie LaBouche in action. I digress but this in a fun movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. Officer Dave Speed is one of those people that you can't help but love due to his mild mannered nature. This trait directly contributes to the contrast between he and Sgt Willie Dunlop who is impatient cynical and hot headed. After Dave has experienced bomb testing in a Native American dwelling in Creektown he has the powers more or less of Superman with his Kryptonite being the color red. It's dated which makes it so fun to watch and gives us great character names like Torpedo and Paradise.

	onyx:emotionText "Well this film may not have won any Oscars or been top of the line in continuity but it is a good time. I remember this flick from my childhood watching HBO. Perhaps it is why I have an affinity for becoming a retiree in Miami one day to watch Rosie LaBouche in action. I digress but this in a fun movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. Officer Dave Speed is one of those people that you can't help but love due to his mild mannered nature. This trait directly contributes to the contrast between he and Sgt Willie Dunlop who is impatient cynical and hot headed. After Dave has experienced bomb testing in a Native American dwelling in Creektown he has the powers more or less of Superman with his Kryptonite being the color red. It's dated which makes it so fun to watch and gives us great character names like Torpedo and Paradise.

Mitchum of course was well used to playing heros faced with abnormal feminine psychology. He faces similar femme fatales in Preminger's 'Angel Face' for instance and in Farrow's 'Where Danger Lives'  all made at around the same time end 40's start of 50's. This may reflect something of the obsession that Hollywood had with cod Freudianism just as much as noir convention but there is no doubting that Mitchum's peculiar manner as an actor his doeeyed sleepwalking acting style made his starring excursions into the dangers of the subconscious peculiarly effective.Brahm one of Hollywoods most neglected directors at least for the work that he did at this time in his career makes the somewhat over stretched structure of the film work pun intended like a dream. Nancy's final walk to the altar immediately before her mental and psychic collapse although necessarily melodramatic is very effective version of a personal calvary and she seems stunned and trance like. In retrospect of course it is easy to see how the whole of the preceding film has been leading up to this sequence just as how the flashback structure of the film reminds one in passing of 'Citizen Kane' but the sound and vision montage is still powerful.By setting the bulk of the film in flashback Brahm places it in the past  or more precisely in the imaginatively reconstructed past and it is this dreamsense that retains a powerful grip on the viewer as events unfold. This almost hallucinatory sense together with a feeling of 'drifting with fate' marks out some of the greatest noirs and Bmysteries made at this time and is what makes this film still very watchable today.A 'Locket' well worth looking into.".

	schema:headline " Interestingly different film that comes together despite a risky flashbackwithinaflashback structure";
	schema:reviewBody "Just before his wedding to the beautiful and carefree Nancy John Willis is visited by Doctor Harry Blair who informs him that he knows the real Nancy and warns the doctor not to make the same mistake as him by marrying her. He tells her the story of how he had just married Nancy when a man called Clyde turned up in his office and told him a story about how he had met Nancy and had got drawn into her world of deception.Shunning conventional structure is always a risk and in this film it is one that it takes as we have a story being told by Blair that is basically about him being told a story by Clyde. This makes for an interesting approach especially since the stories are both told by her dumped lovers. In this regard we're not sure what is true and what isn't and while the stories engage on one level I was conscious of the fact that they were telling and not necessarily facts a trick Usual Suspects would later repeat to great praise. Existing within the minds of the characters the story is interesting and is all the better at the end for it. For many viewers the storytelling approach will be a little slow and I times it did drag a bit but mostly it comes together and works as something different and interesting.The cast are roundly good although they take second fiddle to the script and the ideas of director Brahm who produces some clever ideas in Nancy's bridal march. Aherne is a bit too stiff in the role where really I wanted him to display a bit more range. Mitchum is good in his role but it wasn't the sort of thing I was used to seeing him in and he has been much better elsewhere. Day takes the main role of Nancy and does well with it  she is part of the reason we're not sure what is true and what isn't and she convinced me that she didn't know either. She has plenty of nice touches as well as one or two very strong moments. Like I said though this wasn't a great actors film but nobody was less than good.Overall this is an interesting and different film that takes a risk by stepping back to flashback within flashback but mostly pulls it off. The story format might be a little testing on the patience hearing about something implies a lack of action in the time where we are  after all the audience spent the film in the Willis study but the material is worth it and once back in the present everything comes together nicely.

	onyx:emotionText "Just before his wedding to the beautiful and carefree Nancy John Willis is visited by Doctor Harry Blair who informs him that he knows the real Nancy and warns the doctor not to make the same mistake as him by marrying her. He tells her the story of how he had just married Nancy when a man called Clyde turned up in his office and told him a story about how he had met Nancy and had got drawn into her world of deception.Shunning conventional structure is always a risk and in this film it is one that it takes as we have a story being told by Blair that is basically about him being told a story by Clyde. This makes for an interesting approach especially since the stories are both told by her dumped lovers. In this regard we're not sure what is true and what isn't and while the stories engage on one level I was conscious of the fact that they were telling and not necessarily facts a trick Usual Suspects would later repeat to great praise. Existing within the minds of the characters the story is interesting and is all the better at the end for it. For many viewers the storytelling approach will be a little slow and I times it did drag a bit but mostly it comes together and works as something different and interesting.The cast are roundly good although they take second fiddle to the script and the ideas of director Brahm who produces some clever ideas in Nancy's bridal march. Aherne is a bit too stiff in the role where really I wanted him to display a bit more range. Mitchum is good in his role but it wasn't the sort of thing I was used to seeing him in and he has been much better elsewhere. Day takes the main role of Nancy and does well with it  she is part of the reason we're not sure what is true and what isn't and she convinced me that she didn't know either. She has plenty of nice touches as well as one or two very strong moments. Like I said though this wasn't a great actors film but nobody was less than good.Overall this is an interesting and different film that takes a risk by stepping back to flashback within flashback but mostly pulls it off. The story format might be a little testing on the patience hearing about something implies a lack of action in the time where we are  after all the audience spent the film in the Willis study but the material is worth it and once back in the present everything comes together nicely. Worth seeing for being a different style of drama from the period.";

	schema:reviewBody "Made in the stark film noir style that was popular for crime dramas in the forties and fifties The Locket deals with a similar theme to Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie that of a beautiful but psychologically disturbed young woman whose disturbance manifests itself as kleptomania an uncontrollable impulse to steal. The main character Nancy Monks is a workingclass girl who as a child was wrongly accused by her mother's wealthy employer of stealing a valuable locket and harshly beaten. The memory of this injustice has scarred Nancy ever since and in adult life she tries to revenge herself on the world by stealing jewellery. Her compulsion to steal wrecks first her relationship with Norman Clyde a young artist and then her marriage to Harry Blair a psychiatrist. Nancy's crimes may indeed go beyond mere theft there is a suggestion that she may have committed a murder in the course of one robbery a murder for which an innocent man suffers the death penalty. His feelings of guilt about his role in this affair drive Clyde to suicide.Much of the comment on this film has centred on its unusually baroque structure complex even by today's standards and even more so by those of the forties. It has been described as a flashback within a flashback within a flashback. The main action takes place on the morning of Nancy's second wedding. The story of her marriage to Blair is told in the first flashback which contains a second flashback telling Clyde's story as told to Blair which in turn contains a flashback narrating the story of her childhood. Despite this intricate construction however the plot line is never difficult to follow.The film's links to Hitchcock's works go beyond a thematic resemblance to Marnie. The set used for the house of Nancy's mother's employer is the same one used for the house of Alex Sebastian in Notorious in both cases it serves to suggest opulent wealth combined with coldness. More importantly the filmmakers clearly shared the fascination with psychology that was obvious in such Hitchcock films as Spellbound or Psycho. Such a fascination particularly with the theories of Freud was in fact quite common in the cinema around this period although these theories were often somewhat bowdlerised. The censors were clearly uncomfortable with Freud's insistence on the particular importance of sexual experiences in influencing the human psyche. I was interested to read the comments of the reviewer who pointed out the use of the locket of the title as a symbol of repressed memory.Despite these thematic links it is not really accurate to describe the film as minor league Hitchcock as one reviewer did. I have not seen any of John Brahm's other films but The Locket is the work of a majorleague player. It is not a suspense film in the normal Hitchcock style but rather a melodrama. Brahm is able to get good performances out of his actors particularly from Robert Mitchum as Clyde and Laraine Day an actress with whom I was not previously familiar as Nancy. The melodramatic style requires a nonnaturalistic heightening of emotion in some films this might have come across as overacting but here it is quite deliberate done for increased dramatic effect and in line with the dark neoGothic tone of the film. This is not a wellknown film today but I was lucky enough to catch it when it was recently shown on British television and was not disappointed. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Freudian theories and psychoanalysis were topics which generated widespread interest and discussion in the 1940s and psychodramas such as The Locket tapped into the public's preoccupation with these matters.The Locket is a criminally underrated movie which depicts absolute evil masquerading as normality and in so doing creates tremendous suspense and intrigue throughout. The story's central character is a femme fatale who is a kleptomaniac an habitual liar and someone whose actions lead to the deaths of three men and the mental breakdown of another. Interestingly because the psychosis which is at the root of her behaviour was triggered by an act which was both cruel and unjust the audience is led to view her actions with greater ambivalence than would otherwise be the case. Similarly though not necessarily for the same reason the three men in her life are also reluctant to believe the extent of her wickedness and try valiantly to either protect her or to rationalise her actions.An immensely enjoyable feature of the movie is its structure which utilises a triple flashback technique i.e. a flashback within a flashback within a flashback at the same time as it incorporates a circular one which links the story's oldest chronological sequence with the film's final sequence of events. The flashbacks which effectively plumb down to a previously unchartered third level are handled with such proficiency that the technique never causes any confusion and in fact seems to be a perfectly natural way of recounting the events involved. The circular element of the structure also expertly brings a satisfying symmetry to the whole entity.Nancy Laraine Day is a young woman who as a ten year old had an experience which left an indelible mark on her. Her mother's employer Mrs Willis Katherine Emery forcibly made her confess to stealing a locket which she hadn't stolen and as a result her mother lost her job. Some years later Nancy worked as a secretary for a millionaire businessman and also had a relationship with a struggling portrait painter. The painter was Norman Clyde Robert Mitchum a difficult and moody person but one who she encouraged to accept the patronage of her boss Andrew Bonner Ricardo Cortez. The couple attended two parties at the Bonner house and on both occasions jewellery was stolen and during the second party Mr Bonner was shot and killed. The valet at the house was arrested for the murder and after being found guilty was sentenced to death. After this Nancy decided to move to Florida where she met and subsequently married a psychiatrist called Dr Harry Blair Brian Aherne.Shortly after Dr Blair established a practise in New York he was visited by Norman Clyde who told him that an innocent man was due to be executed and Nancy could prevent this from happening if she would admit that she was responsible for Bonner's death. Blair wasn't prepared to believe Clyde's accusations and invited him to his house that evening to meet his wife and discuss the matter. That evening Nnacy denied all the accusations and soon after the execution went ahead. Clyde was tormented by his inability to prevent the innocent man's execution and committed suicide by jumping out of one of the windows at Dr Blair's office. Following this incident the Blairs decided to move to England where a series of events culminated in the couple divorcing and Dr Blair suffering a mental breakdown after recognising his wife's true nature.After having recovered and returned to the United States Dr Blair discovered that Nancy was due to get married to a millionaire called John Willis Gene Raymond and on the day of the wedding before the ceremony took place he met Willis and told him everything he knew about the woman that Willis was due to marry. What subsequently happened led to some totally devastating consequences after ironically the locket which had been taken from Nancy so many years before was given back to her.One of the movie's greatest assets is the cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca which is excellent throughout but is especially effective in the darkly lit scenes in Clyde's studio and in the restaurant where he meets Nancy and also when Clyde's face symbolically darkens as he starts to tell Dr Blair the story of his experiences with Nancy. The action moves at an exhilarating pace which is generated both by the speed with which information is revealed and also by the extra interest which is sparked as each new revelation is made.Laraine Day's character is seen by most of those around her as being enchanting and perfect and she conveys these qualities very successfully at the same time as also displaying her character's immense talent at being very convincing whilst lying outrageously. Robert Mitchum is also particularly good as the brash recalcitrant and extremely confrontational Clyde.".

	schema:reviewBody "I give full credit to this little treat for introducing me to the world of noir cinema when I happened to stumble onto it on AMC. Oh that AMC showed films of this caliber lately! Laraine Day gives a beautifully understated performance handling what would now perhaps be called a tragic case of posttraumatic stress disorder resulting in a life of  twists and turns with truth no scenery chewing. Brian Aherne strikes just the right clinical note as the sadderbutwiser exhusband and Robert Mitchum gives a memorable performance as the first at least the first chronicled in this tale man to fall victim to Nancy's fatal charms. As Norman he certainly delivers a farewell present to Nancy's physician spouse and by extension to Nancy that they won't soon forget.

	onyx:emotionText "I give full credit to this little treat for introducing me to the world of noir cinema when I happened to stumble onto it on AMC. Oh that AMC showed films of this caliber lately! Laraine Day gives a beautifully understated performance handling what would now perhaps be called a tragic case of posttraumatic stress disorder resulting in a life of  twists and turns with truth no scenery chewing. Brian Aherne strikes just the right clinical note as the sadderbutwiser exhusband and Robert Mitchum gives a memorable performance as the first at least the first chronicled in this tale man to fall victim to Nancy's fatal charms. As Norman he certainly delivers a farewell present to Nancy's physician spouse and by extension to Nancy that they won't soon forget. The denouement at the mansion while wedding guests await fair Nancy is gripping cinema. Watch for a great performance by the mother of Joan Fontaine and Olivia Dehaviland as the cruel woman responsible for Nancy's childhood trauma. Worth the while!";

I had never seen and barely heard of Laraine Day I think she was in a Hitchcock and she's very appealing.  She's kind of a cross between Linda Darnell and Vera Miles if you can picture that and doesn't give the slightest hint that's out of her mind. She doesn't play 'crazy' which helps the movie because it leaves you room to doubt her OR everyone else in the movie.The end is a shame cause its over the top but I still enjoyed this and would recommend it to anyone.  710.".

	schema:reviewBody "The flashback has always been an essential part of the film noir formula. By showing events from the perspective of one who already knows the ultimate outcome of his mistakes the audience is placed in a position of nearcomplete omniscience. Since we already know the outcome but are powerless to change it the story structure encourages an overriding element of fate. The hero is doomed  he knows it now but didn't know it then. Is this the lingering disillusion left over from WWII? Where once a nation had marched proudly and patriotically into combat it now recognised the pure folly of its enthusiasm. John Brahm's 'The Locket 1946' certainly boasts one of cinema's most audacious uses of the flashback narrative device effectively utilising a flashback within a flashback within a flashback to tell a complex story in which three different protagonists find their lives ruined by the derangement of a single woman. This femme fatale doesn't mess around when it comes to potential husbands and her victims  besotted lovers who are left helpless by a pretty face  are only too happy to be exploited.John Willis Gene Raymond is about to marry Nancy Laraine Day the most charming intelligent and beautiful woman he's ever met. Just hours before the wedding ceremony he is confronted by Nancy's former husband Dr Harry Blair Brian Aherne who pleads with him not to marry her having experienced firsthand the pain of Nancy's betrayal. Just years earlier Blair himself was a smitten newlywed and he too was confronted by one of his wife's former lovers Robert Mitchum who expressed the belief that Nancy was guilty of murder a crime for she allowed an innocent man to be executed. The nature of her behaviour lies in a troublesome childhood that encouraged kleptomanic tendencies. The true beauty of this flashback technique is that the audience is treated to nothing but hearsay and that each of these characters could just as easily be lying. Though 'The Locket' appears to treat its flashbacks with sincerity Alfred Hitchcock exploited this practice just a few years later in 'Stage Fright 1950' as did Bryan Singer long afterwards with 'The Usual Suspects 1995.'Laraine Day certainly not an actress I'd associated with any sort of villainy brilliantly utilises her innocent screen persona to paradoxically portray one of film noir's shiftiest femme fatales. Until the overly melodramatic ending Nancy doesn't betray even a hint of malevolence. When Dr Blair first mentions Norman Clyde's name she doesn't flinch not even a momentary doubletake that would have revealed the malice within. Is Nancy a guiltless victim being slandered by jilted former lovers or is she everything they describe and more? The most frightening revelation is that for most of the film we can't even tell the difference. Despite its excellent strengths 'The Locket' unfortunately suffers from an obligatory ending in which the villainess receives her due and I would have preferred a more understated approach. Perhaps as she walks down the wedding aisle Nancy could be perpetually tormented by the ringing melody of the broken music box a symbol of her lifelong guilt. Or maybe  Hays forbid  she could have gotten away with everything her next sucker already waiting at the altar.".

Mitchum one of the least likely candidates for suicide in his generation of actors here gives no indication that his psyche is so fragile that he will take such a drastic and final step. Almost the last thing he said was 'my conscience is clear' and he left Brian Ahearne's office as strong and welladjusted as ever only to jump out of a window. Hilarious. Much has been made on this board of the flashbackwithinflashbackwithinflashback but not one of the posters I read about 12 found anything but praise for this ludicrous situation in which someone 'remembers' an incident for which heshe was not present. For a flashback to have verisimilitude it must confine itself to what the narrator actually SAW andor EXPERIENCED. For example if the narrator says something like ...'I met X for the first time in the automat. It was March ...' and we then DISSOLVE and witness the meeting via a flashback it is imperative that we remain WITH the narrator at all times. If after meeting X in the automat they go their separate ways and WE follow X and NOT the narrator we are immediately cheating because neither WE nor the NARRATOR can KNOW for sure what X DID after leaving the automat. And that's only one of the problems with a SINGLE flashback. Here we have Brian Ahearne warning Gene Raymond not to go ahead with his marriage to Larraine Day and supporting this by narrating how HE Ahearne met Day flashback 1 in turn he relates how Mitchum came to see HIM Ahearne with the news that Ahearne's wife Day was a murderess and was prepared to let an innocent man be executed in her place. This triggers flashback 2 so now he have Mitchum flashing back WITHIN Ahearne's own flashback and thus telling Ahearne things that Ahearne could not possibly recall in his OWN Master flashback to Raymond which is still of course in progress. In turn Mitchum is privy to Day's story of her childhood with is flashback 3 in which Day relates incidents which Mitchum could not know about much less Ahearne. Even within their own flashbacks the subjects are prone to leave the scene and allow us to follow third parties. The result is we have to suspend an awful lot of disbelief. As an experiment it is interesting but that's about all.".

	schema:headline " tour de force for Laraine Day!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Who would have thought Laraine Day could have played a psychologically disturbed young woman. She spent most of her career playing sweet young things. In And One Was Beautiful she played a pretty tomboy not the beautiful one!! who was around at the end to pick up the pieces. Of course her most famous role was Nurse Molly Lamont in the MGM series Dr. Kildare. So she wasn't used to roles that required her to be bad let alone unbalanced.From the world of Art to World War 11 England to a high society wedding  this psychological noir has it all. John Willis Gene Raymond is to be married to Nancy Laraine Day that day when Dr. Blair Brian Aherne visits and tells him a strange story. He had been married to Nancy during a whirl wind courtship. He in turn is visited by Norman Clyde Robert Mitchum who also has a strange tale. He is looking for Nancy who can help a friend of his who is in Sing Sing on a charge of murder!!! Norman had met Nancy at his art class a few years previously. She introduces him to her boss millionaire art critic Mr. Bonner Ricardo Cortez and after an exhibition Norman's reputation is made. During a party a bracelet goes missing. Norman then finds it in Nancy's bag. Nancy is not at all sorry at what has happened and in turn tells Norman what happened to her as a child.Sharyn Moffatt was a terrific child actress of the 40s. She plays Nancy as a child and is excellent in the role. As a child she was accused of stealing a locket and even though innocent of the crime was forced to confess. Norman thinks that is the root of her neurosis. Mr. Bonner is killed in mysterious circumstances and Norman finds Nancy's movements suspicious. Norman's story is finished but Dr. Blair doesn't believe him.It is not the end of the film but the ending is certainly surprising. It is a super film and I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made in 1946 The Locket is an absorbing and very enjoyable film about a woman with some sort of psychological problem that emanates from her being falsely accused of the theft of a locket when she was a child. As a result she has spent most of her adult life to date seemingly trying to get even with society generally for this erroneous slur on her character. On the day of his wedding to Nancy Patton Laraine Day wealthy socialite John Willis Gene Raymond receives a visit from a psychiatrist Dr. Blair Brian Aherne. Dr. Blair tries to warn Willis off his proposed marriage on the grounds that his bride to be has ruined the lives of a number of people. He claims that she was at one time married to him and that she has amongst other things committed theft murdered someone a crime which resulted in the execution of an innocent man and driven a previous boyfriend portrait painter Norman Clyde Robert Mitchum to suicide. Things develop from there. I'll say no more than that. The Locket is a film that requires more than the usual level of close concentration. It is complex in structure. Much of the film consists of a series of flashbacks. To make matters more complicated there are flashbacks within flashbacks and even in one instance a flashback within a flashback within a flashback! It is very well acted and the cinematography is for the most part excellent. The film has its faults. It is a little farfetched in that no explanation is offered or attempted as to why Nancy resorts to such extreme acts of revenge including murder seemingly in order to pay society back as she sees it. Indeed the whole issue of her personality disorder is dealt with very superficially. The external scenes that are set in London are unconvincing in that they give every indication that they were filmed inside a studio. And the conclusion of the film is rather too simplistic and convenient in plot terms. But somehow none of those weaknesses seems to matter all that much. The Locket is a very watchable film. 910.".

	schema:headline " A special ambiance and a special experience from Giannoli Depardieu and de France";
	schema:reviewBody "The French press has been understandably ecstatic about this film. It brings together one of the most distinguished and prolific actors in French cinema with one of its most luminous and vibrant young female talents. But this isn't just a film about stars and authenticfeeling chemistry. It's a film about character and situation. First and foremost it's a film about dance halls and the singers who work in them. Grard Depardieu is the aging almost overthehill Alain Moreau Alain Moreau et son Orchestre. Ccile de France is Marion a fragile young woman tough and beautiful on the outside but inside rather shattered in a new place Clermont Ferrand in a new job selling real estate with her young son she doesn't get to spend much time with.Marion meets Alain when her new boss Bruno Matthieu Amalric takes her to a dance hall where the singer is performing. Used to women who swoon over him Alain comes on strong to Marion  but with an edge of reserve and timidity  and she resists but spends a night with him. Then she resists again and he pursues. Hunting for a house with her as his agent Alain continues to see Marion and to woo her. She continues to resist  and to be charmed to laugh with him to find in him something she's never seen in a man before. She's outwardly brilliant and hard but she has horrible phone conversations with her ex and bad encounters with her little boy and alone in her hotel room she dissolves into tears. He's out of style and overweight with his little Seventies pocketbook and his leather jacket and his dyed hair with highlights and she calls him names like Ladies Man and Mr. Corny Loser. But beyond that he's a life force and for now at least he's filling a large space in Marion's world. She goes away for a while he loses his voice for a while their househunting stops and starts Bruno makes passes at Marion but she and Alain still continue to connect on some special emotional level and when they part after a stadium concert he walks out on they're both been changed by their time together and are ready in their different ways in their different places for new beginnings.The film's most prominent element is character. It lets us get the feel of what it's like to be in Alain's and Marion's skin. But an equally important element is ambiance the music and the place which go together Giannoli's warm acceptance of the provincial world of Clermont Ferrand is in harmony with the seriousness with which Alain and the film itself take the sometimes corny sometimes subtly poetic chansons that it's Alain's life's work to deliver to make people dance. The Singer keeps coming back to Alain's world his faithful wifemanager Michle Christine Citti to his struggle to survive and maintain his dignity his respect for the songs. When he sings a love song it has to be real he has to mean it he must sing it for himself. If you open yourself to the film's bittersweet mood and it works for you you will also open yourself to the songs and welcome them into your heart.The Singer is a film that breathes. Its beauty is that it has no easy tragedies or easy resolutions that things are almost as uncertain between Alain and Marion at the end as they were that first night when she sat in front of him blonde and bright like a diamond in a red dress. Giannoli is a young director who works with independence and drive. His Les corps impatients was a distinctive and risktaking film but this one is a leap forward beyond passion and conviction to larger conception deeper commitment and broader communication. This time Giannoli's done something that can reach a lot of people. Depardieu does his own singing and his performance as Alain Moreau is one of the best things he's done in a long time  at least over a decade  and a great thing it is. This was a magnificent opportunity for Ccile de France and she's met it with her best and richest performance to date. It's a tribute to both actors work in The Singer that you find it hard to separate either them from their characters. The film ends with a song Quand j'tais chanteur when I was a singer. Je m'clatais comme une bte quand j'tais chanteur I had a hell of a good time when I was a singer. The Singer is one of those films that isn't putting on a show for you it's inviting you to come in and hang around a while.".

If you open yourself to the film's bittersweet mood and it works for you you will also open yourself to the songs and welcome them into your heart.The Singer is a film that breathes. Its beauty is that it has no easy tragedies or easy resolutions that things are almost as uncertain between Alain and Marion at the end as they were that first night when she sat in front of him blonde and bright like a diamond in a red dress. Giannoli is a young director who works with independence and drive. His Les corps impatients was a distinctive and risktaking film but this one is a leap forward beyond passion and conviction to larger conception deeper commitment and broader communication. This time Giannoli's done something that can reach a lot of people. Depardieu does his own singing and his performance as Alain Moreau is one of the best things he's done in a long time  at least over a decade  and a great thing it is. This was a magnificent opportunity for Ccile de France and she's met it with her best and richest performance to date. It's a tribute to both actors work in The Singer that you find it hard to separate either them from their characters. The film ends with a song Quand j'tais chanteur when I was a singer. Je m'clatais comme une bte quand j'tais chanteur I had a hell of a good time when I was a singer. The Singer is one of those films that isn't putting on a show for you it's inviting you to come in and hang around a while.";

Alain has a crush on Marion and seeks her out in her office telling that he wants to buy a house. Alain finds that she has a son and the distant Marion gets closer to Alain but the unrequited love drags him down.Quand j'tais Chanteur is a weird and messy romance. Grard Depardieu and his character Alain Moreau are totally out of the league of the gorgeous Ccile De France and they do not have any chemistry along the whole story. The tacky songs of the movie are recommended for very specific audiences where I do not include myself therefore it is hard and boring to see Grard Depardieu singing those songs. The footage of Stromboli 1950 is totally out of the context and last but not the least the resemblance of Ccile De France with Patricia Arquette is amazing. My vote is five.Title Brazil Quando Estou Amando When I am in Love".

Alain finds that she has a son and the distant Marion gets closer to Alain but the unrequited love drags him down.Quand j'tais Chanteur is a weird and messy romance. Grard Depardieu and his character Alain Moreau are totally out of the league of the gorgeous Ccile De France and they do not have any chemistry along the whole story. The tacky songs of the movie are recommended for very specific audiences where I do not include myself therefore it is hard and boring to see Grard Depardieu singing those songs. The footage of Stromboli 1950 is totally out of the context and last but not the least the resemblance of Ccile De France with Patricia Arquette is amazing. My vote is five.Title Brazil Quando Estou Amando When I am in Love";

Like The Wrestler Giannoli's film is about a man people of a certain age within the film's universe would no doubt look back on with fondness when thinking back to specific people within the annuls of a very specific rather popular medium that of music rather than professional wrestling entertainment. It is the tale of that man much more older now at a point in which dishevelment and old age appear to have kicked in a realising of one's loneliness and one's stone cut chances passing one by. It is first and foremost a love story a fascinating study of the duality that exists between the lead and another woman whom is rounded enough and suffers enough from her own problems to keep her from being a one dimensional love interest.The cut and dry figure of Grard Depardieu is that of whom embodies the lead the titular singer named Alain Moreau a man we first see occupying a small and dingy little dressing room the local establishment appear to additionally store the vacuum cleaners inside of. Outside in the main hall his portrait on a poster paints a far more positive image of him in his looking happy and holding a rose in the process as the place fills up with elderly people ready for a night of entertainment and socialising. The item of the strained differences in the man's existence as to what the public see and what's honestly lurking underneath here being the two different things which are brought to our attention. His life sees him work through the night with a band their coming to an end with the conclusion of another gig seeing Moreau leave the establishment upon payment in the morning both bleary eyed and a little shell shocked at the bright early light to an accompaniment of gentle electronic music. Moreau appears lonely he sleeps at a relatively large home by himself and lives a generally muted existence with what seems to be nothing bar a pet fawn of some kind whom totters around the house his closest form of company.The sense of life generally passing Moreau by is highlighted by way of a number of amusing quips to do with the distinction between young and old the then and now the modern and the classical. The item of 'older' people attending his shows is verbally illustrated by a character whom deems his audience members too old for nightclubs and so they attend Moreau's shows whereas Moreau's own views on the contemporary item of karaoke and the ability for any swingingguy to have a bash at singing up on a stage however badly is dismissed. The greater extent of this particular statement enabling us to draw on comparisons to similar contemporary opinions extended to other art forms and mediums namely television and cinema in the form of the rise of more online based opinions which hardened academics often state are trivialising forms of journalism if they aren't already destroying it.Through an old friend named Bruno played by the ever dependable Mathieu Amalric somuchso that he just appears to blend into proceedings who used to be a bit of a gambler and now owns an estate agency Moreau meets Marion De France a divorced woman who's dishevelment and downbeat nature matches that of our lead's and whom works with Bruno at the company. The subject matter and material the film eventually comes to cover is handled in a methodical and mature manner by director also the writer Giannoli. Moreau's organising of house visits purely to see her and the manner in which he keeps coming back neither as lecherous nor as misjudged as it might have been following the early spending of a night together. Principally the two of them are linked more intrinsically by way of the nature of their jobs Moreau the singer on stage at a designated place so as to guide customers through their nights out involving drinking and socialism as Moreau himself verbally identifies that they come here to drink champagne that's all. In regards to Marion's role her turning up to another designated establishment so as to show potential customers around a home they might buy bring to attention the fact that both people are present in their jobs but not crucial they add a dimension to an experience but appear largely unnecessary to proceedings as the greater extent of the trip unfolds around them.The character is explored in a fashion that sees come across as so much more than a mere photogenic supporting act whom cannot get a man despite these qualities and must act purely as the subject of another man's attraction. Their coming together is well observed and nicely unfolded complications linked to Marion's own life situations involving grief additionally given ample attention. The film as a whole cracks along at a right old pace its internal music propping everything up with a series of belting tracks which hop between fast and punchy numbers to slower more resonating ballads nicely echoing the film's own evershifting atmosphere as the lead attempts to get to know his supporting female around the ever present Bruno. Giannoli's film is a mature mediation on middle age a wonderfully involving tale of romantic affection and a well constructed study of two people at respective points in their lives.".

Alain as in 'Tous les Matins' is a musician who cares about his craft and feels under threat by changing fashions and by his own diminishing abilities. Supported by his faithful wifemanager Christine Citti he is just keeping his band scene going despite the rise of karaoke and younger smaller rockbased combos when he meets Marion Cecile de France sparky but fragile an estate agent. The aging and corpulent singer is used to having women swoon over him so he gives Marion the big treatment when her boss Matthieu Amalric brings her to the dance hall. She resists at first but spends the night before running off without stopping for coffee. Although Alain is not as sure of himself as he once was he decides to pose as a househunter so that he can get close to Marion again  barely credible as he already has a large rambling crumbling house in its own grounds with a livein goat. She disappears for a while as does his voice. Despite the stopstart relationship they continue to connect somehow and it falls into place after he decides to walk out of his chance at the Big Time in a stadium concert. There are no certainties really although they end up together and the film's strength is really in recreating the tiny provincial world where Music elevates the people to a better world for just one evening at a time. Alain in his white suit and streaked hair maintains his dignity believes in the songs he sings for his customers be they ever so corny but life is corny and Depardieu fills the skin so well. The original French title Quand J'tais Chanteur is better than the one we have here with its bittersweet overtone.

	schema:reviewBody "How to put into words a film with this sensorial density? It's clearly not the simplest task. Congratulations Christophe Honor could be a good approach maybe the best.As a Portuguese a traditional nation in the European standards I may say that this film surpasses my bounds when speaking of let's say relational experimentalism. Even so I found it astoundingly beautiful and I guess that pickingup the gay issue would be to diminish a film about life and what we make of it in our nowadays living.To have lived in France for over a year eventually helped me out to remark some interesting French particularities in the characters.I found the humor in this film to be typically French. There's a scene were Ismael is Wrapping a pillow making a baby of it asking everybody in the room to remain silent not to wake up the child that had just gotten asleep. Then unexpectedly he throws the baby right out of the window as he gets tired of the staging. This kind of uncompromising performances risking the ridiculous were undoubtedly a dj vu for me.The music is also a key element in the film and gives it a Parisian melancholical aura. The music is often used by 2 or more characters in the form of a dialog where they show their feelings and points of view. As they sing the scenes are incredible well filmed either outdoor in the endless avenues of Paris or indoor in the cosiness of a warm bed in a cold winter night. Sometimes I felt as I was one of the characters right in the scene.The anguish the indecision and above all the solitude are the marking subjects in a film that exposes in a crude manner how individualistic the society is becoming in France and why not in Europe.It's a contemporary timeless? film about human relationships. In my opinion the antithesis of the blockbuster cinema The extravagance is replaced by beauty the free nudity is replaced by sensuality and the easy laugh is avoided. The dialogs are intelligent complex and they have ambiguous interpretation.At the end of the movie a phrase synthesizes it all Love me less but for a long time.To assume the compromise revoking the emotional hurricane brought by fleeting relations will bring peace at last.".

This kind of uncompromising performances risking the ridiculous were undoubtedly a dj vu for me.The music is also a key element in the film and gives it a Parisian melancholical aura. The music is often used by 2 or more characters in the form of a dialog where they show their feelings and points of view. As they sing the scenes are incredible well filmed either outdoor in the endless avenues of Paris or indoor in the cosiness of a warm bed in a cold winter night. Sometimes I felt as I was one of the characters right in the scene.The anguish the indecision and above all the solitude are the marking subjects in a film that exposes in a crude manner how individualistic the society is becoming in France and why not in Europe.It's a contemporary timeless? film about human relationships. In my opinion the antithesis of the blockbuster cinema The extravagance is replaced by beauty the free nudity is replaced by sensuality and the easy laugh is avoided. The dialogs are intelligent complex and they have ambiguous interpretation.At the end of the movie a phrase synthesizes it all Love me less but for a long time.To assume the compromise revoking the emotional hurricane brought by fleeting relations will bring peace at last.";

	schema:reviewBody "In my part of the USA it is rare to come across a film like this. It makes no attempt to compromise its Parisian point of view for American audiences. This film allows an American audience the chance to get a glimpse from the perspective of the contemporary French young adult. There are plenty of French geographic and political reference to confuse but they like the Parisian scenes just give the film its identity.Others have provided detailed synopses of the story. I would rather you just take it as it comes and enjoy how different the plot development is. As a matter of fact watch this film and try to appreciate how different it is from the ordinary American fareno simple boy meets girl romance here. These beautiful people aren't young chic urbanites wearing designer clothes they can't afford living in apartments featured in Architectural Digest. We have three young women Ludivine Sagnier Clotilde Hesme and Chiara Mastroianni who lack the assistance of a personal shopper or a Beverly Hills stylist but do not lack beauty or sensuality. Also as a 59 year old man I have to mention Brigitte Roan who shows how attractive a French grandmother can be. The men are similarly attractive. Louis Garrel demonstrates why he is currently the hottest actor in France. Newcomer Grgoire LeprinceRinguet is disarmingly charming.But this is a musical. You will find no potential American Idols here. The actors are not going to dazzle you with vocal gymnastics. The numbers have no clever arrangements or over produced orchestration. You have evocative lyrics set to a score reminiscent of US folk music in the 1960s or more exactly French coffee houses. One word of caution the English subtitles are quite misleading at times. My college French is a little rusty but a review of the French subtitles gave me an appreciation of how descriptive the lyrics are.Finally there is no gratuitous violence or nudity but look for the number Ma Memoire Sale My Soiled Memory where Ismael begs to be cleansed of the painful memory of his lost love. Some may be shocked at the scene but you can't deny the passion and pain that permeates the number.I have downloaded the soundtrack and ordered the DVD for this is like a good French dish an experience to linger over.".

Honor's 'Inside Paris''Dans Paris' had one song written by Alex Beaupain a duet between Romain Duris and Joana Preiss sung over the phone Duris' delivery full of reedy sweetness. This time the director has fulfilled a longcherished ambition and made a fullfledged contemporary musical with all the songs penned by Beaupain. It's set in the relatively gritty Bastille section of Paris and it's about a mnage  trois involving two girls and a boy Ismael Louis Garrel Julie Ludivine Sagnier and Alice Clotilde Hesme Garrel's girlfriend in his father's 'Regular Lovers' whose life together leads to sorrow separation and resolution. Beaupain and Honor have collaborated for 'the film on 14 songs. 'Les chansons d'amour' is also the director's third collaboration with Louis Garrel though he didn't plan it that way originally and Garrel had to convince him he could do a singing role.This quick followup to 'Dans Paris' which like it but musically portrays love problems family loyalties and depression with an intermittently light New Waveish touch is divided into three sections Departure Absence and Return. Julie seems to accept Alice in the trio to please Ismael but she wants him to herself and regrets his refusal to have a child. Perhaps she's imploding because she drops dead in front of a boite like River Phoenix in front of the Viper Club but of natural causes.Alice considers it only right to move out she can't take the place of two women and her bisexuality no longer protects her from the full onslaught of Ismael's and Garrel's impetuous charms. Ismael whom Julie's family adored moves quickly if shakily forward but Julie's stagnant older sister Jeanne Mastroiaani who suffers from survivor guilt keeps turning up a little tiresomely at the trio's apartment. Alice had recently connected with another guy a Breton musician Gwendal Yannick Renier brother of Jrmie. She doesn't seem to need Gwendal any more either but Gwendal's gay brother Erwann Grgoire LeprinceRinguet of Tchin's 'Strayed' conceives a passion for Ismael and begins stalking him. Note calling Erwann a college student could mislead American readers because 'collge' generally means middle school and he's very young. When Erwann keeps turning up Alice who works at the same office as Ismael thinks this is an indirect effort on Gwendal's part to get back together. Ismael realizes what Erwann's up to though and at first laughs it off and tells him to get lost.But Ismael's lost himselfhe's halfJewish and seems to represent the wandering rootless type we never see his family or hear of his origin in any detailand though he may have the gift of good cheer he doesn't know where he's going even sexually. As the film ends he's actually settling into what's become both a romantic and a sexual affair with the determined Erwannone of those young gay boys who knows early on exactly who he is and what he wantsand begs him in the film's final line Love me less but love me a long time. Honor's collaboration on the screenplay with auteur Gael Morel may explain this highly gayfriendly resolution which will no doubt startle if not offend some members of the original Demy generation. But a mnage  trois that's not bi or gayfriendly wouldn't make much sensenot in this century which Honor whatever his virtues and faults firmly inhabits.American viewers aren't as likely to appreciate the many rhymes between French film families and traditions appreciatively noted by JeanBaptiste Morain in Les Inrockuptibles last June when this film debuted in Paris. What they may grasp and enjoy is the buoyancy and speed of Honor's filmmaking which makes a virtue of lowbudget necessity. Harder to tune in to at times is the director's cheerful way with sadness and depression to be found here as it was in 'Dans Paris.' Some of the songs may feel like wallowing in sorrow but they're better seen as singing the way out of it. Honor lets the song come to you straight without videoready production numbers or irony and the actors all do their own natural singing only occasionally with a little trouble in the lipsyncing of their prerecorded voices. The trouble is Honor doesn't seem to play very well stateside and if 'Inside Paris' got a mediocre reception the offbeat musical element may make his 'Love Songs' even less accessible to Americansthough the romance between Garrel and LeprinceRinguet should go down well with gay viewers and anyone might respond to the warm depiction of a first love. It's not that the songs are hard to take it's their typically French lightness that may make them hard to grasp in this country where people are used to being hit over the head. Likewise Louis Garrel's playfulness to which this director has given increasingly free rein can be enormously appealing if you're up for it but seems to rub some audiences especially Anglo ones the wrong way. Nonetheless as time goes on this film clearly has passionate devotees all over. Mark Olsen's remark in 'Film Comment' rings true Christophe Honor's films aren't just films you likeyou develop weird little crushes on them. The songs in the film have a rich life on YouTube and there you can see the actors and composer performing them at the Divan du Monde in Paris at a CD launching. The audience understandably walked out singing some of the lines. They grow on you.'Love Songs''Chansons d'amour' is part of the RendezVous with French Cinema series 2008 at Lincoln Center Feb. 29March 9 2008.

	schema:headline " How delightfully French  in a good way!";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember watching Bertolucci's The Dreamers and thinking How delightfully French! Whatever we might think about French hospitality or lack of it when we dine in Paris restaurants France has a cornucopia of national traits that can be a joy and inspiration to experience.The Dreamers was set against the student riots of the late 60s. Defiance. A willingness to fight for culture! Demonstrations outside cinemas to preserve true art! A gourmet attitude of tolerance in matters of sexuality admittedly eroded slightly by recent governments. A passion for life. Cigarettes. An atheistic realism. The religion of good taste. A disdain for work  to let the higher faculties soar  we believe.Against a similar if more modern background Les Chansons d'Amour also takes flight. Lifting us in its arms we have one of those rarest of creatures an exceedingly French musical. Love life poetry passion sensitivity all magnificently exalted in song  quite a lot of songs actually  for your crossChannel delectation and savouring.Les Chansons d'Amour starts off fluffily enough  Paris streets a simple boygirl relationship. But this is no prudish American musical or its furtive British variant. Before long  in a scene charmingly reminiscent of Singin' in the Rain's couch number  we realise Ismael and his girlfriend Julie are involved in a happy threesome beneath the sheets.But love cannot be superficial! We do not need the extremes of Danish cinema  this is no Dancer in the Dark. But we will have tragedy! generation class struggles! heartfelt emotion! and aesthetically intellectual challenge! If you please. And the young cast shall be terribly goodlooking without being too prettypretty. And white  one might add more cynically. But if there are unbearable tensions we shall elevate them into song. Pianos shall tinkle and guitars will strum. Tears sublimated by lovely voices as the rain falls without a care. Sexual details tastefully and unashamedly scattered through the lyrics.The whole film reeks of style within a suitably unostentatious budget. When Julie unexpectedly collapses at a rock concert imaginative cinematography intersperses black and white stills of a matteroffact ambulance crew with tunefully segued flashbacks. We try to piece together what has happened. The monochrome medical assistants have a documentarylike reality. At other times clever uses of colour tone cue the intended attitude we should take. Cold and serious blue with oldfashioned parents. Or warm and romantic reds and browns to forestall any opposition to a homoerotic flirtation All shades of sexual preference are treated with the same romantic poetry focus on the person not their gender the film seems to say. If this were a British or American production the pace would be this is what's about to happen this is what's happening now and this is what's just happened. Audiences at feelgood musicals are not known for their attention skills. Les Chansons d'Amour in sharp contrast is fastmoving and expects you to keep up. Blink and you will have missed a plot development. Are you awake at the back? Isn't cinema for adults as well? A strength of the script and the songs is that there is never any hint of caricature or parody. When they sing they mean what they say as much as if they had said it. They do not inhabit the fantasy land however wonderful of Gene Kelly dancing in puddles or Julie Andrews running up hillsides. They can get away with lines like Your body like a flow of lava washing over me and make it sound sexy and romantic.I find the end result is genuinely moving.But how will the film fare outside of its home country? The songs make you want to buy the soundtrack  if you can speak French. It is not the standard arthouse fare that lovers of subtitled films make into a cinematic diet. Les Chansons d'Amour is unashamedly commercial. But I just wish there were more 'commercial' films like this.".

A gourmet attitude of tolerance in matters of sexuality admittedly eroded slightly by recent governments. A passion for life. Cigarettes. An atheistic realism. The religion of good taste. A disdain for work  to let the higher faculties soar  we believe.Against a similar if more modern background Les Chansons d'Amour also takes flight. Lifting us in its arms we have one of those rarest of creatures an exceedingly French musical. Love life poetry passion sensitivity all magnificently exalted in song  quite a lot of songs actually  for your crossChannel delectation and savouring.Les Chansons d'Amour starts off fluffily enough  Paris streets a simple boygirl relationship. But this is no prudish American musical or its furtive British variant. Before long  in a scene charmingly reminiscent of Singin' in the Rain's couch number  we realise Ismael and his girlfriend Julie are involved in a happy threesome beneath the sheets.But love cannot be superficial! We do not need the extremes of Danish cinema  this is no Dancer in the Dark. But we will have tragedy! generation class struggles! heartfelt emotion! and aesthetically intellectual challenge! If you please. And the young cast shall be terribly goodlooking without being too prettypretty. And white  one might add more cynically. But if there are unbearable tensions we shall elevate them into song. Pianos shall tinkle and guitars will strum. Tears sublimated by lovely voices as the rain falls without a care. Sexual details tastefully and unashamedly scattered through the lyrics.The whole film reeks of style within a suitably unostentatious budget. When Julie unexpectedly collapses at a rock concert imaginative cinematography intersperses black and white stills of a matteroffact ambulance crew with tunefully segued flashbacks. We try to piece together what has happened. The monochrome medical assistants have a documentarylike reality. At other times clever uses of colour tone cue the intended attitude we should take. Cold and serious blue with oldfashioned parents. Or warm and romantic reds and browns to forestall any opposition to a homoerotic flirtation All shades of sexual preference are treated with the same romantic poetry focus on the person not their gender the film seems to say. If this were a British or American production the pace would be this is what's about to happen this is what's happening now and this is what's just happened. Audiences at feelgood musicals are not known for their attention skills. Les Chansons d'Amour in sharp contrast is fastmoving and expects you to keep up. Blink and you will have missed a plot development. Are you awake at the back? Isn't cinema for adults as well? A strength of the script and the songs is that there is never any hint of caricature or parody. When they sing they mean what they say as much as if they had said it. They do not inhabit the fantasy land however wonderful of Gene Kelly dancing in puddles or Julie Andrews running up hillsides. They can get away with lines like Your body like a flow of lava washing over me and make it sound sexy and romantic.I find the end result is genuinely moving.But how will the film fare outside of its home country? The songs make you want to buy the soundtrack  if you can speak French. It is not the standard arthouse fare that lovers of subtitled films make into a cinematic diet. Les Chansons d'Amour is unashamedly commercial. But I just wish there were more 'commercial' films like this.";

This instantly explains the poor distribution of the film above all in the US which other reviewers seem to find baffling. Well it's not perplexing at all the prevailing judgment in the film distribution world in the United States is that anything containing male homosexuality is box office poison offensive to Christians etc. In fact the IsmaelErwann romance the new love which resolves the protagonist's lost love is strikingly inconspicuous in all the promotional material associated with Les Chansons  posters images cast list Grgoire LeprinceRinguet who plays Erwann is completely sidelined though his character is as important as Ludivine Sagnier's. But clearly hiding Erwann and the gay theme from view didn't help Les Chansons had to be hidden from the viewers altogether. It's nothing new where male gay content is concerned. As we know getting Brokeback Mountain made and distributed was a long wearying obstacleridden business and the film was deliberately snubbed at the Oscars. Similar difficulties attend every other film in which there is any representation of gay men doing what they do  i.e. making love to other men. In Les Chansons the problem is all the more acute because one of the men doesn't seem to be gay at all ... so it appears that he chooses homosexual love.And this is one of the elements which make Les Chanson unique  it's unusual to say the least to encounter the implicit suggestion that a male character with heterosexual experience documented in the film might opt in favour of gay love. The two men in question also constitute an original even startling combination  just as distinctive and unforgettable as the two lovers in Brokeback.This is a beautiful and outstanding film so it is good to see that 19 of the 24 reviews here before mine say that. But it's disturbing that even here on IMDb all 5 negative reviews below focus their disdain and hostility on the gay content. One reviewer details his loathing dismissing all the rest of us who like the film as gay another calls the film too gay another attacks the sleaze and downmarket sex. There are even a few positive reviews here which go all nervous and jittery about the IsmaelErwann romance. Hmmmmmmm! This is the 21st century.Otherwise Les Chansons is remarkable for its vision of Paris especially the streets of Paris and of course for ... les chansons. It is a most intriguing offbeat form of musical  the way in which the actors utter their songs is very different from conventional singing to such a degree that one has to pay attention to note that they really ARE singing. But it is in fact real singing and these are real songs. Songs of love chansons d'amour.".

The two men in question also constitute an original even startling combination  just as distinctive and unforgettable as the two lovers in Brokeback.This is a beautiful and outstanding film so it is good to see that 19 of the 24 reviews here before mine say that. But it's disturbing that even here on IMDb all 5 negative reviews below focus their disdain and hostility on the gay content. One reviewer details his loathing dismissing all the rest of us who like the film as gay another calls the film too gay another attacks the sleaze and downmarket sex. There are even a few positive reviews here which go all nervous and jittery about the IsmaelErwann romance. Hmmmmmmm! This is the 21st century.Otherwise Les Chansons is remarkable for its vision of Paris especially the streets of Paris and of course for ... les chansons. It is a most intriguing offbeat form of musical  the way in which the actors utter their songs is very different from conventional singing to such a degree that one has to pay attention to note that they really ARE singing. But it is in fact real singing and these are real songs. Songs of love chansons d'amour.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the running for the Palme d'Or in last year's Cannes Film Festival Love Songs by Christophe Honore was nothing like what the writeup used in the festival synopsis would have let you believe. Either that or I'm really dense to have trusted what was essentially a verbatim recap of only the first of three segments that this movie was split into  Departure Absence and Return.Rather than dwell on the nonexistent and off screen mangeatrios it's more of a tale of grief and the handling of grief after personal tragedy. It seemed like an exploration of venturing into the extremes of being experimental for the sheer thrill of it of trying to lead a vastly different lifestyle in other to drown all memories of the deceased of numbing oneself in excessive meaningless sex. I would have welcomed the viewpoints of family members in depth as the movie did spend some time to set up those characters only to have relegated them with sideshow treatment nothing more than caricatures from parents who try to engage their child's friends in order to discover hidden secrets unknown to them to siblings who hang around trying to come to grips with the loss only to find some questionable  eyebrow raising antics leading to assumptions and quick conclusions.As a musical the songs did feel a little out of place when the characters start to break into them and seriously I thought the lyrics could have been lost in translation as sometimes I could not see how they either move the narrative forward or speak from the heart the innermost thoughts from the characters mouthing those words. At some points it really felt a little bit forced and have left one wondering about the relevance of those phrases sung so while the meaning have probably been lost in me it might be of relevance to French speakers.While the movie stars Louis Garrel Ludivine Sagnier and Clotilde Hesme the bulk of the screen time belonged to Garrel's Ismael. The threesome relationship between their characters weren't exactly explained only that they are strange bedfellows sharing their nights together. While Sagnier's Julie did reveal her uneasiness at such an arrangement Hesme's Alice already knows of the boundaries within their relationships that she cannot cross and as they toy around those forbidden lines any sense of angst and unhappiness get sung away quite fleetingly.In short it's a film that lacked some crucial emotional punch preferring to just scratch the surface and try to get away with it. Definitely trying to appeal to the niche crowd with its dalliances with heterolesbiangay themes but ultimately came across as very forced and pretentious trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole if you can pardon the pun. Disappointing stuff.".

This is not down to quality because this is by no means a bad film it's just what you might call a marketing nightmare as a theatrical release anyway. It's a thinks it's cleverer than it is thriller starring two martial arts stars but without martial arts. In fact this isn't action all the way as you might expect with Jason Statham and Wesley Snipes as two of the headliners. Eventually this will find a release but probably DTV.Chaos is an enjoyable flick though. We have Ryan Phillipe and Jason Statham teaming up to investigate a bank heist. As the title suggests this film is about Chaos or the Chaos theory whereby seemingly random acts are in fact connected. Wesley Snipes costars as the bank robber in question. The cast are good. Phillipe shares lead duties with Statham and handles the film well. His character is pretty two dimensional but he does it convincingly and handles the action well too. Statham delivering another strange accent supposedly American is despite his accent charismatic. It's Wesley Snipes though who stands out actually enjoying himself after a string of substandard lazy performances in his DTV action vehicles and also in Blade Trinity.The film looks polished has a decent score and is a good watch. It just feels very DTV but a better than the normal DTV. Indeed this may have one or two twists too many but the twisting plot manages to keep you guessing as it unravels. Overall not bad but nothing new. ".

Sure it was predictable but it tried to be clever different and have that twist. And its almost funny seeing Statham switch from London to American accent all the time and Snipes wasn't the best.. but on the whole it was a better than your average movie.So the quick synopsis Statham is a much maligned suspended detective called in to be a negotiator in a bank robbery. The siege becomes complicated and the audience has to understand the past and present to unravel the future and what is really going on.OK down to the nittygritty. Chaos could have been a class act if it was done just a tad differently. Snipes needed to be as controlled as he was in the beginning Statham should have stayed English accent and the plot punchline should not have been delivered with a sledgehammer  or  not trust the audience to work things out without feeling the need to spell it out TOO clearly. I am reminded of another excellent and cognitive heist movie when seeing Chaos. I will not say it's name as that may be unwittingly revealing.Statham is one of my favourites from LockStock Transporter etc and I like his presence in every performance I have seen him in thus far. Snipes I could take or leave yet I was happy he didn't try to encompass the entire screen! but the pleasant surprise I had was with Ryan Phillipe. I think he's becoming a class actor and I would love to see him land some plum roles that highlights his talent.Overall Chaos tries a philosophical and clever approach that is different from the average outing regardless of what the DVD front cover may suggest possessing a hypnotic funky score in general good acting and a decent enough plot... overlook the obvious anomalies and Chaos provides value.".

But I was wrong very wrong. In fact this movie is really good. I've enjoyed watching it which is a big thing cause it was quite a while since the last time I could say that to a movie. In my opinion Snipes plays a really good villain. But unfortunately for the fans he doesn't get much screen time. OK there are some clichs in the story but it's still not a bad one and you can't guess what will happen next. The only major weakness in the movie IMHO is Ryan Phillipe his performance is just simply BAD that should be in bold. If it wasn't for him I'd give this movie an eight. So all in all I think this movie is worth watching especially for those who like thrillers. But if you only want to see Snipes and Statham fight or you're looking for plain action avoid it. There are no fights and the action is limited to a single chase and some gunfights.".

	schema:reviewBody "In mathematics chaos theory describes the behavior of certain dynamical systems  that is systems whose state evolves with time  that may exhibit dynamics that are highly sensitive to initial conditions popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. As a result of this sensitivity which manifests itself as an exponential growth of perturbations in the initial conditions the behavior of chaotic systems appears to be random. This happens even though these systems are deterministic meaning that their future dynamics are fully defined by their initial conditions with no random elements involved. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos or simply chaos.I copied that from Wikipedia just because that theory is used in the main plan of one of the characters. The film begins with an event that changes the life of Det. Quentin Conners Jason Statham forever and eventually he is suspended of the police. Later we have an apparently normal bank robbery that ends with the return of Conners as a desire of the criminals and with a mystery about the real intentions of the criminals. And there we have the main characters Conners of course and his new partner Shane Dekker Ryan Phillippe looking out for the criminals having different theories. I really like that part of the film mostly because of a cool performance of Statham teaching some lessons to the younger inspector being a tough guy but even creating a friendship with him and a good work environment for his detectives partners. Also I like how the began to have their own different theories even thinking that all was just a revenge against Connors but the film has many twists with many little details of course all based upon the chaos theory and although the very end has the classic mayor twist like in The Usual Suspects or in Lucky Number Slevin is still cool to see Statham coming to Mexico!Well I must add that I never hear a thing about this film until about one week ago that was finally released in theaters and its big publicity ends with commercials in football games I mean in a corner kick or in a foul the narrators says Jason Statham stars in Chaos. Soon in your theater you know the classic stuff. I write that because I was a victim of the publicity so suddenly I really wanted to check this film mostly just for Statham and because there are not many other options in commercial theaters right now. So I convinced my family for going to watch it but I said to them that maybe it was going to be the typical Hollywood bad action film and I was just another victim of the publicity but eventually we have a pleasant surprise with this good not great film.

Someone tried to do the movie a smart one so he tried to relate the plot to the chaos theory. It looks like this person didn't know what the theory is about it's just it sounded cool and he tried on the basis of this cool term to do a movie. He really messed up.Chaos is trying to catch up with movies like 'The Usual Suspect' but the plot and the actors though they do they work fine can't be really compared. Although Jason Statham is as good as in any other movie Wesley Snipes doesn't affect to much with his role. It could be done by someone else though according to his last couple of movies this one is a major step up. Ryan Phillipe beside Jason Statham looks like a school boy at the blackboard trying to solve equations. As someone already noted here he reminds Justin Timberlake which is clearly not to his advantage. As for others I would say that they are doing well.The worst thing is the oversmart plot that makes no logic at all. I won't add more on this subject.Not everything is bad. Overall the movie is well done. I think that the appropriate word for it is  quality. This is a high quality movie in most terms. The support actors are good the action and explosions are made by high standard .The best part of the movie is cinematography. From the beginning of Chaos you know the cinematography keeps you watching the movie till the end.My personal feeling about this movie is that it was quite OK. I can't say I liked it because of the lack of interest in the plot not to that it's dumb. I can't say I disliked it either. The camera work and Most of the actor's play make it watchable so it wasn't a total waste of time.Rarely I stumble into a really good Thriller so if you would like to see one not expecting to much from it I would advise you settle for this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's be fair it's a good movie BUT it's hardly memorable or spectacular in the long term. I think what the director thought was... people like smart action movies therefore i'll make mine smart. Well here's the difference you have action movies that don't look that smart but actually are. And this one looks smart but actually isn't. The problem with that is that it tries to outdo itself especially the last thirty minutes... where the detective comes upon a different plot every ten minutes so what we get then is a Usual Suspects kinda montage of every far fetched clue we overlooked only to be changed entirely ten minutes later up until a point were you stop caring.The directorwriter will have to explain to me how detectives take a mathematical theory seriously as a tool to outsmart cops. Again maybe the director wanted to be smart again by namedropping it's plot by defining it with some fancy word.Anyway i didn't think much of Jason Statham's acting at all he's kinda like the Orlando Bloom of the action movies... luckily he doesn't carry this movie alone unlike The Transporter. Wesley Snipes' character is typical Snipes after starring in numerous action movies i suppose it was a walk in the park for him. And Ryan Philliphe is a very promising upcoming actor he really delivers probably the best acting along with Snipes in the entire movie.Just see it once and you'll be entertained. Just don't try to think much about the plot after worths or you'll be insulted.".

If you're a Statham fan I would definitely recommend it.Also Statham has a thick accent in this movie but he is supposed to be a veteran Seattle cop which is kind of strange but I found easy to get past. Maybe you won't.This movie would have been a cult hit if they had filled in the gaps at the end. The heavy editing is very obvious. This is an example where they should have gone back and reshot some scenes. Instead they just mashed everything togetherscene after scene. It also ended too quickly. What happens with Shane Phillippe? And how about Teddy Waddell and her feelings about Conners Statham? One final note the chaos theme was just stupid and not needed. It was not central to the movie. It also reminds me of the chess theme in Revolver which was stupid as well. I guess Statham likes to play the secret genius. On the outside he is all rough and grizzled but on the inside he is a mathematical genius. That said I still think Statham is the best action character in the movies today hands down.".

When a bank is heist with hostage situation Conners is assigned in charge of the operation having the rookie Shane Dekker Ryan Phillippe as partner. The thieves leaded by Lorenz Wesley Snipes apparently do no steal a penny from the bank. While chasing the gangsters the police team discloses that they planted a virus in the system stealing one billion dollars from the most different accounts using the principle of the Chaos Theory. Further they find that Lorenz is killing his accomplices.Chaos is a great police story with an excellent and complex screenplay that uses the Chaos Theory to build the plot. This theory attempts to explain the fact that a series of initial minor events apparently not interconnected can trigger a sequence of significant occurrences producing unpredictable and complex result. Based in this principle the viewer must pay attention to any single detail since the beginning of the story because they probably will affect the conclusion when the plot is disclosed.

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Snipes' horrible horrible '7 seconds' and 'the Marksman' I wasn't particularly thrilled when I saw his name on the payroll. But hey everybody makes mistakes. And Jason 'Snatch' Statham... well that's about all it takes for me to at least give it a try.Well then on to the first half of the movie. Although maybe a nice artistic touch the very first scene gives away a part of the plot. We see a big clipboard full with articles and pictures of one Det. Connors trialled and suspended after a fatal accident on a bridge. First clue Someone is after Connor.Then the movie starts out pretty nice. A bank robbery some nice action and Connor back on the force and on the case. The master thief who calls himself Lorenz Snipes escapes along with the other robbers forcing Connor to start a bigscale hunt. Connor and his newly appointed sidekick the youngster Det. Dekker Philippe then shoot threaten joke smarttalk and oneline their way to the point where Lorenz' real identity is revealed. But is it really him who is the brain behind all this?The movie is a somewhat strange combination of clichs and smart plottwists. The director manages to build up the tension to some extent and Statham Snipes and Philippe do a good job in making the characters believable. Direction overall is fine as is the camerawork the dialog the score and the plot.Then comes the last 30 minutes or so of the movie. One single event triggers Dekker to rethink everything which unfortunately results in boring and unnecessary flashbacks. Pieces of the puzzle seem to fall together bam. The end. Huh?I can't seem to point out the main reason for the chaos later on in this movie. Is it the directing? Is it the script? A combination perhaps? I do get the plot still it's confusing.All in all a very enjoyable movie some fun and smart plottwists decent acting and overall pretty good script. But those last 30 minutes... Seriously I am confused. Oh well they called it 'chaos' at least now I know why.".

The part with Keegan Connor Tracy was just...absolutely random. Performances range from horrible Natassia Malthe  awful overacting to pretty bad Justine Waddell to just passable Phillippe Statham.Ignoring even the predictability of the screenplay the movie still has to deal with the fifty million plot holes and nonsensical aspects of its storyline including this  why the hell did Snipes' character even try to get through to Phillippe's character the whole Chaos Theory thing in the first place? Again I'm trying to be as vague as possible to not spoil the movie for anyone.

The only reason I'm giving this a 410 is because despite how dumb the movie actually is it's still reasonably entertaining throughout.";

Honestly his great outburst is the only really funny scene in the whole film. Must make him thrilled that he turned down the role of Anakin Skywalker and is now doing this.... Stratham is normally good as the tough but silent hard nut with the selfdeprecating humor but here the extra relationship lines are so laughably bad that even he looks uncomfortable saying some of the clichd mush required. More silent seems best? Snipes is actually OK in a typecast way but another nail in a talented actor's coffin he needs an actor's role not an action hero rehash. Perhaps that business with his taxes will allow him to break that mold and the public and critics will let him on the sympathy vote. It would be good if he wasn't so typecast all the time.The lines these guys speak when they're not doing the plot development and detective work can be summed up in one word.... pheeeuuuh.The film feels all out of whack and it never gels I found it irritating for the first 45 minutes and the tighter last part was passable. It should could have been good but it just can't redeem the awful lines the overwhelming score and the general level of irritation with the levels of plausibility. Overall I nearly didn't make it through incredibly irritating and Ryan.... please please please get rid of the goldilocks....".

The acting is OK I guess but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense a fact which the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to Chaos theory as if it would convince anyone that the film is actually 'clever'  but then again judging from other reviews some were. Don't be fooled the script is a boring derivative mess and no other element of the movie makes up for it. Wesley Snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film and Statham is a thoroughly dull actor.Not recommended.".

That is the gist of the 'Chaos Theory'. Though I have not read anything about the Chaos Theory I have seen it in action in films like Snatch with far more brilliancy. But that doesn't mean this wasn't good. This was actually very entertaining with all the twists and turns. But Statham is doing too much of these kinds of films lately. He has to do another film like Snatch though. He was so funny in that movie.Quentin Conners Jason Statham is suspended from the line of duty when he couldn't save a girl from getting killed in a highway chase. But he is called back to duty when the head of the robbers Lorenz Wesley Snipes who is holding up a bank wants to talk with him specifically. Shane Dekker Ryan Phillipph is the new guy on his first day at the job. They find out that all of this somehow connected to another robbery at the world bank. And nothing is as it seems. Somehow everything is connected and with Conners out of the scene in the final 30 minutes it is all upto newbie Shane to put the pieces together with a billion dollars on the line.Directed by Tony Giglio this movie was very good as in it had the good cop bad cop who's the robber thing going on. Half of the film I was wondering how Lorenz was actually connected to Quentin sure they told us that he was the brother but that didn't convince me and I was right. Jason Statham is always cool to watch anyways. But the story went in a direction which I least expected i.e Quentin is killed off after just 60 of the movie. How could they kill of their main attraction so soon? And Ryan Phillipph was not convincing enough he didn't look like a cop. I still don't see why they cast him in this. He should be out there doing some chick flicks. He looked like a kindergarten cop or an ad model. Also the love interest angle between Terry and Quentin wasn't fleshed out enough backstory wasn't given. But for a popcorn thriller this was quite entertaining. Any film with Statham in it is always worth a watch.810".

Ehlail is also one of those who adapted the novel into the film. I have not read the novel this is based on so I am not sure if the key problem is the original work or the adaptation. There are some known names in here another Das Boot reunion but to be honest I don't think any of these actors were really that talented at any point in their long careers more like on the charismatic side and maybe also at the right place during the right time but their range could be a lot better. Here and there you also get a tiny cameo by Helge Schneider for example but his screen time is too limited to make the impact he usually makes. I found the reenacted parts where the worst here and pretty cringeworthy to watch at times as the material was so bad really that even experienced professional actors couldn't save it. The interview parts were slightly better but also nothing special and sometimes extremely over the top that I wondered if the entire thing was scripted from start to finish. Anyway at not one point in this film I had the impression that they were really grasping the essence of punk or living it. It was all makebelieve in my opinion and all in all this one is a failure as it basically sticks to depicting Nazis as bad guys in a way you'd expect every leftwing oriented film that has almost no substance or depth at all. How about you focus on love instead of hate and truly make an impact with the subject you are elaborating on in here. None of that was achieved here. Besides Guess what we know that Nazis are evil. But there are more bad guys out there speaking of which I see Los Banditos being a production company here. Despicable comes in all sizes colors and shapes. Like this film here. Don't watch.".

	schema:headline " Chapter 27 2007 BOMB";
	schema:reviewBody "Hey my first BOMB rating this whole year  and how fitting a recipient! I thought this sucked big time. No not merely because as a John Lennon fan I consider it a sin that this tragic event was glorified into a featurelength film believe me if I'd thought it was a good or serviceable film in any way which really captured the aura of the tragic event then I'd eat the crow and say so. But I'd already heard a lot of reviewers say it was kind of vapid and that's certainly how it struck me.The movie supposedly focuses on obsessed fan Mark David Chapman's three day stint slumming around New York City from Hawaii and the personal demons he tackles while planning to murder exBeatle John Lennon in December 1980. I say supposedly' because there is nothing interesting cinematically to try and turn an essentially plotless story into something with a drive or purpose. The feature is based on a book by Jack Jones called LET ME TAKE YOU DOWN. In it Jones managed to get into the warped head of a complex murderer and offered up many transcripts of detailed talks with Chapman. Jones' was the superior work if there can be such a thing on a subject as dire as this. I thought that Jared Leto in the role of Chapman was physically a good choice with him having put on all the weight and so on. But as someone myself who's heard Chapman's voice over the years in documentaries and on news shows like 2020 and Larry King yup for historical purposes and the need to try and make logic out of the murder I have watched them I thought his faux southern voice was pretty bad. It was so obviously put on and he slipped in and out of it emphasizing it more at certain times than others.First some admittedly trivial and anal things  what bugged me throughout the film were all kinds of mistakes. Things like the Dakota building looming as it stands now  all clean and light tanlooking in color when in reality back in 1980 it was filthy with grimy black soot of the ages which had made it even more macabrelooking to fit the unfolding scenario. Now don't get me wrong  I realize this is an oversight practically nobody noticed or cared about and I didn't expect the filmmakers to REBUILD the Dakota! But as someone myself who is from New York and visited the Dakota both in 1980 and after I was always reminded this was not 1980 every time I saw the building.There's a scene where Chapman goes into a shop and buys the PLAYBOY magazine with John's current interview. Well the magazine here is NOT called PLAYBOY it's something else not even remotely of a similar title. And later when he sets up the dresser in his hotel room with all sorts of his personal mementos it's a tiny WIZARD OF OZ postcard he picked up in the store. In reality he used an actual movie lobby card from the film and it was especially poignant in a twisted way because in reality it was a favored shot of Dorothy wiping away the tears from the Cowardly Lion. Apparently for the film they figured anything with the name Wizard Of Oz would do. Same holds true for the cover of the DOUBLE FANTASY album... it's another staged pic and not the real album. Now of course I realize that all these substitutions were probably due to rights issues. Good for those who refused permission I'd say  if the filmmakers even bothered to try to ask them.The biggest problem with this movie all quibbling done is that it's DULL AS DISH WATER!! There is no attempt made to really get into the psyche of Chapman or maybe I feel that way because I've read the Jack Jones book of interviews and talks on which this movie was based and so much just did not come through or get covered. There still could have been a way to run through these events and handle them in a more intense style of a more escalating manner. The way the movie came off to me was like when you see a cheap TV show reenactment and none of the actors are really convincing and it's obvious that it's just what it is  A REENACTMENT. It was like bad documentary making. Lindsay Lohan might just as well not have been in the film considering how her character of the fan Jude is rarely featured and there's no real drama in her scenes with the killer. I have seen an interview with the real Jude from back in the day by the way and Lindsay looks like Raquel Welch next to her.I've looked up the credits for writerdirector J.P. Schaefer and this appears to be his very first film  and why am I not surprised? This thing looks and feels like someone's very first attempt at a film class project. Totally amateurish and empty. Even though this is not a fictional movie you know how people sometimes say The Book Was Better! when talking about some films? Well that certainly applies here. The book LET ME TAKE YOU DOWN was more disturbing more concise more dramatic and much more informative on every level. It also takes us down deeper into Chapman's twisted mind for whatever reasons one might care to delve. For me it was in desperate search of some kind of reasoning or understanding. Well I never found either but the book is still a fascinating read I must concede. The movie is garbage. 0 out of ".

At the time I was a senior in high school visiting New York for a few days feeling a lot like my imagination of Holden Caufield. John Lennon got shot the police said. I went to Central Park for the public memorial. Some people were sad but many others were excited as if they were taking part in a giant happening. The atmosphere was hardly funereal something you can see in the stock footage of the scene. I was disgusted and left. Phonies I thought.The movie gets a lot of things right. The preppy clothes the look of New York the bad food the awkward dialogall this brought back memories of feeling young and alienated. It also succeeds in its allusions to The Catcher in the Rye and even Lolita where Chapman could just as easily have been Humbert Humbert at the end. The acting is quite good and the direction though flawed succeeds more often than not.Most interesting to me was the concept. Many reviewers feel disappointed that we don't understand the mind of the killer by the end. But that's the point. There's nothing to understand. The relation between fans and artists is much like the relation between youth and age or poor and rich or even mobs and leaders. In the first instance there is sensitivity that this powerless and derivative and in the second there is sensitivity that is assured and original. The former condition as Salinger Nabokov and my own memory of adolescence contend is basically Hell. The main character never escapes this condition consider his book inscription. From this perspective the movie is less an exploration of his motivation which is causal and developmental than a description of his emotional state which is static and permanent. This is suggested by the structure of the narrative which follows the circularity of Salinger's novel.Viewers will have to decide for themselves whether the movie pulls off the larger metaphor namely that America itself has never escaped the nightmare of adolescence. If you want to see the disintegration of a lonely loser The Assassignation of Richard Nixon is a better movie. But Chapter 27 is smarter than it appears.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning I didn't see this film. I refuse to see this film. This is a review about the fact that this film exists.This is one of those cases where filmmakers go too far with their craft. I'm a huge John Lennon and Beatles fan and Lennon's murder was one of the saddest things to ever happen to humanity in general let alone the musical community. I don't want to see a film about the man that killed him. What are the producers trying to prove? That Mark David Chapman had good reasons for his actions? No! He was a psychopath obsessed with killing John Lennon who unfortunately got to do his ultimate deed. Enough said. Why do you have to make a movie about it?Were you not considering the feelings of Yoko Julian and Sean? Who wants to see a movie let alone know that a film exists about the guy who killed your husband or father? Famous or not. It would be the worst thing in the world to me. In that sense I empathize with Sean when he was upset by knowing that Lindsey Lohan whom he considers a friend was partially responsible for getting this film greenlighted. What's worse about this is that this is EXACTLY what Chapman wanted. He wanted to be famous and this is damning evidence to prove it!I usually try to be a pragmatist and give filmmakers the benefit of the doubt but this is one subject that didn't need to and shouldn't have been explored beyond the usual historical media such as news documentaries books etc. But a dramatic feature film? It's just too much. Unfortunately there really isn't much anybody can do now though seeing as how the film has been out for nearly 4 years already except just to urge film buffs and LennonBeatles fans to not give this film or any other film regarding Mark David Chapman any consideration and instead consider the feelings of Lennon's relatives and pay tribute to John by simply listening to and enjoying the greatest thing he could have left behind his music.".

	onyx:emotionText "Warning I didn't see this film. I refuse to see this film. This is a review about the fact that this film exists.This is one of those cases where filmmakers go too far with their craft. I'm a huge John Lennon and Beatles fan and Lennon's murder was one of the saddest things to ever happen to humanity in general let alone the musical community. I don't want to see a film about the man that killed him. What are the producers trying to prove? That Mark David Chapman had good reasons for his actions? No! He was a psychopath obsessed with killing John Lennon who unfortunately got to do his ultimate deed. Enough said. Why do you have to make a movie about it?Were you not considering the feelings of Yoko Julian and Sean? Who wants to see a movie let alone know that a film exists about the guy who killed your husband or father? Famous or not. It would be the worst thing in the world to me. In that sense I empathize with Sean when he was upset by knowing that Lindsey Lohan whom he considers a friend was partially responsible for getting this film greenlighted. What's worse about this is that this is EXACTLY what Chapman wanted. He wanted to be famous and this is damning evidence to prove it!I usually try to be a pragmatist and give filmmakers the benefit of the doubt but this is one subject that didn't need to and shouldn't have been explored beyond the usual historical media such as news documentaries books etc. But a dramatic feature film? It's just too much. Unfortunately there really isn't much anybody can do now though seeing as how the film has been out for nearly 4 years already except just to urge film buffs and LennonBeatles fans to not give this film or any other film regarding Mark David Chapman any consideration and instead consider the feelings of Lennon's relatives and pay tribute to John by simply listening to and enjoying the greatest thing he could have left behind his music.";

Without a doubt extremely queasy and disturbing material yet the film isn't particularly enlightening or incisive on any level. Writerdirector J.P.

Perhaps he thought going in to it that he would get a stirring and harrowing chronicle of this man's madness but what he didn't figure on apparently at any point in writing the script was giving us a story or any kind of real sense of who Chapman was aside from a mumbling nutcase obsessed with Catcher in the Rye. According to reports yes he was attached to that Salinger book a lot and yes he loomed around the hotel Lennon was staying at.But Scahefer misses any real chances to make the character compelling by sidestepping what is actually interesting about him his past only hinted at with his wife and his time spent teaching Vietnamese children being raised in a strict Christian upbringing apparently for 84 minutes of the same muddled pretentious beat over and over again. Since when was assassination this boring? And the blame on how bad this movie is can be spread out. Some of it is truly the Schaefer's fault just on the design of the narration. Sometimes narration can be really effective I kept thinking back to the Informant another movie about a mentally unbalanced individual with an innermonologue as a prime example but here it's nothing except dull diatribes and complaining and waxing and waning on how he feels or thinks that has nothing to say about Chapman himself or anything interesting about his situation. And some of the blame falls on Jared Leto. Packing on the pounds simply is not enough not when the character is the same lump of a presence in the entire running time and we're left with absolutely nothing to feel for him except hate  not even so much for his impending crime but for his construction as a character and while his voice isn't terribly annoying when acting in scenes it's somehow unbearable in the narration. It's a colossal waste of listening space.Some of the other actors do try but are also left slim pickings. Lindsay Lohan doesn't do too terrible but that's considering what little of her character another Lennon fan hanging out at the hotel is revealed as. There's also a question barely answered as to why she wants to be around this loose cannon who never once gives the impression of stability even in casual conversation i.e. I hate movies dialog. Judah Freidlander fares a little better but he too is only on screen so long as to just play a one note character the best way he can. And yet it says a lot that an actor like Leto who can be talented and show range as in Requiem for a Dream or Panic Room is reduced to being upstaged by his fellow performers who seemingly have less to do than him.The movie made me angry at how it unfolded because there was no progression of anything. I kept thinking about how much of a better or just more fascinating story it could be showing how Chapman developed into this deranged and lonely persona or even just giving us more to chew on about his life before his notorious act. It's telling a situation before a story and one that surprisingly is dull and meandering and often laughably illconceived in every facet of production. I almost weeped at the end not because of a sense of loss for Lennon or for the soul brought down forever due to his own madness as Chapman but because I had to endure a filmmaker's lack of having anything to really say and saying it poorly pretentiously and with a lack of respect for the audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chapter 27 is one of the most visually stunningly films I have seen in a long time. The hauntingly beautiful cinematography comfortably blends it's self with the evocative soundtrack. Jared Leto surprised me with such a challenging and compelling roll and with this competent portrayal of the notorious Mark David Chapman he really proves him self as a character actor. Everything from his schizophrenic mannerisms to the morbid confusion in his eyes Leto is just incredible. Lindsay Lohan's role in the film is essential in developing Chapman's awkward disposition when it came to interaction with other people especially women. Lohan's role although small is an important one and she plays it well. The city of New York also plays an important role in Chapter 27 with it's bitter isolation and apparent lack of moral integrity. A languid soul can be in a city full of thousands of people and still feel completely alone. It's important to remember when watching this film that Mark David Chapman was no evil genius  he was a schizophrenic sociopath. The reason this film doesn't offer much of an insight into Chapman's motive behind this horrible assassination or into the complicated mind of a killer is because there isn't one. And the reason his past and childhood isn't included in the film is not only to admit some things that could be seen as being sympathetic towards him eg a sexually abusive past etc but also because it quite simply doesn't matter or explain anything. Chapman was and is quite simply mentally disturbed and it isn't hard to tell this even if you only know the basics about him. Most of the things we know about Chapman's thoughts and actions leading up to Lennon's assassination we know only from his personal accounts and given his obviously disturbed state in general these accounts may or may not be what really happened. The rest can be taken from accounts of interactions held with people such as telephone conversations with his wife or conversations with other fans also gathered outside The Dakota. Chapter 27 gives us a fairly subjective view of Chapman and his actions. They haven't sensationalized anything and have made a good realistic representation of the events of the assassination and the state of mind of the perpetrator at the time. In so much as people being upset about a film representation being made about the death of someone as beloved as John Lennon I don't think this film is even slightly disrespectful to the memory of John Lennon. It's not exploring what happened to Lennon on the days before he died it's exploring what happened to Chapman. It's more about him that it is about Lennon. This in a strange way is more respectful to Lennon that people might think. There's a certain morbid beauty to this film that comes out mainly through the incredible cinematography and the creative direction. J.P. Schaefer does a very good job for a first time writerdirector. It's a shame this film won't get as much exposure as it deserves.".

And the reason his past and childhood isn't included in the film is not only to admit some things that could be seen as being sympathetic towards him eg a sexually abusive past etc but also because it quite simply doesn't matter or explain anything. Chapman was and is quite simply mentally disturbed and it isn't hard to tell this even if you only know the basics about him. Most of the things we know about Chapman's thoughts and actions leading up to Lennon's assassination we know only from his personal accounts and given his obviously disturbed state in general these accounts may or may not be what really happened. The rest can be taken from accounts of interactions held with people such as telephone conversations with his wife or conversations with other fans also gathered outside The Dakota. Chapter 27 gives us a fairly subjective view of Chapman and his actions. They haven't sensationalized anything and have made a good realistic representation of the events of the assassination and the state of mind of the perpetrator at the time. In so much as people being upset about a film representation being made about the death of someone as beloved as John Lennon I don't think this film is even slightly disrespectful to the memory of John Lennon. It's not exploring what happened to Lennon on the days before he died it's exploring what happened to Chapman. It's more about him that it is about Lennon. This in a strange way is more respectful to Lennon that people might think. There's a certain morbid beauty to this film that comes out mainly through the incredible cinematography and the creative direction. J.P. Schaefer does a very good job for a first time writerdirector. It's a shame this film won't get as much exposure as it deserves.";

	schema:headline " Chapter 27 When It's Not Dull and Dragging Tells Us Nothing We Didn't Know Before";
	schema:reviewBody "Chapter 27 tells the true story of Mark David Chapman and the three days leading up to his assassination of John Lennon. He put four bullets into one of the most beloved and respected rock and roll icons in the world changed history for the worst and after the movie is done we still don't quite understand why he did it.The most frustrating part of Chapter 27 is that it is ambitious enough to take on a compelling true story but somehow manages the drag the story's pacing by weighing it down with blatant egomania. It starts out on December 6 1980 with Chapman Jared Leto taking a taxi into New York City. Throughout the movie Chapman goes from hanging out in front of The Dakota where John Lennon lived to his hotel room and back again stopping occasionally in insignificant places in between.The problem with this movie is not its historical accuracy. Did Chapman spend these three days meandering around before shooting Lennon? Yes he probably did. What I want to know however is at least a little bit about Chapman's background. Chapman just hanging out in his hotel room is about as interesting as Ted Bundy eating a bowl of cereal. I want to know more about his obsession with the Beatles. Why did he choose to target Lennon as opposed to Paul McCartney George Harrison or even Ringo Starr for that matter? You can look it up but you're never given a clear answer in this film.Plus I really wanted to know a little bit about his life in Hawaii where he lived before the shooting. He was married so why did he cheat on his wife with a prostitute? Obviously there was something amiss in his marriage but the movie only hints at the problem not the cause.Perhaps most of all Chapman obviously sees a lot of Holden Caulfield J.D. Salinger's immortal character from The Catcher In The Rye in himself. After all throughout the film Leto quotes Caulfield verbatim from asking a cab driver about how fish survive the winter to dismissing movies as being so fake. However what is never explained and what needed to be is this WHAT DOES HOLDEN CAULFIELD HAVE TO DO WITH KILLING SOMEONE?I happen to love The Catcher In The Rye. In fact I've read it twice and I never came across any line in that book that suggested Caulfield wanted to shoot someone. Caulfield wasn't perfect but he certainly was no killer. Obviously Chapman misinterpreted the book but what this movie failed to explain was what part or parts of the novel Chapman fixated upon to get that message.All these things are frustrating because this movie should have been better. Jared Leto after all is a really good actor who has been in some great films Fight Club 1999 American Psycho 2000 Requium For a Dream 2000. In this movie he went the route that Robert De Niro took in Raging Bull 1980 by intentionally putting on 60 pounds for this one role. He also adopts a creepy whispering Southern accent heard throughout the film. Unfortunately although Chapman was a true egomaniac in real life Leto's attempt to portray him seems too vain. As a result his performance comes off as selfaggrandizing as his stint in 30 Seconds To Mars.Lindsay Lohan surprisingly enough is really good in this movie as Jude a Beatles fan who is more level headed than Chapman was. Jude was probably a fictional character as I can't find any information as to whether a woman named Jude actually existed even on Wikipedia. Still when the movie ended I wanted to know what happened to her. I already know what became of Chapman.The film's final mistake at the end is fatal. It assumes that the climax Chapman shooting Lennon is its own reward. You see Leto point a gun you hear a gunshot and the screen goes black. You see some real life footage of fans mourning Lennon interspersed with newsreels from the time and an admittedly startling shot of Leto as Chapman looking directly into the camera talking about how he's the victim. What you don't see however is Chapman sitting down on the sidewalk reading The Catcher In The Rye before the police apprehend him. Chapman actually did this and I find it more fascinating than anything. He didn't run away and he could have. That fact alone speaks more about Chapman's egomania than Leto's gradually tired voiceover monologues ever could.Even worse is the onscreen epilogue which states that Chapman is still in prison and is now a bornagain Christian. Well isn't that great! He was moronic enough to kill a rock and roll legend and now he's repenting. Whoop dee doo! Such an uninspired epilogue is key to understanding what went wrong in this film it never tells us anything we don't already know. Don't the filmmakers know that Chapman was a fool who played it cool by making the world a little colder?".

Nice way to begin your directing career Mr. Schaefer by angering the entire Hollywood elite. No wonder Sean Lennon voiced vehement opposition towards the making of this movie.

Lindsay Lohan playing the role of Jude  nudge nudge wink wink get it Hey Jude? contributes absolutely nothing as she always does in anything she is cast in. Perhaps directors world wide will finally realize that Lohan is an absolute zero studying hard to one day become a negative number. Lohan's sidekick Ursula Abbott Jeri smokes one cigarette after the next standing outside the Dakota but she does it very sexy. Hopefully she doesn't smoke this much in real life or she'll be hoping aboard the Peter Jennings lung cancer express long before her time. Jared Leto told me in person at the Angelika Film Center in New York that he never visited the real Mark David Chapman in prison prior to the filming of this flop. How could he possibly get a feel on how to portray Chapman without ever meeting him? If you are truly in a desperate pinch to toss away twenty five bucks then take someone to see Chapter 27 otherwise let common sense prevail and wait until it arrives at Netflix as it will be on DVD in lightning quick fashion.Spoiler alert John Lennon is murdered at the end of this movie.".

I bleak compared to a lot of the very fine reviewers here but in my circle of friends I'm known for having some knowledge of cinema. I've usually got a nice clean description for them when they consult me about a hot new movie but in the case of 'Chapter 27' I was torn between these two 'a missed opportunity' or 'compelling and a tour de force performance by Leto'. It let me down at first seeing that I was expecting an insight in the mind of the infamous killer and some new useful info about the incident. Instead what I saw can be considered pointless and trivial.When I gave the movie another spin I focused more on how well the film was as a technical piece of art acting included since I consider it no more than device for the narrative. Just because the film turned in another direction than I and I'm sure a big chunk of the audience with me expected doesn't take any merit away from the movie itself as a piece of art. Some may argue that art must always be considered in relation with the contemporary society the cultural relevance and so fort. I've always disagreed with that acclaimed point of view. Art can and does stand on itself and always has. Seeing that there is no absolute truth especially not in the media besides what some may say the present and past media have shared their love for half truths and flat out lies. Well seeing that there is no absolute universal truth why can't 100 fictional art be as or more important and relevant than nonfictional. I do have a point being that a movie even one only loosely based on true events can be of artistic value even though it is totally irrelevant to society. A definition which fits Chapter 27 pretty well. If the murder of John Lennon never had taken place and someone would produce a movie of such excellence people would be tripping over their own compliments praising this movie sky high.Just as Chapter 27 could have been considered more interesting if it was a fictional work so is it true the other way around. Michael Clayton comes to mind. The style of the movie the way details were blurred as if they were unknown and couldn't be fictionalized lest the truth were bend. Now that is pretentious. Chapter 27 isn't at all. It may not take us deep into the mind of killer but it does take us very deep into the mind of a lonely man. It must be a happy man he who does not identify himself with Chapman in the slightest. His pain is recognizable for anyone and he's never sympathized in my opinion but I connected with his character more than I would've thought was possible for a 'monster' that's debatable as Caufield oh sorry Chapman. Such an achievement is not to be taken lightly and this is why Chapter 27 manages to be interesting in the end not a waste of time and not a failure! As a last argument I saved the best for last I'll bring up Jared Leto. What a talented actor!!! I've had the pleasure of seeing many of his past performances the one that sticks out most of course is 'Requiem For A Dream' Aronofsky's best movie so far but I have high hopes of him overclassing Requiem with a multiOscar winning masterpiece in the near future. Anyway Leto's performance is nothing less than sensational. It's not just the weight gain not even the superb way he has adopted mannerisms and a new way of talking and voice but mainly it's in his eyes. A great director I'm 99 sure it was Hitchcock once said that a member of the audience should be able to follow a movie without a problem if it was muted just by seeing the emotions in the actor's eyes. Well I was never a big believer in that until recently and Leto displays it magnificently. It's like the lights in his eyes went out in his depression but there's a twinkle there too the twinkle of growing insanity as he slowly slides deeper into his fantasy of being Holden Caufield. This is without a doubt one of the best performances I have seen in the last few months and worth more than a few lines in this review but one can only describe excellence to a certain extent brilliance is hard to explain.8.410".

It's like the lights in his eyes went out in his depression but there's a twinkle there too the twinkle of growing insanity as he slowly slides deeper into his fantasy of being Holden Caufield. This is without a doubt one of the best performances I have seen in the last few months and worth more than a few lines in this review but one can only describe excellence to a certain extent brilliance is hard to explain.8.410";

The Direction was also flawed and relayed too much on Scorsese's Classic Taxi Driver but I give him credit for addressing the stoic audience at the Sundance Premiere during the post screening QA. I hope he has learned from the mistakes on this picture and is able to deliver something more impressive his next time around. I'm trying to be generous. Lindsey Lohan was the one shining light in an otherwise unwatchable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Step into the mind of a deranged stalkerListen to the tortured obsessive thoughts as he rambles on and on.That's the premise of this strange but welldone film about the man who killed John Lennon. If you're looking for a good date movie forget itunless your date is a forensic psychologist or a CSI fan. This film is not entertainment. The director's intent was to explore the internal state of Mark David Chapman in the three days leading up to his murder of Lennon.For those who are upset that this film was ever made be assured that it in no way glorifies Chapman. Though the director wants us to empathize i.e. understand the mind of the killer he does not try for sympathy. Chapman is presented as the pathetic loser he actually was. Jared Leto who gained 60 pounds for the role the resemblance is eerie gives us a portrayal of a weird annoying pest. So annoying in fact that it's hard to believe that Jude the Lindsay Lohan character who may nor may not have existed would want to pal around with him. I guess she is supposed to feel sorry for him.The other ChapmanMark Lindsay Chapman no comment on the name that's been done to death pardon the expression elsewhere is equally good in his all too brief role as John Lennon. As the director J.P. Shaefer has said elsewhere he wanted someone to play Lennon as a real person not an icon. Mark Lindsay Chapman's portrayal is downtoearth and matter of factjust like the real Lennon. He sounds eerily like the real Lennon too. MLC is a brilliant choice and cosmically appropriate. He was chosen from a field of 200 to play Lennon in a TV movie back in 1988 when he was calling himself Mark Lindsay. When Yoko Ono found out his real name she fired himbad karma. Now it has come full circle and MLC finally gets to play the rolealmost as if it was his destiny.The film is somewhat artsy which is both good and bad but it is fairly good at capturing the essence the obsessive stalker mentality. Leto is excellent in the role making you believe that you are actually seeing Mark David Chapman. But if you want to know why he did it you'll have to look elsewhere. It does not explore Chapman's backgroundhis religious fanaticism his teenage obsession with Lennon or the crushing disappointment when Lennon announced jokingly that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus.Chapter 27 won't be everyone's cup of mocha latte. It's disturbing and weirdjust like Mark David Chapman. It's not a film you will like but it is a film that you may find interesting. It may not give insight in to the why but it does paint a striking picture of the how. Arcania".

But as a film it doesn't merit any more than a single star and that only because it has the decency to eventually end.Ironically there is a line in this film where the character played by Lindsey Lohan describes another film as being essentially a boring series of pointless scenes leading to an inevitable ending  which perfectly describes this one!Here's why I found the movie so bad1It is neither entertaining nor informative nor transformative. In other words I didn't enjoy it nor did I learn anything new from it that I hadn't already learned from Wikipedia nor did it cause me to change my thoughts feelings or attitudes about anything in any way whatsoever.2The vast majority of the dialogue is presented as an internal monologue of Lennon's killer which is mostly taken according to Wikipedia directly from the murderer's interview tapes from prison.In other words the movie which places the killer rather than Lennon as its central character is essentially acting as a mouthpiece for the killer providing a platform for his scrambled and mostly incomprehensible ramblings and ultimately giving him far more of a voice than he deserves  either morally or creatively.It should be noted that Lennon's widow and children didn't want the film to be made or for the murderer to receive any further publicity or notoriety. His main motive for killing Lennon was to become famous and it was always their desire that he should not get his wish. This film makes a movie star out of a sad uninteresting little man and effectively rewards him for the murder in exactly the way he had hoped.3The filmmakers by making this film are profiting financially from Lennon's murder. That though disrespectful wouldn't be so bad if they had achieved at least one of the primary objectives of cinema. See point 1. But they didn't. It's just an amateurish little mess of grainy handheld shots of a fat guy waiting outside a building while thinking rambling thoughts. An artist of Lennon's stature deserved at the very least for the unauthorised movie of his murder to be either entertaining informative or transformative. Preferably all three!4It's boring. Just plain dull. Bleak and depressing too. But mainly just dull.And yet I was inspired enough to waste further time writing a review so go figure!I should point out that most of the thoughts I have expressed here occurred to me while I was watching the film  as my mind kept wandering  so I was clearly bored and not concentrating. Perhaps my own internal monologue just overwhelmed that of the movie's protagonist and as a result I missed something subtle and yet deeply profound and meaningful that would have made it a worthwhile movie.

The way he feels that John Lennon has betrayed him but still is a fan a heart. He plays the mental and confused guy so amazingly that it takes my breath away. The directing is fantastic too. It's really capturing the atmosphere. And the coloring works so well. This is a movie that by most people will be looked down on. You knowfor portraying a man who killed a legend.

	schema:reviewBody "When a book is so good as the book by which this film was made is you kind of expect the movie well not to suck but let's say you don't keep your hopes up very much cause you usually end up disappointed The Notebook doesn't count. But this... As little as my hopes were this kept disappointing me throughout all hour and a half of its duration. I mean come on!!! This is one of the most romantic and beautiful stories of which I read and during the movie I actually was bored in the moments when I wasn't annoyed. The acting was terrible as was the script. It seems like director wanted to include as much scenes from the book as possible but then forgot to sort it by order so everything was incredibly confusing and dull. The relationship of Step and Babi which is very delicate and which is the main topic was not appropriately unfolded and not as much attention as it should was given to itso everything looks emotionless and ridiculous. I must add that this ugly guy who plays Step has probably ruined any other rereading of this book to me cause I'll be imagining him as Step and not the perfect guy as Step should be and as I imagined him before the stupid film. I give it 3 stars simply out of respect to the wonderful book which I recommend to everyone and that lovely view of the sea and sunset. So... If you didn't read the book just go do that and forget about the movie cause you just won't know what the hell is happening. And if you like the book and want to see this movie just skip that little part and go buy yourself the next part of the book named Ho Voglia Di Teand that will be time and money well spent. If you still decide to watch it my voice will be in your heads telling you I told you so! all the time.".

But this... As little as my hopes were this kept disappointing me throughout all hour and a half of its duration. I mean come on!!! This is one of the most romantic and beautiful stories of which I read and during the movie I actually was bored in the moments when I wasn't annoyed. The acting was terrible as was the script. It seems like director wanted to include as much scenes from the book as possible but then forgot to sort it by order so everything was incredibly confusing and dull. The relationship of Step and Babi which is very delicate and which is the main topic was not appropriately unfolded and not as much attention as it should was given to itso everything looks emotionless and ridiculous. I must add that this ugly guy who plays Step has probably ruined any other rereading of this book to me cause I'll be imagining him as Step and not the perfect guy as Step should be and as I imagined him before the stupid film. I give it 3 stars simply out of respect to the wonderful book which I recommend to everyone and that lovely view of the sea and sunset. So... If you didn't read the book just go do that and forget about the movie cause you just won't know what the hell is happening. And if you like the book and want to see this movie just skip that little part and go buy yourself the next part of the book named Ho Voglia Di Teand that will be time and money well spent. If you still decide to watch it my voice will be in your heads telling you I told you so! all the time.";

	schema:reviewBody "I walked out of the cinema in which Tre metri sopra il cielo had just been shown with mixed feelings. At an immediate level I was pleased to have seen a nice teenager flick well acted by promising young people a captivating story and so on. But when I discussed the film later with my friend I found myself to be somewhat angered. Like they had made a fool out of myself.POSSIBLE SPOILERS 3MSC is about the world of teenagers in Rome and the juxtaposition of two worlds Babi's a good student a perfect daughter a virgin dreaming of a Blue Prince and Step's a violent boy doing anything of his life except earning some illegal money at clandestine motorcycle races even if he is the son of a rich man. Despite all their differences the two young people end up falling in love of course. And of course all their differences will bring Heaven and Hell moments of joy but lots of troubles in their relationship. Fine. Nothing very original but it's soooo difficult do produce original flicks nowadays! What worries me a bit and the reason of my little anger is what lies beneath the thesis of the film it is obvious that you are supposed to sympathise with Step. Babi's world is fake full of formal habits that make the lives of this upperclass family empty. Step's life on the contrary is the adventure the excitement the way to experience the new. This is the film's thesis. But this even with my 20 years of age and my being a sinistrorse I can't accept. Nothing could ever convince me that I have to stay on the side of someone who always solves the troubles he faces by beating everyone who steals who thinks that the better way to obtain something is to shout louder than the other people around him. No I won't accept it even if this someone is twenty has green eyes a fine smile when nobody has beaten him in return and a handsome physical appearance. No I'm sorry. And I'm sorry because a lot of 14yearold girls will see this film and walk out of the cinema with an innocent smile on their faces thinking THIS is the guy I WANT TO MEET in my life. And at this delicate age this is quite dangerous. That's why I was angered.I don't want saying this to destroy totally this film. As I said at an immediate level you can actually enjoy a story not very original but finely shotacted by two young actors Riccardo Scamarcio and Katy Louise Saunders we'll see often in the future. The important thing if you are a 12to19 person is not to get badly influenced by what I told before. An average flick? Sure. But a Film of Cultural Interest as they say at the beginning of the film? A Cult? as on the first page of the book on which the film is based? Please. Italian cinema nowadays offers far better.".

Step is the dream of every adolescent girl he is handsome he likes to live on the edge and he rides a great motorcycle.

	schema:headline " Truly bad film made of an amazing book";
	schema:reviewBody "This story about the love between a good correct girl and a charming troubled bad boy is beautifully told in the book but the main aspects of it are blurred or straightly changed in the film turning it into a shallow nonsense boring teenage romantic film. First the film fails to state the huge abyss that separates Babi and Step. In the book Babi didn't like Step and his lifestyle she finds him violent and rude in the film she actually says she had a great time riding on the back of the motorcycle which is ridiculous because it's dangerous and she's just not that type of girl. Despite her objections Babi falls for Step because she is attracted to him and the freedom and fun with which he faces the world. In the film Step is presented as a bitter teenager who's constantly angry and doesn't talk much. The 'true' Step is quite the opposite. He is charming happy and manages perfectly to turn all questionings to his attitude towards the one who is judging him. He is secure irresponsible and together with his friend Pollo feels like he owns the world. They are not stopped by fear manners social and legal rules in the way of enjoying themselves and life. In this the plot manages to engage the readerviewer in wanting to feel as free as they do but at the same time to question the illegality of their actions and recklessness towards other people. Just as Babi does. But she surrenders to what she feels for him despite this. This fact on its own is crucial. It tells about inner conflicts the judgment call we all have to make about what we can and cannot accept and how so many times our feelings are not something we can control whatever our mind says. Step is not only charming but actually shows to be sensitive enough to wait for Babi until she is ready to make love with him. She doesn't feel ready but he is so tender and caring doesn't push beyond what she lets him and creates a perfect atmosphere for their first time just as she had asked again this is totally twisted in the film where Babi is eager to have sex with him apparently only because he is so hot since Step is not charming in the film just violent. This troubled intense love story ends in the book with Babi leaving Step as she realizes that he is not going to change his violent self. Also once the initial wave of maddening love is passed the fact that both hate each other's world becomes too evident. Step is left heartbroken because he is left with all his wounds exposed those he had managed so well to hide. The fight with his mother his loneliness the origin for all that anger and violence. The end is truly heartbreaking because he is left alone with Babi gone and Pollo dead. But at the same time it makes total sense it couldn't have been any different. He is left to face his issues deal with them and perhaps make a better man out of himself more considerate less violent more responsible. All this in the book of course. As said the main facts about the personality and relationship of and between the characters have been totally changed in the film so one could actually say that the book and film are not the same story even though they bare the same name. It makes one wonder why people bother to make a film based on the book if they are going to change everything. Such changes are usually based on attracting the wider audiences but if the book was so successful is for a reason and they should have realized that. So out of a great book that managed to engage a whole generation capturing the essence of adolescence and the first love they made a shallow not convincing film with some lousy acting too. In summary don't bother with the film read the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Stanley Kramer classic covers a lot of ground  literally and figuratively. Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are white and black inmates who while chained together at the wrist escape their captors when their prison truck hits the ditch. Now Curtis is forced to put aside his prejudice and work with his new partner in getting the cuffs off and ensuring their newfound freedom lasts.As its reputation suggests THE DEFIANT ONES is first and foremost a study of racism. It has a deliberate unpleasantness about it as it brings to life the unsavory attitudes of the past. A young boy who stumbles across the convicts races to the arms of Curtis for fear Poitier will hurt him. A lonely farm wife who takes the men in has to be told that yes Poitier deserves a meal too. And as the men face hanging at the hands of some rednecks Curtis appeals to them on the grounds a white man can't be lynched. Yet the film carries no tired moralistic messages instead allowing the racism on display to speak for itself.THE DEFIANT ONES goes well beyond its central theme. It's an exciting adventure along the lines of THE FUGITIVE as our antiheroes elude their captors and try to survive in the unforgiving wilderness. It's a story of raw human emotions at work and of overcoming adversity by putting our trust in others. And it's a story of loyalty and the capacity of the human heart to change. We come away with the sense that the people involved with this picture knew they were part of something truly special.Though he was given second billing Poitier easily steals the show with his dignified performance. He brilliantly conveys the tortured yet still upbeat soul of a young black man who came of age in a time of unimaginable difficulty. He often doesn't have to speak to let us know the pain he has and will continue to endure. Poitier proves that critics aren't just being kind when they cite him as one of the great black actors of his or any other era though as we see here he is definitely no singer!.THE DEFIANT ONES moves just a touch slow at times particularly when the focus is placed on Curtis. But this is a movie as important as it is worth watching.".

In fact Stanley Kramer must have taken the critique in stride because sheriff Theodore Bikel has a line of explanation saying the warden had a sense of humor.Though the film dates a bit it's still quite dramatic even now.

Still joined at the hip as they are they do need each other and find eventually there's more that unites than divides them.Besides Theodore Bikel in a strange role for him as a laconic southern sheriff look for good performances from Lon Chaney Jr. who runs a turpentine work camp who saves Curtis and Poitier from a lynching and Cara Williams as a trampy white trash farm lady whose needs haven't been met for a while.Tony Curtis in an incredible act of generosity insisted on equal billing for Sidney Poitier since due to the nature of the film they are on screen together for most of it. That act of generosity may have cost him an Oscar for both he and Poitier were nominated for Best Actor but lost to David Niven for Separate Tables. An act that rankles Tony Curtis to this day because at the drop of a hat he will insist Niven got 'his' Oscar.Despite the sour grapes The Defiant Ones though dated is still a good bit of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Kramer was a Hollywood producer who turned into a director. He shows he had a promise when he undertook the direction of this production that involved race relations in the America of the 1950s where segregation was still in place. To even set the story in the Deep South as he did here shows that Kramer was clearly not afraid of whatever repercussions the movie would get or the problems associated for showing this situation to wide audiences.Basically this is the story of two men who are shackled together one white one black as they are being transported to a forced labor camp. When their bus suffers an accident Joker the white man and Noah the black one see it as their opportunity to escape. There is one problems though they can't get the chain that binds their wrists to be cut however much they try.The sheriff of the place where the accident happens quickly organizes a manhunt throughout the area. It will be only a matter of time when these two convicts will be caught. What starts as two men trying to avoid being captured turns out into a sort of friendship between Joker and Noah. Joker will never accept Noah and vice versa but they must stick together if they want to survive.Tony Curtis who up to this point in his career had only been given light roles to play is the unexpected surprise of the film. In fact this is one of the best roles he ever played in the movies bar none. Sidney Poitier on the other hand plays against type in the movies. We always saw him as the decent black man who was a noble creature and wasn't appreciated. In this film none of those qualities are shown by his character who must deal with the burden of having to drag Joker along at the same time he is trying to save his own skin.The supporting cast made an excellent contribution to Mr. Kramer's direction. The excellent Theodore Bikel played Sheriff Max Muller with conviction. Charles McGraw Leon Chaney Jr. Claude Akins and Cora Williams contribute to make this film better than it could have been.The brilliant black and white photography by Sam Leavitt enhanced the film. Stanley Kramer deserved credit for bringing this story into the screen at a time when no one was doing anything as daring as what he did.".

Shared experiences and the realization that inside they are both very similar helps both men to understand each other. I also liked the friction between the gungho sheriff and the more laidback realistic one. The character of the bloodhound owner rings true to anyone who knows a person who breeds dogs. The only thing I didn't like about this film was the Poitier character's singing. I know thats its a big part of the film and it is a form of defiance on its own but it bugged me none the less. Oh well small criticism for a great film. But what's with woman who'll sell out her son to some guy who stumbles into her yard? Wrong priorities I guess.".

	schema:reviewBody "This great film follows two escaped convicts Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier as they try to out run the law. The problem is that both men are chained together. The bigger problem is that one is a white southern man and the other is a black man. The viewers know that by the time the police find them the two men may have already killed each other.The two men form a bond with each other along the way. Each man tells their story and the other one listens. They reluctantly become friends as they go through woods rivers and clay pits to get to the train that leads out of town.The two come across a house where a woman Cara Williams and her son are living. When they get there they break the chain that has held them together all this time. They stay the night in the house and when Poitier falls asleep Williams takes a liking to Curtis. In the morning the two love birds plan to escape in a car while Poitier has to run through a swamp to get to the train.Curtis discovers that it's a trap and runs to help Poitier. They find each other and get to the train where Poitier jumps on and reaches out to Curtis who can't make it on to the train. Poitier realizes this and jumps off. The two fall down a hill and are captured by the police Theodore Bikel and Charles McGraw.This film is a great one. It's a must see film for anyone who likes gritty action. The performances are top notch and the editing is flawless. And the story and cinematography won oscars. Truly a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film very much of its time which I don't think personally has aged too well although it still makes for some interesting and occasionally involving viewing. The writing of the movie is very much in the shadow of Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams against the background of the burgeoning Civil Rights movement in America at the time but for me it buckles under the weight of its own overearnest good intentions despite the considerable efforts of both cast and crew.I was surprised to learn that the screenplay wasn't adapted originally from a play given the amount of static movement in the film coupled with a lot of speechifying. I also just couldn't get my head round the premise of two racially different felons just happening to be chained together and finding themselves on the run together in the Southern States all the film's gritty realism scuppered for the sake of allegory.There's still a lot to savour the cinematography is excellent in its neardocumentary realism while the two leads throw themselves unstintingly into very exacting physical parts. I like both Curtis and Poitier but wasn't completely convinced by their respective performances Curtis's accent comes and goes and you can see him straining to act seriously in the first half of the film  however he improves as the film progresses and ultimately convinces by the ending. Poitier is again forced to adopt a degree of racial stereotyping notably his crooning of the plantationtype song but his acting is more consistent than Curtis and for me more enjoyable. However as stated above the idea that these two the racially prejudiced Curtis and the proud Negro Poitier could get along for more than five minutes never mind pour out their collective hearts along the way as they get all philosophical and universal on us is too much to swallow.In support Cara Williams is fine as the abandoned country wife desperate for love and a future with Curtis there's an excellent dissolve shot as their relationship is consummated but what a difference it would have made to the dynamics of the film if she had fallen for Poitier instead  not of course that such a storyline film could ever have been greenlighted at the time while Theodore Bikel is excellent as the pursuing sheriff who retains his humanity refusing to bow to the pressure of his posse to bring the wanted duo back more dead than alive. The petty squabbling of the pursuing pack together with the lynchmob mentality of a small outpost where the convicts are caught seeking food are obviously thrown up as contrast to the developing getalong relationship between the escapees but as I indicated it was shown in too sharp relief.Certainly a worthy and wellmeaning film but too unbelievable and portentous to really hit home at least with me.".

Curtis and Poitier play well off each other and make their change from hatred to caring seem realistic. Also it was fun to see Lon Chaney in a rare dramatic role and he was great! It was well directed by Stanley Kramer and won a welldeserved Oscar for cinematography. But all in all I found this boring heavyhanded and slowmoving.

After seeing it I thought perhaps the critical acclaim was to do with the TVM remake that starred Robert Urich because this is a film so melodramatic and dated that any cynical audience member will either fall asleep through boredom or throw popcorn at the screen A truck carrying members of a chain gang crashes and a couple of convicts escape . The cops leading the hunt are shocked to discover that the authorities have in their infinite wisdom shackled a white guy to a black guy . You might have thought they might have been more surprised that considering the spectacular crash the two escapees manged to run away without a scratch between them The action cuts to the two felons on the run John  Joker  Jackson and Noah Cullen and just in case there's any blind people in the audience who haven't realised that Tony Curtis is white and Sidney Poitier is black they call each other all sorts of racist names . At this early point I knew instantly where the story was going so all the name calling seemed superfluous in the end and to be blunt I was never convinced that these characters would exist in reality  in fact I couldn't believe they were characters at all  just a couple of actors playing roles And as the story went on I realised I was getting battered over the head with the message  Racism is wrong and we should look beyond the colour of a persons skin in order to survive  . Thank you for pointing this out but I would have come to the same conclusion without it getting rammed down my throat . If the movie had been subtle then I would have regarded it better but that's the problem it's not a subtle movie at all  It's an often ridiculous melodrama best summed up by the ending which is both entirely predictable and laughably illogical".

With the sheriffs hard on their trail Cullen and Jackson find that there mutual dislike for each other is only one of the obstacles between them and freedom.I have seen this film before and had memories of it as a classic of sorts. However a very well known black n' white film with two big stars shouldn't be seen as a classic simply on those merits and I must admit that my memory had tricked me as this wasn't a great film.  The plot had potential but it focuses too much on the bigger metaphor rather than the story unfolding there and then.  As a result chases through swamps lack tension as the film wants to make the wider point of the black experience' or how blacks and whites need to get on etc.  At the time it must have been brave and a point that needed making it probably still is an important point but now it just feels like the film has been chained to a heavy partner that slows it down.Part of me felt that maybe the director wanted to labour his message so that everyone got it another part of me felt that he should have trusted his audience and not rammed it down our throats at nearly every step.Tony Curtis is pretty good.  In some scenes he is given a bad hand to work with but he is certainly a lot better an actor here than his current spoof of himself' appearances would suggest.  Poitier can't sing but he does act with passion and makes his character more than a black man' which was very important to the film.  Their bickering seems to switch quite easily and their redemption is perhaps a little unlikely in it's degree.Overall it is worth seeing as it is an OK film but the message is delivered in a very heavy fashion that really takes a lot more away from the film than it adds.  The pace and energy of the opening 30 minutes is lost to heavier scenes that deliver the message' and then very talky scenes  the point' could easily have been made within the film rather than expanding and taking it over to it's detriment.".

In some scenes he is given a bad hand to work with but he is certainly a lot better an actor here than his current spoof of himself' appearances would suggest.  Poitier can't sing but he does act with passion and makes his character more than a black man' which was very important to the film.  Their bickering seems to switch quite easily and their redemption is perhaps a little unlikely in it's degree.Overall it is worth seeing as it is an OK film but the message is delivered in a very heavy fashion that really takes a lot more away from the film than it adds.  The pace and energy of the opening 30 minutes is lost to heavier scenes that deliver the message' and then very talky scenes  the point' could easily have been made within the film rather than expanding and taking it over to it's detriment.";

	schema:reviewBody "Possibly Stanley Kramer's most famous directorial entry THE DEFIANT ONES is the story of Joker Jackson Tony Curtis and Noah Cullen Sidney Poitier two toughasnails convicts who are accidentally freed when the truck that transports them overturns.  But they are not freed from each other for they are linked at the wrist by a twofoot chain.  Now Jackson a redneck white racist and Cullen a bitter and resentful black man from a povertystricken family must cooperate if they are to escape.  There is a subplot that follows the sheriff's posse pursuing them but it is poorly developed and serves mostly to slow the movie down.THE DEFIANT ONES gets its strength from the study of the two leads' changing characters.  Sidney Poitier's bravura performance as Cullen earned him a welldeserved Best Actor nomination.  Cullen is no saint but his resentment comes across as heartfelt never as whining.  Poitier's timing is superb at one point he breaks out laughing at Jackson's fumbling efforts to ignore him at the exact same instant that I did.  I am not a fan of Tony Curtis and he is frequently guilty of overacting here but he undeniably sparks excellent chemistry with Poitier and with Cara Williams also the lonely abandoned wife with whom the two fugitives take shelter. The twofoot steel chain will stand alongside the Maltese Falcon and the One Ring as the best plot devices in cinematic history.  It is fascinating to watch a link of respect and mutual reliance grow between the two men more durable than the physical link.  The best line in the movie now unjustly forgotten comes after the chain has been removed.  Cullen raises his bare wrist and encourages the injured Jackson Come on Joker you' draggin' on the chain!Samuel Leavitt won a merited Oscar for his sharp glowing cinematography. Jacob Smith's and blacklisted Nedrick Young's screenplay also won an Oscar but that choice is more questionable for every good line there is an artificialsounding clunker and one of the climactic plot twists is painfully predictable.  But they do deserve credit for their ending which is warm and yet completely avoids the feelgood Hollywood denouement that I was expecting.  The supporting cast's attempts at Southern accents uniformly stink the only standout is Lon Chaney Jr. as a compassionate exconvict.There is much to dislike about the DEFIANT ONES but much more to like. Kramer did well with this movie but he did better on his lesserknown efforts JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG and INHERIT THE WIND.".

They are pursued by a posse led by Sheriff Theodore Bikel. After several adventures they are captured.The plot is sketched out schematically. Every scene makes its point then we move on to the next scene which makes ITS point until the two men are lying exhausted next to the railroad tracks and resigned to their recapture Curtis still resentful Poitier defiantly cheerful both doomed.The point of the film  and I hate to say this  is that we are all brothers under the skin shackled together by our common humanity not to mention our physicality.The plot is tightly wound and the points spelled out so that they can't be easily missed  like Stagecoach or High Noon. Nothing and nobody is in the least bit ambiguous or quirky. There's the humane sheriff the rabid redneck crowd the bitter inmates the horny widow the suspicious kid and so forth.I'd consider that a weakness but it's made up for by the depth given to some of the characters. They may be stereotypes but they're pretty hominid after all. Take that horny widow for instance. Here she is isolated in a ramshackle house in some Southern state deserted by her husband left with a kid who shoots rabbits for meals. She's shallow selfish and something of a racist. Yet she seems attracted enough to Tony Curtis despite his phony nose to give up everything gather her dollars together and run away with him. It's an invitation to share her future. And there's no reason to believe she's especially fickle or that he's less than just an instrument to get her away from her stagnation  although he IS an instrument. The widow needs a man to jump start her and Curtis has done it. She's a complex person and ultimately kind of pathetic.The movie today would have been shot in the real South. As it is it looks like California in the rainy season. Those granite rocks to which the pair cling as they make their way across that rushing river look distinctly as if they'd tumbled down from the Sierras which they have. The little flakes of mica that scintillate under the California sun seem to be winking at us. Let's all pretend that this is the hinterland of Georgia or someplace. It doesn't kill the movie. It's just a distraction as is the unbelievably formulaic lynch mob.Stanley Kramer directed this and as usual he's trying to teach us a lesson the way a teacher teaches the ABCs to a kindergarten class. It seems condescending to us now fifty years after its release but it was necessary for some of us in 1958. Maybe the lesson is still relevant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dogfight captures the feelings of the mid to late 1960's in San Francisco. It accurately shows the characteristics of young U.S. Marines destined for Vietnam.  They are insensitive and cruel to the young women they invite to the 'Dogfight' because of their youth and the situation they find themselves in as G.I.'s.  Being in the Air Force during this period I could relate to their crudeness as a posture taken by some young men as a defense against their environment.  Being insensitive was a way to deal with their situation over which they had little control.  The movie also accurately portrayed how young G.I.'s bond with other young guys who in civilian life they might not have bothered to befriend.The love story involves a girl invited to the 'Dogfight' a contest to see who could bring the ugliest girl and the young Marine who brings her.  She breaks through his shell of indifference and they become friends and lovers.Lilly Taylor and River Phoenix are terrific.  Their characters ring true and my wife and I cared very much about what happened to them.Phoenix's return to S.F. after his tour in Vietnam was just as I experienced it.  Although I was not returning from overseas when I returned the Bay Area in 1969 I discovered that the San Francisco of 1965 was totally gone and replaced with a foreign land.'Dogfight' is accurately nostalgic for those of my generation and perhaps older.  Younger viewers get to enjoy a truly good love story.  They also get a glimpse of life as a young G.I. during that uniquely explosive period of change and social upheaval in America during the middle to late 1960's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dogfight is a little gem that is so often overlooked in so many ways. The most obvious is that people today often only watch this film to see River Phoenix an actor we all so sorely miss but most often unless you are a real hardcore fan this one is not the one you rent to see him in.  The usual famous films of his career My Own Private Idaho Stand by Me etc. are always rented first and although these are great films none of them are as subtly beautiful compelling and important as Dogfight. Stand by Me comes close.  And I've seen every one of River's films.  He turns in a touching and believable performance as usual but the best surprise of this film other than the sure handed direction is Lili Taylor.  She is so likeable an so touching that you end up arguing every point she makes. She will always make you smile.  The story is very dark and not romantic yet it's also an out and out love story.  In my opinion it's also the best war film ever made.  This being said about a film with only one war scene.  I say this because unlike other war films you get to know and love these young marines and understand their world then realize how these men's worlds are shattered by the fight the true tragedy of a war.  The onscreen chemistry between Lili and River is so nonexistent at first glance that it's overwhelmingly pure and true.  This is how two people with nothing in common yet everything in common would act together.  And the sequence where Eddie goes off to Okinawa after his night with Rose with the great folk music of the era playing is like a beautiful dream we all have a dream we never want to end.  The same is true of the beautifully orchestrated ever so gentle sequence in the music room at the fair.  You never want these two people to pull away from the embrace.  I do not enjoy romance films but I don't think there is anyone who could dislike this film because it is so real and belivable.  I've never seen a film that is so moving yet not corny or sappy in ANY way.  And it has one of the best endings in film historythe only way a real love story can end unknown.  It allows you to contemplate and figure out for yourself what's goin to happen for these two characters in the future something also so indicative of the time period.  This film also has an extraordinary soundtrack with the best folk artists of the era including Bob Dylan Peete Seeger Woody Guthrie and Joan Baez for people who are interested.  NO ONE CAN MISS THIS MASTERPIECE!  It's truly unforgettable and opens you up to the awkwardness and the perfectness of love or something like it in a way very few films accomplish or even attempt.".

But what always struck me about this film is the silence  it opens very quietly with no music and only muffled voices of the passengers on a bus. Our first views of the main character Eddie are of him sitting alone on a bus and at a truck stop.  It is a perfect way to introduce a character that changes so much from beginning to end.   In fact the film starts at the end and we are allowed to see the past when Eddie reminisces all that happened to him before he left for Okinawa.  The movie has a quiet subtle way about it all the way through.  There are tender heartbreaking moments but also moments that will have you laugh hysterically.  Among the many issues the film addresses are honesty friendship forgiveness war and love.  Someone said this is not a very romantic film and I agree.  It is not romantic in the way that most romances are.  It is a decidely unHollywood approach to love which is what makes it so memorable.  The first kisses are not beautiful and elegant.  They are awkward and uncertain in the most realistic way.  They are not backed by melodramatic music but rather the music that those characters would have really heard in their own ears.  The poetry of it is that it ends the same way it began  in the quietest way possible showing that for the two characters words are not needed.".

This film is gentle and it is so real and the actors are magic on it I believe in their characters and the characters all mean something special to me. Eddie Birdlace is just a version of so many young soldiers that join up and suddenly find themselves in a culture of bragging and shagging and the loyalty to their army buddies is fiercely upheld. I was also a chubby young girl who knew how it felt to be embarrassed when a group of army boys went by and would blush under their smirks so I definitely related to Rose as well and it tugged on my heartstrings so much.

It breaks the viewer's heart to see a young woman so trusting walk into something so degrading.Without spoiling the plot for those who haven't seen the film you owe it to yourself to do so it's assumed there is always chance for redemption. River Phoenix who died tragically just two years after the film's release is memorable as a soldier who struggles with human contact.

One character a new Marine recruit out for a night of fun at the expense of some hapless female who will put money in his pocket as a result of a bet and the other character an idealist young woman who is so sincere and trusting that even I was sucked into her attraction to the unscrupulous Marine. The film's stars River Phoenix and Lili Taylor are the reason that this film works. I can think of no other young actors that could have garnered my sympathy so quickly in a story whose premise is as unappealing as it is somewhat farfetched. And by the film's end both characters are so transformed by the times in which they live that I found myself wishing for a sequel to find out how their lives turned out.

Every word of the screenplay is absolutely perfect and Savoca directs with great care creating moments of surprising tenderness like that in which Birdlace and Rose make love and other of enormous strength like that in which Rose finds out about dogfight and attacks Birdlace. River Phoenix is excellent the best actor of 90s even though he is unfortunately gone and Lily Taylor absolutely superb. A beautiful movie. I love the end in which no word is used to explain what an embrace can explain much better in a scene of extraordinary intensity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Satires are hard to come by. Good satires are much more rare. Satires that fooled everyone from the audience to the actors playing in the film are toughest to find. Jingle All The Way achieves just that. By throwing a social commentary joke over the heads of audiences instead of into their minds and then by delivering a biting message that stands just as true today as it did when it first came out Jingle All The Way went from disappointment to one of the most realistic holiday films ever despite its lack of realism. The hypocritical statements are flying in this first paragraph but the truth is almost everyone missed the joke the main picture. What looks like pure family fun turns into commentary with an attack on commercialism and the American public buying into the scheme. Even if you don't want to look into the deeper details why skip out on Sinbad and The Terminator going at it?Jingle All The Way follows a workaholic dad by the name of Howard who disappoints his wife and son year after year. After missing another karate practice Howard promises to not only show up at the parade the next day but also get his son the TurboMan doll that is based off Jamie's favorite television show favorite cereal and favorite hero. The catch is simple it is impossible to find the doll since it's a massive hit. Not only that but most shipments are not arriving on Christmas Eve notice the setting getting a bit dangerous therefore increasing the supplyanddemand. Howard is still determined to find the doll and not disappoint again. Christmas Eve turns into DDay on the shores of stores across the nation.This sort of idea has always been present in television shows everywhere but to take a simple concept and stretch it into a fulllength motion picture is a challenge to the utmost level. Thankfully we have good writing by Randy Kornfield decent direction by Brian Levant and the supervision of Chris Columbus Home Alone Harry Potter Mrs. Doubtfire Adventures in Babysitting. Looking past the seemingly heavy dosage of criticism against American society and Big Business we see the cast throw our victim fathers into every possible awful and unfortunate scenario possible and the range of ideas presented are amazing.Arnold Schwarzenegger must have a sense of humor because he isn't afraid of embarrassing himself by getting beat up and pulverized by the holiday rush a bitter mailman and a Santa Claus that can scare blind children. His performance by no means is Oscarworthy but we see him with his determination like in his usual action films but in a whole new arena a totally different atmosphere and that just adds a dosage of humor to the entire film. To see an action star have to claw his way out of a melee of people trying to get bouncy balls is priceless. Almost as rare as Schwarzenegger looking wimpy is Sinbad in a superb film. His performance as the disgruntled mailman just matches him perfectly and his determination to get the doll is just as bad. Rounding out the cast is a bunch of underrated andor Blist stars like the brilliant Phil Hartman Rita Wilson Robert Conrad and James Belushi.Why in the world would anyone want to skip a movie in which we see a rumble involving an angry dad and a bunch of Santa Claus frauds running an illegal toymanufacturingdistributing operation Best scene of the movie for sure? Why miss out on The Terminator take on a raging reindeer? Why skip out on a mailman posing as TurboMan's villain and flipping the bird to spectators during a family parade? With an endless amount of silly overthetop brilliant moments in which represent Christmas at its truest Jingle All The Way stands as the most realistic holiday movie ever since it really shows what its all about. Forget the sappy messages you see in Christmas movies it doesn't matter what you did what illegal things you performed how many assaults you have committed as long as you get that goshdarn toy for your child in Christmas it will all be forgiven.Everything in this film whether unintended or intentional downplays the meaning of Christmas and all that goes on. There isn't a single decent Santa Claus in the film they are all corrupt human beings with a different agenda. The stores are not trying to please anyone they just want money for themselves and enjoy seeing people scrap for chances of earning a doll like starving dogs fighting over a hunk of meat. The main child doesn't say he wants his dad to stay home for Christmas he says he wants a certain doll and even recites the entire commercial including the final words Batteries Not Included. Nobody is helping each other everyone is fighting pushing people towards aisles and toy displays. While the entire thing is comical it truly does happen in the real world. There was even one pivotal scene in which Byron the mailman discusses the importance of getting that special gift he compares himself to another child that got the hot item on a certain year. Byron is disappointed grows up to become a loser neighbor that gets the doll becomes a multimillionaire.Can a Christmas without material possessions scar you and turn you into a loser? Or is it Commercial America making it seem that way? Is this film a perfect satire or did it accidentally become that way? While the clues are pointing towards lampoon Levant looks like he really aimed for the heartfelt emotional Christmas movie with the bittersweet ending. Instead we get a film that predates and apparently predicts the Tickle Me Elmo Pokemon Playstation and Furby holiday horror stories. From the campy introduction to the hysterical final showdown it's a great movie for what it is and after aging like fine wine becomes something moreaccidental or not.".

If you just look at it as a lighthearted fun with the family movie then you will have fun. It does get real real cheesy at times but most of the movie is funny and entertaining. That's all you can ask for from a movie. The biggest drawback is Jake Lloyd. I have never liked him as a child actor. You could always tell he is acting and he always sounds so damn whiney. Heck behind Jar Jar Jake Lloyd is the most annoying actor.Other than that it is fun. Hey if it comes on TV pop some pop corn grab the kids and tune in!".

The soundtrack is awesome the film is not too bad to look at and the climax is a lot of fun if very far fetched. Sinbad is amusing is Myron and James Belushi is great as the Crooked Santa. Phil Hartmannwhile he has been better is hilarious as Ted the phone conversation between him and Howard is a hoot. Rita Wilson does a good job as the mother and Jake Lloyd is cute as Jamie. The film has some nice messages for kids. While the film is funny in places the humour is questionable sometimes. The film is also rather short and perhaps a tad rushed. Also Brian Levant's direction could have done with a harder edge. Still despite the failings it is a fun Christmas comedy that is not really to be taken seriously.

Plus he tried to hurt Jamie Jake Lloyd. I must say that Howard was very foolish to wait so long to buy Jamie's present. Even my parents have more sense than that! No offense to you Howard. If you ask me Liz Rita Wilson looked very beautiful in the nightgown she wore. The part that really made me laugh the most was when Howard broke into Ted's Phil Hartman house and stole the Turbo Man doll that was supposed to be for Johnny E.J. De La Pena. This was because Ted's reindeer charged at Howard and caused him to set the living room carpet on fire. That was absolutely hilarious! In conclusion I highly recommend this holiday smash to everyone... especially all you Arnold Schwarzenegger fans who have not seen it. When you see it prepare to laugh and have a good time.".

One liners and all the Terminator is here to cause laughter D This is no more no less really just a funny Arnold flick. There were a few unnecessary bad words but overall the film contains a good message. It may come out as ridiculous at first but look at it. Some things it says are true. Most of us have done the last minute Christmas hunt for a silly plastic toy. The film just shows this in a comical matter. The extreme measures these two men show to get this toy only makes for more fun.All the actors performances were nothing outstanding but just what you would expect. Considering the content of this film you can't really go anywhere but down acting wise. The actors filled their roles well and their is no one else I would have liked to see more as the father then Schwarzenegger.The film also shows how some people go all out on Christmas but they fail to get the true meaning of what it is really all about. They fail to teach their kids what really matters instead appeasing them with insignificant toys and games. The grand Turbo man display in the Christmas parade leaves one thinking has Christmas got that commercial? I guess I am taking this flick to seriously though considering how ridiculous it is.At points the over the top nature of the film such as Arnold flying in the turbo man suit left me shaking my head. However it left me laughing hard more then not. Its a good break from all the serious films that always get you down. Lets face it this kind of silliness is nice sometimes. You can just laugh out load and not worry about all the hidden meanings and such.I saw the film expecting stupidity and I got a lot of laughs! For a fan of Arnold or anyone looking for a fun laugh I'd suggest you go out and rent or buy this. Appropriate for the kids too!".

Some of the things that Arnie does as he gets more and more desperate to track down a Turbo man doll for his son are cringeworthy I'm thinking particularly of when he stalks a little girl in the ball room at the mall but they ultimately do function within the larger scope of the film.Arnold plays a father who was supposed to take care of getting a toy for his son. He's forgotten and has to go out on Christmas Eve to try and track one down. When he realizes that it is the hottest selling toy of alltime Highjinx ensue.The thing with Arnie is that you're either going to take him or leave him. If you find his accent aggravating or his acting wooden then stay away from this film because you're just not going to like it anyway. I don't think he's that bad in this and I would go so far as to say that it is probably his second most successful comedy Kindergarden Cop being my first choice  IT'S NOT A TOOMAH!!! CLassic! Ha!. He's got an excellent supporting cast in this one Jim Belushi as a seedy shopping mall Santa Rita Wilson as Arnie's long suffering wife Phil Hartman as the sugary sweet sleaze of a neighbour and of course the inimitable Sinbad. I would argue that the unlikely pairing of Sinbad and Arnie works extremely well and is probably the key to the film's success. Neither really has the acting chops to make the other look bad or out of place and so they are each able to hold their own when on screen at the same time.There is a tendency to take this film too seriously. It has a great satirical viewpoint. Who among the retail warriors can watch this film and not throw their hands up in the air saying Idiots! You've left it to the last minute and you're getting exactly what you deserve! Who among the legion of overstressed and unlucky parents can't feel some sympathy for the plight of a man just trying to do right by his kid even if it is a little too late? Jingle All The Way is a Christmas cure. It's a sharp point to puncture the over commercialism we get caught up in. This film is a chance to chuckle at ourselves and the insanity we leap into with enthusiasm annually. It is a ninety minute reality check and a chance to sit back relax and not take things so seriously. This isn't 'Scrooged' or 'It's a Wonderful Life' or 'A Christmas Carol.' It isn't the best of comedies or the best of Christmas films. But it is very honest about itself and not a bad way to spend the holiday.".

It's christmas eve and Howard has only 24 hours left! What Howard doesn't bargain for is the fact that psycho sad Mario Sinbad has got to get one for his son too! Throughout most of the movie there's basically Arnie and Sinbad nearly killing eachother to get their mitts on this Turbo Man doll and trying to beat eachother to it no matter what it takes!

	schema:reviewBody "Sigh Jingle All the Way how this film has a rating that is above the 4.0's on IMDb boggles my mind. This is one of the scariest films of all time. First off we have Arnold Schwarzenegger The Terminator he's playing this wacky almost like 80's silly comedy show type of Father Knows Best. Second I think this is the film that just gives up on us it goes from alright to stupid to silly to bad to just plain awful. Third there is nothing redeemable about this movie the terrible acting the lousy story the crappy moral behind it's shallow message and Arnold's accent granted the accent has gotten him a career but still it's disturbing the way he presents some of his lines. Not to mention that for some odd reason they put Sinbad in this movie sorry to say but he is just not funny actually no body even one of the best voice actors of all time Phil Hartmen... I can't believe he took on this movie.Howard Langston is often busy at his job and has a hard time finding time for his wife Liz and his young son Jamie  especially when compared to next door superdad divorc Ted Maltin. After breaking his word again by missing Jamie's karate grading Howard resolves to redeem himself and his marriage by fulfilling Jamie's ultimate Christmas wish an action figure of TurboMan a popular children TV superhero. Unfortunately as is the habit with him Howard has promised to buy that figure earlier that year and then promptly forgotten about it. To make things even harder TurboMan toys are the musthave gifts of the season and stocks of TurboMan toys are quickly drying up all over the country. Desperate not to disappoint his family again Howard embarks on an epic citywide quest to find the toy everyone's looking for. Along the way Howard encounters Myron Larabee a postal worker dad with a rival ambition and the two quickly become bitter competitors in their race for the action figure. The chase begins to arise the ire of a police officer whom Howards keeps running into and one of the most memorable scenes includes Howard desperately hooking up with a band of brandspoofing crooks and ending up thrashing them. In addition Ted attempts to hit on Liz which she eventually turns down hard. The search climaxes with both dads masquerading as live action stuntman in a department store parade. As the real TurboMan Howard uses the opportunity to present a coveted limitededition TurboMan doll to his son in the crowd. But before he can recognize his dad Jaime is chased around the parade by Myron dressed as TurboMan's arch nemesis Dementor.Jingle All the Way is just one of those movies that you wonder how in the heck it got green lighted. It's just so stupid I love how the ending Myron tries to kill a child to get a stupid toy for his son and all is forgiven so easily. Gotta love how TurboMan has an Austrian accent muscle bound square jaw tall... yet his own kid doesn't recognize him at all. Even the one scene that had a great joke the bomb that was wrapped as a present they even ruined that with a lousy slapstick joke that I know it was a family movie but it just was stupid. But give or take it's not that bad of a movie there are some good jokes in it. I can't give Arnold a bad review I just can't it's not in my blood as a critic. There are some moments that are very funny like Arnold screaming at his neighbor for eating his wife's cookies. Also Arnold is just too likable as well as Phil Hartman. It's a light recommendation not the worst movie of all time but just one of the silliest.110".

If you work a lot to provide a good living for your family they will complain that you don't spend enough time with them. If you spend a lot of time with them but don't make enough money you will be blamed for your inability to provide good quality of life. You can never win. Kids only want acceptance from their peers. They are sheep and followers. If you don't get the toy or in this day and age  the gadget you are destined to be an outcast. Why is it this way? Subtle brainwashing by merchants that's been going on since the beginning of times.I wish my Dad was more like yours. Yeah the grass is always greener in the neighbour's yard. If he really had that guy for a Dad I bet he'd be saying he wished some other guy was his Dad. People rarely appreciate what they have. So the kid is real ped at his Dad for missing his karate class and keeps bitching that he doesn't spend enough time with him. But as soon as you promise to BUY him something all is well again. Conclusion? Anything can be fixed with money. You're a good parent as long as you have money to BUY stuff. And... did it bother anyone else that Arnie's character used the situation he found himself in to select his own son as the winner of the special edition toy? Another observation if given choice people will inevitably do what is beneficial to them even if it harms others instead of what is fair or morally correct. Like I said maybe I'm reading too much into it or perhaps the movie does indeed have a deeper meaning.

	schema:headline " Arnold Schwarzenegger leads an all star cast in a Christmas classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to say whether or not the cast and crew of this film knew what they had on their hands when they began production in late 1995. What is easy to say however is that their combined efforts have created the defining film of the 1990's paving a way for thousands of films to follow. In history it is often hard to pin point and exact time in which everything changed forever but Jingle All The Way provides an exact date November 22 1996. In the vain of such masterminds as Spielburg Scorsese and Copolla Brian Levant ignites so many powerful emotions during the coarse of the perfected time of 85 minutes that watching this film is like discovering yourself. It brings out so much personal history effortlessly and shows us what it means to be human. Casting Director Judy Taylor shines here with her impeccable choices of future starlet Jake Lloyd and her spot on choices of Schwarzenegger and Sinbad as the leads. It is especially masterful in the casting of Schwarzenegger who seems more vulnerable here than in any other performance either he has given or any other actors in 90's cinema. The character of Howard Langston is really a powerful metaphor to the common day workingman. He is tired over worked and under appreciated. Schwarzenegger reminds us of all these traits without over acting which shows his artistic genius. Speaking of sheer genius Sinbad gives a tour de force performance as a rattled post office employee just trying to please his son. If Schwarzenegger is ying Sinbad is his perfect yang. The two play off each other's energy in an entirely unique way that has not since been repeated in film. Not only does this film have an unbelievable cast but the locations are inspired and show that there are still some cinematographers who are doing their jobs. The locations are some of the most beautiful in all of film history. The locations of the film actually take it from just a masterpiece of cinema but a masterpiece of art.

	onyx:emotionText "It is hard to say whether or not the cast and crew of this film knew what they had on their hands when they began production in late 1995. What is easy to say however is that their combined efforts have created the defining film of the 1990's paving a way for thousands of films to follow. In history it is often hard to pin point and exact time in which everything changed forever but Jingle All The Way provides an exact date November 22 1996. In the vain of such masterminds as Spielburg Scorsese and Copolla Brian Levant ignites so many powerful emotions during the coarse of the perfected time of 85 minutes that watching this film is like discovering yourself. It brings out so much personal history effortlessly and shows us what it means to be human. Casting Director Judy Taylor shines here with her impeccable choices of future starlet Jake Lloyd and her spot on choices of Schwarzenegger and Sinbad as the leads. It is especially masterful in the casting of Schwarzenegger who seems more vulnerable here than in any other performance either he has given or any other actors in 90's cinema. The character of Howard Langston is really a powerful metaphor to the common day workingman. He is tired over worked and under appreciated. Schwarzenegger reminds us of all these traits without over acting which shows his artistic genius. Speaking of sheer genius Sinbad gives a tour de force performance as a rattled post office employee just trying to please his son. If Schwarzenegger is ying Sinbad is his perfect yang. The two play off each other's energy in an entirely unique way that has not since been repeated in film. Not only does this film have an unbelievable cast but the locations are inspired and show that there are still some cinematographers who are doing their jobs. The locations are some of the most beautiful in all of film history. The locations of the film actually take it from just a masterpiece of cinema but a masterpiece of art. All in all no other film will or can make you cry laugh smile and become shocked than Jingle All The Way. This film single handedly revived the drought that the movie industry was dying from.";

A hardworking father has problems in keeping promises to his son. After a missed karate class he has to buy a Turbo man for his son but every store hasn't got them anymore. So he has to fight with everyone for obtain the damn action figure! Ending even in a parade and making a fool of himself.There are two types of bad movies. The first is the Supercheap movies like ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' ''Manos the Hands of Fate'' ''Madmen of Mandoras''. Yes this movies are made with superlow budget and they only do one thing and do it well Suck! The second type of bad movies and ''Jingle All the Way'' is the king of this category are the bigbudgeted bad and irritating movies. You feel so angry that you want to beat every single person that made it!''Jingle All the Way'' is a movie that made me feel very enraged after I watched it. The few other movies that caused me such a reaction were ''Baby Geniuses'' ''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' ''Basic Instinct'' and ''Santa with Muscles''. And with such a plot the director and producers only could had kidnapped relatives in order to force Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Conrad to star in this movie. And they must have screamed ''CRAPFEST'' while making this movie. I'll give you two examples of how annoying all the other characters wereSinbad Oh I hated him! He was so obnoxious and so unbearable that I always rooted for the ones that hurt him. Somebody should have said to Sinbad ''STOP NOONE LAUGHS AT YOU''. And I hope he ended in jail at the end of the movie!Phil Hartman the worst character put in a kids movie he was only a buffoon that acted like some sort of a stud and nearly won Arnie's wife's attentions. Yeah a good message kids! A mother superfloozy that is more interested in a bachelor only because keeps promises? All wrong folks!Jim Belushi the worst Santa Clause ever worst than Hulk Hogan!

Think of ''Ed'' ''Baby Geniuses'' ''Howard the Duck'' ''Problem Child 2'' mixed all together in a movie and written in a room of mandrills! This is the result.That's it! Nothing funny nothing endearing and nothing worth seeing in this movie. It's just stupid and I felt a idiot watching it pointless and no good for kids. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE LIKE POISON!!

	schema:reviewBody "As I reminisce my youth I feel regret for having my parents go out and get me so many different toys. It was not as if I was a spoiled painin thebutt but it was hard for them to keep up with what I was interested in. I went through a timeline of obsession with Power Rangers Pokmon Digimon and YuGiOh! cards. I cannot imagine the sheer frustration my parents felt spending their hardearned money on merchandise I would soon grow out of. I suppose my past has something to do with my sympathy for Jingle All the Way despite being a fairly bad movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Howard Langston a hardworking salesman who tries as hard as he can to spend time with his family especially his son Jamie played by child star Jake Lloyd. But every time Howard sees a great opportunity to fulfill his family duties he encounters multiple setbacks whether it is traffic or the police. On Christmas Eve Howard decides to makeup for all his troubles by buying his son an action figure of Turboman a TV superhero beloved by children all over the world He is nothing compared to my Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. However finding the most popular toy on the market during Christmas Eve proves futile. Howard is also forced to compete with another father Myron Larabee played by Sinbad for Turboman. Throughout the day Howard will face one problem after another on his quest to buy his son's Christmas present. As a comedy dependent on chaos and absurd behavior Jingle All The Way offers fun but not enough intelligence. People run into boxes containing action figures and use toys to sabotage their competitors. In real life the situation would be more moblike and hazardous with shoving and occasional fistfights. If the director Brian Levant wanted to make a point about Christmas commercialism he should have made the last minute shopping much more realistic. Speaking of which the people in Jingle All the Way are ridiculously easy to anger and they will react with cheesy lines I'm going to deck your halls and violence. If you call me a conman I simply shrug the name off maybe laugh at you for being wrong. I am not going to hit anybody. Arnold gets into fights with everybody a mall employee Santa Clauses midgets giants kids parents a cardboard stand and even a reindeer that acts more like a dog. He is better off fighting a South American army than yelling at a neighbor for eating his Christmas cookies. In this movie Arnold abandons his cool comedic catchphrases in favor of stiff sarcasm. Sure Arnold's lines are fairly comedic and he has a couple of hilarious scenes but his acting is painful to watch especially when he tries being excited. Speaking of which he utilizes his eye bulging routine in Jingle All the Way more than any other film he has ever been in. Despite his flawed performance I enjoyed watching Arnold act as a father who feels as if he must buy his son's love. Rita Wilson plays Arnold's wife Liz and she manages to pull through the movie past a few wooden instances. I have a mixed feeling towards Jake Lloyd. Sometimes Jake convinces me that he is a regular boy but at other times I am reminded that he's an actor playing as a boy. The other cast members have stereotypical roles that do more harm than good for the movie. At first Sinbad's character seems like a desperate father looking for a Christmas present until he abruptly goes off on a rant about his troubled family his oppressed race and marketing ploys. It's not a decent performance but it is strangely amusing to witness Sinbad whine and complain. Meanwhile Phil Hartman overacts his role as the Langston's perverted brown nose neighbor. He is supposed to act as the perfect kind of neighbor but he does way too much good for his fellow man. The only actor who fits his role is James Belushi as the corrupt Santa Claus but he is given too little time to bring out his goods. The movie is not as terrible as some people proclaim it to be because there are funny sequences to laugh and enjoy. A family celebrating Christmas would find Jingle All the Way stupid but entertaining to watch. The parents may raise their eyebrows but will laugh with the kids at the right moments.".

	schema:headline " The True Story is Fascinating The Movie is OK";
	schema:reviewBody "I have always been intrigued by this film mostly because of the fantasy it suggests and even obtained a VHS copy to look it over more closely. Using the  leads posted by other readers I have been able to glean the following facts from  various Internet and library resources concerning the strange tale of The Mad  Trapper of Rat River played in Death Hunt by Charles Bronsona A man referring to himself as Albert Johnson identified post mortem by associates as Albert Nelson although that was also an assumed name arrived in the Aklavik area and brought attention onto himself from a large purchase of  ammunition a new shotgun and an inexplicable refusal to get himself a trapper's license. Johnson ran afoul of a Constable Edgar Millen Lee Marvin's  character during the New Years season of 193132 after his apparent meddlings with the traps of some of the local types who suggested that he had  gone bonkers in the isolation of the mountains. b Two posses did in fact make seperate trips to Johnson's handmade cabin measuring 8 feet by 8 feet and one of the Mounties did in fact have a brief  encounter with Johnson through an open window The first time he simply wouldn't answer their knocks and the second time he shot a Mountie through his closed door with a .38 automatic. A third posse with Const. Millens then  made the 80 mile dogsled trip and blew up Johnson's cabin after he again refused to acknowledge them. c After they blew up his cabin Johnson did indeed jump up out of a foxhole he  had been hiding in firing a sawed off shotgun and a .22 repeater with the stock  removed. The Mounties retreated and Johnson slipped away in the darkness. d A resulting death hunt did indeed ensue set entirely above the arctic circle  and by the firsttime ever use of wireless radios by law enforcement kept the  public of Canada and America riveted with their newspaper and wire reports of  the two week long manhunt that was the O.J. Simpson crime case of it's day. Johnson proved a remarkable adversary using every trick in the book to confound his pursuers and managed to survive the nightly 40 tempetures with  little or no supplies or survival gear. They did manage to corner him on one occasion there was a gunfight Constable Millens was killed and Johnson escaped by climbing a sheer cliff with his bare hands in the dead of night during  a blizzard. e A bush pilot and former WW1 air ace became involved in the pursuit not only  by resupplying the posse and flying out wounded men but played an invaluable  role in tracking Johnson after he had made his initial escape using another wireless radio to vector in the ground pursuit in another law enforcement first.  He damn near well almost escaped too though he was finally cut down in a hail  of lead after keeping the authorities at bay for 48 days. f The whole case was dubbed The Mad Trapper of Rat River incident by the press owing to the locals' contention that Johnson had gone cabin happy. He was found to be carrying a 2400 bankroll when searched and I have found two references to gold teeth or gold fillings The natives of the area had a fable  about The Trapper who steals the gold from men's teeth that may have been attributed to Johnson after he was found to have some gold dental work in his  posession. Whether they were his or someone else's is unknown but their presence plus all that cash led to a rumor that he got rich by prying folks' gold fillings out. This  has never been substantiated and the Mad Trapper name was pinned to him before these revelations came to light. To this very day Johnson's actual identity  remains a complete mystery and his bid for freedom one of the most remarkable examples of man surviving the elements. NOW with that in mind Death Hunt's scriptwriters took a few liberties with the  facts to create a more romanticized taleBronson's Abert Johnson is now a decoarted war veteran trained in Special Ops which accounts for his hardiness comfort with weapons and wealth of survival skills.  The conflict with the locals is initiated by having Bronson break up a dog fight  making his character sympathetic when compared to the dirt bags who pick a scrap with him afterwards.The dog is then killed to provide Bronson with an understandable motive to blow someone's head off and escalate the confrontation. Poor doggie...

	onyx:emotionText "I have always been intrigued by this film mostly because of the fantasy it suggests and even obtained a VHS copy to look it over more closely. Using the  leads posted by other readers I have been able to glean the following facts from  various Internet and library resources concerning the strange tale of The Mad  Trapper of Rat River played in Death Hunt by Charles Bronsona A man referring to himself as Albert Johnson identified post mortem by associates as Albert Nelson although that was also an assumed name arrived in the Aklavik area and brought attention onto himself from a large purchase of  ammunition a new shotgun and an inexplicable refusal to get himself a trapper's license. Johnson ran afoul of a Constable Edgar Millen Lee Marvin's  character during the New Years season of 193132 after his apparent meddlings with the traps of some of the local types who suggested that he had  gone bonkers in the isolation of the mountains. b Two posses did in fact make seperate trips to Johnson's handmade cabin measuring 8 feet by 8 feet and one of the Mounties did in fact have a brief  encounter with Johnson through an open window The first time he simply wouldn't answer their knocks and the second time he shot a Mountie through his closed door with a .38 automatic. A third posse with Const. Millens then  made the 80 mile dogsled trip and blew up Johnson's cabin after he again refused to acknowledge them. c After they blew up his cabin Johnson did indeed jump up out of a foxhole he  had been hiding in firing a sawed off shotgun and a .22 repeater with the stock  removed. The Mounties retreated and Johnson slipped away in the darkness. d A resulting death hunt did indeed ensue set entirely above the arctic circle  and by the firsttime ever use of wireless radios by law enforcement kept the  public of Canada and America riveted with their newspaper and wire reports of  the two week long manhunt that was the O.J. Simpson crime case of it's day. Johnson proved a remarkable adversary using every trick in the book to confound his pursuers and managed to survive the nightly 40 tempetures with  little or no supplies or survival gear. They did manage to corner him on one occasion there was a gunfight Constable Millens was killed and Johnson escaped by climbing a sheer cliff with his bare hands in the dead of night during  a blizzard. e A bush pilot and former WW1 air ace became involved in the pursuit not only  by resupplying the posse and flying out wounded men but played an invaluable  role in tracking Johnson after he had made his initial escape using another wireless radio to vector in the ground pursuit in another law enforcement first.  He damn near well almost escaped too though he was finally cut down in a hail  of lead after keeping the authorities at bay for 48 days. f The whole case was dubbed The Mad Trapper of Rat River incident by the press owing to the locals' contention that Johnson had gone cabin happy. He was found to be carrying a 2400 bankroll when searched and I have found two references to gold teeth or gold fillings The natives of the area had a fable  about The Trapper who steals the gold from men's teeth that may have been attributed to Johnson after he was found to have some gold dental work in his  posession. Whether they were his or someone else's is unknown but their presence plus all that cash led to a rumor that he got rich by prying folks' gold fillings out. This  has never been substantiated and the Mad Trapper name was pinned to him before these revelations came to light. To this very day Johnson's actual identity  remains a complete mystery and his bid for freedom one of the most remarkable examples of man surviving the elements. NOW with that in mind Death Hunt's scriptwriters took a few liberties with the  facts to create a more romanticized taleBronson's Abert Johnson is now a decoarted war veteran trained in Special Ops which accounts for his hardiness comfort with weapons and wealth of survival skills.  The conflict with the locals is initiated by having Bronson break up a dog fight  making his character sympathetic when compared to the dirt bags who pick a scrap with him afterwards.The dog is then killed to provide Bronson with an understandable motive to blow someone's head off and escalate the confrontation. Poor doggie...

	schema:reviewBody "This is an almost forgotten film a status which is undeserved. Loosely based on a true story it is the tale of a lone mysterious trapper who irks some thugs in the Canadian wilderness leading to a massive manhunt by the Mounties. Bronson virtually silent throughout and thus quite effective is a resourceful target at once gentle and violent. Marvin is the grizzled head of the mounted police who has the task of tracking down and capturing a man with whom he can identify. Their unspoken understanding is fascinating to see. Marvin is aided by a wetbehindtheears bythebook officer played by Stevens. It would be hard to imagine a more adorable sight than freshscrubbed Stevens in his red uniform entering the grungy town where the police are stationed. He is gorgeous.....and quite a fine actor. It is a shame that he wasn't able to get to a better place with his acting career. The film is peppered with a ton of familiar if dirty faces from old westerns of TV and film. All of the lynch mob look like people who've been guest villain on Bonanza or The Big Valley. One major drawback is Dickinson. It's hard to believe that someone can be miscast in a role as tiny as this one but she is. Her anachronistic teased hair drains what little 1930's period flavor there is from the film and she is wooden in all her scenes. Apparently she was stuntcast because of her previous work with Marvin but it failed miserably. There is a bit of a connection to Dances with Wolves in this film Maury Chaykin and Tantoo Cardinal appear in both films and Bronson even develops a similar relationship with a vicious dog as Costner does with his wolf. The film is something like First Blood  The Fugitive x snow  40 years. It is a great example of the Bronson versus the world type of film and offers a solid Marvin performance as well. There is more going on here than one might think. The final showdown is quite dramatic and suspenseful. The scenery is also great.".

Seeing the film from start to finish I realized I had misjudged the intentions of the Marvin character. I thought the character was just another honorable to the point of dishonorable hero when in fact he's a conflicted man. During the film you can see that he knows he's as much responsible for what has happened and he's not so much interested in doing the right thing as he is in covering his own rear end.I was surprised to see in the beginning that the film is set in 1931 it seems much like a Western.

Directed by the man who helmed On Her Majesty's Secret Service and starring two of the iconic stars of The Dirty Dozen it's no surprise to find Death Hunt full of machismo. What transpires is a two part movie where time is afforded the set up for the first half and the second half features the man hunt across the Yukon landscapes. Plot basically sees Bronson as nomadic loner Albert Johnson The Mad Trapper of lore who rescues a severely injured dog from a dog fight held by baying locals much to their displeasure.

It's very much fictionalised from the real story but some instances are real including the incredible journey that Johnson undertook whilst fleeing his pursuers. Violence slots in and out of proceedings as does moments of humour and there's a nice grey area in the narrative that questions who you should be rooting for. In fact Marvin's characterisation of Millen is very enjoyable because he is irked by the cretins he finds himself hunting with. Some of the support players are under written so therefore underused while Dickinson pops in only briefly and purely as a bit of sexy relief from the machismo on show. All told it's a safe and enjoyable movie for fans of the stars and fans of outdoor actionadventurethrillers. Kind of like First Blood meets The Fugitive who then take Seraphim Falls out for a drink. Only remember this was before all those and it has Bronson and Marvin in the locker! 710".

	schema:reviewBody "From what I understand although this film has it's story's basis in an actual crime spree and chase in 1930 Canada the details including the deaths of the two star's historical characters were changed. Instead we are treated to a serious discussion on justice and survival in the Arctic circle.Charles Bronson is the mad trapper Albert Johnson who in the film if not in actual history stops a dog fight and precipitates by this action a rising tide of violence that aims at killing him. His actions annoy a bunch of yahoos in the Canadian frontier town who liked dog fights or other violent or vile types of entertainment and who are annoyed when Bronson keeps physically trouncing them. What they don't know is that he was in Canadian Special Forces in World War I and that he has highest level defense and survival skills. In short not only is he the man you least want to pick a fight with but he is less likely to be easily catchable if you chase him.The local Mountie is Sgt. Edgar Millen Lee Marvin who appears to be unconventional. He is not seen dressed in traditional Mountie uniform  that's for Nelson Eddy in ROSE MARIE which is set further south in Canada. A hard and rugged realist Millen sets his police goals to bringing in his quarry for trial or for explanation of the facts. Bronson has killed a man in the confrontation over the dogfight and the man's brutal friends several of whom were beaten by Bronson are sticking to a story that Bronson was the instigator of the incident. Due to small details Millen realizes that Bronson probably was the innocent party attacked by the yahoos but he has to bring him in to explain what happened. Unfortunately Bronson does not trust the law  his father was a criminal and recently died in a prison infirmary.Millen is accompanied by fellow Mountie Alvin Adams Andrew Stevens and Sundog Brown Carl Weathers. Adams has just been assigned to the post and has strange ideas about proper procedure and behavior for a Mountie he'd fit in nicely next to Nelson Eddy that Millen's realism in this environment just does not fit. Brown is a sensible type and also represents a feature of frontier living that was not as readily available in civilized areas to the south he's an AfricanCanadian but Marvin accepts him as a sensible associate on his mission to catch Bronson. Although there are traces of racism in the film's characters these are relatively understated in the frontier  every man proves his worth there by survival skills not by the color of his skin.As the film progresses Bronson manages to outmaneuver all of Millen's attempts to catch him although in some cases just barely. He also makes mincemeat out of the yahoos out to catch him for revenge or for a 1000.00 reward posted by two individuals who wouldn't even try to go into the wilderness to catch him on their own. The irony of the title of course is that while the yahoos look at the hunt as the death hunt to cause Bronson's demise in the end as the death toll keeps rising it is their deaths that make it a death hunt.Angie Dickinson appears in a couple of scenes as Millen's girlfriend who wishes she could keep him home safe. I suspect her role was cut in the final film editing to concentrate on the chase sequences. Her scenes with Marvin give him a chance to show a sad adherence to duty that he could not just drop even if he wanted to. What remains helped fill out Millen's character but I suspect more would have been filled out in other scenes with her.The actors supporting the lead roles are good mostly playing knaves or fools of one sort or another. Henry Beckman as an ambiguous fur trapper who may or may not be helping Bronson is quite good as is Scott Hylands as an arrogant Royal Canadian Air Force pilot who discovers to his cost that while he represents a mechanical future  that Millen wisely says he wants no part of  the wilderness is quite unforgiving to mechanical failure.".

	onyx:emotionText "From what I understand although this film has it's story's basis in an actual crime spree and chase in 1930 Canada the details including the deaths of the two star's historical characters were changed. Instead we are treated to a serious discussion on justice and survival in the Arctic circle.Charles Bronson is the mad trapper Albert Johnson who in the film if not in actual history stops a dog fight and precipitates by this action a rising tide of violence that aims at killing him. His actions annoy a bunch of yahoos in the Canadian frontier town who liked dog fights or other violent or vile types of entertainment and who are annoyed when Bronson keeps physically trouncing them. What they don't know is that he was in Canadian Special Forces in World War I and that he has highest level defense and survival skills. In short not only is he the man you least want to pick a fight with but he is less likely to be easily catchable if you chase him.The local Mountie is Sgt. Edgar Millen Lee Marvin who appears to be unconventional. He is not seen dressed in traditional Mountie uniform  that's for Nelson Eddy in ROSE MARIE which is set further south in Canada. A hard and rugged realist Millen sets his police goals to bringing in his quarry for trial or for explanation of the facts.

If one wonders why Canadian movies are so lame about failure disease depression weird humor I would say it is because culturally we have an aversion to examining ourselves in a critical fashion whereas other countries do it quite naturally. England has made films about notorious murders same with Australia or Germany Tenderness of the Wolves and of course the US. This story would have been perfect material for a domestic moviebut I can find no evidence that Canada ever sought to make this story themselves. I can understand with the stars involved that they dramatized it and changed the facts but if it were done with no stars and kept to the historical story it still would have been fascinating. But the government film funding bodies don't like stories that present Canada in a negative light. At least in the English sideI know Quebec has covered stories on its history in fictional fashion. I remember the furor over a Canadian murder case when a Canadian producer wanted to make a film about it and was harshly condemned so the US made itand Canadian crew people vowed not to work on it. This is seriously screwed up thinking. If Canada wants to develop a normal film industry it needs to be less reserved and more selfexamining.... On the film itself I agree with the sentiments that you wouldn't see this film made todayand if you did it would star modeltypes. Character actors have really gone extinct. Some of the melodramatic touches in the film worked for me the dog the trapper Bill others fell flatthe inserted love story. Still Bronson was effective you could totally believe he was a rugged mountain man and Marvin had some good lines I am sure Canadian government culture ministers would have axed his comment calling the trappers savages if it was made in country.".

Needless to say they soon enough show their true colours as well as the rest of their crew who turn up and begin to make more trouble. They kill the old man's dog and trash his house and needless to say revenge is in order as the man must now struggle to stay alive as they begin to hunt him down in the hopes of trying him for the murder of some of the dirt bags he had to kill to defend himself. It was a true joy for me to watch him take them all out one by one and to witness what the smarter hunters did at the end in order to save their own lives.

As a kid at least we Americans were taught that Mounties were straight arrow heroes a concept that has lasted right down to the television series from the last decade Due South.Apparently Andrew Stevens has been brought up that way as he reports for duty to Sergeant Lee Marvin up in the Yukon Territory. Marvin's an old and tired Mountie but a real professional at his job. Better let these men who live in a forbidding landscape train fighting dogs and bet over them than start killing each other. Because when that happens he has to go to work in earnest.Because that's what happens over a trivial incident involving a trapper saving the life of a fighting dog that Ed Lauter owns. I'm surprised that Lauter didn't see in Charles Bronson's eyes that this was not a man to trifle with. I guess he figured there was safety in numbers because he goes after him with friends.It gets to be one bloody bit of business as Mounties Marvin Stevens and Carl Weathers and a host of bounty hunters go after Bronson. Only Marvin understands him respects Bronson for his skill at being able to live off the land and says quite frankly that if he had been in Bronson's shoes Marvin would have behaved exactly as he did.Death Hunt is one fine acting duel between Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson even though they only have one scene together. The cinematography of the forbidding landscape of Alberta standing in for the more forbidding landscape of the Yukon is beautiful and spectacular. I think Lee Marvin wins the duel but not by much. His Mountie sergeant is one of his best characters ever brought to the screen.I liked Andrew Stevens also. That scene where Ed Lauter makes a very direct pass at Stevens is shocking because it comes from nowhere. This is a place where women are scarce but Stevens isn't about to substitute. Based on a true incident from the Thirties in Depression Era Canada Death Hunt bares somewhat of a resemblance to the Kirk Douglas film Lonely Are the Brave. But this one was done on a much bigger budget. Catch it if all possible when broadcast.".

It is hard to say what my favorite scene is. I think the scene towards the end when everyone is on Johnsons heels and he jumps from the cliff to the tree. then bounces from limb to limb on the way to the ground then makes a clean getaway. Yeah I think that's it well enjoy this one.I believe it still rivals todays most action packed blockbuster.".

The movie is loosely based upon an actual incident that happened in Canada. The film is basically a showcase of Charlie Bronson's wide range of acting abilities. A trapper has a spat with some locals. When push comes to shove Charlie decides to take matters into his own hands and he has to deal with not only the locals but the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Can Charlie survive the locals The R.C.M.P. and the elements? This movie is not a classic but it's a nice little action movie. The violence will satisfy action fans and the photography is excellent. Charlie gives his character some humanity and depth to what would ordinarily be considered a wild mountain man he also gets to say some cool lines and blasts away at some local ruffians. Lee Marvin costars as the Head Mountie and Carl Weathers and Andrew Stevens costar as well as his fellow mounties. Angie Dickenson guest stars as well.Recommended.".

Other than that all of their confrontations were long distance. Too bad.The rest of the cast is also very good especially Carl Weathers and the scenery is spectacular.

It's engaging throughout and the finale was really excellent plus Charles Bronson is simply amazing in this!. If your expecting a lot of action look elsewhere however if you want a slow but engaging film that will give you suspense and thrills look no further!. The character development was excellent and i loved the grisly feel and location it had plus i was rooting for Bronson all the way!. Ed Lauter played the asshole real well and i thought the ending was very well done plus the chase scenes are very exciting and suspenseful!. i had somewhat high expectations for this and i wasn't disappointed as it delivered everything i wanted suspensethrills and great acting!. This is a very solid Bronson film that's suspenseful and well made i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good. Peter R. Hunt does a very good job here with excellent camera workusing a great gritty location great shots of the mountains and scenery and keeping the film at a very engaging pace!. There is lots of blood and violence. We get TONS of extremely bloody gunshot woundsquite a few gory gunshot wounds to the head bloody corpses and bloody wounds. The Acting is awesome!. Charles Bronson is AMAZING as he always was and was amazing here he did not have much dialog but i loved his silent character it made his character very mysterious and he was really excellent in the acting department!. Bronson Ruled!. Lee Marvin is Fantastic! here he is very likable had some great dialog loved the mind games between him and Bronson and he was just too cool! he was a fantastic actor. Andrew Stevens is decent here but got on my nerves somewhat at times as the rookie Mountie still he got the job done and was quite bearable for the most part. Carl Weathers is fantastic as usual but not quite his amazing self due to not having that much to do still he was quite funny and was awesome when on screen! Weathers Rules!. Ed Lauter is great as the asshole and did a really excellent job at doing that i hated him. Angie Dickinson is wasted here and didn't have anything to do at all really. Henry Beckman was good as the weasel. Rest of the cast do good. Overall i highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5".

Aerial shots of abrupt snowy slopes contrast with the ground shots where actors happen to run on a mostly flat soil with little snow most of the time.Thus the chase looks more like a veteran's trekking in the mountains. Peter Hunt was supposed to be an innovative editor but he constantly failed to prove he could edit pictures in his head to achieve remarkable results as a director. All the chase sequences feel disjointed shot at various locations. Bronson is in sight then he escapes and then again he seems cornered by the Mountie posse soon joined by the improvised bounty hunters coming out of the wild simply catching up with the unrelenting chase ok Bronson is supposed to zigzag and the plane helps to locate him very closely but little is done to make this a consistent narrative feature.Eventually it's a poor rendition of a fantastic true story only because the guys involved took the pedestrian path to a Death Hunt in the Arctic wilderness.

Unfortunately previews sole raison d'etre apparently is to get people into the theater. It doesn't seem to matter in the least to these people if the expectation generated by the short is totally out of sync with the experience given by the film.Thusly it is easy to understand the plethora of reviewers who were livid with these bait and switch tactics!

	schema:headline " Horrible film about horrible people";
	schema:reviewBody "Everett Mulroney takes his uptight city girlfriend Meredith SJP home to meet his family for Christmas. His family turns out to be the biggest bunch of fake hypocritical horrible and judgemental people you'll ever meet and have decided even without meeting Meredith that she's unworthy of any hospitality.Let's think  boyfriend brings you home to meet the family  anyone would feel nervous. However when Meredith greets the family in a slightly shaky voice it is only further proof that she's not freespirited enough to join their happy clan in the hills. I'm not sure why exactly the family did not like her but I THINK it may have something to do with the fact that she was super polite and tried to be respectful. I mean no doubt the family would have accepted her in a sec if she pranced through the door ripped her clothes off and asked them to join her around the fire to smoke pot.The horrible sister Amy McAdams says she hates Meredith because Meredith once took her to a nice restaurant and she also likes to clear her throat. Let's remind Meredith to bring Amy to a back alley for dinner next time and keep the phlegm gargled at the back of her mouth. The mother Keaton joins in the fun as is also horrible Ben Wilson the hippie brother falls for Meredith at first sight so we can assume that his love for her is shallow and only physical and starts hitting on her despite the fact that she's his brother's girlfriend. Etc.There's also the gay deaf brother who has a black boyfriend. This very brother tells Everett straight on please don't marry her Meredith although he has known the girl for less than 24 hours. You'd think he'd understand the importance of being supportive and nonjudgementalMeredith eventually calls her sister Julie Danes in for help. Julie is the opposite of Meredith  she's free spirited and is probably the president of the save the whales while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro club She falls off the bus and she doesn't even care!!. Everett falls for her at first sight so again we assume this is only physical because he knows nothing about her. Way to go Everett fall for your girlfriend's sister on the day you plan to propose to her!! Immediately the family flocks to Julie like flies to a carcass while Meredith is helping with dinner and is lonerised in the corner. At the dinner table and this is the scene which made me so upset for Meredith that I ACTUALLY cried Julie asks the gay brother questions about what race he wants his adopted child to be since he's in an interracial relationship. Julie touches on the issue of race and everyone smiles giving it the that's a very good profound question nod. Then Meredith brings up the topic of homosexuality asking if he thinks it's going to affect the child. OK maybe she didn't phrase it well but it was obvious she was NOT being a homophobe If she WAS homophobic would she be eating dinner with 2 gay men AND spend the entire afternoon with the gay black guy in the kitchen??. Meredith is surprised by the fact that the mother says she wished all 3 of her children would be gay and the family immediately labels her as the disgusting narrowminded ahole yes and the father even yells at Meredith. Funny that When Julie asks the family sees her as being curious and interested but when Meredith asks she's offensive and rude.Naturally Meredith runs out in tears. Ben runs after her while the BOYFRIEND just sits there. Julie doesn't look too bothered either and instead of seriously looking for her the two end up having a pleasant little walk in the snow talking about their dreams and goals. It's disparing that Ben the brother who's known Meredith for only a couple of days seems to be more concerned about her wellbeing than her own boyfriend and sister. Everett even has the audacity to ask Julie if she wants to go get a coffee while Meredith is still missing!!! Meredith spends time with Ben get a coupla beers and suddenly turns freespirited she lets her hair down!! REBEL! Then we know what happens they end up in the same room though they don't sleep together and Everett realizes he loves Julie. Everett tries to get Julie to try on the wedding ring he intended to give Meredith. When Julie kinda refuses he almost forces it onto her finger...romantic. I find it even more disturbing though that as a sister Julie didn't go up to Meredith and say something like dude your boyfriend is totally hitting on me. Instead she starts to feel that she also loves this strange man that she's just met the day before though there is no indication of any type of relationship development between the two. Finally everyone confronts everyone and then follows the typical everyone starts fighting they all fall down and start laughing out loud together and then it seems that all the meaness from before is forgotten and everyone becomes best friends forever.Meredith ends up with Ben and Everett the ahole ends up with Julie the ahole. Meredith seems to be TOTALLY OK with that and neither the sister or Everett seems to feel bad at all note the two began flirting with each other while Meredith was still going out with Everett. Who cares Meredith will have the joy of telling her nephews and nieces I your auntie slept with your father.And inbetween all of this we find out the mother has breast cancer. So there's a lot of crying from the family then a lot of meaness then a lot of crying then a lot of you get the idea. I'm still confused as to how the cancer bit fits with the romantic comedy".

	schema:reviewBody "If that sounds positive then that's not how intended for it to seem. First I'm glad I didn't buy the DVD. Seeing the cast I was tempted to get it but thought perhaps I should watch it first. This is one bad movie. Yes it has the usual clichs and a lot of it resemble 'Meet the Parents' and it sometimes tries to be 'The Royal Tenenbaums' but it has an unusual twist which only makes the film far worse. Anyway starting with the good things is that it 'looks' polished and has a good cast. That's it.The bad? The writing. The characters are not likable halfbaked and onedimensional neither the relationships between the characters nor the characters themselves are well developed. I mean Everett was extremely quick to fall in love with his girlfriend's sister what the hell? love at first sight? and that too while he was still dating AND about to propose to Meredith. Then in another scene Meredith too realizes after a couple of shots that she's free spirited and becomes so immediately. Meredith's sister Julie too doesn't seem to care much of what her sister is going through and the two get together right after her sister breaks up with him. Everett's brother Ben too in one glance realizes that Meredith is the woman for him. This whole switching with partner's sibling was icky to say the least. The whole family seem to be against Meredith when they have never met her before they hardly give her a chance and they behave extremely rude to her. even though in the beginning she's hard to like Meredith later on does make some effort. Yet they immediately like her sister Sarah. How ridiculous! Oh there's too many wrong with this film and I think I've listed enough.At the same time the film tries to juggle too many themes. It tries to touch them lightly but only make it more clichd. I mean there's a gay deaf brother a more laid back brother a bitchy sister and a normal sister a sick mother and a father trying to hold it all together. It all becomes a mess during that one dinner table scene when Meredith brings up the issue of raising homosexual children being a challenge and the whole family including her boyfriend who's supposed to know her treat her in an unbelievably hostile manner and when she leaves the room all upset her boyfriend just sits there while the brother rushes out to comfort her. Some viewers have mentioned that the family was under a lot of stress due to the mother's breast cancer which is why they projected all the negativity towards Meredith. Yet they are the perfect host to Sarah. Here I go again pointing out the flaws.Anyway the cast is good and I watched the movie mainly because of the cast. However with such poorly written roles on top of that none of the characters have any likable trait it is hard for the characters to really impress. The Stones really seemed like a family thanks to the talented actors all of whom share a good chemistry Craig T. Nelson as the father Rachel McAdams as the mean sister Tyrone Giordano as the calm brother Luke Wilson as the mellow one Dermot Mulroney as the older brother Elizabeth Reaser as the married pregnant sister and Diane Keaton as the loving sick mother. Claire Danes's Sarah Morton looks forced and sadly she can't do much with the horrible part. Sarah Jessica Parker shows shades of her famous Carrie Bradshaw persona but she's quite okay as the uptight girlfriend.Anyway I'm done with analyzing this horror. It's sad to see such a great cast wasted on an atrocious film. I wonder how the makers got them to do this.".

The only actor who fails to make an impression is Claire Danes who can't do much with the underwritten role of Meredith's sister Julie.The Family Stone is not a groundbreaking movie but it goes beyond the fishoutofwater clichs that its plot might suggest. It finds the emotional truth as well as the humor in Meredith's situation. Plus it's extremely evenhanded all of the characters are flawed but likable and in a climactic argument at the dinner table both Meredith and Sibyl make valid points. Reviewers on this site have accused the movie of pushing a liberal agenda via its sympathetic portrayal of an interracial gay couple and a semibohemian familyand of pushing a conservative agenda via its portrayal of the Stones as hypocritical liberals who pay lip service to tolerance but are prejudiced against people like Meredith. Personally I'm not sure if The Family Stone has any agenda other than to cast good actors in a holiday comedydrama that doesn't insult its audience's intelligence. And it succeeds pretty well at that.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS WITHINFor some reason I thought this movie would be similar to The Royal Tenenbaums  a story about a lovable charming quirky odd family coming into contact with an uptight professional wardrobe queen. Excellent set up right?But the movie starts going downhill from the very first minute never gets better and left me wondering why all these otherwise decent actors chose to associate themselves with such an awful awful script.Nothing that happens in this movie makes any sense. Now for something to make sense in a movie it doesn't have to be realistic. You can believe a winged dragon is going to jump in and save the day at the very end as long as  and this is key here  that point is set up earlier in the script. By establishing characters' motivations and history the audience will slowly clue into the crux moments of the script where those characters have to make decisions  based on their past experiences  that influence the outcome of the film.There wasn't one character in this movie that had any background information established before they started making key decisions. Things happened and the audience watches uninterested because from the very beginning of the film we aren't given any reason to care.The Stone family hates Durmot Mulroney's fiance played by SJP. The audience has no idea why because the film never sets up any organic reason for it. The characters merely EXPLAIN reasons they don't like her which does not a movie make.Halfway through the film we're clued into the fact that mom has cancer. If this was supposed to be a pinnacle moment it merely further confuses the plot as the audience is left wondering why if someone in the family were about to die everyone would be so trifling and petty.Enter Claire Danes. Again for no reason. From the moment she clumsily falls off the bus line that drags her into the Stones' life acting as the complete opposite of her uptight sister we see the plot thickening so obviously that I was tempted to fast forward through the obligatory sentimental conversations that had to follow wherein Durmot Mulroney sees Danes' sensitive side I'm an art grant writer... and this totem pole touched me so deeply.It's almost an afterthought that he falls in love with Danes Luke Wilson marries SJP and the next Christmas everyone lives happily ever after except mom whose dead but who really cares anyway.What made this movie especially bad was the Home Aloneesquire music that forced joviality at moments when the Stone family was trifling a horrible section of Christmasgone horriblyawry pratfalls wherein the entire family gets covered in eggs and turkey in the kitchen ha ha ha.However the handsdown worst part of this film were the shallow characters. Diane Keaton's mother was defined by coffee she had a favorite mug and she hated it when people took the last coffee and didn't make more. Rachel McAdams as the sister was supposed to be a liberal collegetype but was nothing except a basketful of laundry and an NPR logo gives this away. Otherwise she's just a petty brat. Luke Wilson's character is utterly confusing  at first he's rather creepy forcing his affections on SJP then he's a pot head with a Love and Rockets poster in his room then he's a doting husband.And worst of all is Durmot Mulroney whose character development or lack thereof the movie centers on. What we finally begin to understand only through horrible dialog is that The Family Stone doesn't want Durmot Mulroney to marry SJP because he isn't being true to himself. If this would have been at all clear in any kind of setup to the movie perhaps perhaps The Family Stone could have had a bit of redemption. As it is it did not and therefore this movie is one of the absolute worst films of all time.".

THAT'S how ridiculous unbelievable and choppy this movie is. I really thought we lost the first halfhour or so because SJP enters the Stone family household and they immediately hate her. I thought oh well we must have missed the huge leadin to that. NO! There was no leadin. The family just flatout hated the girlfriend of their son for no reason at all. Once I realized we didn't miss the first few scenes I knew this movie would be disastrous.It actually gets worse! The entire family is too large that by the end of it I still couldn't figure out who was related to who who was that 6 year old anyway???? They did not need such a large cast and I did not get to know ANY of the characters or get to like ANY of them at all except Luke Wilson who was sweet. by the way I have to call the actors by their real names and not their character's names because I don't even think we were introduced to all of them by first name. One of the women I guess she was a daughter??? her husband showed up for a total of 16 seconds of the movie. The film is so degrading even though it is trying to be politically correct. They make such a huge scene around the deaf son and his black husband that it completely goes against whatever P.C. statement they were trying to make.I can't even get into how ridiculous and utterly disturbing the 2 romances are. And I forgot about the cancer!! That came out of left field. All of a sudden the evil mother has cancer however we're still making SJP feel like crap because that's more important. This was an extremely inappropriate look at someone suffering from cancer. Besides that it did not add to the plot line at all and instead complicated the story even more so than I ever thought this mess could be complicated.This film is such a completely tangled mess of untied plot lines undeveloped characters and no real genre that it just leaves you feeling MAD you spent any type of money on it at all. I also feel sorry for Rachel McAdams and Luke Wilson  I'm sure they regret their decision to act in this disaster after seeing the final product. Avoid at all costs.".

She is dating Dermut Mulroney and is going to visit his family for Christmas. BUT WAIT! DERMUT's FAMILY is the most screwdup and liberal bunch of hippies on the planet! THE Dad TV'S COACH!and the son LUKE Wilson! totally smoke pot together And the daughter is a serious intellectual we know this because she has a backpack from NPR. Man NPR backpacks super selfrighteous hippies And One of the sons is GET THIS! A Deaf Gay man with a Black Partner Oh SO Taboo! Unless you have watched 'IN THE COMPANY OF MEN' By Neil Labute or have .5 braincells.. HOW WILL SARAHJessica Deal with THE FAMILY STONE? She's so stuck up and anti social and Unlikeable! The family is far too liberal for her. they won't possibly like her.AND SHE'S RIGHT! The entire family already decided that she is horrid and stuck up before she even walks into the door and treat her like garbage by not making her the slightest bit welcome in their home for Christmas for no apparent reason other than the fact that they are complete Jerks! But don't worry! Luke Wilson the stoner brother falls in love with Sarah Jessica and treats her like the woman she should be. And Durmont Mulrony isn't even ANGRY because He just asked SARAH JESSICA'S sister CLAIRE DANES why are you in this film? TO marry him even though he has only known her for under 12 hours. So its okay. Nobodys mad. And wouldn't ya know it?! DIANE KEATON has breast cancer for apparent reason. And She likes to show off the huge scars on her chest where they cut off her breasts. Thats not massively disturbing or entirely uncalled for especially since they deal with Cancer in the most uninelligent way possible.Thats not even all of it. They have a bunch of retarded Polltically Correct conversations about homosexuality that might only be controversial and not utter garbage to the religious right who will most likely disregard it anyway. This film is insulting to Liberals Homosexuals People with cancer Families people with brains etc. etc. Seriously I think this film joins the ranks of the TOP 10 WORST FILMS ever.".

I hated that the siblings switched lovers that was really stupid and i don't think it worked right at all!!!

I need to emphasise how shocked I am at the absurdly high average review rating but I should qualify my comments with some evidence. I could probably do a minutebyminute massacre of this film yes EVERY minute was worth a good napalming but for the sake of the readers I'll keep it brief and in order of heinousness 1This film may have been sponsored by the KKK for the extent to which it manages to undermine good liberal qualities. The whole point of liberalism is accepting that people may have an opposing values to your own without thinking they should be hanged for holding such views. The family's unrealistically immediate hatred of Meredith and their cruel treatment of her when she has done nothing to actively offend them is totally incongruous with the potsmoking Benetton models that formed the family. 2 Why in God's name would you want your child to be gay? Why would you actively WANT your child to be ANYTHING?? Its logically as bigoted to say that you wish for gay children as if you said you absolutely didn't want your children to be gay. You wish for happy children regardless of their sexual orientation. 3Sarah Jessica Parker was completely unable to break out of her Sex and the City character which meant that when she was acting uptight it seemed completely unbelievable. Her supposedly 'drunken' scene was some of the worst acting I've ever seen. It was like the popular girl at school being in a school play acting drunk but not doing any of the embarrassing things i.e. slurring very BAD dancing that would actually make the drunkenness realistic for fear of looking bad. 4Stupid formulae which are completely condescending to the audience. e.g. At the beginning Meredith  uptight  hair scraped back in bun...BUT at the end...Meredith  more relaxedin love  hair loose and down 5Horrible script trying to be like Royal Tenenbaums type of quirky but completely failing. Does any mother ever comment to a complete stranger that a certain guy has 'popped' her daughter's 'cherry' in front of said daughter? Come on. Why does laidback Ben fall in love with Meredith  because he wants a challenge or because he dreams of 'being the snow' that Meredith shovels. Oooh how arty. Eat my shorts. 6Meredith's sister and the fianc are a pair of whores who think they're lives should mimic some stupid French novel where people fall in love over a schmaltzy story set in some country where people are foreign and therefore can be patronised that would be us viewer. And you can swoon over the fact that Meredith's sister is such a great person that she'll come to the Stone family home to comfort her completely terrorised sister  what a catch. Oh except that she's a complete cow who takes her sister's fianc regardless of her three minute hesitation and doesn't go out to see if her sister's OK when they hear her car crash in the driveway. Twice. Hmmmmm. And her hair is far too shinySo disappointing...the worst film I've EVER EVER seen".

The discomfort felt by Sarah Jessica Parker's uptight career girl as she spends Christmas with her partner's closeknit New England liberal family is used to good effect but as much awkwardness is felt as a result of their jibes as by her tactlessness so she's not marked out solely as a stooge. Dermot Mulroney Rachel McAdams the best thing in Wes Craven's 'Red Eye' Luke Wilson a much better actor than brother Owen and Diane Keaton also give fine turns and Craig T. Nelson  another much underrated character actor  is perfectly cast Keaton's husband. It's occasionally sentimental as certain family secrets are revealed but never in a sickly manner and works principally because it's that rare Hollywood beast a genuinely well written ensemble piece.

Cinematically it was nothing impressive but the writing and the acting was quite good and the end actually made me cry that's pretty hard to do. It is a rare movie where I can honestly say everyone in the cast did a great job. And the screenwriters did a great job too. One problem with a lot of Hollywood films for me at least is the unbelievability of the characters or the onesidedness of characters. All of the characters in this film were believable and had good and bad aspects to them. I guess if you are looking for a more fantasybased storyline this wouldn't be the film for you. The interactions are all very realistic and it plays out like a realistic holiday that could occur in just about any family. You won't come away from the film learning any great deep lessons but you will come away feeling entertained and wishing that you could keep in touch with the characters to see where their lives take them.".

I thought it would be a heartwarming movie about misunderstandings and the mutual awkwardness of meeting your inlaws.What the trailers left out was the fact that the family hates their prospective daughterinlaw Meredith without ever giving her a chance. That they are irritating people who use their gay deaf son and his black husband to bait outsiders into saying or doing presumably bigoted things. I'm fine with the fact that diversity is represented here but I hate how dialogue about that diversity is squelched instead of brought out. That despite their violent hatred toward intolerance they are some of the most deeply prejudiced intolerant vicious unsympathetic people of all. And their prideful malice is directed toward an obviously insecure woman with no real faults other than being overly concerned about making a good impression. Let's get one thing straight. Having annoying tics does not make someone a bad person. Being uptight does not make someone a bad person think Monica on Friends.Throughout the movie I was waiting for Meredith to get her comeuppance like Ben Stiller's character does in Meet the Parents. It never really comes. Instead she learns to be more like them and they basically get away with what they want. The lesson is gang up on people who are different than you and they'll come around.I truly want to know why some people have such nice things to say about this movie. None of the characters is likable or even realistic. They are rude and unfriendly to whomever they want and cloyingly sweet and warm with each other. They judge the new girl based on appearances and social class and make no attempt to hide it. And the women especially are cliquish bullying belittling and can strip down any shred of selfworth she may feel. And the cruelest of them all is played by Rachel McAdams.Wait a minute this is starting to sound familiar ...".

The Previews of The Family Stone seemed to hold out the promise of a genuinely light and thoroughly amusing comedy perhaps a bit overthetop but focused on the cultural differences between a very liberal family giving the impression that the parents were perhaps Hippies back in the 60's and a superconservative and tightly wound woman engaged to one of their sons.The problem is that the film showcased in the theatrical trailer plus the marketing campaign launched to promote it vs. the actual movie you see in the theater have absolutely nothing in common!

It doesn't seem to matter in the least to these people if the expectation generated by the short is totally out of sync with the experience given by the film.Thusly it is easy to understand the plethora of reviewers who were livid with these bait and switch tactics! At its core Family Stone is much more of a serious film that attempts to underscore the importance of cohesive family life and how family unity can overcome obstacles that initially seem insurmountable such as sharing and then getting over the pain of the loss of one of their own.The cast is remarkable. Sarah Jessica Parker Luke Wilson Dermot Mulroney Claire Danes Diane Keaton Rachel McAdams and Craig T. Nelson. Almost all of them renowned actors who conform a superb ensemble cast.

I saw the trailer and thought this movie must be O.K with that kind of cast no actoractress can save this disaster. I seriously disliked every minute of this movie. The story and characters were unbelievable unrealistic the whole thing just made me angry. I didn't watched the whole movie but I read about the ending and it was just as I though it would be it sucked. The fact the Julie ended up with Everett and Meredith ended up with Ben is ridiculous! Julie which supposed to be this caring and supporting sister didn't even check on her sister when she stormed out crying and crashing the car twice outside of the house. Everett the boyfriend did not go after his girlfriend but his brother Ben did. Then Everett and Julie go outside together looking for Meredith after they all finished dinner and Julie was reading some book to some kid on the couch like she been in the family for ages which turns out to like they are on a date walking around the town instead of actually looking for Meredith If I wrote about all the bad things in this movie it would take me forever. I have never been so mad after watching a movie that I didn't finish watching. I just had to write my frustration somewhere and I want to warn everybody that haven't watched this crap yet.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so awful that I decided to write this after viewing it on TV one day I was sick and awake at 1AM. I am liberal and so I didn't have any problem with the 'stoned' qualities of the family portrayed in the movie. SJP acting is really good and I disliked her character so much when I saw this movie about 6 years ago that I sided with the Stones.But I guess I have left my adolescent mindset and it is clear now how this 'liberal' family is a horrendous set of petty minded people. I could watch only an hour this time and being sick I didn't have too much else to do so that says pretty much how much I disliked the characters.We are supposed to be charmed by the quirks of this dysfunctional family but the way they humiliate SJP's character Meredith is appalling to see. She escapes from the Stones' house and registers in a hotel after calling her sister to come for help. But in the scene when she is waiting for her boyfriend to drive her to the hotel Luke Wilson's character shows up to give her a coffee in a mug that belongs to his mother who hates her !!! while doing this he is insinuating her physically and obviously hitting her he even tells her he had a dream with her! Then Meredith's sister comes and she is immediately welcomed by the Stones she seems to prefer them to her own sister anyway. After the sister asks a very awkward question to the gay couple and survives Meredith feels confident to ask another awkward question failing miserably. But at this point the family is so over the top unlikable that I was on Meredith's side at this point. Meredith is humiliated again and she tries to escape again but she collides with a tree and in that moment neither her sister or her boyfriend runs to support her. Luke Wilson's character acts as the saver and they end up having a sort of date which end with them sleeping together without sex. When Luke Wilson's goes away with Meredith her boyfriend ends up having a date with Meredith's sister who doesn't seem to care to much about her sister or about being romanced by her sister's boyfriend! There are other points of the plot that are contrived and don't make too much sense if you are nonjudgmental with uptight people. Curiously this time I found Meredith the most likable the only likable perhaps character in the movie. With all her faults she was only a snobby uptight girlfriend trying to fit in her boyfriend's family.The epilogue of the movie is unbelievable and only tries to be a feel good moment. I couldn't believe that this movie got so many good reviews when it was just released but I liked the movie then too so I guess this movie is likable when you are as judgmental as the Stones and think that that gives you a license to be a jerk with uptight people.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first review I have written but I feel obligated as this movie was so perfect for its genre. I'm not saying it is an academy award winner but as far as inspirational age appropriate and inspiring family movies go if simply won't get much better than this.Let me start by saying that I have a child with a physical disability and during his second surgery his school class gave him a book about Winter. This was way before the movie and I had never heard of Winter. My son age 5 who loves fish and sea life was instantly taken with the idea of a dolphin that was special like he was. We read the book many times and even at the hospital we promised that someday he would get to meet Winter.About six months after his surgery we traveled to Clearwater from our home on the opposite Florida Coast 4 hour drive. When we arrived we found the aquarium there very sparse and not all that impressive. That said they were majorly renovating due to the money that they were paid to make this movie even though it still wasn't out yet. That said Winter was well worth the trip. She is every bit as inspirational and real as what you see in the movie. I'm only bringing this up to focus on my movie review. This is for anyone that thought the movie was over the top sappy or cheesy. I'm sorry but that part is true and to not make it look that way would be virtually impossible. Winter gives hope to people with special needs. My son even made her a card and got to hold her special tail.The other features of the movie like the boy finding her and probably many other aspects are creative license. She was actually found by a boat on the East coast of Florida. But I don't think that really matters. When we went there even with no movie and met Winter we knew that she was a movie star.The movie itself was well produced wellacted Morgan Freeman was very good and took on difficult themes subtly for young children. I guess the best comparison to this would be Free Willy however that story was pure fantasy and simply not as good of a movie in any way to Dolphin Tale.I highly recommend this movie for any family especially anyone with a disability. And as far as the barely believable and possibly sappy plot sometime real life is like that and that is a good thing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Inspirational films are often difficult to review. The movie is inspirational for a reason therefore it's usually telling a story of someone making the best out of a bad situation. The problem is that no one wants to be the person to say the movie isn't worth watching. Thankfully Dolphin Tale isn't one of those movies. Dolphin Tale tells the true story of Winter a dolphin who due to a very unfortunate accident loses her tail and the group of people who help her to survive despite her handicap. Director Charles Martin Smith best known for his roles in The Untouchables and Never Cry Wolf takes a heartfelt story and presents it just as is. The movie's lead is a young actor named Nathan Gamble who plays Sawyer Nelson. . Gamble is surrounded by high level talent which you usually don't find in movies of this type Ashley Judd plays Lorraine Nelson Sawyer's mom Morgan Freeman working alongside of Judd for the third time plays Dr. McCarthy a VA doctor tasked with trying to create a working prosthetic to replace Winter's tail and Harry Connick Jr. is doctor Clay Haskett who runs the Clearwater Marine Aquarium and along with his team is mostly responsible for saving Winter's life. Judd provides an endearing charm as Lorraine and her enthusiasm shines through. There couldn't have been anyone better to play Dr. McCarthy than the great Morgan Freeman. Freeman gives credence to Dr. McCarthy and thanks to him not being in the right frame of mind his dedication to creating a new tail for Winter. The charismatic Harry Connick Jr. gives a stellar performance providing Sawyer with a role model. Cozi Zuehlsdorf makes her acting debut as Hazel Haskett Sawyer's best friend. Along with Sawyer the two of them work together to make some magical happen. Zuehlsdorf's shining personality and adorable smile along with her chattiness reminded me of what makes my own daughter so special. Not to be overlooked or forgotten Winter the Dolphin plays herself and is a wonder to watch. Dolphin Tale teaches and inspires in so many ways. It teaches us to not judge anyone that may be different it teaches us that family is forever it inspires us to be role models it inspires single parents to keep up the great work and most importantly it inspires those that have set back to never give up. Winter's story is an incredible miracle. As I sat between my son who's almost 8 and my daughter who is 5 I couldn't help but well up with tears at the determination of these extraordinary people as they all went above and beyond in the hopes of saving a fish yes I know that dolphins are mammals and are not really fish. At the end of the movie I asked my kids how they liked it and they both said that they loved it. They then asked me how I liked it and my response to them was I think that may have been my favorite movie so far this summer. I no longer have to think about it it IS my favorite movie so far this year.Grade ABe sure to check out Winter at www.seewinter.com and then check out our website at www.twodudereview.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Inspirational films are often difficult to review. The movie is inspirational for a reason therefore it's usually telling a story of someone making the best out of a bad situation. The problem is that no one wants to be the person to say the movie isn't worth watching. Thankfully Dolphin Tale isn't one of those movies. Dolphin Tale tells the true story of Winter a dolphin who due to a very unfortunate accident loses her tail and the group of people who help her to survive despite her handicap. Director Charles Martin Smith best known for his roles in The Untouchables and Never Cry Wolf takes a heartfelt story and presents it just as is. The movie's lead is a young actor named Nathan Gamble who plays Sawyer Nelson. . Gamble is surrounded by high level talent which you usually don't find in movies of this type Ashley Judd plays Lorraine Nelson Sawyer's mom Morgan Freeman working alongside of Judd for the third time plays Dr. McCarthy a VA doctor tasked with trying to create a working prosthetic to replace Winter's tail and Harry Connick Jr. is doctor Clay Haskett who runs the Clearwater Marine Aquarium and along with his team is mostly responsible for saving Winter's life. Judd provides an endearing charm as Lorraine and her enthusiasm shines through. There couldn't have been anyone better to play Dr. McCarthy than the great Morgan Freeman. Freeman gives credence to Dr. McCarthy and thanks to him not being in the right frame of mind his dedication to creating a new tail for Winter.

A lot of it is true although they have hollywooded it up. I saw it in 3D. I think the cinematography was beautiful. The colors were very vibrant. Winter is an inspiration to us all.

A dolphin Winter needs a new tail to survive a crabtrap entanglement and 11 year old Sawyer Nelson is the new friend to help her through the adjustment. His job show us that being excited about something worthwhile is the answer to school blues and mother loss. The film is aces at showing that being engaged in helping a living being leads to success and happiness.A slew of other goodwilled people help Winter from likeminded friends to doctors to grandpas. And that's the sweet point of the film emblazoned on an allpurpose Swiss Army knife Family is Forever. With two crucial families needing a mother in one and a father in the other family extends to the community that nurtures children adults and animals. Not only does a Clearwater Florida marine rescue hospital need financial support to continue so also does a crippled soldier and Winter. The figurative connections are obvious but still carefully entered into the drama so as not to heighten the sugar content.Besides any movie that includes Kris Kristofferson as a benevolent grandpa and Morgan Freeman as a caring prosthetics doctor can't be all bad. For a supposedly sophisticated film critic I'm veritably childlike in the presence of these accomplished actors. BTW Ashley Judd as single mom gets my attention as she always does.Yet that Winter she's all any man could want smart and silky with mysterious eyes that seem to say With our help you men will make it just fine. No man bashing in this film just recognition that communal charity and mutual respect will win the day.Something about this Disneyesque retro children's adventure makes me happy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Dolphin Tale is very inspirational and uplifting. It teaches us not to give up when all seems hopeless. Winter lost her tail and the aquarium was poised to close down due to financial issues. After the aquarium exhausted all possible options they had to sell the aquarium but no other centres are willing to accept Winter. The last option they have was to put her down peacefully. Despite the hopelessness young Sawyer Nelson played by Nathan Gamble refuses to give up. After witnessing a mother and her little girl who has only one leg were willing to drive hours up from out of town just to see Winter Sawyer came up with a brilliant plan that can save this handicapped dolphin. Although Sawyer failed many of his school subjects he is indeed brilliant. His mom was surprised by his knowledge commitment and intelligence brought forth by what he was interested in.There are many lessons that we can take from Dolphin Tale. One of the many lessons is that children who may not seem bright at first just needs to find a subject of interest to them in order to display their intelligence. Moreover miracles do happen but sometimes we need to persevere long enough and never give up before we are able to see it happen. Dolphin Tale teaches us that there is hope even when all seems hopeless.Dolphin Tale neither has a typical villain nor a big climax. It is simply an inspirational movie that I find to be emotional entertaining and captivating. It is children friendly and excellent for the whole family to watch. I was astounded by this movie and I highly encourage everyone to watch it. The actors and actresses truly deliver. Moreover I am once again dazzled by Gamble's acting as he brilliantly portrays the character of Sawyer Nelson. I look forward to his future projects and I believe he will continue to rise in the film industry.".

Much of the film centers on the kid his family  which includes a single mother and an athletic cousin wounded in battle  and the aquatic caretakers lead by Henry Connick Jr. and his young daughter.Things drag till the kid meets Morgan Freeman while visiting his cousin at a Veteran's Hospital. Freeman who creates prosthetic limbs for wounded soldiers is the man who gives the dolphin its new tail several in fact.Winter violently rejects all prototypes till the very ending when it all comes down to the line.Directed by American GRAFFITI alumni Charles Martin Smith this is more melodrama than adventure but flows decently enough and most importantly children will take interest.For More Reviews httpcultfilmfreakreviews.blogspot.com".

I am so pleased to see CMA get the recognition they so deserve for all the good work they have done over the years. No doubt they will continue to work miracles as they have done with Winter and her friends!! Don't let the PG rating hold you back from taking the little ones. My two kids under 7 did just fine. In my opinion could very well be a G rated movie.".

Winter has an amazing thriving nature to her and shows us how to be compassionate loving and caring. I cried tears of joy seeing her overcome her disability and showing others that it can be done.

It was uplifting and encouraging for all of us especially friends who have loved ones in the military who have suffered loss of limb and more! and still find hope in part due to motivational films like this one!! There is a strong message of courage perseverance and hope throughout!! We also enjoyed the child actors Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff  both were excellent and it is encouraging to see homeschooled children make a splash in Hollywood without stooping to badwords and disrespectful attitudes as the catch for drawing viewers! Although the young boy character Sawyer begins the movie with a troubled attitude and dislike for school we watch his interest and passions evolve throughout the movie which leads to an attitude improvement toward his Mom as well. Also enjoyed Morgan Freeman's performance as the compassionate and caring Dr. McCarthy. Really every actor performance was topnotch in my opinion! We recommend this film for everyone!!".

Unfortunately that drama is so elementary that I could not take it seriously and the actors did not make too much effort to make it credible with the exception of Morgan Freeman.In conclusion I think I would have preferred to see a documentary about the dolphin Winter instead of this forced melodrama which adds too many tangential ornaments to what should have been a simpler story. However as I mentioned on the beginning Dolphin Tale did not bore me and I think that it is more palatable than many modern animated films or than any rehash of Twilight or Harry Potter for the kids who are hungry of another fantastic franchise. In that aspect Dolphin Tale is more worried about its story than about the marketing something which is enough to make it worthy of a slight recommendation despite having an artificial and recharged screenplay.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a nice little inspirational movie that had a relentlessly positive message and an exuberant talented cast led by Morgan Freeman Ashley Judd and Harry Connick Jr. to boot. While the title and the poster already tells you what to expect the movie actually had a multi layered plot all of these substories drive home the same positive message of hope and redemption in the face of adversity.The main story of course is that of Winter a young dolphin whose tail got caught and seriously injured in a crab trap. Sawyer a young boy with school and father issues grows very attached to this dolphin that he saved. When Winter's tail was eventually amputated Sawyer sought the help of the prosthetics expert at the veteran's hospital to come up with a prosthetic tail so the dolphin could swim normally again.To thicken this simple and straightforward main plot the script gave us several supporting stories. We get the story of Sawyer's older cousin Kyle a swimmer who tragically lost his leg in the war. The very marine hospital itself where Winter was confined was in trouble with its sponsors and was threatened with closure. The very community of Clearwater Florida where the story happened also had to face the wrath of a calamitous cyclone. We get to witness how these broken people had the will to rise above their difficulties and move on with their lives.There was of course no surprises anymore how this will end. However the story telling was engaging without being too pushy or cheesy with its message. The kid actors were very natural and not annoying especially the young man who played Sawyer Nathan Gamble. I think it is a very good family film where important lessons about life can be learned by all. Once in a while it is quite refreshing to watch a happy positive film so reinforce the belief that not all hope is lost in this seemingly sad and cruel world of ours.".

The movie does veer a bit into the boy and his beloved pet territory that might get parent cringing that their kids are going to want dolphins for Christmas or dolphin rides or whatever the amusement park version of it is.

We ALL loved this film and could not stop talking about it after we left. Like others I'm also not sure why it's PG I think it easily could be G.Part of what attracts me to 'living' stories is that these are timeless in appeal to all generations. When there are times of life 'tests' we can reach for the images and meaning of these stories for hope and inspiration. Dolphin Tale is such a tale...and in this true story of 'Winter'  the dolphin there is a moment when an important decision had to be made given a life 'test' and in this process a classic was referred to by the grandfather Kristofferson in order to help guide this decision. It is a reminder to all parents and educators to read to our children from all types of works including great classics that paint these vivid images in our children's minds.The other thing I liked about the story aside from it touching my heart and yes tears will be shed is that the main girl Cozi Zuehlsdorff in the story in home schooled and in no way is there any negative connotation. We see the benefits of what this looks like in her world and it shows the importance of how in education philosopher Charlotte Mason's words Education is the science of relations. Learning is meant to be taught in a way that creates a love for lifelong learning and how this love is interdisciplinary. Charlotte Mason believed that drearydawdling lessons stultified a child's wits and blocked hisher intellectual progress. I love the film example of the classroom teacher teaching content and method and how it did nothing for this film's other protagonist Nathan Gamble Luckily this protagonist was able to experience an example of 'homeschooling' and luckily Nathan Gamble's character's original classroom teacher witnessed these fruits so that he can hopefully change his meaningless classroom content and delivery methods that affect many of our nations' children.Another reason I love this film....I just LOVE LOVE Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd's performances.

In fact other than Will Smith I find it hard to think of a singer I like to see in a movie this film as 2  Kris Kristofferson is also a character. In this movie Harry Connick is able to make up for what I thought was a terrible performance in Independence Day even beside the aforementioned Will Smith he couldn't pull off making me believe he was a military pilot and no I didn't think he was good in Hope Floats but did like him on Will and Grace. As for Kristofferson he hasn't played a character I've liked voice work excluded since 1978 when he was the lead in Convoy.Based on a true story it's easy to think you can take a kid to the movie and check out since you know the ending. Unanimated you're probably thinking that you won't have to pay attention to get the adult humor that hopefully flies over kids heads that come with today's animated films and is intended for the parents that also have to attend. Let me help you  stay awake through the whole thing. Yes the dolphin steals the movie never work with kids or animals especially when they're cute and talented but the other characters are worth watching. I knew the ending but in this movie it's the journey you take in getting there that's worth the price of admission.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the best movie of 2011. It is dramatic comedic fun emotional all at the same time and does it all very well. It is very family friendly appeals to kids very easily also it appeals to adults very easily. It also has a strong pull for veterans and disabled people. People can relate to a dolphin with a prosthetic tale and the main character's cousin who comes home from war with a disability. The acting is top notch. I have to say the young lead Nathan Gamble really stuck out as the best of the bunch. He acted every scene and every line and every expression to the 't'. He has a bright future as an actor and will have no problem become as well known as star as his costars are now. Morgan Freeman was his usual fun and endearing self with a whimsical twist. Ashley Judd was very good as usual. The other young costar Cozi Zuelsdorf made a very good start with her debut role and should succeed should she choose to go on acting. Harry Connick Jr. was a fun character and made his usual top notch performance he even got to flex his musician muscles for a scene. Winter the Dolphin who plays herself will even captivate your attention with her own unique personality. This movie is a hearfelt fun dramatic and inspiring movie. People may compare it to other aquaticthemed movies but once they've seen it they will agree it stands apart as unique and wonderful. I would give this movie a 20 out of 10 but this site won't let me. So 1010 all around especially for young Nathan Gamble!".

It may not have much depth but it is the sort of movie that can entertain people at all ages. The story is linear and simple. Basically it is about a boy who develops a bond with a dolphin named Winter and is dedicated to helping the dolphin with a lost tail to swim again. The story does build on simplicity but it still manages to be touching at certain moments. The story develops at a moderate pace. There are some underwater scenes in the film and the effects are nicely done. This film also does not disappoint people who have paid for 3D tickets.All in all Dolphin Tale is a good family film for the weekend.".

Apparently our main character is sad because he has to go to summer school for some reason. His brother says some clich inspirational words and then is off to honorably serve his country. Anyways he is off to summer school or whatever when he is riding next to the beach where he sees a dolphin in distress an old man helps him contact animal rescue services where they save the dolphin and bring it to the Generic Aquatic Animal Facility that's name isn't important enough to remember. Our character is curious and skips school to see the dolphin the dolphin he shouldn't really have an emotional connection to but does for plot reasons.The boy actually BREAKS INTO the Aquatic Animal Rescue Whatever Facility to see the Dolphin only to advance the plot. Why would a minor break into an Aquarium I know not. He then meets a geeky marine animal loving girl who doesn't immediately report the intruder for some reason and lets him see the rescued dolphin. They then get caught by the dad uncle what ever figure who is OK that a minor broke into his Aquarium. Blah Blah Blah the boy has more of an emotional connection to the Dolphin blah blah. Apparently the dolphins name is Winter or something that will make you AWWWWW That's SO CUTE like the movie tries to do the entire time but Winter has a terrible tail injury and it needs to be amputated because reasons.Meanwhile our main characters brother has had a terribly injury with a munitions bunker or something and has paralysis in his legs. This is the part of the movie that's supposed to be emotional because the Brothers injury represents the Dolphins injury or something that barley has a remote connection until THE ENDING CREDITS but whatever. Apparently our main Characters Brother is ashamed of himself because joining the military was the only way his family could pay for the main characters supposed Olympic swimming future or something. The rest of the movie has Morgan Freeman and our main character trying to make a prosthetic tail for Winter and more fabricated drama and a vomit worthy overly sappy music number.Also a few scenes in the movie are about when the Mother finally discovers that her son has been skipping summer school to see the Dolphin. This is where it gets stupid. The bratty main character whines and cries about how she will never understand the MAGIC of Winter and the Mom changes her mind because her kid cried a little and then goes to the summer school teacher and says that her son is having a more enriching experience with a dolphin that he is at school learning about Mathematics History and Science that isn't marine biology. The teacher is consumed by the sappy narrative and caves in and lets our Character go to the Aquarium INSTEAD OF going to summer school which was probably a district order but whatever when you have an overly emotional dolphin movie why need reality right? The Dolphin doesn't wear the tale properly and throws it off. This causes the Generic Marine Aquatic Life Rescue Center and Aquarium Learning Marine School or whatever the heck its called to predict Winter will die. Then they make a new prosthetic tale that the Dolphin learns to swim with and doesn't have to die.But oh no the Aquatic Marine Life Rescue Learning Center Extravaganza Animal Hospital is having Financial issues but Winter is so adorable people everywhere want to see it and the admission revenue saves the Facility.In the end the Dolphin lives the kid gets to skip school and the Magic Animal Hospital And Aquatic Display Learning Aquarium Facility doesn't go out of business.YAY.The only memorable part of the movie is AT THE VERY END which shows WHAT REALLY HAPPENED its a lot less dramatic I can assure you. It shows how people with prosthetics relate to the animal in a therapeutic relation sort of way which relates to the munition incident back in the film.Honestly this film was made about a little known Dolphin that receives a prosthetic tale. I am pretty sure the thing about the kids relationship with the Dolphin is completely fabricated sappy garbage made to make a quick buck off unsuspecting parents and preteens.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even better than Trading Places. I will only spoil the first 20 minutes. Nick Beam well played by Tim Robbins is an uppermiddle class white man with a pretty wife a successful career in advertising and a nice home. His marriage seems happy but one day he comes home early and sees his wife straddling another man in their bed. He doesn't say anything. She doesn't even know he was there. He finds his boss's cuff links on the way out and therefore realises that it was his boss whom his wife was on top of.After driving in a daze at about 20 miles an hour Nick Beam wanders into the ghetto. This is where Terrance played by Martin Laurence attempts to mug him. Well Nick Beam is so depressed that he really doesn't value his own life and takes Terrance for a little ride.The rest of the movie is filled with their crazy adventures. A few robberies and Tim's gradual transformation into a criminal. There is a hilarious scene where Tim has a spider on his head freaks out and... well you'll see. That scene alone would have made the movie worth watching even if the rest were terrible. But fortunately there is plenty more wacky adventures for these two before the twist at the end.Most of this is comedy but it does get a little serious at certain parts. How could the producers contrast the lives of a welltodo white man with a struggling black man from the ghetto without going into social injustices? Nick Beam accuses Terrance of laziness and wasting his time robbing people instead of finding a job. Terrance never goes into details but just tells Nick not to judge him. Then Nick discovered several rejection letters to Terrance from potential employers. Furthermore Terrance a mugger has a wife and kids and he seems to be a good father to them. It looks like Terrance is more than a common thug.Lastly I complement the musical choices. The spider dance scene was to the song I think its called 'The Scott Man.' Something like that. Its funny. Later in the movie Pachebel's 'Canon' is played. The song at the end of the movie is a rap to the music of 'Canon.' I don't normally like rap but I liked that very creative.I give the movie a perfect 10. Its not a copy of Trading Places at all but it does have a similar theme rich white guy poor black guy. This is one of the few movies that has made me laugh uncontrollably for more than a few seconds at a time. If you haven't seen it watch it and you will watch it many more times after I guarantee.".

It's simple like most other mismatched buddyflicks but this movie has a certain bit of extra which not in the least thanks to its fine solid cast.Thank goodness it's not the type of comedy that forces its humor upon people. The comedy of the movie is more in the chemistry between Martin Lawrence and Tim Robbins. Yes it sounds weird but Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence are really a great screen duo with some nice comedy chemistry that get themselves into some fun trouble when by coincidence embarking on a sort of roadtrip together. Like in all roadmovies some crazy characters popup. The most sensational one's in this movie are being played by John C. McGinley and Giancarlo Esposito who form a criminalduo. The diversity of John C. McGinley as an actor is amazing. Just look at the list of movies he has done and the characters he has played.But the greatest power of the movie is the chemistry between the two main actors and their individual comical skills. Tim Robbins is a great serious actors who just happens to like doing comedies as well from time to time. But on top of that he also really has talent for the genre. He knows how the deliver the lines in the right way and knows how to time his moments. Martin Lawrence also has been the sort of comicalactor who fun with his dialog. As a standalone actor and when he needs to carry a movie on his own he just isn't good enough but when he teams up with another great comical actor for example as was the case with Will Smith in Bad Boys he's truly at his best and most fun to watch.The story unfolded nicely and slowly. Nothing got forced and things just happened as they came along such as always is the case in roadmovies. It at the same time also makes the movie surprising or at least not as predictable or formulaic as most other comedies. The movie has a couple of greatly buildup moments some more subtle than the other but always fun and in some cases even hilarious to watch. Look out for Irma P. Hall as Martin Lawrence's character's mother! It's true that the movie doesn't live up to its fine fast paced start but nevertheless the movie remains fun to watch throughout.It's a movie surprisingly well worth seeing!710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

He was wonderful in this movie even though it didn't really demand a lot of talent.A man Robbins finds his wife in bed with his boss and after being almost robbed at gunpoint comes up with the genius idea to steal his boss's fortune. Along with Martin Lawrence he becomes a criminal mastermind.Martin Lawrence is a great comedian on film. Black Knight and Blue Streak are both wonderful and this film is no exception. His show Martin was less sophisticated but luckily he has shied away from that. The writerdirector is Steve Oedekirk originally I believe a writer for In Living Color after being discovered on Star Search. He's now best known for Kung Pow! Enter the Fist and Ace Ventura When Nature Calls and you'll find more of that stupid but clever humor here.The film's use of music is funny if poorly conceived. One scene involves an impromptu dance by Robbins to Scatman which should be stupid but proved some chuckles. Odekirk cameos as a security guard who likes to sing and dance which plays into the plot very well.Add the very sexy Rebecca Gayheart Michael McKean and John C. McKInley who seems to guest star in pretty much everything and you've got yourself a quirky comedy with a very diverse and talented ensemble cast. This will likely not be your favorite film and you might not even remember it a year from now but it's certainly worth at least one shot. Because heck Tim Robbins can do no wrong.Oh and if you like vulgarity there is a very funny scene where the Fword is used nearly fifty times in a two minute span. So that's fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film after seeing a short advert for it on television I remember finding it funny I'm glad I watched it a second time to get a better opinion on it directed by Steve Oedekerk Ace Ventura When Nature Calls Barnyard. Basically Nick Beam Tim Robbins is an advertising executive who thinks everything is going well in his life until one day he comes home sees a pair of cufflinks on the side belonging to his boss and overhears who thinks is his wife Ann Kelly Preston having sex. Nick presumes that his wife is having an affair with his boss Philip Barlow Michael McKean he is now on the edge of a nervous breakdown and drives around the city unsure of what to do next. On the way carjacker T. Paul or Terrance Paul Davidson Martin Lawrence jumps into his car and attempts to rob him turning the tables on the muggers he kidnaps T. Paul and drives him to the Arizona desert. When things calm down after Nick unintentionally robs a gas station Nick explains the situation to T. Paul Nick then has the idea to get revenge on his boss by robbing him. Nick and T. Paul devise a scheme to break into the office and steal a large amount of cash Nick knows the combination to the safe the best time to enter and where to go and T. Paul has knowledge of security system weaknesses how to avoid cameras and picking locks. Another criminal duo Davis Rig Lanlow Scrubs' John C. McGinley and Charles Charlie Dunt Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito are blamed for the gas station incident they pursue Nick and T. Paul back to Los Angeles they have a confrontation and Nick ends up getting shot in the arm. Nick and T. Paul make it back to the city and begin the plan there are some small mishaps along the way as they enter the building and a security guard Steve Oedekerk spending a few hours dancing to music in the office while the pair are hiding and waiting for him to move on. The situation gets worse as Rig and Charlie who swiped Nick's business card and followed them hold them up and steal the money and place T. Paul in a predicament but Nick manages to get away. Nick decides to call Ann to confront her about the cufflinks he found and the sex he heard she confirms she is not having an affair the cufflinks were left behind after a Christmas party and he actually overheard Ann's sister and her fiancee having sex. Filled with remorse Nick rescue T. Paul and they catch up to Rig and Charlie in the alley they manage to outdo the criminals and tie them up for the police to find and arrest them. Nick insists on returning the money to the safe assuring T. Paul that the security footage will not be checked unless something is missing stolen or damaged but T. Paul wanted to use the money for his family they end up in a fight and angrily part ways. Returning to work Nick is told by Phillip that a fertility statue was damaged they are reviewing security footage Nick tries to stop them from seeing the part where he removes his mask but thankfully the footage was recorded over by T. Paul. Nick goes to see T. Paul and confirms that the incriminating footage was removed they make amends and in return Nick tells Phillip that is he is looking for an electrician to work in the office he should offer T. Paul a job he happily accepts. Also starring Scream 2's Rebecca Gayheart as Danielle and Patch Adams' Irma P. Hall as Bertha 'Mama' Davidson. Robbins made many serious films including The Shawshank Redemption so this was a comic breather for him fasttalking Lawrence is amusing as the petty thief who tries to rob the wrong guy at the wrong time they are just about passable as an odd buddy duo the story has predictable moments and not all of the jokes are that funny but it is fun enough to pass the time an alright action comedy. Okay!".

While it's not without some share of stupidity it also has its share of brains too somewhere. It's basically a B comedy with Alist stars and a pretty high budget but it doesn't sell its audience short of the goods. Martin Lawrence will have his fanbase here as strong if not stronger than in some of his other starring vehicles. He does get some dimension to his character as a guy who has the usual Lawrencetype sarcasm and humor and also some conflict with his life. It's a good balance with Tim Robbins with his own sort of crisis as well. The plot involves a robbery and some holdups some hicks and a dancing security guard. The overall scope of the film with a soundtrack fairly standard isn't anything great although one scene where a song by Scatman as Robbins puts out a certain fire is one of the funniest scenes he's ever done. But this is made up for by some clever bits and a good repore by the stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nick Beam's life couldn't get any worse. He discovers he has been living a lie and is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. So when T. Paul a carjacker attempts to rob him it is the last straw for Nick. With everything to gain and nothing to lose he kidnaps T. Paul and attempts to put his life back together.....Martin Lawrence churns these sorts of films out every five minutes but when this movie was released he was still riding reasonably high from Bad Boys two years prior.But casting Robbins in this was a really strange move.

Paul and attempts to put his life back together.....Martin Lawrence churns these sorts of films out every five minutes but when this movie was released he was still riding reasonably high from Bad Boys two years prior.But casting Robbins in this was a really strange move.

	schema:reviewBody "Nothing to Lose 1997 Dir Steve Oedekerk  Cast Tim Robbins Martin Lawrence Kelly Preston John C. McGinley Michael McKeen Comedy that paints a picture of those who have no form of income. It also suggests major risk taking when we don't know the facts at hand. Tim Robbins visits his fiance only to discover a couple in bed upstairs. He is so upset that when Martin Lawrence attempts to rob him he responds You picked the wrong guy at the wrong time. Eventually they put their differences aside and rob gas stations but Robbins really wants to rob his boss. There is also a meaningless subplot involving two other burglars. Very stupid once one realizes that the whole thing was a misunderstanding. Director Steve Oedekerk handles a few comic moments but this is about as stupid as his previous film Ace Ventura When Nature Calls. Robbins and Lawrence are props with wasted supporting work by Kelly Preston and John C. McGinley. The Robbins characters in particular is a total idiot once one really examines his jump to conclusions decisions. This is also a routine comedy for Lawrence who certainly isn't branching out. Michael McKeen is also greatly reduced playing the boss who is suspected of the fingerpointing for which Robbins does. There is no reason to see this film since it employs little if any originality. Viewers have nothing to lose by avoiding it. Score 2  10".

	schema:reviewBody "I love how Tim Robbins' character loses his mind in Nothing to Lose! Nothing to Lose is a really funny very good movie mostly for its interesting interactions between Robbins and Lawrence's characters in their hilarious adventure they share together! Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence is a somewhat unusual pairing. Writer and director Steve Oedekerk came up with a great premise a man down and out in his love life feeling like he's got nothing left to lose Robbins crosses paths with a car jacking thief looking for himself a little something to gain Lawrence and let's just say the two then proceed to hit it off in a very funny manner! Oedekerk really did fairly nice to bring the film's premise together as a very good film fairly nice but the end of the movie is a bit of an easy exit and the beginning lead up to the movie's main portion of Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence is sort of scrambled and uncertain of how to get into the story almost feeling like a different type of movie thank God though that the sensational Kelly Preston plays a strong presence in the beginning but once Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence meet Nothing to Lose gets very good and amusing. The previous sentence I just wrote is rather pointless and I suggest that you do not even read it except only for the part about the incredibly gorgeous Kelly Preston oh wow! Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence make this movie as good as it became. These two stars share great chemistry with great comedic timing even Robbins! Tim Robbins has never been this good in a comedy! He is funny! And Nothing to Lose is one of Martin Lawrence's better movies it's up there with Life and Blue Streak for Lawrence's best comedy. Lawrence's best comedy is Life but I can honestly say that I like all of his comedies and honestly what am I talking about I love Martin Lawrence of course I like all his comedies. Martin is like my favorite show! Martin is the greatest Lawrence not the show well the show is but so is Martin! When I first watched Nothing to Lose I loved it and nothing has changed. Nothing to Lose is so funny and the two lead actors Robbins and Lawrence really make the movie great. This movie is one of the moreso unknown about good comedies so you should give it a good chance if you haven't already seen it and it should be definitely worth it.".

For every good moment there four dull ones and some funny lines or interesting characters wouldn't have gone astray.So basically if you watch this expecting the worst you'll enjoy it more than if you expect it to be as great as 'Repo Man'.

I am glad it is finally being seen on DVD in its original aspect ratio because in the theaters it had very carefully staged WIDESCREEN compositions which were lost on video.

Joe Strummer as SimmsRIP and the 'runt' Dick Rude completing the main trio.Also popping their heads round Alex Cox's casting room door are Courtney Lovepregnant Velma Fox Harris Kathy Burke Edward Tudor Pole Dennis Hopper IG Farben Grace Jones Jim Jarmusch Miguel SandovalEastwood impression Xander Berkleypriest Elvis Costellobutler and the PoguesMcmahon coffee gang...Superb!!There is also the great setting of Almeira the funny costumes Pray For Rain music and the priceless dialogueregional dilects etc. So stop criticising and just enjoy yourself in Cox country!!";

There's tension characters clashing and sexual. The film didn't have a whole lot of a plot but that doesn't really matter much because it seems to be more of a spoof on spaghetti westerns and even the actors and actresses themselves. It takes repeated viewing to really get down what is going on and how the parties are related to each other but that doesn't seem to matter quite so much. All in all I recommend this film to those of you who love weird movies and everyone who remembers the 80's punk scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is as the British might say taking a pss. It's Alex Cox a usually talented writerdirector taking a cast of ragtag punk rockers and a capable crew to the Spanish location of an obscure 1973 Charles Bronson film and going wild. I wish I could say it's an homage but it might be an insult to the likes of Quentin Tarantino's far more lucid interpretations compared to this. This isn't homage it's ripoff like when a 2nd rate punk rock band covers the Who's Substitute for no reason except that it's the Who. And the sad thing is that there are glimmers of really funny whackedout humor. I'm sure there even was thought put into this circleofhell environment that the characters are in but in the end it doesn't all gel.Plot? Um... I guess all it is is a few criminals donned up in black suits and skinny ties take a suitcase of cash into the desert to hide out and await orders from their boss Mr. Dade. But the car breaks down and they wind up in the weirdest town. When I mean weird this is an understatement there is no order to anything not even to the group of gunslingers who ride into town every so often get drunk off their asses and do singalongs to Delilah and Danny Boy or they shoot one another for the hell of it or pick on the poor hot dog vendor. I guess that's it and then uh someone else dies there's a funeral that's not real since the guy isn't dead and uh Dennis Hopper shows up too giving advice of there's no two bosses only one boss. Did I mention Jim Jarmusch shows up in the one truly funny cameo as Mr. Dade?What is Straight to Hell? It certainly has nothing to do with the song by the Clash I imagine that's not the only reason Joe Strummer was here he lived in Spain for a while so maybe it was a free trip and time to hang out with the Pogues. It's more akin to Rob Zombie's the Devil's Rejects where the purpose isn't so much to follow outlaws and killers in a plot but rather to hang out with them this is their world we're guests and all be damned if we get caught up in the anarchy. And Cox like Zombie or visaversa displays some true moments of brilliance in terms of outrageous buttonpushing. Some of this is very funny. But it takes so long to get to some of these scenes we see characters talk complete bulls in oddforthesakeofodd framing and we see dynamics that have no reason or development. It's sad to see it as such as it is which is what happens when writing is rushed such as this. I don't even blame the cast so much since they fill in their notallthere roles to the best of their abilities.It's an oddity that is not total fiasco or a surreal masterpiece none of us get. It's a pretentious bummer with some fantastic photography sprinkled here and there and a few clever lines.".

It's Alex Cox a usually talented writerdirector taking a cast of ragtag punk rockers and a capable crew to the Spanish location of an obscure 1973 Charles Bronson film and going wild. I wish I could say it's an homage but it might be an insult to the likes of Quentin Tarantino's far more lucid interpretations compared to this. This isn't homage it's ripoff like when a 2nd rate punk rock band covers the Who's Substitute for no reason except that it's the Who. And the sad thing is that there are glimmers of really funny whackedout humor. I'm sure there even was thought put into this circleofhell environment that the characters are in but in the end it doesn't all gel.Plot? Um... I guess all it is is a few criminals donned up in black suits and skinny ties take a suitcase of cash into the desert to hide out and await orders from their boss Mr. Dade. But the car breaks down and they wind up in the weirdest town. When I mean weird this is an understatement there is no order to anything not even to the group of gunslingers who ride into town every so often get drunk off their asses and do singalongs to Delilah and Danny Boy or they shoot one another for the hell of it or pick on the poor hot dog vendor. I guess that's it and then uh someone else dies there's a funeral that's not real since the guy isn't dead and uh Dennis Hopper shows up too giving advice of there's no two bosses only one boss. Did I mention Jim Jarmusch shows up in the one truly funny cameo as Mr. Dade?What is Straight to Hell? It certainly has nothing to do with the song by the Clash I imagine that's not the only reason Joe Strummer was here he lived in Spain for a while so maybe it was a free trip and time to hang out with the Pogues. It's more akin to Rob Zombie's the Devil's Rejects where the purpose isn't so much to follow outlaws and killers in a plot but rather to hang out with them this is their world we're guests and all be damned if we get caught up in the anarchy. And Cox like Zombie or visaversa displays some true moments of brilliance in terms of outrageous buttonpushing. Some of this is very funny. But it takes so long to get to some of these scenes we see characters talk complete bulls in oddforthesakeofodd framing and we see dynamics that have no reason or development. It's sad to see it as such as it is which is what happens when writing is rushed such as this. I don't even blame the cast so much since they fill in their notallthere roles to the best of their abilities.It's an oddity that is not total fiasco or a surreal masterpiece none of us get. It's a pretentious bummer with some fantastic photography sprinkled here and there and a few clever lines.";

Their car breaks down leaving them stranded in the middle of a desert valley where they find a seemingly abandoned ghost town. The next morning however a band of wild murderous cowboys roll into town with guns whiskey and... espresso machines. This utterly insane late '80s western romp pays homage to spaghetti westerns Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood in equal measure but drowned in such heavy idiosyncrasies and whacked out writing that the audience can do nothing but sit back and attempt to take it all in. In all truth the writing here is completely underdeveloped and the film feels like a melange of punk rockers and culture icons thrown in front of a camera in the Spanish desertbecause that's kind of what it is.Alex Cox who infamously directed Repo Man and Sid  Nancy is the director and cowriter here and while the script is delightfully absurd and full of issues it has been said that Cox and his cowriter came up with it in a matter of three days the direction is decent and the film seems to rise above its production values on a visual level. It utilizes the western ghost town sets in Almeria Spain which were historically used in many spaghetti westerns and even some Eastwood films and the dusty desert atmosphere is laid on thick.The real attraction of this film is its cast largely made up of musicianswe've got Joe Strummer Sy Richardson and Dick Rude as the three bandidos with a preHole prerhinoplasty Courtney Love playing their screeching yet somehow endearing pregnant sidekick. Rounding out the cast is The Pogues Xander Berkeley Elvis Costello an insouciant Grace Jones and Dennis Hopper mad as a hatter. The film really seems like an excuse for this ensemble of punk rockers rejects and icons to run around the desert dancing shooting each other and drinking coffee and that's just the pretense one has to accept with this film.All in all Straight to Hell will be a chore for many to sit through but for anyone who appreciates bizarre cinema spaghetti westerns or exploitation trash will have a great time with this film watching it through one can see the referential moulds which Quentin Tarantino would come to bring into the cultural lexicon several years later. The narrative is almost completely nonsensical but the visuals paired with what is probably one of the weirdest casts in film history really make this not only a time capsule but a complete and utter anomaly. 710.".

But to true devotees of the original novel this is a real butcher job.";

So the whole point of abuse of Lowood is lost with this flippant treatment and the complete removal of Helen Burns. Oh and Jane swans off with 'the inheritance she has from her uncle'. Eh? On her way to Thornfield with a comedy cart driver added character husband of Grace Poole she steps down and gets in the way of Mr Rochester's horse. OK this is from the book but her response to his questioning what she does at Thornfield is not! Once at the house Adele is the English niece of 'Uncle Edward' so removing the point of illegitimacy and neglect of the child who is now doted on.Even the first scene of conversation between Jane and Rochester is offkilter especially when she takes to the piano and sings to him! Blanche Ingram is a matronly woman who couldn't possibly compare with Jane's ringlets Adele does imitations of party guests for Blanche's dad and there is no Mason no gypsy scene no tension. There is the burning bed scene but that falls flat and has none of the drive we expect to see from that situation.Rochester is waiting for an annulment to come through so no obstacle to marrying Jane and no potential bigamy here. In fact Adele suggests he marries Jane and so he rushes to propose! The 'mad' wife seem strangely lucid although Jane still leaves when she sees her and almost immediately it seems the house burns down.John Rivers is included briefly as Jane goes to work for his mission and even agrees to marry him before meeting Mr Poole again and discovering about the Thornfield fire. Now her affections seem to change again and she goes back for the reconciliation with the now blind Rochester.As Jane Virginia Bruce is far too pretty but she was a good actress and putting aside the book and other interpretations is watchable and engaging. Colin Clive best known for Frankenstein plays Rochester with some skill but does not have enough to work with. This version is too merry too happy without the complications and the discontent you would expect to see from a man disappointed with his lot and damaged from an inappropriate marriage to a madwoman.I was glad to see it and have rated it a 6 because as a film on its own it is fairly good. As an adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's complex novel it is a disgrace.".

Instead Clive plays the master of Thornfield like he is just some normal single dad on the make who just happens to have his unbalanced first wife locked up in the attic.Maybe director Cabanne thought that this interpretation would make the character seem more suspicious to the audiences of 1934. Unfortunately this reviewer writing in 2002 finds Clive's Rochester about as suspicious as a stained glass window. In a Lutheran church.Virginia Bruce is adequate as the title character but unfortunately her best lines are undermined by unnecessary stock music pulled from Monogram's Oliver Twist released the previous year. However horror fans especially those who feel at home with the jumpoutofyourskin style of Sam Raimi of Evil Dead fame should see this film for the welltimed SHREIKS emanating from that attic. Claire DuBrey's banshee routine is enough to make your heart jump out of your mouth and do the macarena on top of the TV. So see this Eyre for the Screamer not for Ward Cleaver.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had high hopes for this movie and I still think it's worth seeing from a historical point of view but it certainly could have been better.Naturally it's tough to do the novel justice in 62 minutes but it would have worked better had they not wasted precious time on silly or insignificant events. For example does anyone really want to see Adele dust the banister? The 1938 version of A Christmas Carol manages to cover a lot of ground in 69 minutes by making every line count. Alas this version of Jane Eyre doesn't.The character of Jane Eyre in my opinion has been molded into a strapping twofisted gal who progresses from slugging her cousin and shouting at her aunt  to an impudent governess who goes about smashing vases and smarttalking her employer's fiance! The novel portrays Jane as a plain and intelligent young woman who possesses great dignity and the ability to stand tall despite the trials of her surroundings. This movie's Jane Eyre would be at home with the Bowery Boys.Colin Clive is an interesting actor but unfortunately the moody difficult aspects of Mr. Rochester that he might have done something with are almost entirely gone. Rochester here is seen doting on Adele his niece whereas the book suggests Adele is his illegitimate child and fawning over Jane with stunning rapidity. Check out when he invites her to dance and wonders why she didn't dress up for the party! Are we to believe that the engaged and wealthy owner of an estate expects his governess to deck herself out and participate in the party as a social equal? And would an orphanage teachergoverness have a party dress?? Perhaps this movie would play better for someone who hasn't read the book. For me I kept thinking The novel possesses a wealth of fascinating scenes and welldrawn characters. Why don't we see them here? The revelation of Rochester's wife in the novel for example was suspenseful and shocking. Here the actual Mrs. Rochester strolls casually up to say how do you do! I must say that Christy Cabanne's direction was reasonably competent and at times I felt like he was doing a lot with a little. So the movie's not a total loss but it's a major disappointment in that with better tighter scripting we might have enjoyed a smallscale yet wellcrafted production. Too bad!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jane Eyre is my favorite novel. I have read Charlotte Bronte's classic story many times over the past 30 years. The original story has many spiritual aspects that appeal to me beautiful inner and outward dialogue an intriguing plot complex characters and other fine qualities no longer appreciated by a large segment of the reading public in the modern world.I bought the DVD for this ancient film dinosaur with Virginia Bruce and Colin Clive Dr. Frankenstein! no less because I suspected it would be good for a laugh. But this film version is so bad I was more shocked than amused.They ominously started the film on the wrong foot by misquoting the first line of the novel they removed the character of Helen Burns altogether they gave Grace Poole a husband who was a servant in the house who warns Jane I like you so I'm going to tell you lock your door at night! they have Jane screaming at Mr. Brocklehurst and calling him names so she is fired from her job as teacher there. In the book Jane isn't fired she leaves to find a governess position to escape from Lowood Institution here called an orphanage even though in the novel not all the children were orphans  Lowood in the book was a charity institution not an orphanage in this film Adele is not French her origins in the house are not even discussed she calls Rochester Uncle Edward and he fawns over her and spoils her rotten something that didn't happen in the book at all.They make Blanche ugly and older and Jane Eyre a platinum blonde with Mary Pickford curls. Hello? Jane was supposed to be plain and Blanche was supposed to be gorgeous. They turn it all around in this monstrosity. In the scene where Jane saves Rochester from the fire the possible reason for that fire is not even discussed between them he kisses her hands and she promptly leaves the room like she was leaving a garden party seemingly unaffected by his passion.The worst liberty they took with the classic novel was having Edward Rochester apparently trying to have his marriage to his first wife annulled which made no sense since Rochester was not Catholic. There is no Mr. Mason in this version there is no attempted wedding scene. The insane wife just walks into a room at Thornfield in which Jane Rochester and the minister are standing and announces she wants to see her husband. The servants spirit her away and she protests in a totally normal voice I want to see my husband! LOL! Why didn't they LET HER SEE HER HUSBAND??? I was starting to think that everyone in the house was insane and Bertha was the only normal one!There's more that I can say about this sad state of affairs like having Jane singing to Rochester which DID send me into fits of laughter but I won't bore you and will simply conclude with this statement do NOT show this version to anyone who has not read the book first. This is NOT Jane Eyre this is some other story!The best most faithful version of Jane was the 19823 BBC version with Timothy Dalton. Why the Timothy Dalton version has not been put on DVD yet and this 1934 Monogram Colin Clive fiasco has been is totally beyond my comprehension. Hopefully this sad state of affairs will be attended to and corrected shortly.A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons. When film companies approach a story like Jane Eyre with disrespect and feel they can change anything and everything about it to their heart's content then the very spirit of that classic is destroyed. When will they ever learn?".

	schema:reviewBody "I love the book as well and I also agree that the Timothy Dalton series exactly depicted how I had always imagined Jane Eyre as looking. If we are nitpicking Joan Fontaine was hardly a plain jane  maybe by Hollywood standards. I feel that this version was never intended for people that had actually read the book  heck the people that produced it had probably never even heard of Charlotte Bronte. There are quite a few satirical films around that depict the philistines that used to run the studios. People that would take a fine novel like Jane Eyre and dumb the story down so it is completely unrecognisable. Stand In 1937 is a great satire on the studio system  Leslie Howard plays a literate accountant put in charge of a film studio to get it out of the red Humphrey Bogart is a director who wants to make tasteful high class films but nobody seems to know what he is talking about. The thirties were the height of glamour and artificiality in the studio system. Nobody would have gone to the movies to see the heroine played by an unattractive actress. Virginia Bruce has she ever looked more beautiful than in this film!!! played Jane Eyre and who else would play Jane as a child than Jean Darling who started her career in Our Gang and could have doubled as an angel.Actually this film was quite a special production for Monogram  it even secured the services of Colin Clive as Mr. Rochester. The film starts out truthfully in it's depiction of Jane's treatment at the hands of her beastly cousins Richard Quine portrays John Reed. She is sent to Lowood and goes very willingly. The roles of Jane Eyre and Helen are combined as Jane is shorn of her beautiful ringlets. After several years she becomes a teacher and when she has a confrontation with Mr. Brocklehurst she finds a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall. Unknowingly she has already met Mr. Rochester Colin Clive after he has a fall from his horse. She meets Adele Edith Fellows who plays a little Miss Fixit and is instrumental in bringing Jane and Rochester together. She also meets Rochester again and he is completely love struck!!!Jane hears a scream in the night and is told it is one of the servants. Meanwhile Rochester has indicated that he will marry in a few months and everyone assumes it will be haughty Blanche Ingram Aileen Pringle. He invites Jane to her first ball and with adjectives like pretty and charming being thrown about she is almost the belle of the ball  not quite the Jane Eyre I remember. There is also the famous fire which Jane stamps out with her foot and then coughs prettily to awaken Rochester. Jane finds out who is behind the fire and the screams  it is Rochester's wife. She escapes from her room just before his marriage and announces herself. Bertha Claire Du Brey seems quite sane and composed  not the mad harridan of Bronte's book. Jane flees and finds herself working in a soup kitchen run by StJohn Rivers and because she is so irresistible he also has proposed. She then meets Sam a worker at Thornfield Hall who tells her that the Hall has burned down and that Rochester is blind. I liked it also and agree with some of the other reviewers. I certainly didn't think Adele was that bad  at least she had a passable English accent.Recommended.".

If we are nitpicking Joan Fontaine was hardly a plain jane  maybe by Hollywood standards. I feel that this version was never intended for people that had actually read the book  heck the people that produced it had probably never even heard of Charlotte Bronte. There are quite a few satirical films around that depict the philistines that used to run the studios. People that would take a fine novel like Jane Eyre and dumb the story down so it is completely unrecognisable.

I've always liked Colin Clive and it seemed to me that he would be a good choice to play Edward Rochester. I wasn't disappointed. He was nervous agitated sympathetic and quite tormented as usual. I wasn't familiar with Virginia Bruce going in and was absolutely astounded that she was chosen for the part of Jane Eyre. What we have here is a big buxom beautiful blond with a flawless pale complexion and a gorgeous smile. With her shoes on she's nearly as tall as Clive  that sultry fleshy body of hers suggests she outweighs the gaunt actor by more than a few pounds as well. During the party Rochester has for his guests he says to Jane You're a funny little thing... which I thought was a hoot since the script writer must have wrote the scene before clapping an eye on Ms. Bruce who is anything but a Funny little thing. What does all this mean? Well yes as others here have said this film has only a glancing similarity to the novel. The discrepancies are so outrageous that they border on being quite charming and sweet. Aileen Pringle as Blanche Ingram is an attractive actress yet Virginia Bruce has a huge advantage in looks over her that actually leads to dialog suggesting as much! In the novel Rochester is tormented and difficult but he is a powerful and dominating figure. Here Colin Clive as Rochester is tormented and weak and as such we have a romance where he is all but consumed and comforted by Jane's tall figure and ample charms. The sequence where Rochester tricks Jane into choosing jewelry clothes and other items out for herself and not Blanche Ingram which is Jane's mistaken notion is consistent with the novel and other film versions and is very touching. This is the no stress version of Jane Eyre that I found very pleasing to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I've finally seen it the first talkie Jane Eyre from 1934. It wasdifferent to say the least. First off it's only an hour long so a lot was cut and rushed. Jane's years at Lowood an orphanage in this version are condensed to her arrival and then the page from the book describing those years! Yes they just filmed the book page. There's no Helen Burns or illness outbreak. Aside from the main characters those smaller parts that are kept are blink and you'll miss it. Other transitions are done with Jane writing in her diary.Secondly it's very watered down. It's not a screwball comedy like the 1940 Pride and Prejudice by any means but it's definitely much lighter in tone than the book. The characters are happier and the darker stuff from the book is either cut or just watered down. I'm no movie buff but I think I read somewhere that this was because it was the Great Depression and they didn't want to depress people more. Also aside from Colin Clive the majority of the cast is American and most of them don't do that great of a job hiding their accents.Instead of a Plain Jane we got a Blonde Bombshell in the form of Virginia Bruce. I'll give them credit though they made no secret of it. Unlike other adaptations to cast pretty actresses they didn't even try to pretend she was plain. They openly acknowledged that she was pretty. It was kind of weird but at least they were honest! Her Jane is very outspoken and not at all reserved. She never advertises so I don't know how she gets the job at Thornfield but she says she has a small inheritance from her uncle. There's never anything with her uncle Eyre or the Rivers being her cousins. Colin Clive's Rochester is always quite cheery and polite with Jane. All the passion between them is gone. Nothing like the book character at all. I thought they were going to cut his blindness at the end completely! But no they didn't go that far. They didn't have him lose his eye or hand but I think most of the adaptations have done that.The adult actors were decent with what they were given but let's be honest this is a sugarcoated version of the story. I can't say it's a good adaptation God no! or even a good movie but it has value for hardcore Jane Eyre fans andor collectorslike me!".

I doubt very much if anyone would ever consider this 1934 version starring Virginia Bruce and Colin Clive as the best of them.Still in reviewing this movie you have to take into account that this was done for Monogram Pictures on a shoestring budget. Bruce and Clive were borrowed from MGM and Universal respectively and neither was exactly a box office name. The running time is only 63 minutes so like every other work of literature there will always be stuff left out unless it's a TV miniseries and you have several hours to play with.One criticism I will agree with. Jane Eyre in fact is a plain Jane and the glamorous blond Virginia Bruce just isn't right for the part. Joan Fontaine was far closer to Charlotte Bronte's idea of Jane Eyre in her version with Orson Welles on a much bigger budget with MGM.It's definitely a subpar version of the novel but be a bit more charitable to this Jane Eyre considering the circumstances of its creation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have long held Jane Eyre as one of the best classics in the English language and felt that even an average production of the novel would be fairly enjoyable. If the director stuck to the story it would be impossible to make a bad version ... unfortunately this film proved me wrong.The original novel showed the trials of the eponymous heroine as she escapes a traumatic childhood both with her aunt and later at the notorious Lowood school. She ultimately goes to work as a governess at Thornfield where she falls in love with the owner Mr Rochester a man far above her in social class. Will they manage to declare their love for either other? If so how? And what about the strange woman in the attic? The sexual and social tensions in the novel create a tense and dramatic atmosphere  not to mention the Gothic elements of the woman in the attic  and most directors would you feel jump at the chance to make a film of Jane Eyre for those very reasons. It is acceptable to change certain aspects of a story for adaptation for cinematic reasons if these assist in telling the story but this version makes so many changes that the original plot and all the subsequent tension is completely lost. Jane's relationship with Mr Rochester is extremely cordial and he seems almost like the boy next door in his dealings with her. In reality this would never have taken place in the England of the time governesses were strictly below stairs and no employer would have behaved in such a familiar and friendly way with her. The idea of any tension between them has completely disappeared. Likewise the revelation of the identity of the madwoman in the attic is not dealt with as in the novel which would have made a highly dramatic scene for cinema audiences but is given a completely different treatment which is considerably weaker and lacks virtually any impact. In fact I wonder if the scriptwriter had actually read the Charlotte Bronte novel as these changes to the original plot have effectively destroyed all that was of interest in the story.Colin Clive is a fine actor and could have been a far more effective Rochester than the script allowed him here. Virginia Bruce is rather too pretty for the title role and again not given the chance to handle the role in the proper way. The Orson WellesJoan Fontaine version of Jane Eyre remains the standard for me despite certain reservations it is certainly far better than this film which should never have been made.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reason this is not a good movie is not limited to the fact that it has eliminated the complexities of Charlotte Bronte's plot and the depth of her characters but still more that it is little more than a bar of floralscented soap wrapped in pretty bows. Basically it has become a vapid story in which a poor but pretty girl marries the rich handsome gentleman and little else. True the screenwriters nod in the direction of a few of the original ideas. Jane doesn't get along with her aunt's family Jane arrives at the orphanage Jane leaves the orphanage the members of the Rochester household have the same names as in the Bronte novel there is a mad wife in the attic Jane does spend three minutes in a minister's house and she does nearly marry him there is a fire and Rochester is blinded. But in each of these details all the life and complexity has been entirely removed. All we have left is a very pretty Jane Virginia Bruce gazing soulfully at the very handsome Rochester Colin Clive and the inevitable conclusion. A tone of falsity runs throughout the movie as well. The history of meanness is missing from the brief orphanage scene so we only see the consequences in Jane's annoyance with the puppetlike schoolmaster. The costumes seem wrong the little girls wear kneelength dresses and long ruffled pantslike undergarmentsa Victorian fetish I think. The governess wears a fullyextended ball dress while taking tea with the master but a plain dress at the ball. And Rochester does not take off his enormous top hat as he runs into the burning mansion. For what it is this movie is too long at 62 minutes.".

Basically it has become a vapid story in which a poor but pretty girl marries the rich handsome gentleman and little else. True the screenwriters nod in the direction of a few of the original ideas.

	schema:reviewBody "This version of JANE EYRE is for film history buffs only  in it's day it probably would have been a 9. This is a very early talkie from one of the smaller movie companies and all the growing pains show. Garbo's ANNA Christie was made the year before this and while still stagy it shows what a larger more successful film company could do compared to this smaller one. Garbo's film was a film this feels more like a record of a stage performance. The script is rather favorite scenes from JANE EYRE. It takes major plot points and turns them into a brighter story all together mixing and matching elements at will.Virginia Bruce is tall platinum strikingly beautiful with a lovely contralto voice voluptuous figure and mesmerizing sad eyes that inspired Italian doll maker Lenci in many of his boudoir dolls of this period. All of this of course makes her wrong to play Jane in one of the most total miscasting moments of film history. Worse yet she slumps and slinks around like a 1930s starlet more Jean Harlow than Jane Eyre. To see her languidly lounging against a pillar or a piano combined with some of the abrupt dialog lines that contradict the original story brings lots of laughs to a Bronte fan. This version also added characters and played loose with details in ways that also made me laugh.Colin Clive as Rochester is handsome refined and gentlemanly. He treats her like an Etonian suitor. Virginia Bruce rather brusquely runs the scenes with him and often seems very bored with him practically rolling her eyes. So of course all of this is wrong for the story. Now I must say they are both very good actors and inhabit their roles and for this period they are both very fine compare them with the supporting cast especially the hysterically bad Adele  a child actor coached to the ends of every finger and curl in the most obvious stage mannerisms of the day but the limitations of the medium of that day and their miscasting does them no favors.The casting of his fiance is very odd indeed and shows how the beauty of WOMEN was valued at that time over girls. She looks a good ten years older than Rochester and quite the darkhaired demimonde vamp. Watching many versions of JANE ERYE I find that the casting of this role and Adele tell us a tremendous amount about the tastes of the times.The sets are bright and light but we must understand that some of this dynamic was needed for the cameras that were being used at the day the makeup is very dramatic but again the makeup then needed for a face to read on camera was not even natural skin tones. So for these things this version is a fascinating film study of a particular moment when films were transitioning. Miss Bruce's costumes are lovely  more Cinderella than plain Jane  and are also a notable moment of history when this high waisted fully flounced skirt was in style for period films. This type of dress too was copied by doll maker Lenci. You will notice that all the lines are spoken very slowly and distinctly and many will dismiss it as bad acting but this too had to do with early sound recording it was necessary for the way film was made.Since I AM interested in film history this has made me anxious to see more of Virginia Bruce. I want to see if her particular presence was used in more contemporary pieces where her looks and personal style would have made her shine. This is a time capsule.".

At the same time the depth of the characters and the complexity of their relationships make it very difficult for a movie to do complete justice to the story and even the best film adaptations are usually better as movies in their own right than as adaptations. This scaleddown low budget Monogram version can hardly be compared with the original but in itself it is pretty much an average Bmovie of the era.Virginia Bruce plays the lead role and her portrayal of Jane is sympathetic if rather different from the Jane of the novel. Given the overall production Colin Clive was a reasonable choice to play Rochester since he adds a nervous energy to his roles that fits with Rochester's secret concerns although for much of the time his Rochester is little distinguishable from Henry Frankenstein. Some of the secondary characters are also portrayed a bit differently from the novel fitting in with the somewhat simplified nature of the adaptation.Viewed in its own right instead of being compared with the novel the script sets up a few decent scenes although at other times some of the running time is wasted on relatively inconsequential material. As other reviewers have pointed out this version does not work as an attempt to convey some of the depth of the novel and its memorable characters.

	schema:reviewBody "JANE EYRE Monogram 1934 directed by Christy Cabanne is another poverty row screen treatment taken from classic literature in the formatted style to the studio's own presentation to Charles Dickens' OLIVER TWIST 1933 starring Dickie Moore. While not the original screen adaptation to Charlotte Bronte's immortal novel Jane Eyre consisted of numerous silent screen versions one as early as 1913 starring Lisbeth Blackstone another retitled WOMAN AND WIFE 1917 with Alice Brady and again 1921 in retained title featuring Mabel Ballin. For this first talkie edition the title role goes to Virginia Bruce 19101981 on loan from MetroGoldwynMayer. Bruce a fine actress is one who never really achieved the sort of movie stardom of a Bette Davis or Katharine Hepburn. Regardless of its merits and lowbudget structure JANE EYRE in fact didn't help nor hurt Miss Bruce's screen career nor did it prompt any possibilities for other movie studios in remaking the Bronte story over and over again namely the nextinline remake the oftrevived and admired 20th CenturyFox 1944 production starring Orson Welles Rochester and Joan Fontaine Jane. For now let's concentrate on this JANE EYRE from Monogram Studios.Told through the passages of the novel Jane Eyre begins with Chapter I 'The cold winter wind had brought with it somber cold and penetrating rain.' Jane Eyre Jean Darling is introduced as an child orphan living in the home and charity of her unsympathetic Aunt Mary Reed Clarissa Selwynne and her spoiled children Georgiana Anne Howard and John Richard Quine. John a momma's boy pleasures himself disciplining his cousin through unnecessary tactics of facial slaps and accusations of being a thief who's stolen one of his books. Because of her unruly outbursts for defending herself Mrs. Reed soon deposits her niece to the Lowood Orphanage for Girls where Jane finds herself under the kindness of Miss Temple Greta Gould and strict disciplinary actions of its nononsense headmaster Mr. Brocklehurst David Torrence. As the pages flip skipping through various details of Jane's childhood the story resumes with Chapter X 'I remained an inmate of Lowood's walls for ten years eight as a pupil and finally two as a teacher.' The adult Jane Eyre Virginia Bruce is shown as a humanly kind schoolteacher getting through to her pupils with kindness and understanding. Because Mr. Brocklehurst doesn't believe in her tactics he immediately dismisses her. Jane soon acquires a new position that of governess in the estate of Edward Rochester Colin Clive. Though Jane enjoys her new position caring for Rochester's mischievous niece Adele Edith Fellows and the fine companionship of Mrs. Fairfax Beryl Mercer the housekeeper she's surrounded by strange surroundings and occurrences by night with the sounds of tormented screams from the far distance of the mansion a mysterious fire in one of the rooms and a strange figure roaming about reasons known only by married servants Sam John Rogers and Grace Poole Ethel Griffies  a role she repeated in the 1944 version but most of all Mr. Rochester who'd rather spare Jane from the outlandish details.Other members of the cast include that of Aileen Pringle Blanche Ingram Rochester's snobbish fiance Lionel Belmore Lord Ingram Blanche's father whom Adele says resembles a walrus Claire DuBrey Bertha Rochester and Jameson Thomas Charles Crack.For anyone quite familiar or in favor of either the 1944 Joan Fontaine version or the numerous latter theatrical andor madefortelevision editions to JANE EYRE would be quite disappointed by this production. Though comparing with the others is inevitable this JANE EYRE presents itself more like an early 1929 sound talkie than one made in 1934. The low budget qualities and musical background limitations would have been forgivable had it not been for the present structure of the film. Although quite a common practice for the screen treatment to stray from the book in favor of rearranging situations and characters to add more interest JANE EYRE might have succeeded into at least an average product had the film itself been fully developed in both characters and plot. As much as Bruce Clive and Fellows dominate in these proceedings the cast support results to mostly extended cameos. A major character of John Rivers Desmond Roberts becomes a third dimensional one appearing briefly as a man running a charity mission who's gotten to know and love Jane enough to offer her his hand in marriage. Rivers suddenly disappears never to be seen again. While Leonard Maltin's TV and Video Guide clocks JANE EYRE at 67 minutes it's curious as to whether the director's cut was originally longer at possibly 80 minutes than the now circulating 62 minute edition.Retaining Colin Clive immortally known for his title role of Universal's 1931 edition of FRANKENSTEIN in the role of Rochester it's a wonder how JANE EYRE of 1934 might have succeeded had it been produced and distributed by major studios as RKO Radio with Katharine Hepburn excellent choice MGM with Maureen O'Sullivan Paramount Elissa Landi Warner Brothers newcomer Jean Muir United Artists Joan Bennett or even Universal newcomers Jane Wyatt or British born Valerie Hobson as possible casting examples for the Bronte heroine.Not as frequently televised as Monogram's OLIVER TWIST 1933 the long unseen JANE EYRE has become available over the years on either video cassette 1990s andor DVD format the only method of getting to see how it happened to Jane as well as an opportunity in rediscovering Virginia Bruce in a rare leading screen performance and getting to hear her sing Franz Schubert's Serenade while playing the piano.

This film is a great illustration of this set in 19th Century Japan centring on a samurai called Katagiri with a strand of tales which cover restricted love friendship honour and killing.Duty and culture are the main issues for Katagari as he battles with them whilst they forbid him to live a happier life. The film though never treats these issues heavily but rather takes you on a journey for the viewer to understand the world they live in before making a rounded judgement. The beautiful rural setting for this film adds to the atmosphere whilst the acting is understated but delightful befitting the reticent culture the main characters live within.Regardless of the title there is actually no real battling at all until the end and even then it is carefully controlled so as not to make this appeal to fans of sword fighting movies. If anything the battle is only there as a side on to the rest of the movie whose themes are far more important.Overall I would recommend this to everyone it is beautiful interesting and a diversion from the usual fair we all watch on film and TV. You are unlikely to watch many other films as beautifully done as this one all year.".

	schema:headline " Not reaching the stupendous height as Twilight Samurai does but still a splendid film on its own merits";
	schema:reviewBody "In May 2003 I posted a rather long report on Twilight Samurai which was the very first IMDb comment posted on this exquisite film. Earlier this year when I saw that another film by director Yamada Yoji is among the gala screenings in this year's Hong Kong International Film Festival I was overjoyed. Yet I was realistic enough to recognize that the level of cinematic excellence in Twilight Samurai is almost impossible to repeat let alone surpass. Having now seen Hidden Blade Devil's Claw I know that I have been proved right. Hidden Blade is no Twilight Samurai. But I was not disappointed. Taken on its own merits Hidden Blade is a marvelous film. And I must resist the temptation of comparing it with Twilight Samurai which has attained a height that few can scale.Hidden Blade is constructed on the same two themes as in Twilight Samurai a tender love story and the perils of being a samurai. In Hidden Blade samurai Munezo Masatoshi Nagase has been in love with household maid Kie Takako Matsu maybe without being conscious of it himself when she is married off according to custom to someone belonging to her own lowly caste. When the family she married to proves to be abusive he brings her back to continue serving as his maid. The other story line involves a fellow swordsmanship student who is even better than Munezo becomes an escaped convict. Being a lowranking samurai albeit a good one Munezo has no choice when ordered by the clan but to risk his life in trying to kill his former pal. I have simplified the synopsis considerably but I think it suffices to illustrate the similarity of the plot between Hidden Blade and Twilight Samurai.Dashingly handsome Nagase does not have the depth of Sanada nor teenage idol Matsu the indescribable charm and poise of Miyazawa. But here I sinned on comparing again. Both Nagase and Matsu do splendidly in Hidden Blade moving the audience with their simple sincerity. Although at times tending to be melodramatic Hidden Blade has all the ingredients to make watching it a joyous experience script score photography. It even has some pretty funny scenes which depending on how you look at it could be seen as highly entertaining or somewhat disjointing. And yes there is a happy ending which looks almost like something coming out of Hollywood.A word on the title Hidden Blade Devil's Claw. Faced with the frightful challenge of the duel with his former pal Munezo goes back to their teacher who gives him more guidance as well as instructions on his deadly hidden blade devil's claw technique which he has hitherto not taught either of them before. When Munezo finally wins the duel his opponent in his dying breath asks if his has been defeated by the hidden blade devil's claw. To the audience's surprise the answer is negative. But don't worry. We do eventually get to see the devil's claw in action and I for one find it quite satisfying. This little bit of suspense and mystery which is also the title of the movie adds considerable pleasure to watching this movie.In a recent interview director Yamada Yoji intimated that his samurai films are very different from those from Kurosawa. He talks about the Shochiku the dominating Japanese movie company in the 50's and 60's tradition of depicting family life which is reflected in Hidden Blade. Kurosawa's samurai films e.g. Yojimbo he pointed out never touched upon the family. On the same subject he also made an interesting observation that the tatami never appears in Kurosawa's films but makes extremely frequent appearance in Ozu's.".

	schema:reviewBody "I originally went to this film at the Palm Springs International Film Fest expecting lot of samurai action.

The actors do a masterful job and the main character really makes you feel the conflict in his heart.There is very little swordplay in the film. Pretty much only in one scene toward the end. It plays out in a gut wrenching way for the main character. It took courage to tell the story of a Samurai who is reluctant to fight. The film deals with a very complex moral question When is it okay to kill? The main character is put in a moral quandary when he's forced to do something that he is morally against. I felt director showed us a part of Japanese life that we're not used to seeing. The every day domestic details of a honest good samurai.If you get the chance to see it please do.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hidden Blade Kakushiken oni no tsume is filmed in a deceptively oldfashioned and leisurely style to make pointed observations of Japanese society much as Far From Heaven did for the U.S. Directorcowriter Yji Yamada again adapts Shuuhei Fujisawa stories as he did so beautifully in Twilight Samurai Tasogare Seibei. Taking place just a few years before Hollywood's The Last Samurai this feels like a rebuke and response to that very Westernized interpretation of some of the same issues of how changes in military technology impacted feudalism and imperialism as well as visually referencing many classic Japanese samurai films but from a more individualized point of view then Kurosawa Kobayashi or InagakiThe first half of the film establishes the complicated domestic life and frustrating work of the struggling samurai a solid and sympathetic Masatoshi Nagase channeling Toshir Mifune. The broadly comic scenes of fumbled rifles and cannon training recall similarities with the Sharpe TV series of the just a bit earlier Napoleonic wars. Particularly lovely are household hearth scenes of warmth between generations and between master and servants.But this is not the idyllic village where Tom Cruise sojourned as darker abuse is revealed and the samurai flaunts rigid social protocols to do right by those he cares for especially the young maid Kie Takako Matsu channeling the three little maids from The Mikado a bit too much. He is slow to reveal emotions or take action the romance goes beyond Jane Austen in its crosscaste sidling and very slow resolution suppressing vivid childhood memories we see very briefly in flashbacks in contrast to his voluble friend who rebels including against traditional suicide.The emphasis throughout the film is on generational conflict as elders who are to be venerated are constantly shown to be fools or much worse  old uncles complain about younger people whose names they can't keep straight using the new Western weapons but place a higher priority on eating a motherinlaw viciously mistreats her daughterinlaw to increase profits a corrupt senior retainer the feudal titles do not seem welltranslated in the subtitles lies and manipulates while enjoying geishas and complaining about his prostate problems. But a teacher derided as a crazy old man who can still best the young swordsman passes on more useful stealth techniques than the martinet drill sergeant who has inherited the honorific sensei with his British guns.While as usual in such films I simply cannot follow the Byzantine shogun politics even with a superfluous narration as I've never studied Japanese political history the second half ironically builds on the iconography of the genre with unusual sights and sounds. Macho conflicts are filmed voyeuristically with sidling camera angles that indicate a passing from mano a mano duels to the anonymity of modern weapons and thus justifying the use of the titular vengeance.The exquisite cinematography and sound design create a special environment. With a look of faded epic cinematography like the passing of an age we see snow falling on parasols cherry blossoms on the path and rain fall on unrequited love. We hear them too as the breezes wind crickets birds rain and the household sounds of tools and crackling fire punctuate long silences and dominate more than the conventionally soaring score that is used judiciously. But a prison and eventual bloody fights in a heavily symbolic fog are not minimalized.The production design is much more elaborate in showing us traditional architecture than most such Japanese films. I'm sure some of the social and historical commentary just goes by a Western audience unfamiliar with particulars but the themes of individuals caught up in social proscriptions who rebel and seek love respect peace and most of all control over their lives is universal and very involving.".

The film has very beautiful sceneries and the music and atmosphere is really nice. The camerawork is usual style of Yoji Yamada. It hides more than shows. Acting is good especially Masatoshi Nagase Stereo Future acts surprisingly well as a strong minded modest samurai. I was personally surprised the choice of Takako Matsu. But since she has proved herself in her earlier films such as Shigatsu Monogatari I knew to expect a good result from her. The plot follows pretty much the same line with Tasogare Seibei and it doesn't offer much surprise. Yet I rate this movie 9 since it has the wonderful style of Yoji Yamada. It is a great samurai movie and Masatoshi Nagase fans will not be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Hidden Blade";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hidden Blade The Hidden Blade refers to a dreaded samurai sword skill which you will see only towards the end of the film. Folks who like me initially thought that this is one of the usual samurai slugfest may be disappointed that it's not. But like mentioned in the movie killing is only a last resort and even samurais themselves are fearful of death in duels.But hey don't jump the gun pun not intended just yet. This film has a story to tell and a poignant one at that. Simply put it tells of a story about a small town samurai whose village is caught in the transition period of Japan's modernization and introduction of western arms guns and cannons and fighting tactics. While struggling to understand the rapid changes taking place in the nation he has to deal with relationships of the heart with his family's maid whom he adores but afraid to own up to and the dilemma of being ordered into a duel with one of this long time friends whom has gone off the right track.This film explores many themes one of which is the samurai code of honour where committing suicide via disembowelment harakiri is widely accepted as a practice of maintaining that honour. We also see the bastardization of this honour of corruption which brings to mind George Orwell's Animal Farm where some animals are created more equal than others. The protagonist samurai Munezo often put his head on the line while maintaining that code even when all else around including his superiors put pressure on him into making compromises. How many of us will rigidly uphold our values and principles when faced with adversity? Or will we bow to that pressure and be apologetic for it? We are also shown the caste system in feudal Japan which proved to be a stumbling block between the relationship of Munezo and his family maid Kie. The village clan frowned upon and gossips about Munezo's rescue of Kie from her abusive marriage. While the motive may seem justifiable we all know Munezo's real reason  that he loves her and cannot bear to see her being abused and ultimately losing her life. Both know that with the caste system they can never be together. Or can they? The caste system doesn't only apply to relationships of the heart. Even within samurais this system applies. Munezo is a small samurai in a small village and is given little respect by samurais belonging to larger clans and cities. Think of it like the army where foot soldiers have to Yes Sir every officer's instructions  even when it means given the order to kill an old friend who has gone fugitive. Munezo again struggles with this but knows that as long as he's a samurai orders are to be obeyed.Change and modernization is central to the story. And in this film there are numerous hilarious moments as the samurais in training as a modern army come to grips with strange rituals like foot drills the handling of modern weaponry and even the way they run. It's something like Tom Cruise's Last Samurai only that the training's more comical here and subtly highlights the dangers losing of one's cultural values when the world moves rapidly in change.And finally for those really waiting for a slugfest there are 2 fight scenes in the entire movie. One is when Munezo seeks his old master for new guidance and is being taught a new skill  trick. The other is when Munezo meets his longtime friend for a final showdown. Do not expect wuxia styled swordfights. Think Star Wars A New Hope the duel between Darth Vader and Obiwan Kenobi. The duel happens with measured strokes and strategy rather than fast paced action everyone's used to these days.But again the emphasis here is not on violence. It's a simple tale with powerful themes and you will applaud when The Hidden Blade is finally used justly.".

	schema:headline " An engaging story built on commentary Japanese traditions and forward motion";
	schema:reviewBody "Munezo is a samurai who serves closely with friends and peers Samon and Yaichiro. When Yaichiro goes far overseas to serve for the clan Munezo is left with Samon who becomes closer as he marries Munezo's sister Shino leaving him at home with his aged mother and maid Kie. The years go by and when his mother dies Munezo struggles with his studies of new Western weaponry and battle techniques and misses Kie  who has long since married into a merchant family befitting someone of her caste. A man of tradition and respect  Munezo is forced to act against inherited wisdom and practice when he learns of Kie's mistreatment and also of the dishonourable imprisonment of Yaichiro.Some have warned caution of this film to those expecting an action film and they are right to do so but to me the opposite applied. Screened late at night on BBC4 I recorded this film thinking it sounded interesting but could easily be a very dry film full of its own importance and depth delivered with long shots for the sake of stilted dialogue and every single bit of it screaming restrained! like the audience is an idiot. Suffice to say I have been hurt before when it comes to such films! I needn't have worried though because The Hidden Blade manages to be about the restrained traditions of feudal Japan without making the telling or the film be dry and withdrawn into itself. Nor does the film labour the point in the way some similar works have indeed it does give the audience food for thought in regards the proscons of both tradition and progress  neither of which is an entirely good or bad thing but has bits of both. To me this made it more worthy of my respect and interest but what made it so engaging was the amount of ground it covered. I am surprised to read that some found this film boring because to me the narrative is surprisingly packed with threads that cover friendship relationships loyalty and tradition across many aspects  all of which work really well. OK I will give you that the final ten minutes could have been done with a bit more certainty but even this was only a minor thing because mostly there is plenty to watch. What surprised me most about it was that it did also have a good vein of humour running through it my favourite moment of which was the men trying to catch a chicken with a basket  great little throwaway gag.The script is the starting point for it as it builds conflicted characters with as much attention to them as to the world they inhabit. The visual construction of the film matches this as it feels very much in the period and I was quite surprised to find it was made as recently as it was because of how of its time it felt. The cast come good mostly even though I didn't think anyone really nailed it or dominated proceedings. Nagase is a strong actor with almost what the character needs in terms of expression and inner thought processes. He was not quite as distinctive as I would have liked the odd time but mostly he is a firm lead. Matsu overplays the sweet little maid role just a tad but the script is strong enough to make it work regardless and she does come over as charming and a character we care deeply for. The supporting cast around these are mostly good with turns from Ozawa not given enough time though Ogata Yoshioka and Tabata among others.The Hidden Blade may not be what you think it is going to be but whether you assume it is actionpacked or dry as a bone it doesn't matter because the film performs really well at what it sets out to do. The plot builds the world and characters really vividly providing thoughts on progress and tradition while also laying out both in terms of the relationships positions and lifestyles of the main characters. It has humour sadness and intelligence all delivered with professional direction and atmospheric design and cinematography. It is well worth seeing and rewarding with only a little patience required.".

What surprised me most about it was that it did also have a good vein of humour running through it my favourite moment of which was the men trying to catch a chicken with a basket  great little throwaway gag.The script is the starting point for it as it builds conflicted characters with as much attention to them as to the world they inhabit. The visual construction of the film matches this as it feels very much in the period and I was quite surprised to find it was made as recently as it was because of how of its time it felt. The cast come good mostly even though I didn't think anyone really nailed it or dominated proceedings. Nagase is a strong actor with almost what the character needs in terms of expression and inner thought processes. He was not quite as distinctive as I would have liked the odd time but mostly he is a firm lead. Matsu overplays the sweet little maid role just a tad but the script is strong enough to make it work regardless and she does come over as charming and a character we care deeply for. The supporting cast around these are mostly good with turns from Ozawa not given enough time though Ogata Yoshioka and Tabata among others.The Hidden Blade may not be what you think it is going to be but whether you assume it is actionpacked or dry as a bone it doesn't matter because the film performs really well at what it sets out to do. The plot builds the world and characters really vividly providing thoughts on progress and tradition while also laying out both in terms of the relationships positions and lifestyles of the main characters. It has humour sadness and intelligence all delivered with professional direction and atmospheric design and cinematography. It is well worth seeing and rewarding with only a little patience required.";

For example his previous film Twilight Samurai was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 2003 Academy Awards and it was awesome!! I don't know if Hidden Blade is as great as Twilight but on its own it still is a great movie and should be seen by anyone who likes epic films! Here's what it's about There is this samurai honest and low ranking who is trapped in a state of both personal and professional imbalance. For example he is secretly in love with his family's maid and despite the fact that he knows the relationship is impossible he begins an uneasy courtship with the woman. Then there are his professional issues. He has always been raised to respect the traditions from the past but suddenly circumstances have forced him to master a new art the western art of artillery. Can you imagine? A samurai from the East trained to master the arts of the West? Awesome! And then to top it all off he is ordered to find and kill a former friend who he knows is so dangerous that his skills with both the sword and the gun will not be enough. So he enlists the help of his old teacher who entrusts him with  the secret of The Hidden Blade. Great acting great story great movie!!! A must see in my book!".

	schema:reviewBody "Munezo Kitagiri Masatoshi Nagase is another of Yoji Yamada's twilight samurais a sadfaced much of the time useless man. When he finds happiness at the end it's through a kind of lonely exile. It's only when Hidden Blade Kakushiken oni no tsume is twothirds over that there's some serious swordplay but like a dish served after a long fast this death struggle even though it's aborted feels delicious.Kitagiri lives in the shadow of his father's disgrace and creates his own disgrace when he steals a married woman of peasant origins from her husband. The pretty young Kie Takao Matsu once worked in his mother's household and this is a softhearted tale Kie and Kitagiri have always been sweet on each other. When he finds out several years later that she's not only unhappy with her merchant husband but now ill and left to waste away in her bed there by her wicked stepmother Kitagiri simply puts Kie on his back and takes her home. Kie returns to health and thrives in her old surroundings  and the merchant family lodges no protest  but as a samurai Kitagiri can't really marry Kie and so must reluctantly order her to return to her parents.Kitagiri can't seem to get anything right. His uncle criticizes him for capitulating to modern ways because his clan is being clumsily trained to use rifles and canons  scenes of which we see periodically.In the opening scene we've seen Kitagiri and his close friend Samon Shimada Hidetaka Yoshioka bid farewell to Yaichiro Hazama Yukiyoshi Ozawa a fellow samurai who's been posted to Edo. Shimada's wedding is an occasion for elders to criticize Kitagiri and also a sign that Kitagiri is falling behind by not marrying himself. Both Shimada and Kitagiri are backwater samurai as the somewhat prissy sensei sent to train their clan gunsmanship puts it while Hazama in contrast exemplifies sophistication and success and he's a true samurai the best swordsman of his clan. The training in marching and rifles is occasion for much buffoonery. Hidden Blade modulates delicately from romance to comedy to solemn drama to adventure story and back again.Fortunes can shift rapidly in the feudal world and at the end of the story the successful much favored Hazama  though he has a beautiful elegant wife Reiko Takashima prepared to do anything for him  has led a rebellion against the Shogunate and thereby become an escaped criminal and the chief retainer Shogen Hori Ken Ogata orders Kitagiri to perform his final nowin battle to challenge Hazama to a swordfight which he cannot lose.If Kitagiri wins the battle he will be killing an old friend. If he loses he will have failed his clan and added more disgrace to his name.Hazama's wife comes to Kitagiri the night before and begs him to let Hazama escape into the mountains and when Kitagiri can't agree to that she promises to appeal to the chief retainer.I don't think as some do that this is less effective than Twilight Samurai. It may move along in fits and starts but it lacks the latter's longeurs. Hidden Blade's final swordfight isn't as elaborate or excruciating and suspenseful as Twilight Samurai's but it has the virtue of not being so drawn out. It seems odd that Kitagiri ends up seeking revenge against his chief retainer even though the man has undoubtedly done something highly improper. Sensibly he renounces his samurai status. The ending is quite sentimental but one can't fault the movie for being sweet. A samurai would never do what Kitagiri does at the end but he is no longer a samurai.Yamada has his limitations but he's also found ways of breathing life back into the samurai genre he's not so much rehabilitated it as reconceived it by seeing the samurai in more specific social and historical terms. Nagase as Kitagiri has a kind of ascetic antihero nobility and Ozawa as Hazama looks as dashing as Johnny Depp in his pirate mode but with staring eyes and matted hair instead of a grin and eyeliner. Hazama is magnificent almost like a Japanese folklore demon and when he gets his hand blown off it's obvious the modern age has come to destroy our heroes and upstage our villains.".

Hazama was the better swordsman of the two but he wasn't allowed to learn the Hidden Blade. Why? We see the Hidden Blade at the end of the film when Katagiri uses it against his superior who was a scoundrel. We understand that the Hidden Blade is not a fighting technique but a murdering technique. It cannot honorably be used against a samurai in a fight. That explains why he didn't use it against Hazama.OK but why didn't their master teach Hazama the Hidden Blade? The answer is simple that technique has nothing to do with who is a better swordsman. Since it is so deadly it can be taught only to a person who will not abuse it a person of integrity.

	schema:reviewBody "With Yoji Yamada's The Hidden Blade set in the early 1860s the age of the samurai was passing the age of moviedom's bastardization of the samurai was sometime in the future. The Hidden Blade is one of three movies Yamada made based on stories by Shuhei Fujisawa. They all deal with the end of the rigid social caste system of the Tokugawa era the cracks and corruption in the samurai code and the effects of this on some of those in the samurai class whom we come to know. These movies aren't flash and slash epics or just cheap entertainment. The films in many ways are quiet even when there is violence. Sadness and difficult choices are pervasive. The films in other words are wonderful. For the record the three films are The Twilight Samurai Tasogare Seibei 2002 The Hidden Blade Kakushi Ken Oni no Tsume 2004 and Love and Honor Bushi no Ichibun 2006. The Hidden Blade is the story of Munezo Katagiri Masatoshi Nagase a poor samurai who does his duty to his clan in a small village in the north of Japan. His father was forced to commit hari kiri unjustly but the father submitted because obeying the lord was the core of his life. A friend of Katagiri's Yaichiro Hazama who earlier went to Edo has been implicated in a treason plot against the shogun. Hazama is sent back to the village for imprisonment. At the same time Katagiri's sister has married a good friend his mother has died and he has found a merchant husband for the family's maid a young woman named Kie Takako Matsu the daughter of a farmer who had been trained in many skills by Katagiri's mother. We can tell there is affection and respect between the two but the idea of marriage is never recognized because of the rigid separation of the four castes. Katagiri rescues Kie from the cruel marriage but cannot keep her with him. He returns her to her farmer father. When Hazama escapes Katagiri is ordered to go to Hazama one of his best friends and kill him in a duel. Hazama is a fine swordsman. Katagiri is almost as good. Katagiri learns his clan's senior adviser is venal and dishonest. Katagiri must obey but afterwards in disgust takes his own actions. At last he secures his future whatever that might be...but it won't be as a samurai. If this all sounds mundane it is and it isn't. In slightly more than two hours Yamada lets us see these people's lives everything from the rigid strictures of behavior and outward respect to how a servant washes clothes from how to cut firewood to what a prisoner basket is from what a poor samurai's house is like or a merchant's fabric shop to what it takes to train barely educated bumpkin samurai in gunnery and marching. It's all fascinating more so because these are all moreorless ordinary people in a system of rigid class inequities where people have few if any options. Yet if Munezo Katagiri's story is told deliberately it is never slow. Yes we have a great and not flashy sword fight toward the end of the movie and a fast and satisfying act of deadly justice to witness. The heart however of the movie's tension comes from Karagiri's struggle to obey the old rules while realizing how unjust and corrupt they can be. Masatoshi Nagase gives a marvelous performance...thoughtful serious underplayed. The movie ends with a mutual expression of love and commitment between Katagiri and Kie that is delightful and touching. One of the fascinating aspects of Japan is how rigidly enforced and how accepted the social order was and then how quickly and in some cases how ruthlessly it began to crumble. The samurai class above the other three classes was made up of warriors without wars. They sank into near irrelevance except for their privileges and social status. The merchant class lowest of the classes rose to power because they produced nothing of value in the Buddhist sense just money. Money proved more powerful than swords. By the end of The Hidden Blade it's clear that disciplined peasants bearing expensive firearms can take care of any charging swordbearing samurai they might encounter.".

Lots of Japanese movies are set in the early years of the Meiji erajust after the country was opened up to foreign trade around the year 1860. It was a truly revolutionary period and this isn't surprising. And there are lots of films that show the corruption of the Shoguns and local bosses that call into question the morality of the Code of Bushido. So in this sense the movie is not all that unique. However it is handled so beautifully and deliberately that I was very very impressed by the film.The film concerns a samurai named Munez Katagiri Masatoshi Nagase. He's a good man who seems out of place. He doesn't see himself as superior to the lower classes and actually loves a woman from the lower caste. However being a good samurai he doesn't act upon this loveit simply wouldn't be allowed. This bothers him but he follows the unwritten rules of society. However when he sees his leaders behaving in very dishonorable ways he is stuck. While he agrees to kill a rogue samurai who was his friend the motives of his family's leaders disgust him. How will he handle this and his love for a woman who he cannot marry? See this lovely film and find out.The Hidden Blade has a lot going for it. It isn't just some action film in fact there is an amazingly small amount of action but it's both a love story and a film about moral dilemmas. What I liked about this most was the wonderful pacing direction and musicit all worked together wonderfully and is a film that really really impressed me. Beautiful and well worth seeing.".

The plot is well outlined by others on this site so no need for me to go into it other than to say that it takes a very different angle of view to every other Japanese historical film that I have seen to date. The characters are very like some of my friends and neighbours  totally real and very believable. Many historical Japanese films have the characters shouting harshly at one another throughout the movie. This one is very different. These Japanese actually speak like real people!!!! The swordplay is real and not the stuff of Jeddi Knights! The film has that genuine handmade stamp and a homemade and wholesome flavour  and not that of some franchise.This movie is a keeper one to be enjoyed many times over and its subtleties savoured again and again. Very fine acting excellent direction and beautiful cinematography  watch it for just the craftsmanship if for nothing else! I highly recommend this film.".

The thin color palette graceful use of miseenscene dense landscapes the winter ones are especial beautiful are resonate in the tone of 6070s samurai masters like Okamoto. But the story though traditional resonates with more modern concerns. It's more a reflection on the past to try to understand the present. The beginning presents the main character as a lower class samurai struggling to adapt to the changing landscapes of Japan. Trying to read English and Dutch and failing to learn how to use firearms and other Western military devices and tactics. It's an intense samurai film in the style of Japanese classics but dense with application to the modern world struggles. An alternative view of the samurai film that's worth a couple of hours.".

Until Hidden Blade. This is an exceptional film original in story characters and direction. The plot is quite simple a samurai whose father's disgrace has reduced the family in status lives with a maid and a servant. He is in love with the maid and she with him but the social conventions and their own decency prevent this from becoming anything more than a tender friendship. The samurai's sword school companion gets himself into trouble and finally their swordbrother relationship leads the plot to a climax. There are several fights a background of western military training being given to the samurai in this area but above all that is the compassion and decency of the samurai and his maid. There is not a wasted moment in the direction the scenery is beautiful the acting is very engaging the story seems to move at a gentle pace but it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen  one of those truly well made movies where the technical excellence is so understated that you know only that you're being swept along with the story. Highly highly recommended.".

The period when the action happens is the same one where 'The Last Samurai' is located the time when Japan underwent rapid transformation and opening to the Western culture and way of life but the angle is the one of the traditional samurai world. Like in the more famous movie the centuries old code of honor of the samurais enters in conflict with the rapid pace of change of the society around but this conflict takes a secondary role here.It is actually the old code of honor that motivates Munezo the principal character and which prevents him to consume his love to the servant Kie who belongs to another social class and leads him into a life and death fight with his old friend who revolted against the stagnating system. The moral value of the code prevails and saves eventually the heroes in a kind of happy end not unexpected but yet well desired by audiences who identified with the heroes. The film is well acted and uses less the high tomes and interjections that sometimes discourage the Western audiences watching Japanese movies. The cinematography is consistent in approach and dominated by balanced nuances of brown and yellow. Without daring too much 'The Hidden Blade' is a well told story and should not be avoided by fans of Japanese films or even as plain entertainment.".

Yji Yamada masterful retelling of Samurai films transports the tale to XIX Japan and the world of Samurai . It stars a19th Century samurai  held in low esteem due to an action by his late father who committed suicide by seppuku . Well set  as it takes place during the time of change of the mid19th Century  as it is set in the fictional Unasaka domain . It resembles the real area of Yamagata prefecture which is in the Northern part of Japan  there Yaichiro Yukiyoshi Ozawa  is said goodbye by his fellow samurai Friends Munez  Katagiri Masatoshi Nagase and Samon Shimada Hidetaka Yoshioka  as he leaves their clan on the northwest coast of Japan to take a fundamental rank within the shogunate in far away Edo . Munezo has lived modestly with his mummy and sister Shino after his dad was forced into suicide after being caught in a failed political intrigue as well as the failure of a bridge Project . Meanwhile  Kie Takako Matsu  a farm girl serves them as a maid at their home . As time passes Munezo's sister marries Samon his mother passes away  Kie is married into a merchant family and he is required to learn use western weapons from an official sent from Edo. Learning that Kie is ill due to mistreating and abuse  Munezo rescues her . But Munezo is a bachelor man and is really criticized for her serving at his home  then Munezo sends her back to her father's farm. Shortly after  an official called Yaichiro falling in disgrace and imprisoned in solitary confinement . Later on  Yaichiro breaks out  Munezo is assigned an unfortunate mission  to kill Yaichiro  as he seeks the help of his old teacher  the sword master Kansai Toda. Swordsman Toda now teaches him a new technique to use  as Munezo prepares to take on Yaichiro who has taken hostages .The impressive flick blends moving drama  violent fights  emotion  a love story and results to be pretty entertaining  as well as thought provoking and in which a Samurai must resolve his history with a maid and with his close friend .Dealing with thoughtful themes as impossiblity marriage due to different castes  fidelity  Modern Times with use of methods of warfare such as the utilization of artillery and firearms and mutual affection and respect among people . The film confirmed Yji Yamada's greatest strength and his innovative handling of the popular Samurai genre and this interesting story was created by the novelist Shuhei Fujisawa . The movie title comes from a Samurai master  an expert swordsman who entrusted the secret of the Hidden Blade to starring Munez KatagiriNagase . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right  as the Deep impact of the action and combats on this provoking Samurai film  whose main representation was Seven samurai by Akira Kurosawa  it opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged swordplays occur on and off throughout the plot . Enough budgeted production  with appropriate setting  lots of mood  and sad atmosphere . Masatoshi Nagase gives an extraordinary acting as the upright lord who receives a difficult mission  as he is ordered to prove his innocence from complicity by killing his old friend . It contains stunning fight scenes  fine performances adequate sets  exciting drama in which all of the fire  ambition and doom of the Samurai films come brilliantly to life .The motion picture was well directed by Yji Yamada  though slowmoving .He is a good craftsman who in 1969 launched the popular Torasan series the world's longest theatrical film series. The Twilight Samurai 2002 marks his 77th film as well as his 41th year as a director since his first film in 1961 Nikai no Tanin Stranger Upstairs.

The the plot shift is also nice to see opens with the honor plot then focus on the love plot and then focus to the honor plot and closes with the love plot. Yet I think that the side plot of the western modernization on the clan's military doesn't really have any significant thing and looks only as a waste of duration time. The character building is very nice especially on Munezo and Kie and even also on Hanzama. I like the acting overall which is a good work for me. Masatoshi Nagase played the movie's focus character very well encompassing all the needed emotions just enough to keep the samurai pride in them. Takako Matsu also played well enough as the servant. This movie is quite entertaining although I think the duration can be shortened a little bit to excluding all those unimportant parts.".

The protagonist Katagiri is a samurai in the nineteenth century when Japan is opening up to new technology and the samurai are having to learn for to use rifles rather than the swords they have traditionally used. Some time after seeing his friend Hamaza depart for Edo Katagiri learns that his former servant Kie is being mistreated by her husband's family so he brings her back to his house where she returns to good health it is clear that they have feelings for each other but they are of different social classes so marriage is out of the question. After a while people start to talk and he has to send her back to her parents around this time his old friend Hamaza returns as a prisoner accused of plotting against his superiors. When he escapes Katagiri is told that he must either fight and kill Hamaza or he will be considered an accomplice.While this wasn't quite the film I'd been expecting I enjoyed it none the less largely because it depicted a period of Japanese history that I knew nothing about. The story was interesting with a good cast of characters and while there wasn't much action the fight scene was pretty good. Surprisingly there were quite a few laughs too just about any time the samurai were receiving training from their instructor from Edo some laughs were to be had. Some viewers may find the upbeat ending a little bit clich but I for one was rather pleased with it. Away from the story itself I must comment on the look of the film everything looked great whether it was the houses the scenery or just a shot of the cherry blossom that is a feature of so much Japanese culture. I'd certainly recommend this to people wanting to see a film about this period in Japanese history without being full of bloody swordplay.".

Some viewers may find the upbeat ending a little bit clich but I for one was rather pleased with it. Away from the story itself I must comment on the look of the film everything looked great whether it was the houses the scenery or just a shot of the cherry blossom that is a feature of so much Japanese culture. I'd certainly recommend this to people wanting to see a film about this period in Japanese history without being full of bloody swordplay.";

Tenka no Hadou Ken has the feel of something bigger.This may be at least in part because of the storyline of the movie which reaches back to the time of Inuyasha's birth and his father's death. We finally get a look at his father Inu no Taisho and a peek into the pasts of Inuyasha his parents and his brother Sesshoumaru.The plot in brief most Inuyasha fans probably already know about the two swords Inu no Taisho left his sons Tessaiga and Tenseiga. The title of Tenka no Hadou Ken  which translates to The Sword of World Conquest  refers to a third sword Sou'unga. While Tessaiga is the sword of man and Tenseiga is the sword of heaven Sou'unga is the sword of hell. After Inu no Taisho's death it was sealed  only to end up at the Higurashi shrine in the present day for Kagome and Inuyasha to run across.Predictably enough all hell breaks loose.Tenka no Hadou Ken is particularly interesting because not only does it give us a glimpse of Inuyasha's father it also provides a peek at the inner workings of his brother Sesshoumaru one of the series' more inscrutable characters. The movie also contains all the ingredients that make the series what it is the semimythological setting and most of the regular cast of characters whose interaction is as layered and satisfying as ever. Although the somewhat grim storyline mostly precludes humor once it gets going there are a few comedic moments  most notably the opening scene with Inuyasha and Kagome which is comedy gold.Fans of the series should definitely not miss this installment.".

My guess is that if you're curious about seeing the third Inuyasha film then you are already an Inuyasha fan so I'll write this for all you otakus out there! In SOWC the ghost Soyosama a former counsel of Inuyasha's father releases the evil demonic sword Sounga from its sheath after containing it for 700 years. Somehow the sword has ended up in the Higurashi family temple in modernday Tokyo and Inuyasha and Kagome everywhere throughout Japan. The Sounga is connected intimately with Inuyasha's past and we learn more about Inuyasha's family history and the existence of the three great swords including the Sounga.Not only is SOWC a genuine movie and not just a long tiresome episode it is more surprisingly a GOOD film! SOWC is wellscripted with excellent pacing rich setting and an exciting climax. You can tell that the Inuyasha movie production team finally took the time to learn how a film differs from an animated sitcom. For fans it fills the gap in our understanding of Inuyasha's origins and the history between his demon father and human mother.I highly recommend this film and hope the Inuyasha 4 Fire on the Mystical Island proves to be as good or even better. Even though it's a nonsequitur I must add that this female otaku thinks Inuyasha's older brother Sesshyomaru is a real babe.".

The movie's OC villain Takemaru was surprisingly deep and had an exceptional storyline laced with Izayoi Inuyasha's mother. The father of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru however was probably the highlight of this feature he himself was worth seeing the entire movie for.However there were one or two things that troubled me about this story. There were many outofcharacter moments that just irked me but that's to be expected by the people who write the movies and are not too familiar with the original manga.Though I'm happy to say that this movie's animation is much more consistent and mirrors both the manga and anime stylings very well. The music is amazing I was happy to see some of the old stuff from the first season mixed in there. Four Seasons at the end was also a very nice treat.All and all I would say that this is one that needs to be seen by any fan avid or not.".

To stop this evil sword from causing destruction Inuyasha must combine his Wind Scar his sword's special attack with Sesshomaru's sword attack. But can these two brothers who are completely different from each other one is a haughty full demon the other a stubborn halfdemon cooperate to stop this evil?CommentsThis third Inuyasha movie is perhaps the best one I've seen so far. It's got better achingly beautiful animation and there's so much action. The music by Kaoru Wada also keeps getting better.Like all Inuyasha movie this one includes the main cast of characters  Inuyasha the hero himself and Kagome the human girl from the future who travels back in time via an enchanted well. Other famous characters include the lecherous yet lovable monk Miroku and the feisty demon slayer Sango. It was too bad that they didn't have other wellloved characters such as Kikyo or Kagura. But does that really matter? An addition to the cast of characters is Takemaru a samurai lord who loved Inuyasha's mother and died in battle with Inuyasha's father. He has just been resurrected by the Sounga and with that demonic sword having taken possession of his body he's out to get Inuyasha and Sesshomaru. He's an interesting character and great addition to the cast.Sesshomaru our hero's older bro plays a major role in this movie and he's the one who really steals the show. Furthermore we get to see Inuyasha's mother last seen in the first season of the anime and finally his father the Great Dog Demon. This film delves into Inuyasha's family history and explores his relationship with his haughtily full demon older brother who looks down on Inuyasha for being only a halfdemon.Swords of an Honorable Ruler is also packed with powerful moving scenes. Gotta love that scene where Sesshomaru is asked by his father whether he has someone to protect and year later sternly replies that he has no one to protect but later save Rin and Jaken. Such a perfect blend of Sesshomaru's haughty arrogance and his caring fatherly side.Conclusion Without a doubt this is one of the best Inuyasha movies if not the very best.".

Two of the swords he sent to his sons individually at the time of his death but sealed away So'unga for 700 years to keep out of everyone's clutches so that it wouldn't open up the gateway between Hell and Earth and not rain destruction upon the world. Naturally the So'unga ends up in Higuarshi possession and all hell breaks loose when the sword breaks the seal and finds its way to Inuyasha and a spurned suitor of Inuyasha's mother who was killed by Inyu no Taisho.What makes this movie so great is that we get more into the relationship between Inuyasha and his older half brother Sesshomaru and that it focuses on the theme of how far would you go to protect someone. Inuyasha has Kagome to protect while Sesshomaru was only Rin and Jaken to protect although he wont admit it. A plus for the fans is that we get to see Inuyasha's father for the first and only time in the series in the opening scene that occurs right around the time that Inuyasha is born. We never see his face completely but its very memorable.The animation is top notch the script is well done and stays true to the series and even welcomes newcomers with its great backstory opening.I don't remember So'unga being mentioned at all during the series but what the heck the movie's awesome. Swords of an Honerable Ruler is not just the best Inuyasha movie but a spectacular piece of animation that comes from Japan.".

Now that it's been over for awhile now people are just more interested in currently running anime. I remember reading a magazine that talked all about the anime and explained all the characters. I feel bad for forgetting a lot of the plot. Then again I never watched a single episode. I did end up reading the final chapter of the manga. I mean that was so significant even as someone who wasn't a fan I had to see that! Well my movie certainly jogged my memory. Maybe the best part is how it begins by giving Inuyasha's origin story.We even get Kagome tell us about everything that's going on in the show so it's very easy for non fans to catch up with everything! Thanks Kagome! This was my first time watching Inuyasha and it's great to be watching something so popular. The best part about this was probably the animation. I mean everything is so gorgeous here. It looks brand new! I was able to remember the characters and am glad they all contributed to the plot. This movie's plot features a magic sword that corrupts its users. We get zombies which is always a plus. I rarely see that in anime so thank you Inuyasha! 12".

	schema:reviewBody "THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS REGARDING FILM PLOTCHARACTERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...Inuyasha 3 Swords of an Honorable Ruler!!! applause It's true folks from all the Inuyasha films this film is the best of all the installments includes the 1st 2nd and the 4th This is because the story didn't resolve around Kagome being a damsel in distress or drama in the never ending love triangle of KagomeKikyoInuyasha. No we are finally given a story that reveals just what is special of the swords Inuyasha and Sesshomaru possess and a third sword which belonged to the siblings father that is the trouble in the story.. The film focuses on the 'mysterious sword' later to be revealed as Sounga the demon possessed soul looking to conquer the lands. What's amazing about this film is the fact sounga is a demon possessed sword that can control the dead as well as fight so well that even Inuyasha and Sesshomaru aren't able to defeat without working together. but there the question is will the siblings put their own grudges aside and fight sidebyside with the swords given to them by their father whom we get to see in the film briefly in the intro and conclusion without killing each other? It really is an amazing film for the story line and actual character development in the film. Sesshomaru's character throughout the show has always been dark and secret yet in the film we see more to what his father meant to him and just what kind of a person he is. Another plus side to the film is the action buildup where our heroes along with sesshoumaru and his crew of Rin Jaken and AhUhn along with the sword maker Totosai i think i spelled his name right fight the army of the dead literally controlled by Sounga and the man known as Takemaru. a samurai who battled against Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's dad and lost As great as this film is it only gets 910 only because of one character who remains consistently annoying throughout the film in my opinion.KAGOME just can't seem to remember the hero's name since she's constantly shoutingscreamingsayingwhispering his name at least 100 times in just one sentence. Like i'm glad she's no damsel in this film and actually does some asskicking with a headstrong attitude. But it's not needed to have someone shout the hero's name especially when the hero is either fighting saving someone trying to get something done does his own thing or is busy. The old gang Miroku Sango and Shippo are great too with the role of supporting our hero. Miroku and Sango even have their moment which is really sweet to watch. So allinall watch the film cause it's great from start to finish with fantastic action and a few romantic moments. A must for any Inuyasha fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sullivan's Travels is a twofer for me it's my favorite Preston Sturges film and my favorite Joel McCrea one. It's an antimessage film loaded with humor with a most sublime message indeed.Joel McCrea plays director John Sullivan who's tired of making silly comedies and musicals for his studio. He wants to make films of social significance with a message about the troubles in today's world.Problem is that he doesn't know anything about poverty and unemployment he's a rich kid who's been to boarding school. So off he sets several times it turns out to discover how the other half lives.That last time he sets out is a bit unplanned and through a combination of circumstances he winds up on a prison chain gang in some southern state. He learns some really profound lessons from that experience.But that's the serious side of Sullivan's Travels. Before that the film has some really gut splitting funny moments like McCrea learning about the speed of a whippet tank being accused of stealing his own car. But my favorite is when he falls in the clutches of spinsters Elmira Sessions and Esther Howard. McCrea sets out to learn about poverty and deprivation and the two sisters see him as the answer to some poverty and deprivation they've been suffering for some time. Maybe the chain gang didn't look so bad.Veronica Lake in her memoirs said that one of the films she enjoyed most was Sullivan's Travels where she plays an disillusioned Hollywood hopeful who befriends the tramp McCrea without knowing who he really is. The following year Lake would be paired with Alan Ladd who was closer to her height. She said McCrea was a kind and decent man and wonderful to work with. The disparity of their height was the source of some amusement and some problems for Preston Sturges. Lake was a tiny thing it was why she was teamed with Alan Ladd and McCrea was well over six feet tall. Check the shots of them together very rarely will you see them standing side by side.Sturges used a lot of his regular company of players. My two favorites in the supporting cast are Robert Grieg and Edward Blore who are McCrea's butler and valet. Both turn out to be wise men in their warnings to their boss about this folly he is undertaking.It's been said that Sullivan's Travels is supposed to be the antiFrank Capra film about messages. I'm not sure Capra saw it that way. If you look at the portion of the film when Sullivan falls into this unfamiliar universe of the chain gang it's very similar to what George Bailey was experiencing in that parallel universe he was sent to in It's A Wonderful Life. I think Sturges and Capra would find a lot of common ground in the messages of It's A Wonderful Life and Sullivan's Travels.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes right down to it what you think' you want isn't necessarily what you really' want nor is it likely to be anything you need.  But finding the answer is up to the individual a prospect that's explored in the satirical Sullivan's Travels' directed by Preston Sturges.  Movie director John L. Sullivan Joel McCrea has made a career of churning out one successful comedy after another yet he remains unfulfilled.  He longs to do a serious' film one with meaning a drama that will leave his mark on the industry and the world.  And he has a property that he thinks is perfect a screenplay entitled O Brother Where Art Thou?'  The studio he works for however balks at the idea Sullivan's comedies are not only good they're a cash cow for the studio so why fool with success?Sullivan is adamant though and determined to make his film he strikes a bargain with the studio and gets the green light.  But once he's given the goahead he wants to do it right and he realizes that to make a truly meaningful film he must first experience himself the hardships of life he will be examining in O Brother.'  So with only a dime in his pockets he sets out on the road to find out what life' is really all about.  And before it's over he will get all he's looking for and more in an odyssey that will be unforgettable for Sullivan and for the audience as well. Filled with pathos and poignancy Sturges' film is an insightful sojourn across the territory of the human condition.  It'll make you laugh and it'll make you cry as along with Sullivan you come face to face with some hard truths about reality.  And Sullivan's eventual epiphany regarding his personal wants and needs may be your own as well because this is a film with a definite message that is honest and undeniable.  A lesson in life delivered subtly and sensitively by Sturges who makes it entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.  It's refreshing in fact t discover a film that delivers such an impact without having to resort to any kind of sensationalism relying instead on the inherent humanity of the story which Sturges conveys masterfully.  With exceptions of course it's a sensibility few of today's directors seem to possess.  Some notable exceptions would be Ang Lee with The Ice Storm' Kenneth Lonergan's You Can Count On Me' and Tom DiCillo's Box of Moonlight.'  All are films that like Sullivan' are journeys of discovery profound in sentiment without being overly sentimental.  There are more to be sure but they seem too few and far between.One of the elements that makes this film so engaging is its colorful cast of characters and the actors it employs to bring it to life beginning with it's star McCrea who hits his stride as Sullivan with facility.  He credibly reflects Sullivan's ideals and principles with a look as well as an attitude that makes it work quite naturally.  You can believe this is a man with perhaps not a naive but certainly a rather guarded perception of life in the real world.  Which is not to say he lacks insight or wisdom it's merely one of the basic truths this film points out that people live within parameters of their own design established through personal experience and frame of reference.  And that's the John Sullivan McCrea presents here with a portrayal that is honest and incisive.Veronica Lake was one of the hottest actresses around in 1942 when this film was made and as the girl who becomes a part of Sullivan's journey she lends considerable charm and a bit of mystique to the film.  It's a fairly straightforward role that benefits from her sparkle and personality a notable performance that adds a touch of humor and some class to the proceedings without being particularly exceptional.  But watching her it's easy to understand the attention she received especially after draping her long blond hair across her eye peekaboo style which started a craze that swept the country while creating an indelible image that ultimately defined her career.The supporting cast includes Robert Warwick Mr. Lebrand William Demarest Mr. Jones Franklin Pangborn Mr. Casalsis Porter Hall Mr. Hadrian Byron Foulger Mr. Valdelle Margaret Hayes Secretary Robert Greig Sullivan's Butler and Eric Blore Sullivan's Valet.  Call it a lesson in life or a lesson about human nature however you see it Sullivan's Travels' is an experience you're going to remember.  Entertaining enjoyable and enlightening it's an uplifting appreciation of the way things are and not necessarily the way you think' they should be.  It's a film that celebrates the comfort to be found in finding your own niche and realizing the importance of whatever it is that you contribute to your world and those around you.  It leaves you with a sense of purpose and the understanding that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  And it makes your own grass look pretty good in the bargain.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.".

Call it a lesson in life or a lesson about human nature however you see it Sullivan's Travels' is an experience you're going to remember.  Entertaining enjoyable and enlightening it's an uplifting appreciation of the way things are and not necessarily the way you think' they should be.  It's a film that celebrates the comfort to be found in finding your own niche and realizing the importance of whatever it is that you contribute to your world and those around you.  It leaves you with a sense of purpose and the understanding that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  And it makes your own grass look pretty good in the bargain.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.";

It is also arguably the most audacious film in Hollywood's mainstream history audacious because it takes the kinds of risks that can so easily fall flat on their face and right until the final image as Sturges becomes increasingly ambitious and multilayered you wonder how long he can keep it up without getting ridiculous.  It never does but the film is so full of contradictions tensions suppressions clanging lurches in tone  'Travels' is ostensibly a comedy and one of Hollywood's best but the last twenty minutes are truly painful to watch harrowing and not at all funny.The overriding source of tension of course  is the film itself the plot and the emotions that are supposed to be elicited.  It is very difficult and frequently impossible to gauge the tone of any one scene.  Sometimes this is straightforward as when information is deliberately withheld from the audience it is asked to make a judgement and then shown to be wrong as in the scenes where the studio moguls claim a background of deprivation which is historically plausible.  This kind of comedy is familiar enough. But what about the later montage of Sullivan and the Girl experiencing the 'reality' of poverty  are these scenes supposed to be genuine representation of poverty?  Are they part of a wider satire on pious films like 'Grapes of Wrath' which dubiously aestheticise poverty  there are a lot of Expressionistic flourishes in this sequence?  Are they a kind of abstract purgatory through which Sullivan finds spiritual understanding? There is a big difference between the representation of poverty in this sequence and the one where Sullivan is attacked and sent to prison.  But is one more 'authentic' than the other  the second one bravely rejects the view of 'noble' poverty shows how it dehumanises people turns them instinctual and brutal but it also provides a neat moral which suggests that if you do somebody wrong you will be horribly punished for it.  This realism therefore is as contrived as the first.  Is this Sturges' point that the good intentions of realism are always tainted by ideological assumptions patronising goodwill or motives of elevation.  This sense of artifice of a film comprised of varying selfreflexive modes rather than a plausible narrative runs through 'Travels' with characters talking about the film they're in as a plot  in direst danger Sullivan acknowledges the need for a helluva twist which duly arrives filmed in silent slapstick with barely concealed Sturges contempt and did his friends seem terribly put out by his death?.This would seem to uphold 'Travels'' ostensible theme its celebration of comedy as a sugar with which to sweeten the harshness of reality.  This is a very cynical view of comedy and a highly manipulative conservative one  distract an unhappy populace from the injustice of their lives.  The best comedies  from 'Sherlock Jr' and 'Modern Times' to 'Playtime' and 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie' have always been about real life encouraging their viewers to think harder about the society they live in much more effectively than socalled naturalism.  'Travels' is no exception.  It might be a celebration of comedy but this is comedy a million miles from 'Ants in your Pants'.  What other 40s film still manages to show the brutality of poverty of the prison system of race relations the fate of young women in sexually voracious Hollywood the Girl's ease with her body in the swimming pool scene speaks volumes however we choose to read them?  When Sullivan's determination at the end to continue making populist comedies is endorsed by the ringing laughter of the world's meek and suffering the disjunction is grotesque.  This is a man on an airplane completely removed from reality surrounded by wealthy toadies. Those happy laughs could so easily be contemptuous guffaws because what Sullivan wants to do and Sturges hasn't is hide the inequalities of capitalism the system on which Hollywood thrives and the flaws in which they would be only too happy to cover up with inanity.  But to even suggest this is to fall into the 'Capra' trap mocked at the beginning.This difficulty is what makes 'Travels' such a stunningly modern film  its shifts from sophisticated verbal wit to elaborate slapstick to blatant Carry Onlike innuendo the matronly sister dusting  the bedpost after seeing a sweating shirtless Sullivan work to tragedy to hallucination and dream to satire foreshadows Melville and the New Wave while the privileged rich man who cannot escape Hollywood would transmute into the guests who can't leave the house or can't get dinner in later Bunuel films or the film that begins with an end.  The opening sequence takes off 'Citizen Kane'.  The deadpan genderplay is quietly gobsmacking and Veronica Lake as a gorgeous tramp would be alluded to by Jeanne Moreau in 'Jules et JIm'.

In a way this is a satire about the movie industry.Hollywood in the early years wouldn't touch any project that it deemed non commercial. Which is why when John Sullivan a successful director of film comedies decides to do a movie based on a serious book the studio thinks he must be going crazy. Why would this director want to make the movie going public think? It was a preposterous notion then as well as today when basically all movies making any points are independently produced. After all the industry wants everyone to have a great time be entertained and not make them think about at all.John Sullivan gets much more than what he bargained for when he decides to take to the back roads of the country dressed as a hobo and with only ten cents in his pocket. The first check on reality comes when he meets the kind girl at the road side diner. He is hungry but what can one get for a dime? This girl who has had it trying to make a name in the movies orders ham and eggs for him no strings attached. If there is a more kindred soul than this young woman who wants nothing in return we haven't met her yet.Sully and the girl go back on the road where they witness the reality of America's indigents traveling back and forth in empty cattle cars all over the country in search of jobs or perhaps a better living. Sullivan ultimately wants to give money anonymously to the poor people he has met but he meets with disaster and ends up in jail the victim of circumstantial evidence and he is sent to jail. One night Sully discovers the great mystery about the allure of the pictures It's the laughter stupid! Sullivan realizes how far off the mark he has been in trying to bring drama to the masses.Joel McCrea makes a fantastic Sullivan. This under estimated man was a great comedian as well as an actor that is always believable. The whole reason for watching this movie is Mr. McCrea's performance. His chemistry with the ravishingly beautiful and young Veronica Lake is one of the best things in the film. Both these actors under Mr. Sturges' direction do their best work on screen. Sturges makes fun at his own expense when the girl asks Sully if he can introduce her to the great Hollywood director Ernst Lubitsch. Mr. McCrea and Ms. Lake seem to be having a fun time together.Mr. Sturges always surrounded himself with a group of actors that one sees in his movies. Robert Greig Eric Blore William Demarest and the rest of the cast contribute to make this a winning comedy. The best scene that involves most of these actors happen at the beginning of the film when they are chasing Sullivan in the R.V. and things inside the trailer begin falling all over the place. That was priceless movie making.Preston Sturges combines a social commentary with comedy in this brilliant film that is a tribute to his genius.".

I'm amazed that Hollywood could capture the pathos so well. It made Sullivan's eventual point and should make that same point to movie producers and audiences alike.As a film school student I was taught that when people make lists of greatest movies seldom are comedies included.Sullivan's Travels helps dispel the notion a comedy can't be great. It is both significant and thoroughgoing entertainment.".

I'm amazed that Hollywood could capture the pathos so well. It made Sullivan's eventual point and should make that same point to movie producers and audiences alike.As a film school student I was taught that when people make lists of greatest movies seldom are comedies included.Sullivan's Travels helps dispel the notion a comedy can't be great. It is both significant and thoroughgoing entertainment.";

It occurs on no regular basis from no reliable source and is accountable to no one for what it says and does.  Preston Sturges wanted to make that point in Sullivans Travels and he does so exceedingly well with everything from slapstick frolics in the land cruiser to fleas in the bed to hectoring soliloquies about poverty from the butler.Ten years before Chaplin tried to explain the same thing in his movie Limelight Sturges tells a tale meant to both hearten and cozen us.  It heartens us to know that a cynical moneygrubbing place like Hollywood will continue to spin out comedies because they make money.  And it cozens us into thinking there is something magical about comedians.  Anyone who has ever actually known or been married to a professional funnyperson knows they are by turns grumpy lazy tempermental stubborn and always insecure.  Not the life of the party.

	schema:reviewBody "In Hollywood the spoiled director of humdrum movies John Lloyd Sullivan Joel McCrea was born in silver spoon but is very successful with his superficial comedies. Out of the blue he tells to his producer Mr. LeBrand Robert Warwick that he wants to make serious dramas like O Brother Where Art Thou? and he will live like a tramp on the streets to learn the sorrows of great part of the population. He wears cheap clothes and tries to blend with poor people but he always returns to Hollywood protected by the safety team hired by the studio.One day he goes to a dinner with a coin and a blonde girl Veronica Lake offers bacon and eggs to him. Soon he learns that the girl is a failed actress that had never a chance in Hollywood and is returning home hitchhiking without any money. Sullivan decides to retribute her kindness giving a ride to her in his car but they are arrested by the police. When they are released the girl decides to join Sullivan in his quest to learn about poverty. When Sullivan is satisfied he is robbed and dumped unconscious in a train. He awakes in the countryside where there is an incident and he is arrested and sentenced to a labor camp where he leans the importance of comedy in the miserable lives of destitute people. Sullivan's Travels is a delightful movie by Preston Sturges with a satire of Hollywood lifestyle and the importance of comedy in the life of people a relief for a couple of minutes for those that do not have other sort of entertainment. Joel McCrea is very funny in the role of a naive director trying to find how the poor people live. His chemistry with the gorgeous Veronika Lake is perfect and this was the first time that I noted that this lovely actress was only 1.51 m height. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Contrastes Humanos Human Contrasts".

When he realizes he knows nothing about THAT sort of life he sets out with 10 cents in his pocket and finds out what it's really like. Along the way he meets Veronica Lake  who plays The Girl.

Once he is convinced he knows nothing about real life he decides to travel across country as a tramp and discover that life. But nothing works.

McCrea is so grateful he decides to make one last pass among the bums and pass out 5dollar bills. Then tragedy strikes.As the film takes a tragic turn in becomes one of the great social satires of all time. Reaching the heights of Greek Tragedy Sullivan's Travels pulls no punches as Sturges examines reality vs. Hollywood illusion. Just a wonderful film from start to finish.McCrea and Lake had spotty careers in Hollywood. McCrea played all kinds of parts in the 30s and 40s but never really became a top star. He hit his peak in the early 40s with this film The Palm Beach Story and The More the Merrier. Lake was mostly confined to glamour roles but is totally winning and charming in this film.

William Demarest Franklin Pangborn Charles Moore Dewey Robinson Jimmy Conlin excellent Al Bridge Porter Hall Almira Sessions Esther Howard Frank Moran Robert Warwick Robert Greig Eric Blore Byron Foulger Margaret Hayes Steve Forrest Julius Tannen Torben Meyer Roscoe Ates and many others bring vibrancy humanity and humor to this great film.If you never see another Preston Sturges film this is the one to see!".

A butler pulled into a swimming pool as he tries to pull someone else out a chef in chaos in a mobile kitchen ends up with food all over his face at times these moments feel like they belong in a different film. The cathartic power of laughter is the overwhelming message of the film so a failure to be funny when it tries should be a major problem but for several reasons it isn't. Why Sullivan's Travels is such a great film comes down to a perfect script some unforgettable performances and one of my all time favourite scenes from any film I have ever seen. While the slapstick falls flat the dialogue on the other hand never does it crackles with wit and intelligence sidestepping every clich and expectation. Veronica Lake is lovely and reason alone to watch the film but a very small role performed by Jess Lee Brooks as a kindly preacher is truly wonderful and one that leaves the strongest lasting impression.The preacher appears in just one short part but its a scene that the films whole premise and emotional beliefs radiate out from. A churches congregation prepare for their 'guests' a gang of convicts who visit for screenings of cartoons in the church. As the congregation sing 'Let my People Go' the convicts seem to be summoned up from the surrounding swamp they somberly march in and sit in their designated pews at the front of the church. The cartoon show starts up and musters such insanely enthusiastic laughter from all present that it jolts the slightly wooden protagonist towards his epiphany. The whole scene is so totally barmy so full of heart and so visually striking that I find myself returning to it again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joel McCrea plays Sullivan a bigtime director of movie comedies and musicals who decides he wants to direct a film with a message and rides the rails as a bum to find out what it's like to be poor. He takes with him Veronica Lake playing a Hollywood starlet wannabe who's just about ready to throw in the towel. Together they find out that they can't really ever know what it's like to be poor unless they're actually poor a fate that eventually befalls Sullivan through a crazy turn of events after which he rediscovers the value of using film to make people laugh.Sullivan's Travels is one of those reflexive movies about Hollywood and the business of film making that can be wonderful when done well and entirely too self conscious when done poorly. I can't imagine writerdirector Preston Sturges having done a better job than he does here with this simply marvelous film easily one of the best of the 1940s and perhaps one of the best ever. Rarely have I felt that a director has made his point as clearly and effectively as Sturges does with this film. He manipulates his audience dexterously but not cheaply. When the film takes a dark and sobering turn we fidget anxiously and wait for it to get funny again which is exactly the reaction the studio executives in the film's opening tell Sullivan he can expect from his important film and why they tell him to stick to comedy in the first place. The irony of course is that in making a film about the value of mindless comedy Sturges at the same time made a quite important picture that more forcefully addressed the plight of the working man than any number of other films that treated the subject more seriously.I've never liked Joel McCrea better than I do here. His laconic way with a one liner is perfectly suited to Sturges' brand of quick and witty writing. Indeed the patter comes at you so quickly that your brain may have trouble keeping up with the jokes. Veronica Lake is cute and droll and she and McCrea get on well together. The film's best moments come when the pair are learning how to be hobos. And Sturges fills out the rest of his film with a cast of regulars from his stable of character actors with virtually every member getting some bit of business or a line to remember him by.However despite Sturges' wonderful dialogue the film's most memorable and beautiful moment comes when everybody shuts up and a montage of scenes showing McCrea and Lake experiencing life as it was for countless homeless and unemployed regular Americans at the tail end of the Depression plays out with no sound accompanied only by a pretty musical passage. In a movie that will take your breath away with its pace and crack comic timing this moment will take your breath away for different reasons altogether.Grade A".

This is not really a comedy film but the drama is cleverly accentuated with satirical antics through the first half of the story before it powerfully delivers the message. I will not give the reader a synopsis of this film as so many have so adequately done already. I will say the performance given by Joel McCrea is one of his finest. The young Veronica Lake adds glamour and gives a very charming performance worth seeing. William Demarest is completely in his element. The entire supporting cast all present their unique characters perfectly making this movie a brilliant achievement for writerdirector Preston Sturges. This is a must see classic film that still continues to deliver pure enjoyment.".

Early on he meets the girl Veronica Lake I don't recall her ever being given a name in the film who sees that he is too innocent to survive on his own and insists on bringing her broader knowledge of society to the journey and joining him to get him through this learning adventure.The first part of the film is comic but just as it seems to be coming to an unfulfilled ending something unexpected happens.  This event alters the course of everything and exposes John to some of the true injustices of the time  and shows him and poignantly reminded me that comedy is particularly important when some people have nothing else to cheer them up.This is a film of classic Hollywood vintage with good snappy performances by both of the lead actors.  The romance isn't at all developed but just seems to happen in a matteroffact way perhaps we can take it on faith that there is instant chemistry but what is lacking in psychology of the relationship is made up for in the chilling glimpse we get of the psyche of the underdog in Depression America.

Finally however something unexpected occurs which truly gives him a new perspective on the poor class and as his role as an entertainer.While many if not most consider this film to be a comedy classic I'm afraid I must disagree. Although there are some humorous parts the film in my perspective fails in it's most lofty ambition  that is to poignantly express the condition of the less fortunate while wrapping a screwball comedy around it which would be just the kind of entertainment those same unfortunate soles would enjoy  an ironic movie about movies.Charlie Chaplin was much more effective in expressing both the sadness of the poor class while mixing in effective and genuinely funny humor. Perhaps his films and others with similar themes succeeded where this one failed because we were drawn into the life of someone in the poor class and routed for the underdog as our protagonist in the midst of the humorous circumstances.In this case I found the protagonist to be shallow selfish and ultimately hypocritical. Here we have a rich welltodo Hollywood type pretending to be a tramp and being at a disconnect with their way of life for almost the entire film. As such we never develop a fondness for his character even though the circumstances he finds himself in may be interesting. In addition the whole character of Veronica Lake was entirely out of place in this film. The love interest distracted from the message the film tried to convey and she couldn't come across as looking even remotely the part of a poor disadvantaged young girl. She looked much more out of place in the tramp suit than did McCrea.In the final vignette where Sullivan supposedly sees the real plight of the less fortunate it is via rubbing shoulders with hardened criminals ! not just the poor unemployed trampledupon everyday man. And then he uses his position of status to its fullest unethical extent in order to weasel his way out of his undesired condition.

	schema:reviewBody "SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS 1941 A film review by Dan Navarro Copyright Dan Navarro 2005Writerdirector Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels 1941 a wicked satire of Hollywood is a masterpiece one of the best films ever made. The first time I saw this pinnacle of Sturges' estimable career was at an aud call when I was in grammar school. The teachers herded us kids into the auditorium to watch a 16mm print of it and they hoped get us out of their hair for an hour and a half. I was only about 6 years old but I believe Sullivan's Travels is the first film that ever made me cry tears of joy. It's been more than half a century but my eyes still well up when I watch it a sign that either the film is effective or I'm an easy mark. I prefer to believe it's the former.The plot tells of John L. Sully Sullivan a Hollywood director who is a big success at turning out comedies but then gets it into his head that he should direct a serious film with social significance all about tragedy hopelessness and suffering. To prepare himself for this bleak scenario he decides to go on the road dressed as a bum with only ten cents in his pocket to learn what it's like to be poor and hungry. Be careful what you wish for. Before Sullivan's travels come to an end he will have visited the darkest corner of the deepest pit of the human condition.This being a Preston Sturges picture of course there's a happy ending. But he puts the hero through hell before that happens. There's also a romance of sorts pairing Sullivan Joel McRea with a young woman we know only as The Girl Veronica Lake. I say of sorts because there is no love scene per se no kissing not even any fond hugging. The closest they ever get physically is one evening when the two ersatz hobos The Girl has joined him in his masquerade stop to admire the moon... and put their arms around each other lightly. Less is more. I think the love between them seems stronger than if they were pawing each other every few minutes.Preston Sturges began his Hollywood career as a screenwriter Never Say Die 1939 Remember the Night 1940 but soon prevailed on the studio brass to put him on as a director because he was frustrated at the way directors were reshaping his words. His first film as both writer and director The Great McGinty 1940 was a hit and won him an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Sturges was on his way.There's an early scene in Sullivan's Travels that deftly shows off Sturges' skill with wordplay. McRea Robert Warwick and Porter Hall are having a vigorous debate over the wisdom of embarking on Sullivan's new changeofpace film. The rapidfire dialogue is intoxicating to listen to because it seems the actors never take a breath. As each line ends a new one begins as if we are watching a relay race with words instead of batons. That's not all The entire scene from beginning to end is shot in one continuous take with no cuts. The camera moves as necessary to follow the actors but essentially it is all a single shot. And Sturges manages to bring the scene in at four minutes flat. I have no idea how he did it or how many retakes were needed to achieve this precision. But the effect is mesmerizing.Sturges gives us many great scenes in Sullivan's Travels but there is one that really put a lump in my throat. Sully has been imprisoned in a Deep South chain gang presided over by a ruthless warden the great Alan Bridge. The warden won't brook Sully's independent attitude and resolves to crush his spirit by locking him in the sweat box a sadistic oneman windowless cell where the hapless prisoner is forced to stand for hours alone.The prison trusty played by Sturges regular Jimmy Conlin visits the sweat box periodically and gives water to the dehydrated prisoner and also gives him words of encouragement. Finally at night the trusty is allowed to open the sweat box and release Sullivan from this torture device. He unlocks the door and the exhausted Sullivan collapses into his arms. The camera remains still for several seconds while the trusty cradles him gently. I don't know if Sturges intended this but the shot reminded me of a Renaissance painting of St. John holding the body of Christ after the Crucifixion.Sullivan's personal epiphany comes when he joins the other prisoners as guests at a local black church where they are treated to an evening of Mickey Mouse cartoons. The prisoners the warden even the preacher laugh uproariously at the antics of Mickey and his dog Pluto. Finally Sullivan starts to laugh too. And that's when this great comedy director realizes the truth the best gift he can offer his audiences is not dour drama but comedy  pictures that enrich the human condition by offering a touch of happiness in a world too filled with tragedy.McRea's final line in the movie is one of the greatest closers ever. After Sullivan's eventual escape and reunion with his Hollywood friends he announces that he won't be making that socially significant picture after all. He'll stick to making comedies. Why? There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Do you know that's all some people have? It's not a lot in this cockeyed caravan but it's better than nothing.

And this offense to intelligence has stood the test of time surviving the decades to stand as a Sturges comedic masterpiece. In evaluating this movie you have to put aside nostalgia and leave behind the hype surrounding the worthy reputation of Preston Sturges. Remove the wacky screwball dressing adorning Sullivan's Travels and what you're left with is a depiction of the poor and disadvantaged as a business demographic consumers of a commodity. Never mind that the reality was that a ticket for the 10 cent pictureshow would have been a real luxury back then an expense the poor could ill afford. Here Sturges won't even deign to suggest that they eat cake he wants to nourish their empty stomachs with laughter.The movie execs as portrayed in the storyline here accustomed to living in their bubbles of privilege see themselves as purveyors of a social service by making movies that give the unfortunate a few hours of laughs a respite from their miserable existence. A reductive and simplistic bit of selfrighteous justification. Joel McCrea as the movie director Sullivan masquerading as a down and outer to gain material for serious film topics engages in nothing but a tourist romp through the world of the havenots. His travels through the netherworld are accomplished under the surveillance of an entourage of assistants and consultants who follow him around as a force in constant and protective vigil. Veronica Lake is a wraithlike bit of feminine fluff a decorative element to provide romantic interest. She's too radiant and groomed to be believable as a disillusioned starlet worn out by the trials and tribulations undergone in a failed attempt to achieve Hollywood stardom. The scene in the church is crafted as a plot device for dramatic epiphany and recognition. The congregation of AfricanAmerican worshippers are joined by a group of convict laborers and as the preacher emotes all in the sight of God and after an introductory burst of hymn singing in unison this assembly is treated to a show of cartoons...in the likes of Mickey Mouse et al. Like an alien continuing his rocket ride into another galaxy Hollywood honcho Sullivan suddenly with wonderment sees the light. This flock of humble reverent souls burst out in unrestrained laughter an almost religious communion of joy overtakes all. Wow!...realizes the movie director I've got the formula now! Charlie Chaplin purportedly refused to be connected with the Sullivan's Travels project and it can be guessed at...for good reason. Chaplin's films could make you laugh and cry they convey humanity and compassion. In this film Sturges makes you cringe.".

	schema:reviewBody "If the message of this film can truly be summed up when McCrea's character says There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Then I can't say much for 'Sullivan's Travels'. I can see why someone might think this is a great movie. It attempts to mix comedy with social commentary. While attempting to make a comedy with some sense of purpose or message is a noble and bolder undertaking then most comedies especially screwball comedies of the 30s40s were willing to attempt. That doesn't mean it automatically gets an 'A' on effort alone. The fact is that this comedy doesn't even attempt to be a comedy for the last half of the movie and instead veers sharply into melodramatic commentary on the inequities of depression age America and the misguided way in which the upperclass views the lower. Oh and it also points out how ultimately Hollywood is a friend to the every man and provides a great social service kind of like Clooney's Oscar speech. Anyway the point is that all of the comedy in this movie is confined to the first half and the second is an overwrought drama which beats its message home. If this was truly a great comedy it would have integrated the two halves instead of lumping them one on after the other. Making a highly comedic satire that seamlessly blends comedy and drama while maintaining an interesting plot and effectively conveying the message can be done. 'Dr. Strangelove' or perhaps more to the point 'Network' and 'The Player' accomplish this task much more successfully then 'Sullivan's Travels' does.In any event I fail to see how AFI could rank this has the 39th funniest movie of all time. Was it the part where Veronica Lake pushes McCrea into the pool and then she falls in and the butler walks up and...well you know the rest. That bit has been done before but only like a million times before and sometimes it's a lake or pond instead of a swimming pool and I've seen it done with a puddle of mud and a bath tub too but I digress. Or okay how about the part where McCrea gets in the car with the kid and it goes tearing down the street out of control with the van chasing after them. Hmmm well OK how about the witty dialogue which for the period didn't come nearly as fast or furious as it does in other pictures. Now granted you may find the dialogue funny and I can't say that you don't maybe you honestly do. Maybe you were put in a maniacal uncontrollable fit of laughter like some of those prisoners were watching Pluto chase his tale around who knows? But what you can't tell me is that there are any jokes in the last 30 minutes of the film. And it is impossible for me to understand how a movie that half consists of routine slapstick in its first act and doesn't even attempt comedy in its final act is the 39th funniest movie of all time. Oh wait I know it's a freaking classic first off and not only that but one that champions the film industry itself. Give me a break. Oh by the way the little joke I made in the first two lines of this review is funnier then anything in 'Sullivan's Travels'. So at least if seeing the movie has lead you to read these reviews you got to see at least one good joke. If you're looking for a classic screwball comedy And after watching this I wouldn't even classify it as such but that's what I heard going in. go rent Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing up Baby or something that isn't Sullivan's Travels.".

Dominic West is over the top as Jigsaw  which is what Jigsaw should be! A horribly disfigured mob boss with a vendetta is not a subtle thing to begin with.As for the respectable critics' complaints 1. Violence Of course it's violent! What part of the title Punisher War Zone implies peaceful conflict resolution? He's not the Admonisher. The gore and violence is not at the level of a Saw film but it is high. It is rated R for a reason.2. Dialogue I think the critics have been spoiled by Dark Knight and Iron Man. Those were comicbook movies with extraordinarily good dialogue. Punisher War Zone is no worse than a Predator or Rambo First Blood. Not great but not awful. This is not supposed to be Hamlet.3. Script The story moves along well and when there's a break in the action which isn't very often the film doesn't drag it's always going somewhere. Not perfect but good. Much better than the critics have made it out to be.All in all a good time and one that I'll buy and rewatch as soon as it comes out on DVD.".

When the Punisher fails to kill an up and coming mobster named Billy Russoti Billy decides to start a war against the Punisher and he won't quit until the Punisher is dead.While the story may seem fairly basic it serves its purpose perfectly. This is the ultimate Punisher movie. There are more bullets and blood in this movie the most action movies and the action never lets up.Acting is well done by everyone. While I like Thomas Jane as an actor I think Ray Stevenson is a better Punisher. Dominic West is good as Jigsaw but I felt he might have hammed it up a bit in a few scenes.Lexi Alexander has made the quintessential Punisher film that dares to show you the gritty world of the Punisher without shying away from all the gore.

While that movie did not feel like a comic book adaptation at all the story being pretty ordinary and plot being too heavy war zone is much closer to the source material. Corny situations had corny and extremely violent solutions. Villains were perfectly cast and did feel like Punisher villains and got what they deserve from a Punisher. The accents were distracting in the beginning but once you get used to them which is pretty fast since everyone uses a fake sounding and bad accent you stop noticing it and focus on action which is plenty. Ray Stevenson was a perfect cast and comes across the perfectly believable imposing and intimidating killing machine as the Punisher. The muchmaligned first scene actually set the tone for rest of the movie for me when Punisher goes on a killing spree on the dining table killing everyone on the table menwomen alike in different but extremely bloody way. That is Punisher for me. Perfect movie for fans of Punisher and violent action movie fans in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those seeking out the sequel to the 2004 Punisher film will probably already know what they are getting into partly because a quite limited release at cinemas in the UK means it is not easy to stumble into ironic considering how many Brits are in it. This helps the film because really this is not something that tries to have something for everyone so much as it is a film that knows the target audience and is determined to give them what they want. As a result the story here is a simple affair of a criminal scarred by the Punisher going out for revenge while the police are after both of them  it is not the most complex bit of writing you'll ever see but then it doesn't need to be. Those looking for the Punisher's dark tone to be utilised to try and make this character into a possible Batman in regards having a dark psyche at the core of it will be disappointed because the film does no such thing. I was one of these people though and I was at least hoping that more would be made of the rage and loss inside Castle  but again a few flashbacks aside he generally just broods around the place full of vengeful justice.What carries the film then is a series of brutal action sequences and effects shots all full of callous violence macho posturing and gun play that rewrites all rules of the real world. At this point it does depend what you are looking for because there are a core of viewers will love the film for this as it delivers exploded head after collapsing face after dismembering and other really graphic acts. For me personally the overdose on excess is all too much and it does leave the film with this very unpleasant air that makes it harder to enjoy. If the violence was a little less graphic or frequently graphic then it would have been easier to actually enjoy the big action sequences for what they were rather than the gore putting me off  although again for some this will be the cherry on the cake. To the casual viewer this excess does give the film an exploitative careless edge where all the characters are little more than things waiting to explode and it limits how much we care  not just about the goons but also the main characters.This further detracts from the dark character of Castle as he becomes just a machine and not a man or even a shadow of a man  and no staring off moodily into the distance every now and again is not the same thing. At the same time it also limits the more flamboyant and silly side of the film  the side that the hammy Jigsaw needed to play up. You can see it in the excess but also in the Patton reference and other silly things all of these imply that it should be a little bit camp with the darkness hence making it a bit more fun and accessible but it doesn't do this and those that play to this side of it are left just looking silly in a bad way rather than a good way.Specifically West suffers from this as his comic book villain is lost in the sea of gore. As a Wire fan I do feel a bit for West but his Italian impersonation at the start is awful and once behind the makeup he can do little but be a bad man without much unique about him to make him notable for anything other than what he has done before. Stevenson is not good either but he matches the ambition of the film and makes for a big dark presence  which is all the material needs and this he does well. I quite liked Salmon in it because he is one of the few that feels natural  which is a bit of a condemnation on everyone else when you think about Salmon's range generally. Hutchinson matches West by overplaying but again the sense of comic book madness is taken away by the gore.Punisher War Zone is a basic genre film then. For target audience it will satisfy as it delivers simple characters with simple motivations a straightforward plot with lots of action and lots of gore  boxes ticked. However for many casual viewers it will be all too dark and unpleasant as the gore dominates and it makes everything seem a bit less entertaining and a lot more like work. The dark tone to the character and the hammy silliness of the villains are lost and the entire film appears to be about exploding heads  great if that is your thing but not so great if not. A noisy Saturday night special with your male friends  but that's all it is.".

For me Ray Stevenson is THE PUNISHER!!!!I like Dolph and Tom's interpretation are good though Tom Jane's performance is more of a Taxi Driver character then a Punisher Stevenson was the best and showed a wider range of emotion a great voice fighting guns and all together look and feel of Frank Castle.This is one of the best adaption of a comic in a long time the back story for Frank Castle was right on target and though Jigsaw's origin is modified its a better origin. The casting for all characters was great way to go Wayne for Microchip and Dominic for Jigsaw. Everyone fit perfect.The story for the movie felt like a comic book as The Punisher takes out criminals and how Jigsaw and his brother Looney Bin Jim wants revenge makes for great entertainment. But I do not want to spoil anything for moviegoers if you enjoy comics action or revenge movies check this one out.For all the people who reviewed this movie and either bitch about the violence or didn't like this incarnation of The Punisher had no idea about the character nor even read the comic book or didn't start reading until after the 2004 version. So this is a great tribute to almost all incarnation of the Punisher in the comics and even a nod to the 1989 version too.Though I like all the Punisher movies I liked the 1989 version better then 2004 version I think this is better then the 1989 and best adaption it may seem like a broken record but I feel it is necessary.By all mean check out one of the best action and comic book movie in a long time. This brings back what action should be like. I too hope this will have a good box office return as well for rentals and sales to bring more sequels! The producers are already in talks in for more and Barricuda could be the next villain!Way to go Lexi and Ray and everybody involved working on this film thank you for bringing back the PUNISHER!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have ever read the famed comic books containing the hero Punisher then you are in for a special movie treat. This dramatic story is called  Punisher War Zone.  Writer Nick Santora allows his imagination to run rampant and in doing so creates a solid storyline which will have audiences gasping by what they've seen. Ray Stevenson plays Frank Castle a professional Exsoldier who's wife and daughter were murdered by street thugs drug dealers and gang members. In this story CastlePunisher goes after the Italian Russian and Asian mobs in an effort to clean the streets. However one of the most vicious gang leader suffers a horrific disfigurement and takes the name of his deformity called 'Jigsaw.' Dominic West With his phychotic and deranged brother 'Loony Bin Jim' they set out to destroy Castle his friends and anyone close to him. The entire movie is one exciting slam bang and explosive tour through the bowels of hell. It was surprising to see Wayne Knight as a courageous Micro in among all that black gang and destructive mayhem. If you are looking for an exciting gut wrenching and certainly bullet ridden film with bodies flying everywhere this is your movie. Black as pitch written for the dogeatdog audience this movie creates a spiral stairway into the very bowels of darkness. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Taken on its own terms Punisher War Zone is everything it is supposed to be excessively violent larger than life fast paced and almost always loads of fun. War Zone doesn't take itself seriously and it doesn't ask the audience to do so like the '90 and '04 films did. It never ponders the morality of its hero any more than necessary it's The Punisher for gods' sakes.The casting of Ray Stevenson as Frank Castle is in a word perfect. He is commanding intimidating and always fun to watch. If you can't enjoy Stevenson as The Punisher you shouldn't even be watching the damn movie. Though the film is shot tongueincheek Stevenson stays consistent but is almost always interesting to watch. The supporting cast led by Dominic West as Jigsaw also shines in several scenes. There are no weak links in the cast to undermine WZ the way say John Travolta undermined the alreadysuffering Thomas JanePunisher movie. There are many reasons to fault the first two Punisher pics for perhaps giving the character a bad rap because the critics sure seem to be roasting this more than necessary. One perplexing review comes from Roger Ebert who seems to praise the film in several ways while outright damning it to the same exact two star rating he applied to the first two far dumber and less entertaining Punisher movies The Punisher War Zone is one of the bestmade bad movies I've seen. It looks great it hurtles through its paces and is wellacted. The soundtrack is like elevator music if the elevator were in a death plunge. The special effects are state of the art. Its only flaw is that it's disgusting.I don't see what's wrong with that. This isn't an average mainstream film. This is an extremely gory film with a level of violence that is rarely seen on the big screen outside of the Saw movies. And yet it remains entertaining even comedic in how far it goes. The superb and colorful cinematography action choreography sound effects score and editing make Punisher War Zone a must for dark comic book fans and action film junkies.".

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost I'd like to state my earnest interest in The Punisher character. I can honestly say he is my favorite superhero of them all largely because of the realistic nature of the character which is more easy to relate to IMO.I will begin by saying that I had very low expectations for the PUNISHER WARZONE going into the movie. With the impression that the movie was just gonna be a mindless shoot 'em up kind of flick I was not far off from my prediction.There's not much to speak of about the plot other than to say that it was massively inadequate and was there just for the sake of having a plot. The action albeit good and entertaining was way over the top and at many times pointless. Now don't get me wrong I love a great action flick but there comes a certain feeling of annoyance when the plot is practically ignored just to have Frank slay a herd of people. In my mind and I'm pretty sure many of you will agree the action is supposed to SUPPLEMENT the plot not the other way around. This movie failed to do that.I also must say that the character development was utterly horrible. I knew nothing of Microchip or Soap's motivation. Why not explain that Micro's reason for helping the Punisher is because his son was murdered? Why not spend more time on Frank's motivation? It seems the action is all the producers cared about. Soap and Micro were virtually ignored and seemed to just be thrown in there to remind the audience that they were still watching the Punisher. There wasn't an ounce of reason as to why we should care for The Punisher's accomplices. There was no sympathy for Micro's death. If you're gonna kill a character like Micro at least try to develop him some.Furthermore the acting was terrible. Ray Stevenson seemed allergic to emotion and his wordless role in the first 30 minutes of the movie left me unconnected with the character and his purpose. Tip of the iceberg. I actually looked around at the 15 filled theater to see if anyone was buying the scene when Donatelli's wife was threatening to kill Frank. And don't get me started on Dominic West's New York accent. Yeah definitely not one of the film's bright spots.All in all I think the movie was just really bad. The action was way over the top. It was entertaining yes but at many times needless. It is undeniable in my eyes to see the glaring flaws in the movie's lack of the well rounded storyline and character development that Thomas Jane's version provided. It seemed that the makers of WAR ZONE took everything the '04 version was missing and took it way too far to the point that the story was ignored. Yes I wholeheartedly prefer Jane as the Punisher but it seems both movies were undeniably hindered by poor writing. I recommend this movie purely for brainless action. Otherwise thumbs down.".

I enjoyed  the previous Punisher movie with Thomas Jane as a guilty pleasure and  it continues as such with every consecutive viewing. Punisher War Zone  takes this principle to a delirious high and former fighter director  Lexi Alexander certainly has a flair for directing high quality dreck.   On a purely visual level this film trumps its predecessor and is  indeed quite slick and well shot. Along with such artistic clarity  however follows copious amounts of blood and brutal sadistic violence  which at times repulsed me to a certain extent. For those who found the  previous outing violent will find themselves wincing more then in any  other movie this year. It is this choice to turn The Punisher Frank  Castle into a purely animalistic killer Which truthfully is probably  what he should be that distances the audience from his blight and  makes this B movie a pure action film and features little dialogue no  character development just pure unadulterated havoc. Replacing Thomas  Jane is Ray Stevenson who I loved from HBO's shortlived series Rome  and he certainly suits the part Brooding ruthless and savage in his  ways. A reboot more then a sequel Punisher War Zone features all new  characters a fresh backstory and a pristine batch of baddies to  dispense of.   Following a crimson soaked encounter at a Cosa Nostra summit The  Punisher has found a true nemesis A disfigured Mafioso calling himself  only Jigsaw Dominic West. However during this encounter an  undercover FBI agent is killed by Frank Castle the former Special Ops  agent and wracked with guilt hovers behind the widow and daughter of  the agent. Feeling a sort of connection to the two with his own  slaughtered family he fosters a protective tendency over the pair  which ramps up when Jigsaw seeks revenge against the family of his  crony who was obviously an undercover operative. Recruiting his  imprisoned brother Looney Bin Jim Doug Hutchinson following a feisty  prison break to aid in his revenge Jigsaw wages a war against The  Punisher his friends and goodness in general.   The high point of this film is undoubtedly Dominic West as Jigsaw who  oozes malice and overthetop sadism and is certainly the best villain  sincewell Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight......never mind. His brother  is equally insane but is more laughable in his place then West's  portrayal. Wayne Knight as Castle's ally plays the role surprisingly  straight and departs nicely from Newman on Seinfeld. Really  truthfully don't believe for a second that this film is a good movie  it is corny clichd supported by minimal dialogue and by all  standards a bad bad movie. Yet damn was in fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I prayed that if there is a second movie I hope some else would cast as the punisher than Thomas Jane. Well prayers answered it was Ray Steveson. I liked his performance as the punisher. He has a much closer appearance to the comic cold powerful intiminating and shows no remorse in his eyes when killing his foes. His acting was good and his voice sounds so cold that makes Thomas Jane sound like a girl. Good on you Steveson I hope you get to stay.Second the movie storyline seems much closer to the comic though the producers and writers may have change the time setting of the movie to suit our time frame. And perhaps to my understanding from comic fans they may left some empty plots. Well its quite logical as it is a movie not a TV series so they may have to cut it short.Third the action scenes and violence was sick in a way that I enjoyed every moments of it. Watching bad guys get shoot up to bits turned my frown to a grin. Though it was exaggarated who cares its Hollywood. If you do not appreciate this element of the movie too bad its supposed to violent its the Punisher or else it could have been dull.Now I have a new prayer let there be Punisher 3 and Ray Stevenson stays as our noir crime fighter.".

	onyx:emotionText "First I prayed that if there is a second movie I hope some else would cast as the punisher than Thomas Jane. Well prayers answered it was Ray Steveson. I liked his performance as the punisher. He has a much closer appearance to the comic cold powerful intiminating and shows no remorse in his eyes when killing his foes. His acting was good and his voice sounds so cold that makes Thomas Jane sound like a girl. Good on you Steveson I hope you get to stay.Second the movie storyline seems much closer to the comic though the producers and writers may have change the time setting of the movie to suit our time frame. And perhaps to my understanding from comic fans they may left some empty plots. Well its quite logical as it is a movie not a TV series so they may have to cut it short.Third the action scenes and violence was sick in a way that I enjoyed every moments of it. Watching bad guys get shoot up to bits turned my frown to a grin. Though it was exaggarated who cares its Hollywood. If you do not appreciate this element of the movie too bad its supposed to violent its the Punisher or else it could have been dull.Now I have a new prayer let there be Punisher 3 and Ray Stevenson stays as our noir crime fighter.";

I have been a Punisher fan for years I am a rabid fan of the Punisher MAX comic I loved the 04' film and The Punisher character is for me one the best characters in a comic ever.I went into this movie with low expectations because I was such a fan of the Thomas Jane Punisher film in 04'. It also had horrible reviews but I told myself that a true fan would give this film a chance. In the opening scene of the movie Frank Castle sneaks into a mafia stronghold and does what he does best kills people. However he does two things that Frank castle would never do he snaps some mafia woman's arm and decks her true fans know the Punisher doesn't hurt woman or children it's one of his few rules. Then he grabs a chandelier hangs upside down and then starts shooting. The Punisher is not a flashy overly choreographed showboat. He's a well trained straight forward exmilitary killing machine. Knock my sheer nerdery but how do you enjoy one of your alltime favorite characters acting glaringly uncharacteristic manner. He accidentally kills an undercover FBI operative for god's sakeunless they explain he didn't do it after the 71 minute mark of the movie when I left. The Punisher I know doesn't accidentally kill people I swear i thought that I read that the director of this film did extensive research into the character and stated her love for the war journal comic. But I refuse to believe that anyone who would put this movie out is anything close to a fan let alone well versed on the characters nuances. The casting was horrible the acting was hackneyed and the excessive splatter gore and grandiose fancy deaths were total BS. Ray Stevenson was horrible as Frank Castle talk about a phonedin effort. Choosing Ray Stevenson to play this role would be the equivalent to casting Corky from life goes on to play Jason Bourne in the next Bourne Movie.I will go as far as to say that i feel like this movie is the marvel equivalent to the DC Batman and Robin debacle. You want to see horribly campy special effects and onedimensional acting se this film. The Jigsaw face special effects reminded me of Jim Carrey's the mask and his brother Looney Bin Jim wow what a horribly over the top job of psychopathic portrayal.This movie takes various elements of the Punisher story his family's murder microchipworst casting choice Frank Castle's soft spot for children and his penchant for extreme violence. And then perverts them to the exact opposite of what I've come to expect from the Punisher Mythos.The bad part of the plot for me was pretty much start to finish. It was predictable and Bmovieesquire. Punisher maims a criminal he survives and then goes on a rampage of revenge Punisher kills him in a bullet drenched showdown credits role. I'm not saying I could write it better Per Se but I would've stuck to the Punisher MAX style of writing. Had Garth Ennis written this movie and used any of the Punisher MAX story arc's this movie would've been better than most of Marvel's recent films.".

I'm not here to trash Punisher War Zone for anything other than the arias it needs trashing. I went in expecting a brainless action movie and that is the sole thing I judged it on. That was also the sole thing I gave it this score for.Honestly I don't blame the fans as much as the movie makers for the bottomless pit of dramaswithafewthingsblowingup disguised as action movies. I can understand how this got a high rating for being purely fun to some viewers. I'm not going to lie that there was some fun to be had if you were halfdrunk and with a group of buddies. If that were me I'd most likely give it a decent score myself. But I'm not being biased here. Punisher War Zone is bad. Here is why.The film starts out flat out with some of the worst acting out there. There is not a single person in the entire cast minus Julie Benz maybe that could even remotely come close to good acting. Some of the actors were so utterly ridiculesthe two bad guysthey reminded me of something right out of a firstyear film student's final project. If that. Dominic West as Jigsaw which is a name I never want to hear outside of the Saw movies is 100 obviously rippingoffwell more like retardedly imitatingJoker in The Dark Knight. If his acting wasn't enough to give away that he is a Heath Ledgerwannabe the camera angles and lighting are both also rippedoff from the scenes with Joker in The Dark Knight. Not to mention his makeup is almost a direct copy of Two Face in The Dark Knight.So the acting is bad. It's a brainless action movie who cares right? Wrong. It's not a brainless action movie as advertised. You can argue with me all day but am I really the only one who was bored out of his mind? The film opens up with action then an hour later there is another action scene then there is one last action scene and the movie ends. Three action scenes separated by over half the runtime of pointless talking scenes and pointless cheesy drama scenes. There was a lot of the movie I thought I was sitting through Twilight all over again. This has to be one of the least entertaining movies of the year by far. There is simply very little action. Why can't action movies today be like the old Indiana Jones movies or the old Predator movies where the action was almost consistent from opening to close? They never had pointless clich talking and drama sequences. They had ACTION.Despite what anyone is telling you take my word. Punisher War Zone has very little action. It's so ridiculously slow I was ready to walk out more than once. I literally counted them and there is literally only three main action scenes. Maybe a forth small one. They all last five to ten minutes each then the movie is back to drama. And cheese.The action isn't even anything you haven't seen a thousand times either. Put simply it's very typical. Generic uninspired shootouts. Also do not listen to whoever told you this movie was megaviolent. It wasn't. Yeah there was a few bloody scenes and maybe two graphic scenes and that's about it. Nothing you haven't seen before whatsoever. The violent level is average for this kind of movie. Period. It's all generic and predictable. Heads cut off throats slit heads bashed in. Typical violence in typical amounts. A lot of it isn't even shown on screen. Talk about pathetic.If you want a brainless cheesy action movie that actually has action go watch Kill Bill or The Machine Girl. If you want a serious action movie that actually has action go watch the original Predator or even the new Bond movie Quantum of Solace. I'm not sure which one Punisher War Zone was trying to be but it failed at both. It also failed at being a successful comic adaption. Instead of actually taking time to attempt to reenact comic style the director just puts random color backgrounds in certain scenes. Not to mention Punisher isn't even half this ridicules in the comics.No matter what way I look at it I can't think of a single thing this movie did right.010".

	schema:headline " The Punisher is in conflict with himself as the FBI hunt him and Jigsaw takes over the New York underworld!";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching Dolph Lundgren kill a record number of Mafia and Yakuza villains on screen in 1988 as the original Punisher I found my ideal superheroantihero. Frank Castle was a man that wanted only one thing to wipe evil off the face of the earth by any means possible.When Thomas Jane portrayed Castle in that early '00's 'origin movie' of sorts I thought the best man to play the Punisher had been found an action movie star that could outact the best of them. As Frank Castle Jane brooded like a Black Hole on the edge of space.Then Ray Stephenson rampaged his way onto the screen as Jane's sudden replacement and a new kind of superhero movie was born with War Zone. The man is basically Jason Voorhees in military gear...Ray Stephenson provides the exmilitary antihero with his best outing yet and War Zone is as dark as The Punisher could ever be. Stephenson can act Castle's rage jumps from the comic book and right onto Stephenson's own face. And he's the right age this time not late twenties or mid thirties but he actually looks like a grizzled war veteran...So it's a shame that War Zone lacked any real story and dialogue to beef him up and make a truly solid icon out of him because I doubt the next movie will star Stephenson again the way the producers are acting up. But Castle is pure attitude and action in this film and it's good to see a straightforward action film reminiscent of old John Woo films such as 'Hard Boiled.' War Zone is undoubtedly more comic and humorous than the previous films but in terms of character Castle leaves the humour to villain Jigsaw and edgy FBI agent Nick Budianskiplayed with great passion by Stevenson's fellow Brits Dominic West and Colin Salmonand simply goes from victim to victim like a serial killer.Even with all the humour Castle's black moods far outweight the lighter aspects. He is one seriously messed up man. Maybe a few 'Bad Lieutenant' scenes wouldn't have gone amiss. After all Castle did have a drink problem and a severe case of psychosis going on.Unfortunately the producers gave us a smaller budget film this time which is not the way to do business on the sequel to one of the best comic book hero movies of recent times but Director Lexi Alexander fares well with the loss.The New York underworld setting is immensely dark and grimy the atmosphere is cold and claustrophobic and somehow Castle threatens to jump off the screen and choke you even when he's not doing anything. Ray Stephenson makes this film and is so worryingly professional in his action scenes that you believe he is Frank Castle.War Zone is extremely violent but also highly theatrical and still aims at audiences too young to watch it.

	onyx:emotionText "After watching Dolph Lundgren kill a record number of Mafia and Yakuza villains on screen in 1988 as the original Punisher I found my ideal superheroantihero. Frank Castle was a man that wanted only one thing to wipe evil off the face of the earth by any means possible.When Thomas Jane portrayed Castle in that early '00's 'origin movie' of sorts I thought the best man to play the Punisher had been found an action movie star that could outact the best of them. As Frank Castle Jane brooded like a Black Hole on the edge of space.Then Ray Stephenson rampaged his way onto the screen as Jane's sudden replacement and a new kind of superhero movie was born with War Zone. The man is basically Jason Voorhees in military gear...Ray Stephenson provides the exmilitary antihero with his best outing yet and War Zone is as dark as The Punisher could ever be. Stephenson can act Castle's rage jumps from the comic book and right onto Stephenson's own face. And he's the right age this time not late twenties or mid thirties but he actually looks like a grizzled war veteran...So it's a shame that War Zone lacked any real story and dialogue to beef him up and make a truly solid icon out of him because I doubt the next movie will star Stephenson again the way the producers are acting up. But Castle is pure attitude and action in this film and it's good to see a straightforward action film reminiscent of old John Woo films such as 'Hard Boiled.' War Zone is undoubtedly more comic and humorous than the previous films but in terms of character Castle leaves the humour to villain Jigsaw and edgy FBI agent Nick Budianskiplayed with great passion by Stevenson's fellow Brits Dominic West and Colin Salmonand simply goes from victim to victim like a serial killer.Even with all the humour Castle's black moods far outweight the lighter aspects. He is one seriously messed up man. Maybe a few 'Bad Lieutenant' scenes wouldn't have gone amiss. After all Castle did have a drink problem and a severe case of psychosis going on.Unfortunately the producers gave us a smaller budget film this time which is not the way to do business on the sequel to one of the best comic book hero movies of recent times but Director Lexi Alexander fares well with the loss.The New York underworld setting is immensely dark and grimy the atmosphere is cold and claustrophobic and somehow Castle threatens to jump off the screen and choke you even when he's not doing anything. Ray Stephenson makes this film and is so worryingly professional in his action scenes that you believe he is Frank Castle.War Zone is extremely violent but also highly theatrical and still aims at audiences too young to watch it. Sporting many vicious fight scenes throughout War Zone culminates in an ultraviolent seek and destroy mission that sees Castle take on an entire hotel infested with allied streetgangs and it's a pleasure to see Ray Stephenson pull off what Thomas Jane never got to do in the last movie namely put to maximum use the military training they made the actors go through in preparation for the film.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a total disregard to Thomas Jane's Punisher. Did Hollywood fight amongst themselves on who can make a better Punisher? The story lines were different like how both Punishers families get killed and who killed them?As much as I hate to admit because I admire Thomas Jane's attempt to portray Frank Castle War Zone beats the 2004 predecessor marginally. It is really hard to compare these two titles that are similar in name yet completely different entities. Like apples and oranges.Jigsaw and his brother LoonieBin Jimmy make this movie inappropriately silly at times. But the direction doesn't want you to take it seriously. Seriousness belonged to the 2004 Punisher. Seriousness in this one? No directing didn't even try that hard. Their aim was purely to entertain and they were somewhat successful at doing that. Anyways Jigsaw and his brother were decent villains with a little depth to them even though it is inevitable that they will turn out to be more casualties in the end.War Zone mirrors the actual comic book. The comic book Frank Castle is supposed to be a taller more muscular figure with dark hair. Thomas Jane is not that tall and is naturally blond. Ray Stevenson is about 6'4 with dark hair and stockier build. Therefore he fits the role perfectly. Ray Stevenson is a good actor but was overtaken by the typical cold faced vengeance persona and that gets old a little too quickly. But then again that was how Frank Castle was portrayed in the comic book. In a way I kind of miss Thomas Jane because he almost made me believe that he was Frank Castle but he tried to make the Punisher into something that he actually wasn't meant to be which was a bit too talkative in the prequel.One more thing that is notable is this films ability to desensitize you from the bloody mass body count War Zone provides. It is the way that Punisher kills without remorse and care just like when he blew a hole in the head of that guy who was sitting down. There were also a blend of comedy in many of the killings much like Shoot Em Up.Overall a 710 because of the entertainment value. Was it flawed? Yes. But it was deliberately flawed and I am okay with watching again without any thought.".

	schema:headline " An Underappreciated Gem";
	schema:reviewBody "Tamara Drewe is a real gem by The Queen director Stephen Frears. It is an updated version of Thomas Hardy's Far from the Madding Crowd but based on a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds. A dark comedy set in the English countryside the story is centred on a writer's colony run by Tamsin Greig's character Beth and her crime writer husband Nicholas played by Roger Allam.Gemma Arteton plays the title character who lived in the same small down in Dorset known as Ewedown during her teenage years. Now grown up she returns to restore and hopefully sell the house she used to live in. With help from a surgically reconstructed nose Tamara Drewe has blossomed into a beautiful woman and her presence shakes the sleepy town as Bethsheba did in Hardy's novel.The film is true to the memory of Thomas Hardy maintaining the turmoil of sexual desire and even obsession across all age groups which so commonly adorned his novels. One of the characters the sympathetic American novelist Glen played by Bill Camp is writing a novel influenced by Hardy and references the author on many occasions.The film breaks the notion of a quiet and sleepy town like so many British films do. Underneath these seemingly close communities lies an underlining suspicion. Everyone is in everyone else's business in Ewedown and Tamara's presence only helps fuel the tension.The pivotal scene that embodies Tamara Drewe's character occurs when Glen tells her that life must be very easy for her because she is beautiful. She laughs it off citing that it has always been difficult for her to be taken seriously.Behind the character of Tamara Drewe lies something more sinister. The sudden appearance of a beautiful face in the town leads to a series of events that causes the balance of everyone's life to be upset. Men are suddenly smitten by the prospect of sex while women are often jealous or angry by the disruption they cause.The story really begins to escalate when Tamara begins to date a drummer in a rock band played by Dominic Cooper and sets up permanently in the town. Soon everyone in the town is invested in the lives of these people in some way.The voyeurism of the locals who regard Tamara Drewe as both someone to envy and detest is likened to the celebrity status of her rock star boyfriend. Tamara quickly becomes the target of two schoolgirls who are both obsessed with the drummer and jealous of Tamara for disturbing the order of things.The film eases its dark themes with its excellent use of subtle humour. The updated version of one of Hardy's most celebrated novels exposes the reality of a voyeuristic society too concerned with the lives of other people.Along with Frears excellent direction the other great strength of this film is its actors with special distinction going to Tamsin Greig. Greig is familiar to the London stage scene while others have played minor roles in big films. Gemma Arteton was one of Bond's muses in the Quantum of Solace. Roger Allam has been equally excellent in Frears academy award winning film the Queen as well as in V for Vendetta.On one final note I read one review that argued that the climax just does not amount to much which I personally felt was very misguided. The ending was true to the traditions of Hardy which is what Tamara Drewe is all about.".

Excellent dialogs sparkling soundtrack gorgeous photography rich colors fresh witty and ebullient perfectly balanced black and ... regular humor. The story is nicely knitted a lot of grey matter must have been consumed for the dialogs. Some lines have got what it takes to become a quote. I loved it! Found a few British stereotypes? So what? Troubles to follow the quick replies in the original English version? Cannot follow the subtitles while trying to translate the cream of the jokes? So what? Watch it again!! I will!";

Film makers often disappoint the Time Travellers wife is a case in point where an excellent story was ruined by someone not understanding the multiple viewpoints in the book.Not sure if this was aimed at fat middle aged blokes  but it worked for me my worries were groundless the comedy and drama survived from the story maybe Posy Simmonds should create more novels that can be filmed. The casting was excellent and Roger Allam gave a fantastic performance Tamsin Greg was brilliant as usual and Gemma Arterton was a revelation in the lead role. The Drumming sequence with 'Ben' in the cottage was particularly brilliant. It was good with its 'loser' characters and I thought maybe they should have weekends to help civil servants write inspiring briefing for uninspiring MinistersI am amazed at the negative reviews on the site I do not think that that the film tried to be more than it was and yes it was set in an idyllic English village  that was the point. Maybe these reviewers should be more careful at the multiplex and are more at home with rubbish like the Expendibles. Not clear about the link to 'Cold Confort Farm' made by another reviewer this is clearly a different style of story about modern people in the modern countryside. There was superb characterisation by a first rate cast in a subversive story that played with the stock characters that stories in English villages always have and made some real points about what is happening in these communities and about peoples lives and how selfish actions and jokey 'messing' can have big consequences in other people's lives.Go and see this movie.".

	schema:headline " Tamara shakes and shocks them far from the madding crowd";
	schema:reviewBody "Tamara Drewe is full of comic book characters  literally of course as it is based on a Posy Simmonds comic strip. So we should not complain that nearly every character is a slightly exaggerated depiction  which they are. In real life surely nobody could be such a serial philanderer as Nicholas Hardiment Roger Allam and think that he could get away with it. Or no wife could be as innocent and ignorant of her husband's infidelity as Beth Hardiment Tamsin Greig. Or no young woman could be quite as lusty and selfassured wilful and flirtatious as Tamara herself Gemma Arterton. But no matter the inyourface nature of the characters makes for a very funny and rather impious movie which just about keeps going over its nearly two hours duration.I like most townies have sometimes thought that I would enjoy life in the country. The country pub with the fine local ales and fresh food the country lanes with the birds in the hedgerows the fresh air and the simple life. What this mental idyll ignores of course is just how insular and rejecting of newcomers country communities are. The Hardiments have been in Ewedown their fictitious Dorset village for twenty years  but they are still seen as parvenu newcomers by the locals. The returning local Tamara like her Thomas Hardyesque model Bathsheba in Far from the Madding Crowd causes a sensation because of her reimaging. The ugly duckling has had a nose job and become cosmopolitan  and she even dares to wear the shortest shorts that rural Dorset has surely ever seen! Tamara like Bathsheba is torn between three men all of whom desire her. Hardiment of course Ben Sargeant a rock band drummer brilliantly played by Dominic Cooper and handsome Andy Cobb who is the archetypal local man with strong arms  the Gabriel Oak figure with a bouquet of earth dog tobacco and engine oil and who strongly resembles Alan Bates in John Schlesinger's the 1967 Madding Crowd film.The film pokes gentle fun at the literary world. The Hardiments run a writers' retreat which allows Nicholas to wallow in his fame as a successful writer and requires Beth both to look after him as well to cater for the guests with home baking and other country fare. Key to the unwinding of the plot are two feral local teenage girls Jody and Casey who make mischief in an undercover and puckish sort of way. Because of their interference all of the main characters become aware first of Ben's steamy fling with Tamara and then of Nicholas's affair with her. Tamara seems to sail through all of this without too many cares  but she leaves a couple of broken hearts along the way before predictably settling for Andy who turns out to have been her childhood love all along. The final scene is dramatic and violent and a rather rough justice is done  not all of the characters lives happily ever after. Indeed arguably none of them emerges unscathed from the story. The film is part romp part morality tale and part mild social commentary. It is entertaining well directed by Stephen Frears and is definitely a good promotion for the beauty of the Dorset countryside. The story is an amoral one  certainly by the conventional mores that wellbred country folk might like to assert they follow. But such pomposity and hypocrisy is rather nicely pricked  just like Thomas Hardy once did with his slightly shocking tale of nineteenth century double standards.".

	schema:headline " Far From the Madding Crowd... and too far away from the graphic novel alas";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge fan of Posy Simmonds and I've been following her career for over twenty years. Her graphic novels richly satirize modern British society. When she published Gemma Bovery I was astonished by the book's blend of contemporary social observation and commentary on Flaubert's novel Madame Bovary. While Gemma Bovery poked fun at artists and ex pat Brits living in northern France Tamara Drewe exposes life in the British countryside revealing the conflicts between longtime residents and newcomer second homeowners. The tangled love life of the title character exposes as well the ambitions and tensions of writers while paying tribute to the original source Thomas Hardy's study of country life Far from the Madding Crowd.When I heard that Tamara Drewe was going to be made into a film I was delighted. If I had any worries about the adaption they were dispelled by the opening sequences which show academic Glen McCreavy overhearing a fight between celebrity writer Nicholas Broadbent and his long suffering wife Beth. It was just like the installments of the graphic novel in the Guardian newspaper had been brought to life. At the start the screenplay by Moira Buffini makes a few small changes to the development of the story of the now beautiful Tamara's return to her native village but the changes make the events more cinematic and the film is paced effectively. Director Stephen Frears expertly transfers the look of the graphic novel and its humor to the screen. The performances are all outstanding especially Roger Allam as Nicholas Tamsin Greig as Beth and Bill Camp as Glen.However the ending isn't as faithful to Simmonds. The graphic novel concludes with two deaths. The first is Nicholas'. The novel shows Tamara expecting him to come to her house after he has his final row with Beth. Nicholas never appears. The visiting writers at his farm find him in the field the next morning. Only later does the novel reveal that Glen had a fight with Nicholas before the cattle stampeded. Furthermore Glen doesn't kiss Beth in the novel Nicholas and Glen fight over Glen revealing to Beth that Nicholas didn't leave his previous lover Nadia for the sake of his marriage Nadia dumped him Glen learns this when he overhears Nicholas making a begging phone call to his ex. The second death is Jody's. In the novel Jody is found on the same morning dead in her bed clutching a can of computer cleaner. The verdict of the coroner is that inhaling the cleaner stopped her heart.Replacing Jody's death with the death of Ben's dog makes the film lighter. My husband thought that the producers might have changed the ending to avoid having an 18 rating and to avoid controversy over substance abuse. But it means that the film has less edge also the book powerfully indicates how the boredom and tedium of life in the village for the local teenagers leads not just to mindless pranks and drinking but also tragedy.I wish that the screenplay hadn't ended so neatly with Beth finding solace with Glen and Ben forming a couple with with Jody as the song played over the credits suggests. I couldn't see why he would be interested in an underage stalker it looked more like pure wish fulfillment for her.Overall I would still recommend the film. However it is a shame that the movie version of the story has more of the tone of a light farce rather than indicating the sorrow of modern country and celebrity life.".

	schema:reviewBody "British comedy is a strange creature. There are films that are satirical such as In the Loop satirical like Four Lions to intelligence and dialogue driven Withnail and I and films that aim for low key charm Calendar Girls. Sometimes a film may try and made a number of these features like the work of Edgar Wright. Based on a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds Tamara Drewe hits our screens with Gemma Arterton's profile continuing to increase.The village of Ewedown has become a writers retreat a place for writers to relax work and chew the fat. Crime novelist Nicholas Hardiment Roger Allam and wife Beth Tasmin Greig run the place with an American academic Glen Bill Camp who sounds a lot like William Hurt struggling with his book on Thomas Hardy staying with them. In the village two schoolgirls Jody Jessica Barden and Casey Charlotte Christie cause havoc and mayhem simply because they are bored. But the village is turned on its head when the attractive journalist Tamara Drewe Arterton returns home to sell her out house. She turns heads including drummer Ben Sergeant Dominic Cooper her old frame Andy Luke Evans and Nicholas.Writer Moira Buffini and director Stephen Frears make a film with drama and wit and some moments of out right laughs. Frears was able to inject some style like when characters speaking when there are on the phone. The humour of the film relies on number of areas witty comments and observation physical violence and visual gags. The schoolgirls offer a lot of comedy because many people can empathies with their situation rural England is not the most exciting place to grow up as a teenager. Their mischief making and thrills about a star in their village compensates Barden lack of confidence as an actress. It is refreshing to characters that do look their age. Frears and Buffini aim to a make a charming comedy but with more swearing so trying to have their cake and eat. The two should have tried to make gone one way or the other. Strangely for a film called Tamara Drewe there are long periods where she is not on the screen or mentioned. There are plots involving Nicholas wayward eyes and the budding relationship between Glen and Beth walking the fine line of drama and comedy. Tamara Drewe goes from being pretty serious and hits you with a sudden joke and vice versa working with effect. Tamara Drewe is very British beast but Glen the American does offer an outsider view and will allow a nonBritish audience a pointofview with few British swears and slang words being used. There are some issues affecting rural England like rich city flock buying houses and making villages too expensive to live in and boredom for young people but it is hardly a political piece.Whilst some of pacing is a little slow and the film ends up sidetracking at moments there are strong performances from most of the cast. Atherton shows why she is a raising star giving Tamara a quick biting wit. Allam effectively plays a very slimy writer who takes advantage of his wife and he seems to have a nack for playing dislikeable characters his previous roles have been in V for Vendetta and Speed Racer. Cooper and Evans work well against each other as love rivals for Tamara with Cooper really understands the part of a pretentious indie musician. Greig too gives a good performance and given her background as a comic actress she her character is for the most part serious with moments of witty comments.Tamara Drewe is more a gently comedy with small jokes and drama and not a out right laugh fest as the promotion will want you to believe.".

Tamara Drewe goes from being pretty serious and hits you with a sudden joke and vice versa working with effect. Tamara Drewe is very British beast but Glen the American does offer an outsider view and will allow a nonBritish audience a pointofview with few British swears and slang words being used. There are some issues affecting rural England like rich city flock buying houses and making villages too expensive to live in and boredom for young people but it is hardly a political piece.Whilst some of pacing is a little slow and the film ends up sidetracking at moments there are strong performances from most of the cast. Atherton shows why she is a raising star giving Tamara a quick biting wit. Allam effectively plays a very slimy writer who takes advantage of his wife and he seems to have a nack for playing dislikeable characters his previous roles have been in V for Vendetta and Speed Racer. Cooper and Evans work well against each other as love rivals for Tamara with Cooper really understands the part of a pretentious indie musician. Greig too gives a good performance and given her background as a comic actress she her character is for the most part serious with moments of witty comments.Tamara Drewe is more a gently comedy with small jokes and drama and not a out right laugh fest as the promotion will want you to believe.";

	schema:reviewBody "Thomas Hardy is not perhaps a novelist whom one would normally associate with comedy fun and hilarity. He did attempt one comic novel The Hand of Ethelberta but it was a failure even in his own day and today is largely forgotten. Tamara Drewe however based on a longrunning cartoon strip in The Guardian is described as a modern comic reworking of his Far from the Madding Crowd. The action takes place in the Dorset countryside and there are a number of Hardy references. One major character has the surname Hardiment and minor ones have characteristically Hardyesque Christian names like Tess and Diggory. One character is an academic working on a critical study of Hardy and the manner in which another meets his death is reminiscent of an incident in Far from the Madding Crowd.The film is set in Ewedown a fictitious village in Hardy's home county of Dorset. Tamara Drewe a young and attractive journalist working for The Independent and a native of the village returns home in order to arrange the sale of her late mother's house. Several of Hardy's novels notably The Return of the Native turn upon a central character revisiting the scenes of their previous life. Tamara corresponds to Bathsheba Everdene in the original novel and the plot is the story of her love affairs with three men. Andy Cobb Tamara's former boyfriend from her teenage years and a saltoftheearth countryman is clearly intended as the Gabriel Oak figure and Ben Sergeant a charismatic but arrogant and selfobsessed rock star is equally clearly intended as a modern equivalent of Sergeant Troy. The Fanny Robin character is Ben's exgirlfriend Fran who has left him for a fellow bandmember although she does not come to the tragic end of her literary counterpart.This left me wondering who the Boldwood figure would turn out to be. The obvious candidate seemed to be Glen the shy bachelor American academic but this was perhaps a bit too obvious. This film was always going to be a tough sell in America given that there are no big Hollywood names in the cast that much of the dialogue is in a rustic dialect of British English and that the only American character is middleaged balding bespectacled and physically unattractive. Making the only American character a middleaged balding bespectacled physically unattractive loser in love obsessively jealous to the point of homicidal fury would have made it an absolutely impossible sell. Instead Tamara's third lover turns out to be Nicholas Hardiment the successful author of formulaic mystery novels. As Nicholas is just as successful as a womaniser as he is as a writer he does not bear much similarity in character to Hardy's Boldwood but someone obviously felt that the parallels between film and novel should not become too obvious.The script is often sharp and witty with some pertinent observations about life in the English countryside which as in Hardy's day is not always as idyllic as it looks. It touches on topical matters such as the conflicts between local people like Andy and welloff secondhome owners or the lack of opportunities for young people in rural areas. The film is at times virtually stolen by the two mischiefmaking teenage schoolgirls Jody and Casey brilliantly played by Jessica Barden and Charlotte Christie. The girls' main preoccupation in life apart from sex is their obsession with the doings of the celebrities about whom they read in glossy magazines. When they discover that Ben one of their idols is staying in their area they become obsessed with the idea of getting him into bed even marrying him. There is also a very good performance from Tamsin Greig as Beth Hardiment the longsuffering wife of the insufferable Nicholas.The reason why the film does not earn a higher mark from me is that some of the characters come across either as caricatures or unbelievable. I found it difficult to accept Roger Allam's Nicholas as a successful serial seducer as he is so obviously a sleazy selfish cad that no attractive young woman in her right mind would touch him with a bargepole. Tamara's eagerness to drop her hotpants for him seemed completely incomprehensible. Ben is just as sleazy and selfish as Nicholas but at least Dominic Cooper lends him a sort of dangerous sexual attractiveness something in which the rumpled ageing Nicholas seems completely lacking.The title character is played by the strikingly attractive Gemma Arterton something of a rising star at present as a sexy sluttish goodtime girl. The film's advertising material was dominated by a photograph of Gemma in an improbably tight pair of denim hotpants it was therefore difficult to take her seriously when she complained a few days after the film's opening that Hollywood only wanted her for her ass. I couldn't therefore really see Tamara a girl with the looks and personality of a glamour model as a journalist for the Independent a highminded leftwing broadsheet. Doubtless the Indie wanted the same sort of product placement that its rightwing rival the Daily Telegraph achieved when Kate Winslet was cast as a Torygraph journalist in The Holiday. Gemma Arterton tries so hard to make her character sexy that she forgets to make her sympathetic. If the filmmakers were going to turn Far from the Madding Crowd into a romantic comedy they should have realised that one of the rules for a successful romcom is Don't Make Your Heroine a Slut. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "The Independent journalist Tamara Drewe Gemma Arterton returns to Dorset Ewedown to sell the Winnard Farm that belonged to her deceased mother. Her neighbor Beth Hardiment Tamsin Greig runs a writers retreat with her unfaithful and womanizer husband Nicholas Hardiment Roger Allam that is a successful writer of the adventures of his alterego Inchcombe and cheats Beth every now and then with younger women. Tamara was the sweetheart of the handyman Andy Cobb Luke Evans whose family owned the Winnard Farm but lost it to Tamara's family and she sees him she rekindles her love for him.However when Tamara travels to interview the unpleasant drummer of the Swipe band Ben Sergeant Dominic Cooper he has just found that his girlfriend Fran is having an affair with the other musician Steven Culley and he breaks up with the band. Tamara and Ben have a love affair and Ben moves to Winnard. Meanwhile Ben's teenager fan Jody Long Jessica Barden and her best friend Casey Shaw Charlotte Christie that are bored in Ewedown feel happy with the presence of Ben in the village. When Ben proposes Tamara they travel to London to spend a couple of days in the big city. Meanwhile the jealous Casey breaks in Tamara's house and uses her computer to send an email pretending to be Tamara that will change the lives of the dwellers and end in a tragedy.Tamara Drewe is a disappointing heavyhanded romance and comedy by Stephen Frears. The story is too dramatic for a blackhumor comedy and too silly for a drama. Most of the characters are obnoxious specially the annoying Casey and Ben. Gemma Arterton is very beautiful and when she appears wearing small short is something very sexy. Roger Allam is absolutely out of her league and it is difficult to accept and understand her love affair with such unpleasant man. In the end I did not like this film. My vote is five.Title Brazil O Retorno de Tamara The Return of Tamara".

Her neighbor Beth Hardiment Tamsin Greig runs a writers retreat with her unfaithful and womanizer husband Nicholas Hardiment Roger Allam that is a successful writer of the adventures of his alterego Inchcombe and cheats Beth every now and then with younger women. Tamara was the sweetheart of the handyman Andy Cobb Luke Evans whose family owned the Winnard Farm but lost it to Tamara's family and she sees him she rekindles her love for him.However when Tamara travels to interview the unpleasant drummer of the Swipe band Ben Sergeant Dominic Cooper he has just found that his girlfriend Fran is having an affair with the other musician Steven Culley and he breaks up with the band. Tamara and Ben have a love affair and Ben moves to Winnard. Meanwhile Ben's teenager fan Jody Long Jessica Barden and her best friend Casey Shaw Charlotte Christie that are bored in Ewedown feel happy with the presence of Ben in the village. When Ben proposes Tamara they travel to London to spend a couple of days in the big city. Meanwhile the jealous Casey breaks in Tamara's house and uses her computer to send an email pretending to be Tamara that will change the lives of the dwellers and end in a tragedy.Tamara Drewe is a disappointing heavyhanded romance and comedy by Stephen Frears. The story is too dramatic for a blackhumor comedy and too silly for a drama. Most of the characters are obnoxious specially the annoying Casey and Ben. Gemma Arterton is very beautiful and when she appears wearing small short is something very sexy. Roger Allam is absolutely out of her league and it is difficult to accept and understand her love affair with such unpleasant man. In the end I did not like this film. My vote is five.Title Brazil O Retorno de Tamara The Return of Tamara";

Don' t get me wrong this isn't a Lawrence of Arabia of the Home Counties and would have arguably been better as a ITV1 mini series with Trevor Eve as the feckless middle aged crimewriter but it is tight funny and I hate to you use the word NICE.

	schema:reviewBody "'TAMARA DREWE' Two and a Half Stars Out of Five Stephen Frears director of such well respected films as 'THE QUEEN' 'DANGEROUS LIAISONS' 'THE GRIFTERS' and one of my all time favorite films 'HIGH FIDELITY' directs this British fluff comedy film. It's written by Moira Buffini and based on a graphic novel of the same name which was a newspaper comic strip republished as a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds. The comic strip was inspired by author Thomas Hardy's nineteenth century novel 'Far from the Madding Crowd' the film further makes this significant by having a character write a book about Hardy. The stunningly beautiful Gemma Arterton stars in the title role you may remember Arterton from such blockbuster films as 'QUANTUM OF SOLACE' 'CLASH OF THE TITANS' and 'PRINCE OF PERSIA'.The film revolves around the once 'unusual looking' Tamara who received a nose job and now returns to the village where she grew up Ewedown a fictitious place said to be located in Dorset England to sell her deceased mother's house. She's now of course the subject of every man's desire including an ex fling named Andy Luke Evans a famous writer she used to have a crush on named Nicholas Hardiment Roger Allam and a famous touring musician named Ben Sergeant Dominic Cooper. She initially is drawn to Ben but when one of Ben's young teen fans Jody Jessica Barden meddles in their affairs Nicholas sees an opportunity to sweep in and win the girl over. This is especially troublesome because Nicholas is married to a loyal and loving wife named Beth Tamsin Greig who he runs a writer's school with.The film is full of clichs and predictable slapstick mishaps but it does have a certain charm and is well crafted to a certain extent. Arterton shines in the film and of course looks beautiful but her character is a little too unlikeable to be the lead heroine in this type of film for my taste. I do like the flawed hero but the film almost seems like it overlooks her misdoings and wants us to forgive her for her selfishness without her learning from her mistakes possibly just because she was once despised because of her looks or something of that nature. Another problem I had with the film is the dominant glaring message that if you're seen as unattractive and life has got you down all's you have to do is fix your appearance to that of what people prefer and everything will work out for you. While one could argue that this is true it's not a message that should be so simplistically shoved in the viewers' faces. I also expected a lot more from Frears the film pales in comparison to the quality of his greatest works. The film is amusing but just that.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vSd0S1srQ9T8".

No matter how old I get I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching these brave men launch various objects at their genitalia and ignite a wide variety of explosives while standing far too close for comfort.I'm sure most of you have seen the trailer so I don't have to go into the stunts and pranks performed in the film but what I will talk about is how amazing the film looks. 3D has been reserved for large scale action films and animated features. Here is essentially a documentary being shot in 3D the first of its kind though Werner Herzog's upcoming documentary Caves utilizes 3D technology as well.The compositions on screen are so bizarre yet so simple. They make the most immature acts a work of art. Rather than finding out the harmful effects of being stunned by a stun gun or cattle prod they turn it into an event whereby several members of the group run through a hallways with various types of these devices hanging in the air.These daredevils or trained professionals as they disclaim in opening credits have gone from punk rebels to cultural icons. Their outlandish pranks and inconceivable stunts are a testament to our society's consumption of the obscene and the absurd. We watch these hooligans abuse themselves for our enjoyment. We laugh at their pain. The only reason we laugh is because we aren't the ones feeling their pain.What really makes this film funny is the groups approach to their work. I can imagine how many takes of each segment introduction their must be. The men are either dying from laughter at what is about to unfold or they can hardly keep their composure for fear that this next stunt will be their last. Regardless we get a sense that what we are seeing on camera is what these people are really like. They laugh scream and gasp for air like we would though perhaps with a little more courage.This carefree approach comes through in the production as well. The melding of the crew with the cast is like watching a dysfunctional family's home videos. The cameras capture the action both with the cast and behind the scenes with the crew. It's a fun slightly off atmosphere. To help create this atmosphere we are fortunate enough to listen to a great selection of songs my favorite being Roger Miller's You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd played over Johnny Knoxville being chased after by a herd of buffalo. Oh yeah he's also wearing roller skates. How fitting.I don't think I need to tell you all this but this film isn't for everyone. I can think of several scenes which some will find offensive others will find revolting and maybe a few of you will deem as unfit for human eyes. Still those who are fans of the show or if you're looking for something new look no further. This film is a raunchy laugh riot.".

Audiences were mesmerized by this fascinating new art of cinema an art made all the more engaging for the fact that the plastics of its image had roots in reality that somewhere else in space and time Chaplin had actually stood next to this lion and the reality of this image was now available to them for their own viewing pleasure.For a contemporary equivalent I give you SteveO launched through the stratosphere in a PortaPotty full of dog poop. In 3D.Jackass 3D appeals to cinema's timehonored capacity for ontological testament and makes an equally compelling case for the camera's potency as an empathy machine We see the setup of a stunt we endure its execution and we then either clutch our balls or puke in our mouths depending on what the stunt entails. Cinema is reality and their pain is ours.Jackass isn't simply effective in the art of its performers however as there is a genius to the framing and editing of each segment as well. Many of the film's laughs are built in to its premises and the crew smartly eschews overexplanation. We see a tee ball we see the path this ball is on track to take and we see SteveO's nutsas an intelligent and discerning audience it is left to us to piece together the narrative before it unfolds resulting in our increased engagement and a far greater potential for humor upon realization. And we then hang in that moment of anticipation until the situation's potential energy is quickly and cathartically rendered kinetic.Jackass 3D is notable as well for its use of stereoscopic 3D cinematography. In one scene Johnny Knoxville fires a projectile toward the screen in slow motion to great effect shallow depth of field slowly reveals this item to be a dildo and 3D reveals the dildo to be humorously close to your face. Elsewhere stereoscopy is employed in the service of some truly excellent model work the scene's genuine beauty makes its ultimate subversion all the more effective.Needless to say Jackass 3D will not appeal to everyone. But as the film so effectively marries the ontology of outrageous stupidity to so many facets of cinematic expression it's definitely worth seeing if you think you can stomach it. TK 101710".

My friends and I debated whether or not the guys were too old but apparently they were offered enough money to not care much. This is just like Jackass Number 2 in that they got a big budget to do the set piece stunts. There is still the low key sneak up on people pranks but now in glorious slow motion.The set piece stunts are in bright and crisp 3D that really adds to the effect of whatever they are trying to do. As others have stated the intro is pretty cool but I was actually left wanting just a bit more. Note the paintballs though in amazing 3D. This is Johnny Ryan Dunn Steveo Pontius and Weeman's show. Dave and Aaron end up getting hurt as usual but are awesome sports.There are more gross out and insane painful stunts than pranks on unwitting public people but a few of the funniest skits fall into the latter category. The midget couple at the bar is the funniest in the movie by far. These guys are as funny as always and their genuine friendship is really quite nostalgic at the end. Its been nearly 10 years since Jackass went off the air and these guys are really still at the top of their game. The entire theater was crying with laughter the entire film. I was invited to stay after for a post film discussion and one of the other people summed it up nicely by saying he felt that not a single skit was a misfire. Matt Hoffman Jeff Tremaine and Spike Jonze were in the crowd.Of the 25 or so people that stayed after the film 22 thought it was the best of the trilogy.".

	schema:reviewBody "How does one review Jackass 3D? The tertiary installment in MTV's prank and stunt franchise is basically immune to criticism because you get exactly what you pay for. Love it or hate it Jackass 3D accomplishes just about everything it sets out to in effect Johnny Knoxville scores a goal on an empty net.I am the anomaly but I'd wager next to no one is 'on the fence' about whether or not they should see this film. They either contributed to the massive 50 million opening weekend box office cume or they immediately dismissed it. In my case however having never seen the Jackass films wasn't a conscious snub. Believe it or not there just always seemed to be something better to watch.But mine's not a high horse. I sought out and watched Jackass and Jackass Number Two the week prior to my first theater experience with the series and I'm glad I did. After all I grew up on America's Funniest Home Videos and throughout high school religiously followed the English hidden camera show Trigger Happy TV. Jackass is not as clever as the latter but by measure of unbridled chutzpah Knoxville and Co. are the reigning kings.Like a Victorian freak show or museum of oddities the often selfdestructive experiments of the Jackass crew are the guilty pleasures of our generation. There's something almost gladiatorial about watching the elaborate dangers these brave idiots subject themselves to. Man vs. bull man vs. mule man vs. manour fascination with competition spectacle and injury is nothing new.Jackass 3D being my first chance to observe others' response to these shenanigans I was most amazed by the twopronged reaction the audience had to the physical trauma the performers sustained. A given stunt would be executed typically resulting in its participant doubling over in pain. The crowd laughed as they'd been cued to. The film would then play back the moment in slow motion and suddenly everyone would groan or sharply inhale. Though we paid to laugh at people injuring themselves what's more interesting is our ability to empathize with the depiction of human pain. That the Jackass films achieve both is not an insignificant feat.This isn't the definitive Jackass experience however. Having watched all three films in the span of a single week I did discern a distinct arc that left me somewhat letdown with Knoxville's most recent effort. Jackass Number Two improved upon the original with a more polished professional look and more elaborate and inventive stunts. It gave the genuine impression that the crew was pushing its boundaries and trumping itself wherever possible. That same sense of pioneering is largely missing from Jackass 3D. The glasses gimmick seems to supplant genuine innovation in their routine and on the whole it feels slapdash in comparison to the conceptual genius of its prequel.But what survives in Jackass 3D and what ultimately endeared me to the franchise is its creativity. Where it won me over was not in the painful payoff of each trick but rather in the setup. The use of the camera to disorient spotlight and surprise is what really makes the series sing and the trilogy is full of epiphanic moments of hilarity. Jackass has and always will be a potpourri of comedic elements not all of which directly appeal to my specific sensibilities but the variety is essential and the whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts.I only wish Jackass 3D had more of the entrepreneurial spirit that so distinguished the second film. It may not be ambitious but hey a goal made on an empty net still counts.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all if you don't know about Jackass you need to be prepared for a movie with no point at all. Jackass is the third movie installment based on the popular MTV series with the same name that ran from 2000 to 2002. The cast includes Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Chris Pontius SteveO Ryan Dunn Jason WeeMan Acua Preston Lacy Dave England and Ehren McGhehey. Therefore even though the show was only on TV for three seasons summing to 25 episodes the antics did not end there. In 2002 Jackass The Movie was released followed by Jackass Number Two in 2006 along with numerous TV shows created by different cast members including Viva La Bam Dr. SteveO Wildboyz and Homewrecker. Four years after their last meeting in their second film these crazy men are back together in the latest Jackass movie in 3D! The film follows these characters as they beat the living hell out of each other while performing a series of hilarious disgusting disturbing and dangerous pranks. This is the first film that has used 3D in a way that makes the film worth seeing in 3D. The implementation of 3D adds to the party and along with another dimension to the film. It allows all of the pranks to be bigger better funnier and more entertaining by immersing the audience into the world of Jackass. The opening and closing scenes of the film abuse the use of 3D especially well through slow motion effects and exceptional cinematography yes I did just say that. The stunts in the film are at a whole new level that the TV series or the previous films have not been able to capture. The stunts are so crazy and ridiculous in the film that they will leave the entire audience wondering How are they all still alive? While no sane human being would be attempting these stunts in the first place leading to the fact that all of the actors mentioned earlier and especially Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Weeman and SteveO are all one of a kind maniacs that prove that they are four of the craziest and most entertaining men in the world or are they just stupid?.There is no plot at all to this film and contains a specific type of humor that isn't for everyone. There are a lot of sexually oriented pranks in some shape or form. The film targets a very small audience that includes males ages 18 to 35 and even in this demographic the movie isn't for everyone. The film is extremely disgusting to the point where multiple scenes are unwatchable to the extent of gagging. Nothing is off limits in the film and therefore there is no limit to how gross the film gets and no limit on how long the scenes last. The disgusting aspect of the film ranges from scenes with male nudity to other scenes with different forms of bodily waste. Jackass has always been this way and when it comes to male nudity there is significantly less nudity in this film than in Jackass Number Two which was more of a male nudity fest. Just be prepared for what you are getting yourself into before seeing this film.The Jackass TV series and Jackass 3D in general takes an acquired taste and the right mood to enjoy. I cannot recommend this film because you already know if you want to see it or not. Therefore I recommend that if you want to see it on the big screen in 3D see it now otherwise don't see it if you think its going".

And this was just a lot more of the same.The film is not for the squeamish especially due to the delight taken in excrement. Excrement here is treated like confetti on New Years Eve. I don't want to get into details because much of my enjoyment of this film is due to the shock factor. There were a few scenes that I was just too scared to watch.I won't get into trying to describe or give a list of what's shown here. Let me just say that if Thomas Edison had ever thought his invention would show something like THIS he'd have destroyed his camera and killed himself. But for about 80 of this film I was howling with laughter though terribly embarrassed I was carrying on like that.The only thing I can say specific to a scene in this movie is that the Midget Bar Fight has got to be no doubt about it the most hilarious Candid scene I've ever watched.I had major qualms about going to see a film so crude gross violent and obviously marketed to an audience about 40 years younger. I saw it. I loved it. I'm so embarrassed. And I saw it in 2D. Which was at least one D more than I needed. The idea of watching some of these scenes in 3D . . .".

There is plenty of this in Jackass 3D. What you don't expect to get is forced laughter fake setups and really really BAD acting. I get why they laugh at the stunts. It's marketing. The harder they laugh the harder you laugh. It's easier to laugh at something that someone is already laughing at. But the laughter is just too loud too forced and goes on WAY too long for the severity of some of the stunts. The vignette with the fake  and I MEAN FAKE  gorilla in the idiot parents' hotel room was just beyond the pale. The mom has the worst fake reaction of anybody I've ever seen in Jackass. She is so unbelievable that she ruins the whole gag. And then supposedly the father had the sh!t scared out of him  literally. Give me a break. You will find yourself laughing at the stupidity of their reactions. You might also feel a little insulted that they think you're so stupid. It's also obvious that some of the people in the street gags are acting. They're just not good enough to pull it off. People know what natural reactions look like and this just ain't it people. There's also a scene where Johnny Knoxville or SteveO I can't tell which drives a scooter through a plate glass window. Just coincidentally there is gas in the scooter INSIDE the dealership never happens big nono the path to the window was completely clear even though every single inch of the other windows in the dealership were cluttered with product AND he goes through the 10foot plateglass window without being cut to shreds. Not even a scratch. C'mon people.Don't get me wrong there are some big laughs in this movie. Big hits big injuries and BIG falls. But I left the movie with a bad taste in my mouth. Thank GOD my movie wasn't in 3D or that taste could have been something else.".

If that's not for you then you won't like it. I for one happen to be a Jackass fan. Over the years of watching these guys beat themselves up for money it almost feels like they became my friends. So Jackass 3D was like a reunion. Hanging out with old friends in 3D. The 3D definitely sold the film. It starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time and I didn't want it to end. A worthy installment in the Jackass series and the most fun at a film this year. Sheer stupid fun. So if you like watching nutshots and poo cocktail supreme's then definitely check out Jackass 3D in theaters. See it with friends. And see it in 3D.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jackass isn't a movie that you can review by conventional standards.  Heck it even isn't a movie in the strictest sense of the word rather  it's a featurelength version of the stunt and prank show that debuted  originally on MTV and has since found its way onto the big screen.  Three times I might add with director Jeff Tremaine and the rest of  the Jackass cast proclaiming with each movie that it would be their  last. Tough luck they will have retiring if you haven't already heard  the movie smashed the fall opening weekend record when it debuted in  the United States. Clearly their steadily growing fanbase keeps  clamouring for more.  If you like this reviewer haven't actually watched any of the  Jackasses at work or play really before this movie then it's  better you take this example as a litmus test of just how much you'd  enjoy Jackass 3D. In one of the stunts proudly named the Poo  Cocktail Supreme Jackass regular SteveO is strapped in a sitting  position inside one of those mobile toilets filled with excrement. The  PortaPotty is in fact bungeecorded between two cranes and on the  mark is set flying upwards where it subsequently bounces up and down.  I'd rather not describe what happens inside the cubicle suffice to say  that it is as hideous as you would imagine perhaps even much more so.  How much you are willing to stomach such scatological humour and  revolting gags really determines how much you are going to enjoy this.  There isn't a plot there isn't a purpose there isn't any continuity.  Basically this is no more and no less than a countless string of  stunts pranks and skits featuring leader Johnny Knoxville who  introduces himself at the beginning of each segment and his band of  merry idiots. You're better off looking for some maturity amongst a  herd of cows than amongst this group of overgrown mischievous buffoons.  Not to say that there's nothing to admire about their buffoonery. One  can't help but be impressed by their willingness to sacrifice for their  art even if the art is clearly made for the lowest denominator. Who  would readily put themselves in front of an oncoming ram or a few  buffalo? Who would readily place his genitalia in harm's way by tying  it to a flying toy helicopter the stunt is called Helicockter I kid  you not? And who would dare drink another's sweat collected in a cup  while exercising on the treadmill wearing plastic wrap? You're not  likely to find people as ready or game as Knoxville Margera Ryan  Dunn SteveO Wee Man Preston Lacy Chris Pontius Danger Ehren and  Dave England.  You're also not likely to find the same kind of camaraderie elsewhere.  Whenever one of their stunts goes awry or one of them bends over in  agony the rest standing around will almost immediately huddle around  him offering words of encouragement the way fratboys would. None of  them would be here without the other indeed there wouldn't be a  Jackass without the fun and derringdo of each one of them and it's  heartening to see the Jackass team displaying a keen sense of  friendship and solidarity.  As with any circus act not all the parts are equally interesting e.g.  the one where Margera's parents get ambushed by a guy dressed up in a  gorilla suit when they check into a hotel room or the rather  repetitive Evil Knieveltype stunts on jet skis and mini bikes. But  there is really more than enough to keep appreciative audiences  thoroughly entertained e.g. the Lamborghini Tooth Pull the Beehive  Tetherball and the Tee Ball each one of which are selfexplanatory by  their titles.  And what of the extra dimension? Well let's just say that in the same  way that Avatar was made for 3D the same way that dance movies were  made for 3D and the same way that horror movies were made for 3D  Jackass is one type of entertainment that was made for 3D. Indeed  when a prosthetic sex toy flies in slomo through several different  iconic landmarks and finally shatters a glass of milk the joy of  seeing it in the additional dimension is enough to convince you that  Jackass was meant for 3D.".

If someone were to tell you that Jackass' methods of merrymaking were crude and unorthodox they would be 100 percent rightHowever as the film industry has changed over the years it seems as if vulgar behavior is what most people desire for good amusement. So if dropping a duce or getting hit in the groin is what the people want then let there be Jackass.This film personifies humor and will leave you in stitches on the way home I give Jackass 3D the best possible score it could receive an 8 out of 10.".

The scene where the guy poops in a toilet store remains one of the funniest bits I've seen in this genre.Now however both me and the Jackasses are older. These dudes are pushing 40 some probably over 40. Nothing wrong with that but what we see here is the opposite of what made the original Jackass irresistible The guys are old the stunts have been seen before some of them have drugdrinking problems etc. There is a sadness to it all. Its mildly entertaining but also somewhat embarrassing. I understand the dudes need cash but i would really want to see them come up with something different that just wearing a ballerina skirt and punching eachother in the face. That was fun 10 years ago not so much now.The midgets in the bar was indeed a nicely made candid camera scene. So was the simplicity of the fat man leaving his dog with a guy on the street. None are movieworthy though there are funnier TVshows that do the same.Nah guys don't ever grow up but please..reinvent yourself for the next one.".

Could they have really imagined that after all this time they'd still be attempting to find cruel and unusual ways to tease torment and torture each other? There has of course been a long break since the last installment even if you include the deleted scenes which escaped onto DVD under the pretence of being a separate movie so it is it really worth the wait? For that matter is it really worth the trouble? The excuse for this dip into the well of human depravity of course is the opportunity to affix a D to the 3 of the title. Always looking to do things properly where it counts they've got some proper 3D kit then set about finding ways to use it. This isn't to say that every stunt requires the use of 3D indeed more of them than not would be absolutely fine in 2D but there are undoubtedly some memorable moments. What actually works better here is the other new innovation the high speed camera used to capture the moments of heavily inflicted pain watching the moment of impact in crystal clear slow motion adds to the feeling of awe and sense of fascination as you watch the slowmotion convulsions and also to the empathy you'll feel for each one on the receiving end.Of course Jackass has never been about purely sadistic pleasures the intent is to make us laugh and a lot of that is dependent on the camaraderie and interplay between the various Jackasses. Most make a return only Raab Himself and Brandon DiCamillo not present from the core cast and the rest might look a little more creased but are still willing to give their all in both the physical and the just plain daft. Knoxville might be the figurehead but the most telling contribution is that of SteveO who has discovered sobriety since the last movie and enters into most of the stunts with a new found sense of selfawareness giving him much more of the expression of a rabbit in the headlights about two seconds before it's about to connect with bumper.It's not all about the physical of course and Jackass is as smart as ever in the execution of some of its high concepts such as a bar fight played out by WeeMan and a few of his friends. April and Phil Bam's put upon parents get put upon again although it's sometimes more of their own choosing now and stalwarts of the series from Spike Jonze to Rip Taylor all pop up in their wellworn roles. So to answer those earlier questions it was worth the wait absence has made the heart grow fonder and the technical innovations add an element of freshness to the familiar. As to whether it's worth the trouble that's one you can only answer if you've seen and enjoyed Jackass before it's always gelled in a way that its contemporaries have struggled to do and it remains consistently funny throughout. If Jackass is your sick bag then there's little this year that will make you laugh as hard or as long.Why see it at the cinema For anyone even slightly inhibited the company of others should allow you to truly enter into the spirit. And by that I don't mean you should urinate on the row in front. Just to be clear. Why see it in 3D? Where else can you expect to see a giant pink dildo being fired out of a cannon straight at your face? IN 3D?The Score 910".

The chances are that by the end of the decade 3D will be dead and buried until the next time the fad comes around. For me it's little more than a gimmick that they charge you more for and honestly I can't imagine it improving the majority of movies anyway. Take this film  how much gnarlier would it really feel if you felt like you were being covering in various disgusting liquids in the same way these guys are? In case you're wondering what the hell all this is about allow me to introduce you to the Jackass crew Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Wee Man a newly sober Steve O Ehren McGhehey Dave England Chris Pontius Preston Lacy and the late Ryan Dunn who like nothing more than indulging in a wide variety of crude sick and disgusting stunts. But this time they are letting 3D cameras record the results which usually involve someone puking getting covered in faeces or urinated on. If you're a fan then this will be right up your street but if not this won't do anything to convert you.The trouble with Jackass 3D is that it doesn't really offer anything different to the others besides the 3D effects. The other issue is that it's extremely inconsistent  sometimes it's frankly hilarious such as Ehren trying to pin a tail on a real donkey blindfolded but others such as the Pee Cam sequences don't really work. And this issue seems to plague this entry in the series more than others because some of the skits feel very familiar. The Old Man makeup gets yet another outing and pranking Bam's parents also makes another appearance. It gives the film a sense that they were running out of ideas and just decided to revisit old material but in 3D. It feels lazy and halfhearted as most jokes do the more you hear them.I was actually looking forward to this even though I wasn't going to bother with the 3D side of things as I never do. While it wasn't a disappointment it did exactly what I thought it would do  churn my stomach occasionally make me laugh occasionally and make me a little grossed out occasionally. It's childish stupid and everything a fan of Jackass could ask for  assuming you still have the appetite for this sort of nonsense. Personally I'd have liked a few new ideas from the boys and less reliance on old gimmicks such as Pontius's penis and Preston's wobbly bits. It feels time to close this particular chapter of light entertainment especially after Dunn's tragic demise but part of me wished it would have been far funnier which would have been a more fitting epitaph.".

But this time they are letting 3D cameras record the results which usually involve someone puking getting covered in faeces or urinated on. If you're a fan then this will be right up your street but if not this won't do anything to convert you.The trouble with Jackass 3D is that it doesn't really offer anything different to the others besides the 3D effects. The other issue is that it's extremely inconsistent  sometimes it's frankly hilarious such as Ehren trying to pin a tail on a real donkey blindfolded but others such as the Pee Cam sequences don't really work. And this issue seems to plague this entry in the series more than others because some of the skits feel very familiar. The Old Man makeup gets yet another outing and pranking Bam's parents also makes another appearance. It gives the film a sense that they were running out of ideas and just decided to revisit old material but in 3D. It feels lazy and halfhearted as most jokes do the more you hear them.I was actually looking forward to this even though I wasn't going to bother with the 3D side of things as I never do. While it wasn't a disappointment it did exactly what I thought it would do  churn my stomach occasionally make me laugh occasionally and make me a little grossed out occasionally. It's childish stupid and everything a fan of Jackass could ask for  assuming you still have the appetite for this sort of nonsense. Personally I'd have liked a few new ideas from the boys and less reliance on old gimmicks such as Pontius's penis and Preston's wobbly bits. It feels time to close this particular chapter of light entertainment especially after Dunn's tragic demise but part of me wished it would have been far funnier which would have been a more fitting epitaph.";

My only disappointment is that i didn't get to see this in 3D as i think it might have looked great.I'm not sure how much longer these guys can keep doing these stunts because sooner rather than later someone is going to get seriously hurt or failing that they will get too old but while they can i will still enjoy watching them.".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe I enjoyed the classic MTV series' made movie Jackass 3D a bit too much if that's possible. This is the third installment in the Jackass franchise and while not the best it has certain stunts that really put a smile on your face and ones that make the film itself memorable in it's own special way. It's been eight years since the first film went to theaters and ten since the series got it's start on MTV. Jackass 3D celebrates the occasion by having all the same characters back and doing the crazy no limit stunts they're famous for.Who needs plot? Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Ryan Dunn SteveO Chris Pontius Jason WeeMan Acua Preston Lacy Dave England and Eheren McGhehey perform hurtful injury filled and pointless stunts for our enjoyment. I know how much people have looked forward to this film and I won't ruin any stunts or so which ones I favor. But I will say this one is male nudity filled and laugh infested.I will say the opening sequence to this film was probably the weakest yet in Jackass films. The first movie they ride down a bridge in a giant shopping cart I call that my favorite opening. In Number Two they are being chased by bulls on a suburban street pretty funny and amusing. A worthy opening. This one I won't spoil but nothing special happens. Some of the people I've talked to enjoyed it but I didn't really. It had it's perks and different levels of amusement but overall it's just average. Though the fun filled ending scene makes up for the bland intro.It seems too they gave characters who didn't have a name more stunts to perform. I swear I've seen Preston Dave and Eheren more than I have ever seen in a Jackass film or TV show. They were there once in a while but they do various stunts in the film most notably Eheren who's name is now Danger Eheren. We also see Dreamseller author Brandon Novak get hit a few times which I enjoyed. Him and Joe Frantz are both underrated and I think seeing Novak in the film will get him some support.I will say that the gang may be forty but they perform stunts like they're in High School. No matter which way you look at it when Jackass came on it was an iconic series nothing like that had really been done before. Guys doing stunts and getting injured for audience amusement? Gnarley dude! Johnny Knoxville and SteveO have stood out to me has Jackass' best. Though the whole cast never ceases to impress they've stood out has the true jackasses. Once I head Johnny Knoxville say Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville an' welcome to Jackass! I knew oh yeah I was back.The last thing I want to touch on is the 3D and keep in mind the star rating isn't effected by the 3D's performance. The 3D is nice for a few scenes but overall if rated it would get a two and a half. It's nice in some scenes but it's not as in depth as it should be. I know it's live action so it's without a doubt harder to do than most animation but Avatar's three dimensional performance was great even in live action while not being a mind blowing film. The most awkward thing about 3D is when it comes to DVD or TV in 2D it'll look odd having many things bouncing out at the screen since it was clearly shot for 3D purposes. All movies have an odd 2D transfer if shrunk down to 3D.Jackass 3D may not have surpassed the classic series but it did impress a bit more than the second film did in that matter. The film has memorable stunts and little quirky things that make the film special in it's own way. To reflect on Roger Ebert's Jackass The Movie review it's like we are watching a series of outtakes not a real movie. Jackass 3D is 94 minutes but it goes by ridiculously fast even in RealD 3D. Nothing left to say but stupid is as stupid does.Starring Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Ryan Dunn SteveO Chris Pontius Jason WeeMan Acua Preston Lacy Dave England Eheren McGhehey Spike Jonze Jeff Tremaine and Brandon Novak.

Once again this third film is directed by Jeff Tremaine and this time written by Preston Lacy whom my friend Erika says she knew back in her home town. The 3D is pretty effective at times with certain things flying right into your face although maybe a little underused. The movie itself is more of the same if you've seen one 'JACKASS' movie you've seen them all but it's still extremely funny and amusing as well as of course disgusting.For those of you that don't know the MTV TV series 'JACKASS' was created in 2000 by Knoxville Tremaine and Spike Jonze. It ran for three seasons and featured Knoxville and fellow 'Big Brother Magazine' a comedic skateboarding magazine collaborators Pontius Dave England WeeMan SteveO and Tremaine as well as skateboarder Bam Margera and the crew from his popular stunt  prank 'CKY' movies including Dunn. After the show's demise it was quickly followed by the first theatrical film featuring most of the TV cast and crew in 2002 and then a sequel in 2006. Despite the dangerous nature and severe self inflicted bodily harm of the stunts the crew continues to make films due to their immense popularity.Fans of the TV series and previous films should get exactly what they expect from this third film and be mostly satisfied I was. The movie is once again hilarious and you can't help but feel a part of the enormous fun that you can tell the crew is having. I could have done with out all the male nudity flying feces and other crude spectacles in the film but my stomach has gotten a little more used to it over the years. I enjoy the pranks a lot more and of course the crazy stunts. I'd say this installment isn't really inferior to the others in any way and it does have that added 3D visual effect but it is getting a little old and a little less original and less inspired in some ways. Due to the fact that it's made up of a bunch of short gags stunts and pranks it does drag a little as with all of the films and seem much longer than it's 94 minute running time. Even so I have to admit I still had a lot of fun and I pretty much got exactly what I expected. If you're a fan of the series this film should definitely not disappoint.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vMgpux8tZ4".

Every character is believable and comes with a story making her or him alive.There're laughs aplenty and at other times I found myself sitting there with a big smile on my face from pure joy. And yet I wouldn't call it a comedy as the laughs are not really central to the movie.And then there's music full of raw energy and quite memorable  many in the audience left the theater humming and whistling the title song.I guess the best thing about this film is that it is real there's nothing contrived or false in it that I could see. Generally I have no problem suspending disbelief and accepting the lack of internal logic of the world created in a movie. With Linda Linda Linda there was no need for that. It was easy to embrace the world of a high school festival and enjoy every minute of the screen time.Hmmm... I think director Nobuhiro Yamashita's other films could well be worth watching.".

Every character is believable and comes with a story making her or him alive.There're laughs aplenty and at other times I found myself sitting there with a big smile on my face from pure joy. And yet I wouldn't call it a comedy as the laughs are not really central to the movie.And then there's music full of raw energy and quite memorable  many in the audience left the theater humming and whistling the title song.I guess the best thing about this film is that it is real there's nothing contrived or false in it that I could see. Generally I have no problem suspending disbelief and accepting the lack of internal logic of the world created in a movie. With Linda Linda Linda there was no need for that. It was easy to embrace the world of a high school festival and enjoy every minute of the screen time.Hmmm... I think director Nobuhiro Yamashita's other films could well be worth watching.";

At two hours it's a tad overlong but some mesmeric camerawork and subtle humour helps it along nicely. The casting is superb with every character believable and captivating. And of course the music's fantastic  the title song gets played to death but it's still a cool cover of a great Japanese punk song and James Iha of Smashing Pumpkins does a brilliant job with the incidental music.I'm so glad this film got an English sub and considering how quickly the tickets sold out for these two London screenings a full release would be warmly welcomed. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm happy to report that the Japanese film Linda Linda Linda which screened tonight at NYAFF and was the first film of the festival that I was able to go see at the ImaginAsian theater is handsdown the best movie I've seen at the festival so far. An upbeat and joyous film about a high school girls' rock and roll band it's practically guaranteed to go straight to the heart of anyone who believes in music and its power to save one's soul.The plot is as straightforward as they come. Shiba High School is holding their annual Holly Festival complete with a musical talent show and three friends  drummer Kyoko Aki Madea Battle Royale keyboardistturnedguitarist Kei Yu Kasii Lorelei and bassist Nozomi Shiori Sekine of the real band Base Ball Bear are struggling to get a band together. After their previous guitarist injures her finger and has to bow out they recruit shy Korean exchange student Song Bae DooNa Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance as their vocalist and decide to cover three songs by the Clashesquire 80's Jpunk group The Blue Hearts. After weeks of staying up all night practicing jamming until the wee hours not to mention the fact that Song has to learn her lyrics phonetically they are finally ready to play their music before their teachers and friends.Admittedly the description above probably makes this movie sound like every other movie about a band or a sports team or some kind of sentimental rahrah Eye of the Tiger pap. Trust me  nothing could be farther from the truth. What this movie is about is the people  the four schoolgirls that are its main characters are as quirky and as buttoncute but also as three dimensional as anyone you'd meet in life and the movie's long uninterrupted takes and improvstyle acting give us a flyonthewall feeling of being there. Opening with a MiniDV shot of one girl giving an oncamera interview about the Holly Festival the movie starts out depicting its characters with shy restraint gradually revealing more and more about their personalities foibles their joys and sorrows until eventually they literally start to feel like our friends. By the end when the group performs their songs we've honestly forgotten that they are characters in a film. We want to stand up and applaud.I would honestly say that Linda Linda Linda is one of the greatest rock and roll films I've ever seen. Being a recent film it doesn't have the legendary status of This Is Spinal Tap or A Hard Day's Night but honestly it's up there. This is rock and roll stripped down to its very core. No pretension no decadence no sex drugs limos and all of that bullshit  just the threechord structure of a song and its power to save lives. It's a truly beautiful thing to see and hear.".

If you are looking for those quick pickmeup rock'n roll flicks with heroesheroines get the girlboy and fat recording contracts after performing jawdropping numbers overcoming incredible odds then perhaps this movie is not for you. But pick you up in a bigger and more satisfying way this movie does. This movie is realistic in that it does not need artificial plot devices and major suspension of belief on the part of the audience. It just shows what ordinary teenage high school girls trying to put together a rock band in a few days for a festival would do in those precious few days of their lives. This is perhaps the last significant thing they will do before they head out to the real world and maybe college.Kudos to the director who sets the right pace for the scenes. In my opinion Japanese movies in general have slower pace than necessary but for this movie it was the right one and gives the audience the feeling that they really spent those few days with them. It is time well invested and gives the viewer a big payoff. Of course Bae Doona absolutely steals all the scenes she is in. Not only she is an amazing talent but these roles come naturally to her since she cut her tooth in a highlyacclaimed high school TV drama before taking on motion pictures. Look for her in the forthcoming 'The Host 2006'Korean title 'Gwoemul'. All in all a very satisfying movie. And I just had to buy the Blue Hearts CDs. The songs just would not leave my head!".

	schema:reviewBody "In most films directors try with varying degrees of success and failure to capture various feelings and emotions set in times and places that will connect with the viewer. When the director fails to catch the vibe emanating from the source material the film falls apart. But every once in awhile a director gets the material and turns out a product that seamlessly captures a slice of life. The latter better describes Nobuhiro Yamashita's Linda Linda Linda a beautifully constructed study of young love high school politics and of course rock and roll.In preparation of a High School Festival due in three days band leader Kei Yu Kashii forms a group to cover the works of a JPunk band named The Blue Hearts for the festival. She quickly finds a drummer Kyoko Aki Maede and a bassist Nozomi Shiori Sekine. After some difficulty the group finds itself their singer a Korean exchange student named Son Donna Bae who only has a basic knowledge of Japanese. The group prepares tirelessly for the coming event... but will they be ready in time?OK I want to get this out of the way I have one major gripe about Linda... To be honest the first thirty minutes are paced so slow that it borders on tedium. Some scenes in the beginning are totally unnecessary to the plot and could have been edited better to provide the film with a better flow. Though after that the film magically changes itself into a beautifully endearing coming of age drama complete with cute Japanese schoolgirls and blazing punk rock.After the clumsy beginning Linda Linda Linda does one thing that few films can boast. It does an exquisite job of capturing the awkwardness of youth the purity of blossoming friendships and the universal love of music. As the film progressed I was constantly reminded of simpler times in my life. A time when friends were closer than they ever were after which life puts you through the ringer. A time when every experience was fresh and new and exciting... basically it reminded me of how it was to be young. This is no small accomplishment and is the film's strongest point as well I believe as Nobuhiro Yamashita's primary goal in making Lind Linda Linda.Other than the emotional aspect of the film Linda also features brilliant cinematography and a great score. Much of the camerawork seemed to be aimed at casting a Abbey Road effect as many of the film's shots could be easily mistaken for album cover artwork. Add James Iha's Smashing Pumpkins melodic rock soundtrack and covers of the JPunk band The Blue Hearts and you get some moments of intense allure i.e. what I like to call mind candy. And we can't forget the actresses. Everyone holds their own here playing their roles expertly and acting how you'd expect teenage girls to act the standout being Donna Bae as Son. Her wide eyed naive Son clinches the film and puts it into the level of greatness. She plays the kind of girl that you'd want to befriend both subdued and full of life at the same time.Bottom LineThis is a beautiful film that encapsulates all the emotions of youth. A bit boring and unfocused at the start but the rest of the film more than makes up for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having just had a week filled with watching two Shakespearean tragedies I was ready to be uplifted and found the perfect answer in Nobuhiro Yamashita's Linda Linda Linda. It is not only a feelgood movie it is a feelgreat movie that had the audience dancing in the aisles figuratively if not literally. Yamashita has managed to put together not only one of the best rock films but also one of the most truly honest films I have seen about what life is like for teenagers. It also has a very infectious song Linda Linda Linda arranged by former Smashing Pumpkin James Iha that will roll around forever inside your brain. The songs are not lipsynced but are actually performed by the talented actress musicians.The plot is simple and can be summarized in a paragraph or two but the strength of the film is not in its story but in its quirky humor natural conversations great music and the small moments that convey the roller coaster existence of high school life. Four girls attending Shibazaki High School in Japan want to compete at the annual Holly Rock Festival but things are not going their way. With less than three days before the competition Moe Shione Yukawa the lead guitarist has just broken two fingers in an accident and is unable to play. Two members Kei Yu Kashii and Rinko Takaya Mimura have had a falling out over Rinko's attempt to recruit a boy to play in the bandand are not on speaking terms.A patchwork solution is proposed where Kei decides to be the guitarist while Kyoko Aki Maeda moves to drums and Nozomi Shiori Sekine plays the bass. All that is left is to find a singer and a song no small task. With days left to prepare the girls agree to choose the first person who walks in the corridor in front of them. Since the first person was a boy they decide to pass. They also pass on Rinko a vocalist they used in a former band.Since Rinko doesn't want to sing the song they've chosen they pick the next girl walking by a Korean exchange student named Son Bae Duna who agrees to sing but without much knowledge of Japanese rehearsals are a struggle to communicate. Calling themselves the Paran Maum the girls have to sneak around the school and rehearse at night often falling asleep on the floor. The pace of the film is slow and the girls face challenges but they are real life events not movie problems. Kyoko is attracted to Kazuya Katsuya Kobayashi but needs to find the confidence to let him know. Kei must learn to work within the confines of a group and give up some control and Son has to become comfortable enough with the language to perform.While the story may sound like a teenage soap opera Linda Linda Linda stays away from clich and the film is without contrived plot twists or dramatic confrontations with parents who are mostly nonexistent in the film. Along the way however there are some very endearing moments. One is Son's attempt to enter a karaoke club without buying a drink and her back and forth conversation with the attendant borders on the painfully hilarious.Another great scene is when a young boy tries to communicate in broken Korean to Son that he loves her but there is more than a language barrier. The acting in Linda Linda Linda is uniformly excellent especially the performance of Bae Duna who moves from being shy and inarticulate to front and center stage and sweeps you away with her great smile. The ending of the film is so perfect that I dare not give it away except to say that the feeling the film leaves you with is one of pure and simple joy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Named for a song by legendary Japanese punks The Blue Hearts this film tells the story of four girls who form a band for an endofyear high school festival. They decide to play covers by The Blue Hearts and although the film only covers a few frantic days of practice the pace is sometimes glacial. I'm not sure that this is a bad thing though it felt like the film wanted to go in two directions. On the one hand it was a typically sentimental Japanese film about the passing of youth and the director gives us a few shots of each of the girls smiling wistfully while gazing off in the distance. On the other hand it's a film about a throwntogetherforthehellofit cover band and it could have used a bit more of that kinetic attitude. That being said it was hugely enjoyable though probably a good 15 minutes too long and Bae Doo Na who plays the gawky Korean exchange student literally steals the film. Her transformation from gawky outsider to sassy singer though unrealistically quick is endearing. And only in a Japanese film would someone get to sing the lyrics Like a rat I want to be beautiful and make it sound heartfelt.".

Three days before the fest the guitarist injures her hand leading to an argument between the keyboardist and vocalist. Their search for a lead singer leads them to a shy Korean exchange student Duna Bae who barely speaks the language and can't really carry a tune. Will they be ready in time for the fest? This was released on DVD in the US a few weeks ago and I have watched it 3 times since yet I can't seem to get enough of it. I think it's one of the best films this decade. It's probably the best movie I've ever seen about teenage girls and one of the best movies I've ever seen about rock'n'roll. I've read complaints that it's slow and nothing happens in the film and I can understand that. The movie has a very subtle feminist and punkrock aesthetic that I don't think every viewer picks up on. It doesn't pander to its audience nor does it beat you over the head with its messages. And the music is awesome. DuNa Bae The Host Ring Virus has quickly become my favorite Korean actress. She's brilliant and hilarious in this. The other actresses including two young women from Battle Royale and a reallife jrock star are also excellent. Linda Linda Linda is rock 'n roll in the purist sense. Genius.".

For me this probably has the beautiful Bae Doonas best performance to date I might slightly give the nod to A Girl At My Door but this film runs it close. She steals the film as the kooky exchange Korean student turn front woman to think she was 26 at the time of this film and a bit older then the other three female leads but she makes you believe she's a teenage girl. The other three members of the band are very good especially Aki Maeda Battle Royale as the drummer. But none come close to topping Bae Doona. The ending has a bittersweet feel to it as some else mentioned in their review that it's the last significant thing that they probably do. With shots of empty corridors and grounds of the school it's kind of eerie in a strange way. Also big up the music of the Blue Hearts you end up humming Linda Linda for weeks after hearing it.I did have some problems with it. I did have some trouble with the pacing and I felt a few scenes could have been trimmed to make a tighter film. But overall it's nit picking as this film has it's heart in the right place plus Bae Doona stealing the show. Well worth checking out.".

In a whim they recruit Son Bae Doona a Korean exchange student who has no prior performing experience and can speak very little Japanese to be their vocalist.

The overall pacing may be slow  the editing doesn't resort to quick cuts and many scenes are simply long takes where the camera remains static minimal dialog is spoken and instead would rely on the actors' emotions  but coupled with the soundtrack of Smashing Pumpkins alumnus James Iha Novuhiro Yamashita's lovely direction makes the film consistently droll and bittersweet.Minimal subplots are added and the narrative is pretty much straightforward. The script is mainly concerned with the four girls and their music as the girls' backstories are only hinted at mostly involving teenage squabbles. A scene showing Son and a male admirer is funny to anyone who can relate and Son's nonchalant reply to the boy's I love you is painfully amusing.However the movie's main strength is the chemistry among the girls as they struggle to rehearse and form a bond with their new vocalist despite her inability to speak Japanese fluently. Bae whom I last saw in the Korean movie The Host subtly delivers her deadpan humor in a natural way and her skillful interaction with her much younger costars is spoton.Generally the film is a solid effort. It's pretty much straightforward in presenting a slice of life of its characters with a plot that's not too interested in veering away from the girls and the music they play together. The result is a simple movie that's both entertaining and endearing.".

The songs were as catchy as the lyrics were inane well if the English subtitles were to be trusted taken from Japanese pink rock band The Blue Hearts. Naturally you'll need the element of adversity and it comes in the form of a lack of venues to practice before their big day performance during the school's rock festival.As per formula you'll always have the misfits put together and then bonding just in time for their show. It's no different for Linda Linda Linda as ultimately it's still a feel good movie. It follows the same technique in teasing the audience on the group's performing ability as they improve day by day in not showing you their performing of the songs in full and builds up anticipation for that bringthehousedown finale. However it lacked certain deftness in resolving the multiple minor subplots like romance it opened preferring to leave them unresolved or open ended. And when the final performance did come on it's too little too late with its lack of oomph in delivery cutting short on the promised 3 song medley. It's a pity though as the journey to the destination really hinted on a bigbang adrenaline filled ending.".

There were points when we were watching the movie at normal speed where I would leave prepare part of lunch and return to find that literally nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened the background no important facial gestures were made nothing but mindnumbing awkward silence.This is NOT how to make a thoughtful film especially when the movie's plot follows all the same basic Hollywood movie tropes. If I told you that Disney was making a film about 4 girls starting a band and the singer was a French exchange student what you would expect to be the conflicts that arise?The lead singer has to overcome stage fright? Someone has an unspoken crush? The band is late for their performance and a sidecharacter has to buy them time?SPOILER ALERTAll of those things happen in this movie.At no point in this film do you have even the slightest fraction of concern that these girls won't be able to accomplish their goal.THIS ENDS THE SECTION OF SPOILERSI like Japanese films. I've spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Heck I even know all the bands referenced in the record collections and MDs that they're going through and I've sung along to the title track with friends at karaoke.This is probably the worst film from Japan I've ever seen. Do not be confused. Though the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical Japanese high school things this is not a typical day in the life of movie. This is a day in the life of 4 extremely random heavilyconflicted awkward Japanese students.There are noticeable problems with the DVD as well. Viz decided that a great extra would be a producer reading aloud the Wikipedia entry about the Blue Hearts. What a value! In addition they care so little about the subtitling that the band's name in the subtitles Paran Maum is different than it is in the chapter selection menu Paran Marum. In the final auditorium scene there is a VERY visible reflectionghosting effect on everything but this seems to be the fault of the original film.210 do NOT view if you do not absolutely love awkward silences.".

This jeopardizes their chance to add some meaningful memories to their highschool life's so they are forced to scrap their original songs get a new vocalist and learn some new songs. Their vocalist comes in the form of Koren exchange student Son Duna Bae who is still learning the Japanese language. With the odds against them each member learns something new about themselves as they desperately try to learn the Japanese punk rock band The Blue Hearts song Linda Linda.The most refreshing aspect of the film is easily the story which is very simple to follow from beginning to end allowing for greater accessibility. It doesn't follow the usual formula for film involving highschool girls by portraying a life of materialism and sex. Instead it focuses on four girls growing together as friends who wish to make sure that that had some memories of highschool of good times when they enjoyed themselves. While Bae takes a more centre stage role each girl is as important as the other as each goes through a different experience not shared by the others. If there is a problem with the story it is through it's execution. The director Nobuhiro Yamashita does many still camera shots which serve to slow the pace of fun story. While some scenes do work enhancing the idea of holding onto your memories of the past it does come across as being used too often for its own good. This becomes coupled with a general lack of spark the story drizzles on till its finale which helpfully ends the film on a bang.For a couple of youngsters the acting is acceptably good. Each character is easily distinguishable by their own quirky traits and this is a great achievement which is mostly due to the cast. There are the rare occasions where the actors come across as a little lazy and don't appear all to interested in what is happening but many are probably not bound to notice.Since the story is about music it is important to note that the music is sadly lacking in energy and this is a problem for a film which while not slowly paced does not pace itself quick enough considering the events unfolding in the story. The tunes from The Smashing Pumpkins and James Iha make for a pleasant listen but the only music which pumps with strength are the three songs which the main characters play from The Blue Hearts.Devoid of any offensive material until the final song where the lyrics contain two expletives.Linda Linda Linda is a fun film that suffers mostly from pacing issues and the factors meant to aid this issue do not. Still there is a bright cast of wonderful personalities and the music they make is a definite delight to the ears.".

So they are hard pressed to replace them and get going. The film carefully steers away from all the usual clichs and focuses on very believable situations skillfully acted by 4 adorable young ladies. Doona Bae steels the show as a shy quirky Korean exchange student who rarely understands what everybody is saying and yet is the lead singer. There is no foul language sex or even a real antagonist. Linda Linda Linda is lighthearted funny and simply charming. The title song of the same name has such a catchy hook that everybody I know who has seen the movie can't get the tune out of their head.

	schema:reviewBody "Bergman's adaptation of Leck Fischer's play behaves like a stage play that has been slightly adapted for the screen.  It is essentially a chamber melodrama and it makes little use of the cinema's expanded scope.  The film is watchable and the cast is competent.  Almost everything about it is competent.  It was Bergman's first go at directing a film. He was 2728 years old at the time.Bergman is clearly influenced by Ibsen  I say is because the old master nearly 85 years old now is still at it on the stage  I have the privilege to hold tickets to see his adaptation of Ibsen's Ghosts in London May 2003  can't wait.  Kris is clearly influenced by Ibsen but while the piece has borrowed Ibsen's mastery of structure and development Kris lacks depth.  If Ibsen is grand opera Kris is operetta.  Bergman had not yet acquired the skill to turn a minor play into a major film.There is the odd hint of greatness to come in particular the railway scene between Jack and Ingeborg.  There is also the odd interesting camera angle. But some of the cutting is amateurish and the music is ghastly.If the weatherman tells you that there is going to be a tremendous storm you do not need to be a genius to recognise that the wispy breeze is a prelude to that storm.  In the absence of that weather forecast you could be forgiven for not recognising the breeze as an early hint at the big one. So it is with this film.  Because we know it is Bergman we see hints of greatness to come. Otherwise this would seem like an admittedly above average ordinary 1940's film.Bergman aficionados will enjoy it but it should be quite a way down the list for people who want to start discovering the greatness of Bergman's work.".

It is essentially a chamber melodrama and it makes little use of the cinema's expanded scope.  The film is watchable and the cast is competent.  Almost everything about it is competent.

The themes of human desire for change lost innocence intense longing and other existential themes are apparent at the surface but do not reach the intense depths with which we can analyze the main characters from the films I just mentioned.I found the character Jack Jenny's boyfriendlover to be the most interesting and think he is worthy of a more detailed analysis. Though we later learn that his words are completely contrived he says the same thing to all women we see that he has a talent of making women sympathize with him and he possesses a special ability to say what women want to hear thus revealing his unique understanding of the female psyche. He is something of a broke down Don Juan if you will but he is also the most deeply passionate and complex character in the film. Perhaps it would be easy to write his character off as a wolf who preys on women but I think he reveals more about human desire and an intense longing for life that plays out in his lust for women and his joy in wooing them. Jack does not know where to direct his passions and the pure young and innocent Nelly is simply one of his targets in his misappropriated releases. Despite his selfishness and apparent callousness he is eventually unveiled as a horribly tragic and lost figure a man incapable of reconciling his passions with reality.If you have not seen this film there is no reason to enthusiastically run out and buy or rent a copy but the simple fact that this is his directorial debut should hold enough curiosity for any Ingmar Bergman fan or burgeoning fan one of European cinema's great masters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like much of his pre'Seventh Seal' early work Bergman's 'Crisis' has been called a melodrama.  One can see the attraction of the label  the largely cramped theatrical settings the plot with a prostitute coming to a sleepy provincial town for the daughter she abandoned 18 years earlier taking her back to the big city and a young lovercodedpimp the squalls of overemphatic music at key moments the accumulation of narrative tension finding release in sexual violence and death the contrast between the sophisticated but corrupt ethics of the city and the decent but dull values of the country coded in costumes and architectural space the 'doomed' morally impotent young antihero.But if 'Crisis' is a melodrama it belongs to the work in that genre by those great directors who like Bergman began their careers in the theatre Max Ophuls and Douglas Sirk.  Like them Bergman takes a form dependent on moral certainties to create a world where such certainties have cased to exist.  This is not to say Bergman has contempt for the genre he works in  like all great melodramatists he gives vivid dramatic form to oppositions for instance the cramped interior world of Ingeborg and the fresh location shooting in which we first find Nelly or the young people's jazz intrusion of a fusty mayor's ball.  He respects the melodrama's focus on women their stifling in set social roles  prostitute mother spinster lover daughter illegitimate child ideal whatever.But what Bergman cleverly does is milk the expectations of genre only to totally confound them.  When Jenny comes to abruptly collect a daughter she simply dumped on Ingeborg followed by a young man clearly coded as a pimp we imagine the sordid horrors into which Nelly will be flung especially as she's seduced by Jack with drink fine words and jazz.  Her mother dressed in black and shamelessly free with her body as she takes a foot bath all suggest a licentiousness into which the 'innocent' will be trapped.  The huge elision between her leaving Ingeborg and the latter's visit to the city marked only by a letter of dubious provenance contribute to the bad omens.  And yet as Ingeborg discovers Nelly is quite respectably working in the beauty salon as her mother had promised she has new clothes and friends.  The young man is no pimp but an aimless sponging egoist.This isn't mere legpulling on Bergman's part  it's a way of forcibly shaking us out of lazy assumptions.  The supposed haven of the village is shown to be repressively conformist and culturally dead while Nelly's aunt's house combines lassitude with penury.  The location shooting that seems to express Nelly's authenticity become a Skakespearean stage where Jack seduces here and the prosaic Ulf beats him up in a heavily stylised and brilliantly artificial masque.Bergman from the opening narration emphasises the fictiveness and theatricality of his story where his marionettes are continually placed in transposed theatres his framing as with Ophuls and Sirk is elaborately intrusive capturing characters in boxes or behind bars the sequence shot at the ball the camera moving from the kids jiving to the old folks' pretentious horror is a masterpiece of concise visualising of themes catching these two seemingly disparate groups in the one trap.The heavily contrived finale is not only introduced by a glaring narrative elision but is soundtracked to the noise from an adjacent theatre.  Add to this the dreams and anxious visions of Ingeborg which like the young hero's in 'Fanny and Alexander' seem to seep into the narrative itself so that it is difficult to tell whether what we are watching is objectively happening within the narrative or the  subjective projection of a lonely woman's nightmares and you have a structural ambiguity with which Bergman not only transcends the limitations of traditional melodrama but points forward to the impulses of his finer later work.".

This allows the viewer to observe the evolution in a director's style.While being familiar with films such as 'The Magician' and 'Jungfrkllan' I picked out 'Kris' for takeoff. The first film of a director is usually not the best  keeping this in mind is important when watching it. If you have seen some of the greatest movies of a director it's unlikely that you will be equally impressed by his debut.I enjoyed 'Kris' thoroughly because I tend to ignore the occasional mistakes or failures and seek for those indications that show us a lurking genius. Watching 'Kris' this way makes it simply joyful as one can see clearly an upcoming talent. The theatrical dramatization gives us clear hints of Bergman's favorite subjects which he will continue to explore in many of his later movies such as the doomed destiny of human desire surrounded by existential pain.'Kris' is categorized as a drama here on IMDb  the first half is full of cheerful comedy though. Bergman informs his audience about this at the start of the movie in order to prepare them for what is to follow. That is also the way I recommend you to watch this movie or as Bergman describes This is an everyday play perhaps even a comedy.Enjoy".

She just kind of flits through things because she has pretty much been adored. She is impetuous. I haven't seen such a tear jerking woman as her loving stepmother maybe Mrs. March in little women.

She goes to be a hair stylist and gets hooked up with some bad ones including a wolfish playboy. Meanwhile some big lunk with a silly name Ulfe carries a torch for her. In fairness it has lots of very good shots and is pretty polished for a first film. It's just a bit dull and silly and very predictable.";

The overemphatic music by Erland von Koch ironically demonstrates how discreet Bergman's use of music would be in his heyday.Considering that it was purely an assignment its interesting how womancentred it is like some of Bergman's more auspicious later projects.

	schema:reviewBody "Charles McArthur and Ben Hecht met when both were reporters in Chicago during the 1920s. They created two of the funniest farces in American drama TWENTIETH CENTURY about theater people and THE FRONT PAGE. The latter was based on their experiences as news reporters in those crazy days in Chicago where the newspapers concentrated on sensationalism and the politics was thoroughly corrupt. The resulting play is hysterically funny and yet remains timely. For all the exaggeration of how Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson manipulate police politicians reporters and civilians to get their scoop the story remains relevant for several reasons. The political balance in a big Mayoralty election is precarious due to the Earl Williams case. Williams has shot a policeman who is AfricanAmerican a big local voting block and they want him punished. The corrupt Mayor and his idiot jail warden are willing to execute him for the votes needed to stay in office but the Governor who is from the rival party believes the killer is insane or at least mentally deficient. So already as you see race politics and the validity of the death penalty get pulled in. Soon we also see examples of nepotism and corruption in the police and City Hall cynical politics based on a man's life and questions about privacy and a free press. For a play from 1931 this one still has relevance.There had been an earlier version of the play in the 1930s called THE FRONT PAGE starring Adolphe Menjou as the conniving and devious Walter Burns and Pat O'Brien as ace reporter Hildy Johnson. It is a good version and both stars do well with their parts and both have the verbal speed necessary for the dialog to flow over the ears of the audience. But when the film was remade in 1940 Howard Hawks decided to redraw Hildy Johnson into a female reporter and previous wife of Burns. His casting of Cary Grant was radically different too. Burns is a nasty conniving s.o.b. who would kill for a good story. Menjou was somewhat dapper he was usually dapper in the role but the hardness under the presentable shell was there. And by changing Hildy from a guy to a gal and Walter's former wife you had to make Walter look more interesting. So Walter is turned into Cary Grant. There was a search for Hildy involving Jean Arthur and Irene Dunne as possibilities. Neither ended up playing him. Instead it went to Rosalind Russell.It has to be admitted Russell had the vocal abilities to push the dialog at the proper clip. Possibly Jean Arthur could have done that just as well but Arthur did not have the apparent physical strength behind the stylishness that Russell showed. She really does balance well in this film with Grant given their characters.Motivation changes a little. This Walter Burns still wants to get his scoops but there are moments of fragility when he realizes he may forever lose Hildy to her fianc Bruce the ever helpless Ralph Bellamy. And they oddly work Hawks manages to keep them under control. Also as the story is now twelve years older than the original play certain changes occur in Walter's political views. He does dislike the gang led by Clarence Kolb and Gene Lockhart running the city and points out to Hildy that they have a chance to help give the city the sort of government New York City has under La Guardia. This does not end his joy at scooping the opposition but it does suggest that Burns has more depth.It is now generally believed that this is the best of the film versions of THE FRONT PAGE and one of the funniest films ever made. The entire cast shines look at the scene where Helen Mack confronts the reporters who have made her look like a tramp and have told lies about John Qualen Williams  she is in a state when Russell takes her out of the press room and the reporters are thoroughly ashamed of herself  and Russell comes back looking at Regis Toomey Porter Hall and the others and says Gentlemen of the Press! with heavy cynical irony. And also note Billy Gilbert's immortal Joe Pettibone the most hopeless monument of total befuddlement in movies. It is one of the few film comedies of that period that retains it's laughs one viewing following another.".

The corrupt Mayor and his idiot jail warden are willing to execute him for the votes needed to stay in office but the Governor who is from the rival party believes the killer is insane or at least mentally deficient. So already as you see race politics and the validity of the death penalty get pulled in. Soon we also see examples of nepotism and corruption in the police and City Hall cynical politics based on a man's life and questions about privacy and a free press. For a play from 1931 this one still has relevance.There had been an earlier version of the play in the 1930s called THE FRONT PAGE starring Adolphe Menjou as the conniving and devious Walter Burns and Pat O'Brien as ace reporter Hildy Johnson. It is a good version and both stars do well with their parts and both have the verbal speed necessary for the dialog to flow over the ears of the audience. But when the film was remade in 1940 Howard Hawks decided to redraw Hildy Johnson into a female reporter and previous wife of Burns. His casting of Cary Grant was radically different too. Burns is a nasty conniving s.o.b. who would kill for a good story. Menjou was somewhat dapper he was usually dapper in the role but the hardness under the presentable shell was there. And by changing Hildy from a guy to a gal and Walter's former wife you had to make Walter look more interesting. So Walter is turned into Cary Grant. There was a search for Hildy involving Jean Arthur and Irene Dunne as possibilities. Neither ended up playing him. Instead it went to Rosalind Russell.It has to be admitted Russell had the vocal abilities to push the dialog at the proper clip. Possibly Jean Arthur could have done that just as well but Arthur did not have the apparent physical strength behind the stylishness that Russell showed. She really does balance well in this film with Grant given their characters.Motivation changes a little. This Walter Burns still wants to get his scoops but there are moments of fragility when he realizes he may forever lose Hildy to her fianc Bruce the ever helpless Ralph Bellamy. And they oddly work Hawks manages to keep them under control. Also as the story is now twelve years older than the original play certain changes occur in Walter's political views. He does dislike the gang led by Clarence Kolb and Gene Lockhart running the city and points out to Hildy that they have a chance to help give the city the sort of government New York City has under La Guardia. This does not end his joy at scooping the opposition but it does suggest that Burns has more depth.It is now generally believed that this is the best of the film versions of THE FRONT PAGE and one of the funniest films ever made. The entire cast shines look at the scene where Helen Mack confronts the reporters who have made her look like a tramp and have told lies about John Qualen Williams  she is in a state when Russell takes her out of the press room and the reporters are thoroughly ashamed of herself  and Russell comes back looking at Regis Toomey Porter Hall and the others and says Gentlemen of the Press! with heavy cynical irony. And also note Billy Gilbert's immortal Joe Pettibone the most hopeless monument of total befuddlement in movies. It is one of the few film comedies of that period that retains it's laughs one viewing following another.";

And the oneandonly Rosalind Russell is every bit his match  full of verve and aplomb Russell's Hildy is an independent career woman brimming with intelligence and class that impressively predates the major feminist movement of the midsixties by a good 25 years.The film's supporting cast is no less impressive with every single role cast to perfection. This is particularly true of Ralph Bellamy who along with his Oscarnominated performance in 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH proves once again that he is the ultimate straight man. The film contains some grim subject matter that may seem like unlikely fodder for a screwball comedy murder attempted suicide and public execution are all touched upon although the film somehow manages to deal with such topics respectfully and without sacrificing any laughs. In the end HIS GIRL Friday is an absolutely unbeatable romantic comedy that remains wildly hilarious and comes as close to sheer perfection as any motion picture could ever hope to.".

	schema:headline " Fast Dialogue only savior for unsympathetic characters";
	schema:reviewBody "When I learned about Howard Hawkes screwball comedy His Girl Friday one of the biggest attractions I was told was the fastpacedoverlapping dialogue. During this time in Hollywood dialogue would only be spoken by one person at a time. His Girl Friday was one of the first films to have characters speaking at the same time often over one another this would create an environment that was more realistic especially in a place such as a newspaper room. Well if that's what Hawkes was going for he certainly achieved it.The best thing about the film IS the dialogue. Characters speak at a breakneck speed throwing witticisms left and right as if they were candy. Many times while one is laughing at one joke they would miss another right after it. That is how quickly the jokes are thrown out in the film. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are great at spilling lines out seemingly without any problem. It's a real testament to how professional these two were along with the rest of the cast with the amount of verbal meat they had to chew I can't think of an actor today that could possibly pull of the kind of dialogue that was given in this film.The problem that I had with the film was that the dialogue was the ONLY great thing about it. Unfortunately the characters and situations presented in the film had little sympathy and lack of any kind of real depth. The situation with the falsely accused murderer was handled poorly given the context of his predicament instead of really caring about this person and really trying to help him become cleared of charges the Grant and Rosalind characters instead used him for their own purposes in getting the big scoop. Now of course one can argue that that WAS the reason they treated him the way they did my issue is that such a serious subject was handled in a supposed comedic fashion as if it was OK that this falsely accused person can be treated in such a horrible way simply because it handled comedically. The lastsecond deus ex machina that sealed this person's fate supports the idea that his story wasn't really handled with any kind of importance.The thing the really hurt the film was the love triangle between the Grant and Rosalind characters and the Rosalind's character's fianc. We are told in the beginning of the film that Grant and Rosalind are divorcees and Rosalind is set to marry her fianc the very next day in Albany. Of course in a film like this we are supposed to root for the Grant and Rosalind characters to get together at the end. the problem is the Grant character is such a manipulative creep that at the end of the film I found myself actually rooting for the fianc to the win the girl. Three times in the movie the Grant character manipulates the situation causing the fianc to be thrown in jail and preventing the wouldbe married couple from leaving the city. This in turn gives the Grant character enough time to convince Rosalind that she will always be a newspaperman. The Rosalind character isn't much better either. Throughout the beginning of the film she keeps explaining to others that she is through with the newspaper business that she wants to settle down raise a family and not have to deal with the daily grind of hunting down a story.

	onyx:emotionText "When I learned about Howard Hawkes screwball comedy His Girl Friday one of the biggest attractions I was told was the fastpacedoverlapping dialogue. During this time in Hollywood dialogue would only be spoken by one person at a time. His Girl Friday was one of the first films to have characters speaking at the same time often over one another this would create an environment that was more realistic especially in a place such as a newspaper room. Well if that's what Hawkes was going for he certainly achieved it.The best thing about the film IS the dialogue. Characters speak at a breakneck speed throwing witticisms left and right as if they were candy. Many times while one is laughing at one joke they would miss another right after it. That is how quickly the jokes are thrown out in the film. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are great at spilling lines out seemingly without any problem. It's a real testament to how professional these two were along with the rest of the cast with the amount of verbal meat they had to chew I can't think of an actor today that could possibly pull of the kind of dialogue that was given in this film.The problem that I had with the film was that the dialogue was the ONLY great thing about it. Unfortunately the characters and situations presented in the film had little sympathy and lack of any kind of real depth. The situation with the falsely accused murderer was handled poorly given the context of his predicament instead of really caring about this person and really trying to help him become cleared of charges the Grant and Rosalind characters instead used him for their own purposes in getting the big scoop. Now of course one can argue that that WAS the reason they treated him the way they did my issue is that such a serious subject was handled in a supposed comedic fashion as if it was OK that this falsely accused person can be treated in such a horrible way simply because it handled comedically. The lastsecond deus ex machina that sealed this person's fate supports the idea that his story wasn't really handled with any kind of importance.The thing the really hurt the film was the love triangle between the Grant and Rosalind characters and the Rosalind's character's fianc. We are told in the beginning of the film that Grant and Rosalind are divorcees and Rosalind is set to marry her fianc the very next day in Albany. Of course in a film like this we are supposed to root for the Grant and Rosalind characters to get together at the end. the problem is the Grant character is such a manipulative creep that at the end of the film I found myself actually rooting for the fianc to the win the girl. Three times in the movie the Grant character manipulates the situation causing the fianc to be thrown in jail and preventing the wouldbe married couple from leaving the city. This in turn gives the Grant character enough time to convince Rosalind that she will always be a newspaperman. The Rosalind character isn't much better either. Throughout the beginning of the film she keeps explaining to others that she is through with the newspaper business that she wants to settle down raise a family and not have to deal with the daily grind of hunting down a story. Well does settling down and having a family sound like a bad thing to you? I didn't think so. Every time she tries to leave she gets bogged down and distracted by the story many times through the very fault of the Grant character. It gets so bad that when the fianc comes to her begging her to leave with him she brushes him off like a fly barely acknowledging him.

It forgets it has a story with also some romantic as well as dramatic elements in it. Because of this none of the romance and more serious intended moments within the movie just didn't ever worked out.To be honest I quite liked the movie in the beginning and in general I'm also fond of these type of movies especially when they star Cary Grant but about halve way through the movie totally started to loose track and the movie became an huge fast going mess. It's pace becomes incredibly high and lots of character constantly show up and are going away again just as fast as they came. The movie at that point basically becomes more of an annoying one to watch and it doesn't get any more better when it heads toward its ending.It's not like I hated watching this movie and it certainly does has its moments but for a movie that is considered a true genre classic it's definitely a disappointing one.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "'His Girl Friday' represents one of the major paradoxes of American narrative cinema  Hollywood's ability to incorporate images of social change into films that ultimately deny and frustrate the possibility of such change.  Tom PowersBefore Wilder's Ace in the Hole and Mackendrick's Sweet Smell of Success there was His Girl Friday Howard Hawks' motormouthed screwball comedy and lighthearted satire of both journalism and Chicago politics.The film is based on a 1928 play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur but it was Hawks who came up with the idea of making the lead a woman. Write em as a guy and cast em as a broad was Hawks' motto a technique which resulted in a filmography filled with strong masculine bawdy women. This time around our heroine is Hildy Johnson Rosalind Russell a star reporter who has recently divorced Walter Burns Cary Grant editor at the Morning Post.Like most screwballs His Girl Friday finds Walter and Hildy engaged in a battle of wits. They can't stand each another but Walter nevertheless spends the entire film scheming to repair his relationship with Hildy. When the film's couple aren't cracking wise Hawks engages in an altogether different affair excoriating conniving journalists newspaper editors and the politicalmedia machinery of Chicago.At the heart of this crisscrossing satire is a character called Earl Williams scheduled to be publicly executed for the shooting and killing of a black police officer. Every subset of the city the film goes on to show wants Williams executed for different reasons the Mayor chasing African American votes and the news desks itching for good ink. Their detachment is chilling death reduced to filling column spaces. No better is Hildy's desire to twist Williams' story into a weapon to be used against the Mayor's local policies. Make Williams a scapegoat and damn the Mayor she thinks.By the film's end Williams has became a pawn in an ugly chess game in which everyone is wrong. Meanwhile the news desks politicians and police are all busy overpyschoanalysing Williams. Each group hires experts to offer expert opinions on Williams' motivations. These experts are geared not toward finding the truth but creating rationalizations and therefore ammunition for already held opinions plans or policies.Hawks' films have always been amoral dark and cynical but His Girl Friday is particularly bleak. It's a film filled with sharks leaches and backstabbers though a century of cynical films about newspaper men have rendered its satire impotent even the cutting edge The Wire in its final season can't get away from these clichs. Likewise modern viewers may find Hawks' once novel screwball antics somewhat dulled by a diet of TV sitcoms. Aesthetically the film is typical of Hawks packed with rapidfire banter overlapping dialogue virtually no dead air and snappy fluid camera work. Hawks captures the energy and buzz of newsrooms. His film spits like a machine gun.Incidentally upon release Friday was praised for promoting social change. Namely that of marriages being based on equality rather than exploitation the notion that women might be economically independent intelligent and self sufficient and that new possibilities lay ahead in the roles of the sexes. In reality however the film boils down to rigid old gender roles. Men operate in a sphere of violence and corruption a stance Hildy must herself adopt  her price of admission into their allmale world  in order to escape the world of female entrapment and domesticity. This domesticity Hildy then decides is not worth the effort leaving. In other words play the game be a ruthless man or shut up and stay at home.810  Worth one viewing.".

It's certainly emphasized here that screwball comedies focused on the conflict for women in deciding between lovemarriage and professional careers. This film doesn't work for me on many different levels. While I can certainly appreciate extended dialogue this film is overkill. The dialogue is absolutely blistering. It has many plot swings that are equally as painful but the biggest reason I simply didn't enjoy this movie was because I just don't care whether or not Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell wind up together largely because neither character is particularly likable.".

Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were masters of their craft with a palpable chemistry between their characters due to their proficiency in acting. The side characters were wonderful as well enhancing the story without taking focus away from the main players or the plot. The cinematography was excellent they managed to do so much within the newspaper room where a majority of the movie takes place but it manages to never make the audience feel like they're stuck there. I didn't expect the drama but I think it very much enhanced the film adding stakes to what was already a seatgripping story. This truly elevated the screwball comedy genre and both Cary and Rosalind's career to new heights delivering a suckerpunch of a performance that leaves you breathless.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a classic adaptation titled His Girl Friday  1940  it makes some memorable exchanges from original play  perfectly directed by Howard Hawks including allstarcast such as Gary Grant  Ralph Bellamy and Rosalind Russell with the pivotal character assigned to a woman instead a man  dealing with a newspaper editor uses every trick in the book to keep his ace reporter exwife from remarrying . And being voted 10 in Total Film's 100 Greatest Movies Of All Time list . Very good recounting about known story in which a beautiful woman reporter Rosalind Russell  though Katherine Hepburn Carole Lombard Joan Crawford  Ginger Rogers Claudette Colbert  Irene Dunne turned down the character and whose role was based on the reallife a notorious reporter wants to marry a young Ralph Bellamy but his mean editor sympathetic and charming Gary Grant impedes it . Riproaring vintage newspaper slapstick comedy and subsequently remade by Billy Wilder titled The Front Page this 1940 retelling is the best one titled His girl friend and with awesome acting from everyone . Cynical editor named Walter Burns Gary Grant wants to get a big scoop on an execution which involves convincing star reporter Hildy Johnson Rosalind Russell who resented the fact that she wasn't the first choice to play Hildy for director and she then showed up to the audition with her hair wet from swimming to come back to work and put off her marriage to handsome executive . Walter tries to keep him in town and break up her upcoming marriage takes place against the backdrop of a botched death row . Hildy can't resist covering some good news  even when it mean helping a condemned man John Qualen getaway the law as she attempts to help an innocent man is about to be executed . And the escaped convicted murderer offers the journalist an exclusive interview . Other reporters also give hilarious acting in this breathless pursuit of an exclusive with the escaped death row inmate .Great cast gives powerful performances as Gary Grant as a scheming publisher  Rosalind Russell as a convincing as well as impulsive journalist and Ralph Bellamy as an incautious boyfriend . Enjoyable play and screenplay from Ben Hecht  Charles MacArthur about a cunning managing editor of a known newspaper and his ambitious reporter . The journalists are all based on actual reporters who were Chicago colleagues of authors Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur with most working alongside them at the courthouse  the real names were only slightly changed . Ben Hetch's brilliantly tart dialogue overlaps story to carry the black farce along the rollercoasted speed . Agreeable performance from attractive Rosalind Russell as ace journalist who wants to quit the business and get married  though Jean Arthur the first choice by studio head Harry Cohn turned down the role of Hildy Johnson because she and Howard Hawks had been cool to each other during the filming of Only angels have wings 1939 the year before . Likable Gary Grant as an editor who finds out his main reporter wants to leave him and gets in the way  though many critics in 1940 felt that Cary Grant was badly miscast as Walter Burns and that Clark Gable would have been much better in the part . Inventive and furious screen combats in which Gary Grant and Rosalind Russell are given equal footing with staccato dialog and sparkling interpretations . Phenomenal playing from everyone  including a topnotch secondary cast such as Gene Lockhart  Porter Hall  Cliff Edwards  Regis Toomey  Abner Biberman  John Qualen and Helen Mack . Adequate photography by cinematographer Joseph Walker  being necessary an right remastering because of the film copy is wornout and suffers the public domain . The only music is in the first and last two minutes of the film . Stunning direction by Howard Hawks renders more funny than usual  and achieved success enough . Rating  7510 . Worthwhile watching and premiere voted this movie as one of The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time in 2006.

The Grant character was dishonest and manipulative and he did bad things. In real life I would have had nothing to do with a person like this. Yet he is the one that we are supposed to think of favorably. Why? What does he have to recommend him? Absolutely nothing. He is a firstclass jerk. I saw reviews calling this movie hilarious and incredibly funny. There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie let alone hilarious.

I happen to think that cruelty and injustice are not funny in the least. And things were done that made no sense.

	schema:headline " Definitely a commendable visualisation of Murakami's reflective novel this is a thoughtful piece of work which may not be everyone's cup of tea";
	schema:reviewBody "Those were the best years of our lives. Every once in a while when the weather gets melancholic we would reminiscence those years when loss and sexuality meant a whole lot more. Every once in a while when we hear a morose tune on the radio we would recall those moments when relationships mattered a whole lot more. And every once in a while when we watch a moody film we would remember those times when life played out like a cinematic feature.All that remains now is nostalgia.And that is why critically acclaimed Japanese writer Haruki Murakami's novels spoke to so many people. His works poignantly captures the spiritual emptiness of the modern generation and explores the loss of human connection in the bustling society we live in today. And just when detractors thought that Murakami's bestselling 1987 novel was unfilmable along comes Tran Anh Hung whose past works include the award winning Cyclo 1995 and The Scent of Green Papaya 1993.Set in Tokyo during the late 1960s the film's male protagonist is Toru a quiet and serious college student. He loses his best friend to suicide and his personal life is thrown into turmoil. He becomes emotionally closer to his friend's exgirlfriend Naoko who shares the same sense of loss. Circumstances bring Naoko to a sanatorium and Toru becomes devastated. Another girl Midori enters his life and he realises that she is everything Naoko isn't. Torn between two women and feeling empty about life's past and future what ensues is Toru's nostalgic journey of loss and sexuality.The above synopsis probably doesn't do justice to Murakami's writing which is known to be humorous and surrealistic. While we haven't read the original novel which this 133 minute film is based on we have chanced upon Murakami's other works and we must recognize Tran's decision to adapt the story into a feature film.The first thing which grabs you is the hypnotically mesmerizing cinematography by the award winning Lee Ping Bin In the Mood For Love Three Times. The breathtaking mountainous landscapes of Japan are captured on Lee's lenses like gems. You can imagine yourself wandering through the green grasslands and the snowy grounds letting the spectacle engulf your senses. To replicate the mood of 1960s production designers Norifumi Ataka and Yen Khe Luguem have painstakingly created scene after scene of the film's characters journeying through life's alleys against backdrops of intricately decorated cafes workshops and hostel rooms. The result is a visually pleasing mood piece which displays the director's eye for details. The soundtrack composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood completes the viewing experience with an enigmatic score.Also commendable are the cast's performances. Playing Toru is Kenichi Matsuyama Death Note's L. He has an empathetic vulnerability which leaves a lasting impression with viewers. Rinko Kichuki Babel displays the much needed frailty of Naoko's character without becoming overly melodramatic while newcomer Kiko Mizuhara is charming as the charismatic Midori.Like most literary adaptation this film loses some of the novel's poignancy when it comes to character and plot development. Emotions are conveyed through convenient voiceovers and the exploration of sexuality may appear preposterous to those who uninitiated to Murakami's works. Furthermore the slow and meandering pacing of the two odd hour film may be a test of patience to some.It will take audiences who are familiar with the postmodern writer's work to appreciate this film. If you are an individual who often indulges in poetic wistfulness this may just be the perfect film for you on a contemplative evening too.www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost I am a Haruki Murakami Fan. So far I have read nine of his novels and still going. Although of me being a fan of his work Norwegian Wood is NOT one of my all time Murakami favorites despite of having enjoyed reading it To each his own. In fact after reading it I wondered whether if being named after a Beatles song had maybe something to do with this novel's popularity. Still once I heard it was being made into a movie I had to see it! Before seeing this I had previously seen Tony Takitani which is also a Haruki Murakami short story that was made into a movie and also enjoyed. So needles to say I am a die hard Murakami fan.The movie itself was wonderfully filmed. Ping Bin Lee the cinematographer behind Hou HsiaoHsien's movies Millenium Mambo Three Times Caf Lumire........ did a stellar job on this film. He shot wonderful strong visual scenes making the scenery and all other locations look beautiful throughout the movie. Needles to say this movie visually stands out.The music also sets the tone for this film. Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead was hired to do the score and although I am familiar with the music from Radiohead not a big fan though I could tell it was done by him.Anh Hung Tran's direction keeps up with his previous film I Come With The Rain which in my opinion was quite successfully presented even though it was highly criticize among movie goers. Whether you enjoy his works or not this guy piques my interest and I will keep an eye out for whatever he makes next. In my opinion he honestly did his best keeping the story true to the novel. Of course there are a few things that he did not get into telling like Reiko's back storythough was briefly referenced Watanabe's roommate anticsthere were some minor moments though but whole scenes Nagasawa and Watanabe's escapades were kept to a minimum.......etc. Also the first ten minutes of the film rushes easily through about a third of the novel. It's a movie so not everything from the book will make it on screen. And YES the ending on the movie is just like on the novel although the novel describes the underlying Murakami ending which you only get through reading some of his novels so if you're interested in understanding the abrupt ending you might just read the novel just for that in case you we're put off by it and did not understand what was actually going on on the final scene which there's much more to it. There are also much more that you don't get from watching the movie so you're interested in knowing what wasn't told on screen you might want to read it.Overall I enjoyed the movie more than the novel. I still love Haruki Murakami novels. All His works are very straight forward which I always enjoy. Whether your a fan of his works or not watch the film and compare it with the novel. Worth checking out!".

If you can get through the first 30 minutes the film will grow onto you and engage you and eventually immerse into your world. Based on a 1987 award winning novel about the 60s changing social situation in Japan the film explores the complicated notions of unrequited love the era of sexual freedom and the loss of innocence. Director Anh Hung Tran paints a beautiful slow and lingering picture which allows the film to grow onto the audience. At times the film feels like something from Wong Kar Wai and the Beatles title song is fitting. The film ends on a lighter tone and there is one quote that I find worthy to share about loss All we can do is see it through to the end and learn something from it but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sorrow that comes to us without warning. I am delighted to have gone through this cinematic journey and despite its opening flaws Norwegian Wood eventually wins the audience's heart Neo rates it 910.www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:headline " A generally commendable effort but with rather serious omissions";
	schema:reviewBody "For the audience who have not read the book this movie could be a satisfying cinematic experience if artsy romance is their cup of tea. For people who have read and liked the book it is bound to be disappointing and it is hard to blame them. To be fair Vietnamese director TRAN Anh Hung who made his mark with his stylish languid indie The scent of green papaya 1993 endorsed by Murakami himself has delivered some of the moods and emotions of the novel through minimalistic direction fluid editing mesmerising cinematography and rich background music from classic to pop. But so much that is so important in the novel have been left out that what you see on screen is only a small fraction.Most disappointing is the character Midori. Despite Kiko Mizuhara's good performance what we see on screen is only a pale shadow of the rich and endearing character. This is not the actress's fault as she has been given little material to work with. The neighbourhood fire scene during Watanabe's first visit to his bookstorecumhome so vital in cementing her character and their relationship is completely cut. Similarly the episode with her dying father in the hospital is so miserably trimmed that the scene amounts to nothing where it should do a lot. Another complete omission is the story of Reiko which in the book takes up a good part of a long chapter about onefourth of the entire length of the book through a flashback account by the protagonist herself. Without it her role is much diminished and the meaning of her sexual liaison with Watanabe at the end of the movie is completely lost and even looks ridiculous. I can only find one reason for these huge omissions  yes I know there is a commercial consideration a 4hour movie is not a feasible proposition but I don't mean that  it is assumed that the majority of the audience have read the book.Credit should be given when it's due. The roles of both Nagasawa and Hatsumi are well performed particularly in the confrontational dinner scene. Casting of the main protagonist Watanabe is excellent as Kenichi Matsuyama brings out the charm of this superficially unenthusiastic layback character. The role of Naoko is probably one that triggers much debate from what I've read. In that Naoko is the most enigmatic character in this story and therefore subject to different interpretations by different people it is not surprising. Rinko Kikuchi is acclaimed internationally for her performance in Babel 2006 which made her one of the only eight Asian actors ever nominated for an acting Oscar. My reaction after watching the movie is that she does manage to capture at least part of the Naoko in my mind but if you ask a hundred people you'll probably get a hundred different answers.So here's the dilemma. If you haven't read the book you wouldn't be able to appreciate the movie in a way it is meant to be appreciated. But if you have you are bound to be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have read the book by Haruki Murakami this film won't spoil it but you will be frustrated at what it failed to achieve. Sometimes with adaptations you hate the way they change key details and take away the meaning of the original work. Here its a different problem. The film was too languid and reserved. The story of Naoko and Watanabe was generally well done. But it really failed to tell the relationship of Midori and Wantanabe. In the novel she is far more quirky and sparky than was shown  and it would have lifted the film to have portrayed that. Similarly it would have made it more lively had we seen Wantanabe's strange room mate Stormtrooper. And again it would have been more interesting if we had seen Watanabe and Nagasawa on their nights out hunting for girls. Norwegian Wood was beautifully filmed and I loved the sets which resonated with the descriptions in the book. I apologise for mentioning the book so much but I don't think this film carries its own weight if you haven't read it. I can't imagine I would have felt emotionally drawn into without knowing the book as the characters weren't developed properly. To sum up  not a disaster but very much a missed opportunity.".

And again it would have been more interesting if we had seen Watanabe and Nagasawa on their nights out hunting for girls. Norwegian Wood was beautifully filmed and I loved the sets which resonated with the descriptions in the book. I apologise for mentioning the book so much but I don't think this film carries its own weight if you haven't read it. I can't imagine I would have felt emotionally drawn into without knowing the book as the characters weren't developed properly. To sum up  not a disaster but very much a missed opportunity.";

	schema:reviewBody "The poet Rilke said There is only one journey. Going inside yourself. Here something blooms from out of a silent crevice an unknowing weed emerges singing into existence. The unknowing weed takes its time to sing but sing it does in director Tran Anh Hung's film Norwegian Wood his first since Vertical Ray of the Sun in 2000. Based on the bestselling 1987 novel of Haruki Murikami which I haven't read the film reflects the inner journey of 19yearold Toru Watanabe Ken'ichi Matsuyama a journey that embodies the pain of love and loss the tantalizing embrace of death the end of dreams and the beginning of adult responsibility.Scored by Jonny Greenwood with some narration by Watanabe the film takes place in Tokyo in 1967 in the midst of student protests against the War in Vietnam. Trying to ease the pain of the shattering loss of Kizuki Kengo Kora a close friend from high school Watanabe immerses himself in his studies at school where he is majoring in drama and with Nagasawa Tetsuji Tamayama an older and more experienced friend is able to release his tension by going to bars and picking up girls for sex. Things change however when Kizuki's former girlfriend the beautiful but emotionally fragile Naoko Rinko Kikuchi shows up in Tokyo and reaches out to Watanabe for consolation. Though their language is exceedingly frank and sexually explicit it is vital to understanding the characters and never used to titillate.Their deepening relationship however only brings the feelings of loss closer to the surface and Naoko's ensuing emotional breakdown causes her to leave Tokyo for psychological rehabilitation at a mountain retreat where she is only able to see Watanabe intermittently. Even on occasional meetings however they embrace a dark ecstasy that inures them at least temporarily from their mutual grief but when Naoko's roommate music teacher Reiko Reika Kirishima sings the Lennon and McCartney song Norwegian Wood at Naoko's 20th birthday party the line and when I awoke I was alone this bird had flown evokes tears that flow naturally.Paralyzed by her sadness and feelings of responsibility for Kizuki's death Naoko sinks deeper into despair and Watanabe's vows of lifelong fidelity are compromised by his attraction to Midori Kiko Mizuhara a smart outgoing student who also has had to overcome a troubled past. Norwegian Wood is not a film about teenage angst or any other of the favorite catch phrases that substitute for empathy but about the essence of life itself and the anguish of having to let go of attachments. More of a tone poem than a freeflowing narrative the film creates an indelible experience of both exquisite beauty and aching pain perhaps two sides of the same coin. Like the underappreciated Tony Takitani another film based on a story by Murakami Norwegian Wood unfolds like a dream evoking a mood of serenity and contemplation.Supported by the stunning cinematography of Ping Bin Lee much of the film's power takes place in the silences that allow us to simply observe the sublime beauty of the countryside its forests waterfalls and the purity of its winter landscapes. While some may try the film's emotional roller coaster cannot be filtered out and in the process of assimilating it it builds a quiet power that ensnares us and leaves us to explore its meanings long after the final credits. In spite of those who want to attach the label of boring to every film that moves slowly and requires concentration Norwegian Wood will be remembered as one of Hung's best films and a work that brought cinema to a new level of artistic achievement.".

	schema:headline " Movie Version of Norwegian Wood";
	schema:reviewBody "When I was a university student one of my close friends told me that novels by Haruki Murakami were good and recommended me to read them. I was 19 years old then and it was the first time for me to read Norwegian Wood. The novel captured my interest and I have read it again and again since then and I still read it even now. Norwegian Wood is one of my favorite books.The novel Norwegian Wood depicts the university days of the main character Watanabe Tohru. In the novel he lives in Tokyo and goes to university. He likes reading American modern literature. He did not have any friends except for one best friend during his high school days but the friend killed himself at the age of seventeen. Watanabe has several relationships with women between the age of 18 and 21. Some characters in the novel other than Watanabe's best friend have also killed themselves. The novel consists of sex death literature and intelligence.I went to university and had some close female friends. In addition I liked reading classic literature. Furthermore I did not belong to a sport clubs at university so the scope of my friendship was limited. In essence I felt a sense of intimacy with Watanabe while reading the novel. In fact I learnt The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger and The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald from Norwegian Wood and both books were the first English novels which I completed reading in their original language. Norwegian Wood is an important book for me so I was glad to hear 2 to 3 years ago that the movie version of this novel would be screened. The movie was released about one week ago and I went to see it today.Locations shot in the movie were beautiful and the music sounds good. In particular I was moved by one scene in which Reiko sang Norwegian Wood by the Beatles with a guitar and Naoko lost her mental stability during Reiko's performance. In addition the cast members in the movie were also good especially Mizuhara Kiko who played Midori was very cute and vivid.Since I have read the novel over and over and remember the whole story in detail I can go so far as to say that I do not need any explanation for the story in the movie. Because I know the story I was purely interested in how the film director Tran Anh Hung had expressed the novel through the media of a movie.The movie version of Norwegian Wood was not solely a converted version of the novel but represented its originality and creativity with the help of movie techniques such as music voice cry laugh or angry facial expression and scenery.However it is certain that those who have never read the novel will not enjoy the movie.The above comment is forwarded from my blog at httpmetropolitantokyo.blogspot.com".

While its not my favorite of his books I'm a big Haruki Murakami fan and I love Anh Hung Tran's earlier films  I thought this was potentially a match made in heaven.The film is good  very good. Just not the great film I'd hoped it would be. There are wonderful scenes and great acting and the cinematography is beautiful. But I think there are some major flaws. The flow of the film is oddly disjointed at times  while the book is very much written from the perspective of an older wiser man looking back at his immature youth the film seems unsure of its own perspective. The voiceover is poorly structured seemingly aimed at filling in narrative gaps rather than giving us the older narrators overview. Oddly for Tran a director who has been extremely minimalist in the past some scenes are far too overwrought not helped by the intrusive and anachronistic score. The casting is also uneven  Rinko Kikuchi is a marvelous actress but is simply too old to play a convincing 20 year old. The character of Reiko is also played by an actress much younger than the character in the book but the part hasn't been changed accordingly. That said Kenichi Matsuyama as Toru and in particular Kiko Mizuhara as Midori are terrific.I really don't know how someone who doesn't know the book will react to this. I suspect that if you are a romantic at heart you will like it even if you find it a bit overlong and some of the characters too thinly drawn. Fans of the book will mostly love it as it is quite faithful maybe too faithful to the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based upon the novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung boldly translates the story to the big screen with a cast of familiar faces in Kenichi Matsuyama and Rinko Kikuchi in lead roles but somehow this attempt seemed to float along rather casually into a typical tale of a love triangle loss and sexuality without much emotional depth. Set in the late 1960s in Japan with a whole host of student turmoil this aspect of the story got shelved aside to focus more on the personal coming of age tale of Toru Watanabe Matsumaya and the women in his life.So putting aside the various one night stands he benefited from hanging out with casanova Nagasawa Tetsuji Tamayama Watanabe has to choose between Naoko Kikuchi a girl whom he knows from his younger days when she was the girlfriend of his best friend Kizuki Kengo Kora who inexplicably committed suicide and that of Midori Kiko Mizuhara putting in a very charismatic performance who actually had made the first move in getting to know him better although stopping short of going the full distance given a boyfriend whom we never see on screen.Depending on your preference and emotional pull toward broad stereotypes of people the two girls are very much distinct in their personalities one being an emotional wreck given the loss of Kizuki and spending her time in rehabilitation which accounted for the many lush green and white sceneries depending on the calendar month while the other is a perpetual sunshine confident outgoing and attractively lively. It's pessimism versus optimism although you'd probably understand Watanabe's obligation toward Naoko having spent time growing up together losing their mutual friend and growing close not to mention an awkward deflowering process that happened to seal the emotional deal and attachment.And you wonder if you'd call that love or attraction even as opposed to the proposition with another girl who had entered into a crossroads in his life being stuck in time having to want to care for someone close versus a new opportunity being presented with Midori's presence. Tran's vision puts one into a deliberately slow paced evaluation as Watanabe struggles to understand his emotional predicament and dilemma presented where if one doesn't know how to proceed at a forked road ahead one stalls for time and stalling is what this film felt like.But thanks to cinematographer Mark Lee Ping Bin this allows for plenty of beautiful postcard picturesque shots of the countryside and many visually stunning captures of emotions of the characters at hand allowing sensitive moving moments to come through and even chances to showcase a long tracking shot set out in the fields which flip flops across the screen as Naoko shares with Watanabe her oft confused state. My favourite however involved that between Watanabe and Midori in a snow filled landscape cold in scenery but completely filled with the warmth of heart. The cinematography added a boost in the mundane state of characterization and when things can't move forward at least your eyes can start to roam at the well crafted technical shots and composition of the film in addition to the era of the 60s.The subplots of the rich story tried to muscle its way into the film but ultimately got sacrificed to stay focus on the primary trio in a tale about finding it tough to let go and move on without being perceived as uncaring. And just when I thought the story had finally found its grounding from which to move off in comes a deus ex machina moment to help propel it forward taking off the shine of emotional rollercoaster of the previous two hours which made it all seem a little futile and a waste. Draw your own conclusions if you will since the film left things unsatisfying open ended and what you take away from the film will probably be self reflective. I tried to love this film but ultimately I can't.".

Running at more than two hours this Japaneselanguage film from acclaimed Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung The Scent of Green Papaya 1993 Cyclo 1995 is beautiful to look at features topnotch performances from the leads and has a haunting score by Johnny Greenwood There Will Be Blood 2007 that gives a number of scenes a rare intensity in this mostly quiet film about life and death past and future and the complications of love.Rinko Kikuchi who was nominated for an Oscar for Babel 2006 plays Naoko a beautiful young woman who has been emotionally troubled by the suicide of Kizuki her lifelong friend and lover. Soon after Toru Kenichi Matsuyama a close friend of both Naoko and Kizuki develops romantic affection for her in which she reciprocates. However a sense of loss continues to haunt her making her distant and introspective. Some time after Toru meets Midori Kiko Mizuhara a very pretty and outgoing girl whom he is also attracted to.Norwegian Wood a screen adaptation of Haruki Murakami's popular novel of the same name brings forth the tension between Toru's commitment to Naoko and the possibility of a new life with Midori. Set in the backdrop of student protests against established rule in 1960s Japan Tran's film is shot mostly from the perspective of Toru as he recalls memories of sadness joy pain pleasure and tragedy. Even for a film that markets itself as a serious but freespirited romancedrama Norwegian Wood is surprisingly frank in its treatment of sexuality which is somewhat instrumental in pushing the film's plot forward.Watching Norwegian Wood reminds of Never Let Me Go 2010 also a film adaptation of a novel by a Japanese author. In both films the atmosphere is melancholically dense though it is occasionally poetic sharing similar themes of memory loss and love. Norwegian Wood however is the far better film because it probes more deeply into the lives of its characters especially of their emotional reaction to their psychological troubles. However despite Tran's excellent direction of his cast the actors' performances seem unable to make us feel completely sympathetic for their characters. In a way the acting is strong but there is a lack of potency.The director's nearconstant use of extreme closeups of the actors' faces as they converse kiss and have sex allows the camera to wrap itself around the space that the couple inhabits providing added intimacy. There is one memorable long take of Naoko and Toru brisk walking back and forth in a remote grassland as they bring up the past ending with the former crying uncontrollably. It is a scene that intensifies the emotional fragility of Naoko foreshadowing more relational complications.Perhaps the most powerful scene comes in the final third  the visual juxtaposition of Toru's inconsolable grief to waves crashing into the shore as dark clouds loom above  which is accompanied by ominous music that makes us feel on edge. In competition for the Golden Lion at Venice Norwegian Wood has its fair share of detractors criticizing it as empty slow and emotionally vacant. However I feel that Tran's work deserves more praise and should be viewed not as a failed tearjerker but a calm meditation on the subject of sorrow and love.SCORE B 810 or 3.5 stars www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved.".

It is a scene that intensifies the emotional fragility of Naoko foreshadowing more relational complications.Perhaps the most powerful scene comes in the final third  the visual juxtaposition of Toru's inconsolable grief to waves crashing into the shore as dark clouds loom above  which is accompanied by ominous music that makes us feel on edge. In competition for the Golden Lion at Venice Norwegian Wood has its fair share of detractors criticizing it as empty slow and emotionally vacant. However I feel that Tran's work deserves more praise and should be viewed not as a failed tearjerker but a calm meditation on the subject of sorrow and love.SCORE B 810 or 3.5 stars www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved.";

Now it could have worked perfectly fine as a 2hour version if the director had chosen to present the story in a different way. But as it is now it's like watching the whole story from the book being fastforwarded while you get to see a few random scenes in it's entirety. Readers of the book will be disappointed because the characters feels too shallow and underdeveloped while general viewers will leave the cinemas with a big question mark. I won't begin to mention all those small bits of information in the film that are never explained unless you happened to have read the book.

Somehow the sex scenes was a larger snippet than the others impressed?Watching this movie was like watching a hell of a long trailer and the characters were reduced to the three basic denominators Naoko Toru and Midori. Everybody else is just blank background. The sad thing is in the final scene Reiko could be substituted with a mushroom and you would not see the difference. You don't see or know for nonnovel readers what the emotional sickness has done to her appearance and not knowing of her story she is another background like the sofa and the curtains.I am not sure who made this decision anh hung tran or whoever else. The story is shattered into bits and pieces but emphasis was put in all the wrong places. Scenes of Toru's life are just insignificant intersections to his next sex scene. The story is not only about a spaced out kid growing up but about the particular era he was living in how people around him had plans of their own in that era and how it seems he as such an ordinary person that he is has to make a living even though he had to think of Naoko constantly. Even if the director don't have this part of the story in mind could he have at the very very basic level make a comprehensive piece of story for the nonnovel readers? Why spend some 5 minutes on Kizuki's suicide when the details were not mentioned in the book and spoils the audiences' imagination and certainly the shock of his death? You could've spent that time on showing something else that is more crucial to the character development considering how little there are already.On an end note the scenes are beautiful and almost every 20 minutes of the film the audiences are treated with a beautiful scene. But that doesn't save the movie as a whole it is not just an ornamental vase to be looked at. So many characters are sacrificed for showing 10 minutes of splashing waves probably all filmed in one afternoon which doesn't explain or show how long Toru has actually been living his wasted life in solitude?If there is a 5 hour version for hell of it show the 5 hour version instead of this shattered piece of thing. I feel the movie is meant for those who have read the novel as the audience has to fill in most of the gaps so what about those who haven't read the novel? The movie gives the novel a bad name...".

	schema:reviewBody "Watched this in an effort to get into Murakami in an effort to actually read fictions. Absolutely loving it. Murakami's stories or at least this adaptation doesn't seem as messedup as I try to expect it to be. But then again I've watched Oldboy so everything else is tame in comparison.I haven't read the book but watching this film made me believe that everyone has their own struggles in the past and Tran Anh Hung succeeded in delivering it in such few shots especially for side characters such as Nagasawa Natsumi and Reiko.So I'm gonna go indepth on why I love each and every single character in this film and how are they so human.Nagasawa He's a great friend but we all can agree that he's a dick to Natsumi. He is almost too simple of a character until his final advice to Watanabe revealed something. He said Don't ever feel sorry for yourself only degenerates feel that way. It showed that he probably has battled with selfesteem issues in the past and he had come far to get to where he is right now. Was it family abuse? He's also very ambitious did he came out from poverty? Natsumi She loves Nagasawa so much almost unconditionally. It's the greatest feeling in the world also the worst. The moment she killed herself albeit being told in narrative was the most heartbreaking moment in the film for me.Midori Despite coming from a broken home she decides to stay optimistic. Flirtatious but respect the social contract of being in a relationship hence she only fully came out to Watanabe after she broke up and still wait for him to settle things with his other love interest.My favorite moment of Midori is when she talked about of her idea of love. She want to be pampered loved and protected it all sounded almost selfish. But I appreciate her honesty. She just don't want to be hurt again.Reiko She is portrayed as the mentor figure in the film especially with the sensei title. But all the while she was accompanying the couple I couldn't help but wonder how does she feels? She's a human being too a woman. She also deserves to have the feeling of companionship.I was partly relieved for the end scene with Watanabe. Though I genuinely panicked for him he promised to go back straight to Midori but he also shouldn't refuse Reiko as she too deserve happiness I was relieved that Reiko was given the chance to rediscover what she has long lost.Naoko We never really know what made her plunged too deep into depression and schizophrenia but we know that she was in a lot of pain. Too much pain. Unsure of her real feelings towards Kitsuki inability to really experience physical intimacy hopelessness not getting answers too much.I can't articulate enough on how I relate to her the most but I do.Kitsuko He's someone interesting. Very short airtime in the film but only towards the end we can sympathize what Kitsuki had to go through. One of it being unable to make Naoko happy? Watanabe He's the guy who has to take everything in from everyone in his life. Except during the time Kitsuko and later Naoko kill themselves he never showed much reaction. Naoko showed up after years of disappearance? Okay. Disappear again? Okay. Midori flirted with him and describing very visual sexual encounter? Okay. She got mad and cut contact with him? Okay. Nagasawa and Natsumi making the dinner uncomfortable? Okay. Reiko came back asking to sleep together? Okay. OMG WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE IN WATANABE'S LIFE.What I love most about him however is his overbearing sense of responsibility towards Naoko. Like what he told Midori even if hypothetically he doesn't love Naoko he still have to be with her. Poignant but beautiful.Well that's it. I'm grateful I watched this as there are too many things to take away from. Putting this into words so I will have a record on how I feel about the story before getting into the book!".

	schema:reviewBody "I can see that many fans of the book have reviewed this movie I will add to that list as I am a fan of the book and Murukami's writing in general. I would also like to add that I am a fan of Tran Anh Hung's work and feel that his movie Cyclo is the finest example of Vietnamese cinema to date. Now that leaves me in a difficult situation regarding his interpretation of Norwegian Wood and I have to emphasise his movie as an interpretation as he is a director who's work is very much characterised by his distinctive use of colours and camera angles and plot. And it is with this that I feel this movie fails in delivering fans and non fans alike with a satisfying visualisation of a brilliant story of young love and adulthood.Hung's direction is very much in keeping with his visual style with a powerful emphasis on the natural world and the austere beauty of the everyday. However I feel as though by emphasising on the surroundings the movie has forgotten that the story requires some time to develop. Hung's has an accomplished eye for shots and every scene in this movie could be free zed framed and shown in a gallery as a work of art but what this movie has in visual flair it lacks in story telling as very little is done to develop the plot even going so far to omit the pivotal opening scene in the novel of the protagonist on an air plane listening to Norwegian Wood through the air plane's sound system and then recounting his walk through the woods with Naoko. This scene alone is the crux of the novel and sets up the doomed love between the protagonist and Naoko yet it is strangely missing from the movie. Instead we have a flashback scene placed in the middle of the movie rendering this scene as irrelevant and confusing.Also I would have to agree with other critics here who felt that the character of Midori was grossly underwritten. Though I would go further to say that all of the characters are underwritten none of whom are given much characterisation leaving the already stifled script with an even more foreboding sense of incompleteness.Hung's direction was also a little misguided. What I felt the director was trying to convey was an inner sadness and yearning within all of the characters which is definitely keeping in tone with the novel but what he seemed to neglect was the energy of the characters. The sweeter moments that comes with youth like say meeting random girls in a bar or sharing a flat with an absolute psycho or waiting for someone you love to call you. These bittersweet moments were all in the novel yet were strangely omitted in the movie which seemed to dwell on the sexual aspects of youth yet not in anyway on the joys of youth.All in all this is an unsatisfying package and the sole reason is that the direction is not in keeping with the tone of the book. While I applaud the interpretation and the directors vision I feel that the movie failed to deliver a story with the same emotional highs as the novel. Tran Anh Hung was the wrong man for the job what he has created is an overly stylised guilt ridden reworking of what should have been a bittersweet coming of age romance story with a dose of tragedy.".

Hung's has an accomplished eye for shots and every scene in this movie could be free zed framed and shown in a gallery as a work of art but what this movie has in visual flair it lacks in story telling as very little is done to develop the plot even going so far to omit the pivotal opening scene in the novel of the protagonist on an air plane listening to Norwegian Wood through the air plane's sound system and then recounting his walk through the woods with Naoko. This scene alone is the crux of the novel and sets up the doomed love between the protagonist and Naoko yet it is strangely missing from the movie. Instead we have a flashback scene placed in the middle of the movie rendering this scene as irrelevant and confusing.Also I would have to agree with other critics here who felt that the character of Midori was grossly underwritten. Though I would go further to say that all of the characters are underwritten none of whom are given much characterisation leaving the already stifled script with an even more foreboding sense of incompleteness.Hung's direction was also a little misguided. What I felt the director was trying to convey was an inner sadness and yearning within all of the characters which is definitely keeping in tone with the novel but what he seemed to neglect was the energy of the characters. The sweeter moments that comes with youth like say meeting random girls in a bar or sharing a flat with an absolute psycho or waiting for someone you love to call you. These bittersweet moments were all in the novel yet were strangely omitted in the movie which seemed to dwell on the sexual aspects of youth yet not in anyway on the joys of youth.All in all this is an unsatisfying package and the sole reason is that the direction is not in keeping with the tone of the book. While I applaud the interpretation and the directors vision I feel that the movie failed to deliver a story with the same emotional highs as the novel. Tran Anh Hung was the wrong man for the job what he has created is an overly stylised guilt ridden reworking of what should have been a bittersweet coming of age romance story with a dose of tragedy.";

I disagree with the reviewer who said this movie requires someone who is appreciative of Murakami to truly understand and love it. I love Murakami and Norwegian Wood is one of my favourites and I hated this film without reservation. This adaptation is unbelievably uninteresting. The characters have no emotional appeal whatsoever. They are emotionally distant and unrewarding. The movie takes random episodes from the book and strings them together with no sense of a cohesive theme  no understanding of why the episodes are meaningful or how they relate to each other why we are on this journey. The episodic nature of the film kills any interest in the story. And for a writer who relies so much on music to create a sense of mood time and place this movie is strangely devoid of music for much of the time. I was literally begging for some music to play if only to distract me from the mess unfolding on the screen. I guess I have technically disqualified myself from the right to review this film by walking out but I really could not take any more. I regard this as a travesty against the book. Adapting a book is not simply an exercise in selecting scenes from the book and stringing them together. It's an exercise in understanding the soul of the book and rendering that in a meaningful cinematic way. This fails on all levels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Norwegian Wood is dreary unfocused and unreasonably slowpaced. It involves characters so dour and unlikeable that investing in them takes nothing less than sheer will power. They each find themselves in relationships so emotionally complicated that never once do we see a process of connection at work we can only marvel at the fact that these people have somehow found their way into each other's lives. Not only do we not understand their reasons for being together but on the basis of what unfolds no one is the better for it. Here is a coming of age drama so confused and needlessly drawn out that we're anxious for the moment when the hero finally grows up  which in this case has nothing to do with witnessing a beautiful act of transition and everything to do with ending two miserable hours sitting in a theater.Adapted from the novel by Haruki Murakamki the film has been structured by writerdirector Tran Anh Hung in the most curious of ways namely to make every single scene play like the finale. When you have a movie filled with ends you will inevitably invite speculation as to how it all began and it's incredibly unfair to deprive audiences of answers. Some scenes are just plain awkward in their length pacing and exploration of characters that have no bearing on the central plot. It's almost as if clips from an entirely different movie had been randomly spliced in by editor Mario Battistel perhaps because he was feeling a bit mischievous and wanted to get audiences off of what narrow a trail there was to follow. If that was his intention he succeeded. This story leads us nowhere in particular except in circles.It takes place in Japan during the late 1960s the era of the Vietnam War and a time of great social unrest. You'd think that given this rich history the filmmakers would actually make it a part of the plot. But no  history is reduced to a handful of brief shots all of disorganized student protests that immediately fade into the background. Because it's barely a backdrop for a soapy story of love and loss this movie could have taken place anywhere at any time. It's told from the point of view of nineteenyearold Toru Watanabe Ken'ichi Matsuyama who moves to Tokyo and enters college following the inexplicable suicide of his best friend since childhood Kizuki Kengo Kora. Why this is left unexplained I have no idea. I for one would have appreciated knowing what made Kizuki so unhappy that he felt the need to poison himself with exhaust from his own car.Toru forms a relationship of sorts with Kizuki's girlfriend Naoko Rinko Kikuchi who also knew him since childhood. Ever since his death she has not only fallen into a deep depression she has also lost all traces of her sexuality. She will make repeated attempts to find it throughout the movie at first by submitting herself to Toru on the night of her twentieth birthday the rest of the time through sexual advances she initiates. Alas it's to no avail she's incapable of feeling anything physically while emotionally she retreats further into herself. Her mental state has landed her in a sanitarium buried in the forested mountains of Kyoto. I use the word sanitarium loosely as it isn't made to seem like one. If anything it comes off as a spiritual retreat for the musically inclined.Toru occasionally visits Naoko and will even exchange letters with her. He might even have feelings for her although you'd never know it by looking at him as Toru Matsuyama gives a performance so statuesque and softspoken that never once does an emotion leap off the screen. Regardless Toru finds himself torn between Naoko and one of his classmates a young woman named Midori Kiko Mizuhara equally as soft spoken but far more outgoing. At times she's developed to the point of oddness and if you watch the scene where she calls Toru after the death of her father you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The worst thing about this character is that her interest in Toru stems from nothing made clear to the audience she like everyone else in this movie has no clear purpose apart from being doing and saying miserable things.In spite of the characters the plot the structure and the performances a connection still might have been possible had it not been for the horrendous soundtrack. On the one hand we have samples of sleepinducing folk rock hits of the era including the Beatles song the film derives its title from. On the other hand we have Jonny Greenwood's score which is comprised of depressing and emotionally manipulative violin dirges. Most of it plays during the latter half of the movie at which point the story goes from solemn to outright devastating. Listening to both the score and the songs one wonders if anyone involved in the film has ever laughed or even knows what laughing is. For films like Norwegian Wood joy and happiness are treated as foreign concepts that get lost in translation. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

It is different story in the movie. It seems that emotionless Toru and awkward Reiko decided to give Naoko even SADDER funeral Reiko sang while Toru sat there with his mind in God knows where they indeed had sex but instead of joking and laughing Reiko broke into tears given that the director didn't give any p explaining of Reiko's past prior to this scene this is simply unforgivable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in 1960s Japan Norwegian Wood is a film about depression loss and sexuality. After his best friend Kizuki commits suicide aged 17 Watanabe Kenichi Matsuyama moves to Tokyo and enrols at University in an attempt to escape the depressing nature of his home town. By chance one day he meets his dead friend's exgirlfriend Naoko Rinko Kikuchi and the two begin a loving but strained relationship. Naoko has never truly got over the death of Kizuki and one day disappears eventually turning up in a sanatorium deep in the forest. Watanabe tries to maintain both a friendly and sexual relationship with the depressed Naoko but this is made difficult by her mental state and the introduction of the outgoing and self confident Midori Kiko Mizuhara who vies for Watanabe's affections.The film features some quite stunning cinematography and beautifully shot landscapes. This was great because the actual story was quite depressing and boring. I never really got on board with any of the characters and felt distanced from them. Watanabe is a man who is deeply in love and trying to do the right thing but at the same time living through a sexually adventurous age and wants to have something from both worlds. Naoko was a very loving but deeply disturbed character and the two of them spent most of the film staring into nothingness or out across beautiful vistas. It kind of felt like a two hour long perfume advert. Another thing it reminded me of is the sort of French tragicdramas that go down so well with critics but are seen by about six people all of whom hate it. I think you have to get on board fairly early on with this film and I just didn't.Along with the fantastic cinematography the film also features some great progrock and psychedelic music from the period which works really well. The score is also excellent and was composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. The great Beatles song Norwegian Wood from which the source material got its name is also used.On the whole the film is incredibly beautiful but feels allusive and distant.

	schema:headline " Same faults as the book";
	schema:reviewBody "I have a feeling I am in a minority of 1 when I admit I read Norwegian Wood and hated it. I got dragged along to see the movie version as my wife unfortunately did enjoy the book and insisted on seeing it despite having watched the uninspiring trailer online. The book is a poorly written or if you're feeling generous badly translated into English misogynistic wouldbe Japanese answer to The Catcher in the Rye with a cast of characters far too good looking and vomitenducingly cool to be as miserable as they are. A lot of fans of the book seem to be complaining that the movie was not long enough to fit in all aspects of the novel. This is nonsense as it is actually very faithful to the original and you can't expect any adaptation to cover every sentence. The film is in fact over long as they drag out the tedious conversations mainly revolving around handjobs can I say that on IMDb?. If any of the characters' motivations are not clear enough then that is the fault of the original source material not the movie. The only large chunk of the story they left out was Reiko's reason for being in the sanatorium which was the most outrageously unbelievable and puerile plot line in the novel giving the infantile novelist the chance to imagine himself having sex with a middle aged lesbian as he'd already had his way with every other female character in the book. The film makers obviously realised this and left it out on purpose. The cinematography is not as wonderful as others have stated. The actor playing Watanabe is wooden and unsympathetic so does a good job translating the character from page to screen as is love interest number 2 Midori. Love interest number 1 Naoko goes from smirking and simpering to hysterics in alarming leaps on cue from the director. I won't go on as my dislike of the novel probably means I'm not the most balanced reviewer suffice to say it was unlikeable slow and empty.".

I got dragged along to see the movie version as my wife unfortunately did enjoy the book and insisted on seeing it despite having watched the uninspiring trailer online. The book is a poorly written or if you're feeling generous badly translated into English misogynistic wouldbe Japanese answer to The Catcher in the Rye with a cast of characters far too good looking and vomitenducingly cool to be as miserable as they are. A lot of fans of the book seem to be complaining that the movie was not long enough to fit in all aspects of the novel. This is nonsense as it is actually very faithful to the original and you can't expect any adaptation to cover every sentence. The film is in fact over long as they drag out the tedious conversations mainly revolving around handjobs can I say that on IMDb?. If any of the characters' motivations are not clear enough then that is the fault of the original source material not the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I guess I've been waiting so long I'm looking for perfection. That makes it tough.Waiting for perfect love?No even I know better than that. I'm looking for selfishness. Perfect selfishness. Like say I tell you I want to eat strawberry shortcake. And you stop everything you're doing and run out and buy it for me. And you come back out of breath and get down on your knees and hold this strawberry shortcake out to me. And I say I don't want it anymore and throw it out the window. That's what I'm looking for.I'm not sure that has anything to do with love I said with some amazement.It does she said. You just don't know it. There are times in a girl's life when things like that are incredibly important.It's best to see that scene within the correct context. At the beginning of the movie you have major student protests confrontations between faculty and students over the relevance of Greek literature to political lifenot seeing anything that isn't immediately personally relevant as relevant at all. The book then presumably takes place in '68 and I think should be taken as an exploration of that massive event. The political upheaval the sexual liberation and libertinism the conflict between traditional and modern values the sense of alienation the narcissism of Midori. As you know second wave feminism was born from the 60s in one of the early conversations I had with my girlfriend not yet a girlfriend I asked her if she knew what feminism is and she responded it says that women should be better than men. I laughed quite shocked.I think this is the proper context and way to read the scene1960s narcissism. In this sense the movie is a very typical perhaps even ubiquitous exploration and critique in Japanese cinema between tradition and cultural change. You know that the title Norwegian Wood is taken from a 1965 Beatles song.Where Toru's relationship to Naoko seems to represent tradition by way of his virtuous sense of obligation Toru's relationship to Midori is much more modern. First Midori is definitely much more dynamic aggressive forward than Naoko Midori is something of a modern Japanese young woman trying to find her way. And second and more obviously the relationship between Toru and Midori comes at the end of a spate of Toru's womanizing. Reinforcing these themes is the subplot between Nagasawa and HatsumiHatsumi ultimately committing suicide because of the infidelity and coldness of Nagasawa whom she loves. So on the surface Naoko represents tradition which ultimately becomes schizophrenic and commits suicide and Midori represents the vitality although uncertain of the future.But note that Midori redeems herself by waiting for and ultimately forgiving Toru for rejecting her in favor of his traditionally Japanese obligation toward Naoko this ushers in a new beginning on the note of which the film ends. How to account for the capitulation of the narcissistic ethosin the name of love? Read at a deeper level Naoko rather than Midori is the true exemplification of uncompromising narcissism.First note that one of the central plot elements at least in the film is that Naoko can't have intercourse because her vagina can't get wet. She never had it with Kizuki whom she insisted on several occasions to have genuinely loved she had it only once with Toru. Ultimately this incapacity for sexual intimacy is a significant contributor to her madness. But when is the one time when she can get wet when she has intercourse with Toru? It's prior to her commitment to Toru it is prior to the commitment to genuine emotional engagement. The only time that she is capable of vaginal wetness is in the fulfillment of bodily pleasure in the absence of emotional bond to the Other in a situation where she does not wither in selfconsciousness in the gaze of the Other narcissism sine qua non. Ultimately her incapacity for physical intimacy is inextricably linked to her madness her incapacity for physical intimacy mirrors her simultaneous rejection of relationships with otherswith her hyperreflexivity constantly talking about herself driving herself mad with thoughts about her own self and own feelings etc.and ultimate suicide.Here we are starting to see most clearly the focus on the thematic of alienationof separation of person from person of personal isolationthat is one of the major subjects of the film whether through sexuality through madness or in extreme conceptions of love. Midori although appearing to be a real piece of work after her dialogue about love forgives Toru so we should be inclined to forgive her. She is a young woman who struggles with contrary conceptions of self but unlike Naoko who uncontrollably spirals into herself escapes into the fantasmal past and toward suicide she ultimately compromises with her emotions and indeed her stated ideal of loveand in a rather conservative conclusion fulfills the classical motif of the woman faithfully waiting for her man while he is away on a personal journey seen first in Odysseus and recapitulated throughout the Western literary patriarchy.Does not then Midori in fact fulfill a traditional female role or at least move toward it in a modern way whereas Naoko is the one who exemplifies inflexibility and the descent into the self and selfdestruction? Midori shows herself as a maturing young woman originally with flawed views and an egregious and possibly insulting stated worldview but who ultimately compromises her own narcissism for her love of Toru even as she claims not to understand Toru's commitment to Naoko. Like in Pulp Fiction the vision of the film points toward the future rather than the past but it simultaneously recognizes the logic of the traditional past without inflexibly adhering to itas when Butch cuts down The Gimp and incapacitates Zed with a samurai sword but rides away on a motorcycle.".
