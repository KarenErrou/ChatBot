Well I'm not saying it's a typical American in your face comedy but it sure is funny to me.Some complaints Evan Rachel Wood is not really that great of an actress yet. Of course she's talented but I mean...she was talented four years ago. Now I'm like...when is she finally gonna deliver. To be fair I haven't seen all of her movies so maybe I should check out some other ones before spewing criticism.Also King Of California is one of those movies that left me feeling indifferent. That's not a flaw it's just the kind of movie KOC is.

The combination of Alexander Payne SidewaysElectionAbout Schmidt producing and Michael Douglas playing wacky gives hope for another great dramedy along the lines of Little Miss Sunsine and Sideways. King of California easily meets those hopes and for many it will be much more enjoyable then those former films. The movie features Douglas as Charlie a recently released mental patient with a whimsical fascination for buried Spanish treasure. While Charlie has been away his 16 year old daughter Miranda played by Evan Racheal Wood has managed to avoid child services dropped out of school and support herself and their home by working fulltime at Mcdonalds. Upon Charlies arrival home Miranda finds that life was much easier without Charlie around not only does she have to support their home but now she has to take care of her unstable father. Persitent with his intent to search for a mythical buried Spanish treasure Miranda begrudgingly agrees to help him. The movie finds its humor and warmth in the moments shared between Charlie and Miranda during their treasure hunting through developed suburbia that leads them to a unlikely final destination. In the end the real treasure may not be the gold after all but the love between a daughter and father.The ever developing Evan Racheal Wood is solid in the role of Miranda the whole movie develops through her narration and her acting is effortlessly touching. Michael Douglas is outstanding and in true form here from start to finish he's a joy to watch this is easily his best performance since Wonder Boys. This will definitely be one of the best movies in 2007 expect praise a plenty for Douglas come awards time.".

She is world weary and bitter at never having a proper childhood and having to be the adult in the relationship.Eventually Charlie convinces her of the validity of the buried treasure and there is a bonding as they search for the lost treasure that leads them to the depths of a local Costco warehouse.The performances are great.

His life as a jazz bassist and entrepreneur has always veered off the map leaving him alone with his only daughter Miranda who has survived her father's irresponsible life by keeping the old family home in the midst of a huge housing development with the money she makes double shifting at the local MacDonalds. When Charlie is released his focus is on discovering the gold left behind by Catholic priests in the mid 1600s a fact he has researched while hospitalized on the Internet and from the journal of one of the priests. Miranda slowly buys into Charlie's madcap scheme and adventure as a gold hunter and the caper results in a bonding between father and daughter that has been teetering on the brink of disaster for years. The manner in which Charlie Miranda and an old excon friend Pepper Willis Burks II go after the treasure provides most of the energy of the film.Yes there are bits and pieces of this project that have been done many times before and often better but the pleasure of KING OF California lies in the bravura and touching performances by Douglas and Wood.

	schema:headline " A very slow moving movie featuring superb acting from Douglas.";
	schema:reviewBody "King Of California is the art house version of National Treasure or Indiana Jones. It's the story of Charlie Michael Douglas who is released from the mental institution in which he has spent several years and is reunited with his sixteen year old daughter Miranda Evan Rachel Wood. Although he is obviously a few sandwiches short of a picnic Charlie manages to convince his daughter to join him in a quest for buried treasure. Together they move through Southern California looking for clues leading to the lost doubloons.If after reading that description of the plot you're now expecting these two characters to run through dark tunnels with giant boulders rolling after them then you'd be wrong. King Of California is a slow and very quiet movie which focuses more on Charlie and Miranda repairing their relationship than the actual treasure hunt. Miranda has been forced to take a job at McDonalds in order to survive during her father's absence meaning that she is now the rational one whilst Charlie acts as a child. Their search for the treasure takes them to golf courses and busy stores where Charlie sees signs that they're on the right trail whilst Miranda not fully believing in Charlie's dream simply wants to spend some time with the father she's lost touch with.Douglas gives one of his finest performances in recent years as Charlie managing to make the character seem insane whilst also being totally appealing witness the way in which he wins arguments by stating absurd facts and telling people to look it up. Evan Rachel Wood is also perfect in her role. It may not be as showy a role as Douglas' but Wood convinces you that Miranda absolutely loves her father despite all his faults and he certainly has a lot.Although I liked King Of California I really can't say that I loved it  the plot was perhaps a little too slow moving for my tastes. I certainly admired its message however that you should follow your dreams because dreams give you something to believe in. If you have patience and like characterdriven movies which reveal their charms at a very leisurely pace such as the movies Sideways or Rushmore then I'd recommend watching King Of California for its superb acting and lifeaffirming message. Others  like myself  however who prefer story lines to move along at a much quicker rate may find it a bit boring in places and slightly too whimsical overall.".

It's the story of Charlie Michael Douglas who is released from the mental institution in which he has spent several years and is reunited with his sixteen year old daughter Miranda Evan Rachel Wood.

I think this movie is also saying something about people who live by the beat of a different drummer like Charlie. They live their lives differently then most people. You don't necessarily have to work a 95 job to work. He says he isn't looking for the treasure for the money and she said something like you would if you had to work and his reply is that it depends on what you consider work. There are a lot of subtle things in this movie that you don't get unless you watch it and listen intently. You probably have to watch it more than once. There is a part near the end when Charlie says something about the passageway is suppose to be 40 bars120ft down. If there is a passageway it must lead to someplace where he was probably headed when he dove in the second time.".

There's the young actress Evan Rachel Wood who also deserves some credits as the patient and caring daughter to his father Charlie. The director also deserves some creds. He made an awesome film with the most perfect cast and a touching yet heartbreaking ending. I suggest you go see it now.";

And Charlie has a plan to find the treasure Father Torres hid in the 1600s. Miranda is no longer comfortable. Normally I run to a Michael Douglas movie and I ran to this one too but now that I have seen it I wonder what all the running was about. There is something very wrong in this movie and I am not sure I know what it is. The narration by Miranda didn't bother me. It filled in gaps. Some of the narration was almost funny. The best line was by Miranda and went something like this I never felt comfortable when he was around. I always felt something was about to happen. The movie shows that she did love her father questionable as he was but she looked after him like a mother would watch her child running close to sharp cornered tables. I too felt something was about to happen except it never did. Charlie was running around like a drunken sailor and seemingly lined up with pointy edged tables but his head never veered into those edges. He just kept running from one point on the map to another one to find that treasure. Miranda was frustrated and so was I.I just figured out what is wrong with this movie. It was a 2man act Charlie and Miranda. It needed to be more than that more interaction with others more dialogue There was some but not enough for me. Charlie bounced around so much it was hard to like him despite a twinkle in his eye and his easygoing constitution. He was incomplete as was the movie. I felt for Miranda but not Charlie. The character Douglas played couldn't sustain a movie lead. He was like a monkey running from one found banana to another. We liked Charlie but we weren't sure what he liked and yes we were wary of him too. We wanted Charlie to be more of a human soul to be somewhat normal. Well that wasn't going to happen and we were shut out. But somewhat normal could have worked too in looking for the treasure. Audiences like it when the characters look for a treasure. Here we didn't care if it was found. The movie told us the journey was more important than the destination. Did the movie save itself? I think so even with the poor ending. Okay really bad ending. But the next time I will walk not run to a Michael Douglas movie maybe read the box next time ask a few friends read some reviews..slow walking the whole time. ViolenceNo Sex No NudityNo Language Yes and I didn't see any need for it in this comedy.".

Her young life skipped over any fun years and immediately entered the survival mode in which many lowwage adult workers live because of a lack of education or opportunity due to absentee parents or the socioeconomic situation of their family. Enter her mentally ill quirky father who at first she sees as just another burden. Over time she realizes he is a sincere idealist struggling desperately to make up for his past mistakes. Her love brings a reluctant willingness to humor him and join in his quixotic search and ends with an eyeopening realization about her father life and the nature of idealism.

Let us go back to a small scene in which her father had given her her own credit card in her name. Why would he do that you suppose? The methodology was simplistic and brilliant at the same time and was most likely overlooked by many viewers. The heart wrenching scene at the near end of the father tying her to the soda machines and telling her how important she was and what she meant to him was beautiful. Then we see him cautiously running from rack to rack with a small plastic container empty at first then heavy and rattling on the way back. Then he dives back into the hole to go after the rest of the gold. This is where most people have trouble. First the rushing water. Rushing water is moving water and therefore has to empty out somewhere. It just doesn't stop. After realizing he cannot go back the way he came he follows the flow of water and comes to a light ahead but it is too narrow and he cannot cross it with his tanks. He removes them and swims up. Remember the dream of the naked Chinese men? What does his daughter come across on the beach? What empties into the ocean? He lives. The director leaves the outcome up to interpretation but I must believe that he lives given the small clues and the character's ability to see the outcome.".

Nothing that's what!If you are looking for an intellectual thriller I have a feeling Komodo is not your cup of tea.

	schema:headline " With a little work this should've been a theatrical release";
	schema:reviewBody "First off let me say one thing... B horror and drama are the only two genres that really don't mix at all.  That said Komodo one of the few films to actually try to combine those two genres isn't all that bad of a movie. The special effects are in fact pretty impressive for a straight to video cheesefest and the cinematography is definitely worth noting. The cinematographer somehow made Komodo look like a big budget studio piece with some very inventive camera angles and my favorite... a LOT of movement. I don't know why... I'm just a fan of camera movement.The acting though it wasn't great was decidedly above average for a film such as this. Jill Hennessy star of TV's Law and Order put forth a decent performance but her... errr... assets seemed to have a lot more screen presence than she ever will. Kevin Zegers one of the most talented actors of his generation showed little of that talent here sleep walking through his role with ease. The remainder of the supporting cast was average with the exception of Patrick's grandmother I think who was just begging to be eaten. Remember that one moment in Deep Blue Sea when Samuel L Jackson got chomped up by the shark? Remember how you felt when that happened? Were you cheering? I thought so. That's exactly how you'll feel when she gets swallowed whole by the Komodo Dragon cue cheesy Dum Dum Dum sound and trust me you'll be wondering why Jill Hennessy even bothers to try to save her. And thankfully it's in the film's first twenty minutes.Well all that said the movie did have it's share of problems and then some. First off THERE WAS NO CLIMAX!The biggest one however was the movie's tremendous lack of focus. Many movies do have trouble focusing but never has that been more evident than in Komodo. First off the movie can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a Jurassic Parkesque sci fi horror flick which it hints at in a few scenes a Carnosauresque Jurassic Park rip off which it also hints at or a full fledged character studydrama which I actually wish it had turned into and also... yea you guessed it... hints at that. It had the promise starting off a subplot where Jill Hennessy's character has to crack through the veritable shell Kevin Zegers has created around himself shielding him from reality. But alas that subplot was thrown out halfway through the movie the main plot with the killer lizards taking over.Secondly the movie doesn't want to decide on who the main character is. It starts off with the focus on Kevin Zegers shifting to Jill Hennessy back to Zegers then staying on the two for a while. Then about an hour through Zegers is completely forgotten about for over twenty minutes not a second on screen during that time until the end where he's brought back for some reason. If you're gonna have a main character you can't throw them off to the side?I made my own Jurassic Park rip off well technically it was a spoof a couple of years ago titled Catastrophe Jurassic Park With Cats and I did the same thing. That was before I knew anything about filmmaking. Now that I do I watch a Hollywood film like Komodo do the same thing and I'm blown away. Have these people even gone to film school?Bottom line Komodo is an entertaining B flick but little else. But hey if the considerably worse Bats made it to theaters why didn't this?".

	schema:headline " Would've been fine with an imposing monster";
	schema:reviewBody "Komodo isn't that bad but could've been a little better.SPOILERSYears after a mysterious massacre psychiatrist Victoria Jill Hennessy brings traumatized soulsurvivor Patrick Connally Kevin Zegers back to the small island where his parents were killed. Bringing his Aunt Annie Nina Landis along with her to help him recover from the incident. Although initial attempts to get through fail she feels she's near a breakthrough when they're attacked by giant Komodo Dragons. Attempting to get away they seek shelter with oil workers Bracken Simon Westaway Oates Billy Burke and Denby Paul Gleeson who work on the island. Realizing that the Komodo's are here as a result of an accident years ago and are covering up their existence on the island they all try to survive the creatures and help him overcome his fear of the island.The Good News This isn't all that bad of a creature feature. This is thankfully one of the better explanations for the creature's increased aggression. Rather than simply being normal creatures blown up to insane sizes through genetic testing that also made them crave meat this one simply has them become hungry due to lack of natural food and the characters show up on the island at the worst time possible forcing them to go after the only food source. It works from a nature standpoint as this has happened where lack of food has made creatures savage and feral adding credibility to the film while also not sounding like every other flick out there in the genre. The pacing isn't all that bad and even though there's no real standout action sequence or one happening every five minutes this still manages to remain watchable. There's no real downtime devoted to needless exposition or useless scenes that deeper define characters that don't mean anything. The attacks what few are shown onscreen aren't that bad and actually come off pretty good most notably the initial house encounter. The appearance of the creature that early in the film is a nice shock the attempts to get away are pretty suspenseful and the payoff is quite rewarding and really works. The highway escape has some spooky moments and the final showdown is still modest and lowkey just like the film. The best scene is the encounter in the tunnels which is full of action and features a lot of great moments. From the nice touch of the creature's step breaking away part of the floor to the trap set for it to the lucky break needed to escape the threat it's a really fantastic sequence that throws in a great jump and plenty of action into the mix. The last part that works for the film is it's creatures. When they're not CGIcreated and actually are depicted by models they look great. There's a sense of them actually being there they look closeenough for realism sake and move like real ones. All together this one isn't that bad.The Bad News This here did have a few problems with it. The biggest problem is that there's no real blood or gore in here. This is mostly determined by it's weak rating which really results in harming the film more than anything. This robs the creatures of their menace relegating most of their attacks to happen offscreen away from showing the viciousness that is shown when they pop back up onscreen. The attacks are pretty brutalappearing yet there's only a couple attacks that are shown. There's very little blood at all and more appears on the creatureaftermath than through the human victims and that really lowers their threatlevel if they don't vigorously tear into prey. The other problem which really haunts most creature features is the use of CGI to render the creatures. Despite the mix of the reallife puppets in several scenes the times where the CGI creature comes into play are painfully obvious. The activity is far too exaggerated for living creatures they don't blend in naturally and have an air of fakeness around them. These here are it's main flaws.The Final Verdict While there's a few flaws this one still has enough good points to make it a great recommendation for creature feature fans. Give it a chance if you're a fan of these films or those curious though if you're a gorehound then at least seek caution with this one.Rated PG13 Violence mild Language and creature violence".

For all of you out there that want to get your Creature kicks see this flick as soon as it hits you theater. Kudos to all the filmmakers.  Great first time direction by Lantieri.

	schema:reviewBody "Not a bad direct to tape creature feature.  Too bad Michael Lantieri didn't have a bigger budget to play with because as much as I liked Komodo I think it still had a lot of potential.  Need more proof?  Anaconda wasn't much more and that film raked it in at the box office.The set up is standard and the characters are pretty much off the self but I found the film to be entertaining nevertheless. My only complaints with Komodo are that the animals looked pretty fake in certain scenes hey Michael I know the budget was small but couldn't you have called in some favors from the people you won Oscars for Jurassic Park with? Also I could've done without the afternoon soap opera music.  This is supposed to be a thriller not Steel Magnolias.  On the upside this film had it's share of scares.  I jumped more while watching this movie than I did watching Blair Witch 2 which may not seem to be saying much but you get the idea.  Also contrary to other comments posted I think Kevin Zegers Patrick did a fine job with the role.  No he didn't talk much which was a little bit of a let down but then again the role didn't call for a lot of dialogue.  He looks to have a lot of potential and I think we'll be seeing a lot more from him in the future. The box art for Komodo touts Lantieri's association with Jurassic Park and watching the movie the similarities become clear.  There are much worse ways to spend 90 minutes and movies with much larger budgets that are still a few notches below this one.  Komodo may be mindless but it's mindless fun.My grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "To me Komodo is fun. Partly because I am a real sucker when it comes to movies like this and partly because this one in particular was assembled by a cast and crew composed of concerned individuals. It not only stands over but towers above many of its kin some of which are also about large flesheating lizards from Indonesia with higher production values a mostly excellent cast and more of the creative magic that we love the movies for. Now I admit it does not appeal to all in fact very few but I cannot deny the fact that I liked it. And I really don't see it as that much of a guilty pleasure.Now the setup of how a colony of tenfootlong Komodo dragon lizards end up on a North Carolina island is an eyeroller but the rest of the plot's fabrications are welcoming in their effort and imagination. You see the lizards massacre a vacationing family on the island leaving only their teenage son Kevin Zegers alive. When he is suspected of having suffered a mental breakdown having witnessed his parents being torn to shreds in a surprisingly effective opening sequence that relies on our imagination to fill in the gaps he is escorted back to the island in an effort to discover the truth by his aunt Nina Landis and a devoted psychiatrist.The shrink is played by the lovely and talented and underrated Jill Hennessy of Law  Order fame and it is her performance's conviction and the sureminded dialogue she is given in the screenplay by Hans Bauer and Craig Mitchell that formulates one of the best elements of the movie. Does the picture go into a big psychological character study of her or anybody else? No. But what it does is create some likable individuals whom we might actually end up caring about when they confront the lizards. There is also a very interesting subplot involving a biologistturnedmercenary very wellplayed by Billy Burke who is suspected of murdering his wife when the real culprits are guess who? There's also a very likable character a trustworthy and noble boatman also wellplayed by Michael EdwardStevens. With the exception of the snarling nasalvoiced oil company executive I found conviction and interesting dynamics in the monster movie way from these characters.I think the key to Komodo's success with me was that unlike many of its fellow creature features it was put together by a director who had a clue of what he was doing. Is not a coincidence that the movie has good special effects when its director Michael Lantieri was the special effects supervisor of pictures such as Jurassic Park and therefore had connections with fellow animator Phil Tippett's special effects studio? The titular Komodo lizards are very wellrealized via a combination of lifesized animatronics and some very detailed computer graphics. Not only that but the filmmakers take care in giving us the illusion that the big carnivores are really there by having them nudge bump and knock things around in the sets. There's a marvelous and exciting sequence where one of the big lizards shows up unexpectedly in the house bursts through a pair of doors that two characters are hiding behind and knocks over a table stacked with items using its head. The coordination and efficiency makes this sequence and many others work out extremely well.Also worthy of praise is the imaginative technicallyrich camera work by David Burr he makes great use of crane and dolly shots whereas many creature features resort to tired old handheld and lockeddown shots and a wonderful earworm musical score by Academy Awardnominee John Debney. They work well with Mr. Lantieri who had not made a picture before this one and unfortunately not one since and bump the movie's production values up several notches above what we would usually expect from a movie simply titled Komodo. Now you do have your moments of loony dialogue and again I really wished that they had eradicated the physical presence of the greedy oil exec and instantly implied him rather than show him but overall the screenplay for Komodo also shows some promising creativity. The whole movie does. Even its detractors have to admit that the movie is a whole tier above its contemporaries and I think for people going in with the right state of mind will be very fun.

I remembered it being laughable but here again I didn't remember anything about the actual movie so I was not that excited about rewatching it but I felt like I could get a good laugh at it in any case. Well I didn't laugh one bit! In fact I was very pleased with how this movie turned out! As it started off I was immediately entertained. The plot was as thin as paper and the characters became questionable at times but overall this movie was very satisfying and not bad at all. The performances were surprisingly over average! I could watch an hour and a half of Kevin Zegers laying in the floor reading the newspaper or something like that anyway for he is a fantastic actor and is not bad to look at at all. The main girl did astonishingly well too She made her lines and character believable and though of course this movie isn't a masterpiece it turned out to be way more than I thought it would be.The special effects were surprisingly really good as well I mean for a BMovie. This film obviously wasn't given a high budget and job well done with the special effects for such a small amount of money! Overall I actually even think a 3.7 is too low of a rating! There are a lot worse films than Komodo for this was not bad at all and is even worth a second watch! Great opening act pleasing performances nice special effects but a plot that is so dull it's see through and around the end felt rushed and a little mediocre. Still I enjoyed this film and recommend it if you can appreciate it for what it is.".

This movie is full of awesome special effects and several set pieces that WILL make you jump most definitely. The FX team seamlessly blended Phil Tippett's CGI Studio's work with animatronics to create a truly creepy and genuinely scary horror film. Sure the characters and script aren't Oscar material but if you're in the mood for a good horror film that'll make you perch on the edge of your seat in anxiety then Komodo is the perfect rental for a Saturday night alone...at home...in the dark.".

This movie is full of awesome special effects and several set pieces that WILL make you jump most definitely. The FX team seamlessly blended Phil Tippett's CGI Studio's work with animatronics to create a truly creepy and genuinely scary horror film. Sure the characters and script aren't Oscar material but if you're in the mood for a good horror film that'll make you perch on the edge of your seat in anxiety then Komodo is the perfect rental for a Saturday night alone...at home...in the dark.";

The script by Hans Bauer  Craig Mitchell treads the same worn path that these types of films do the isolated location the monster threat the hero the one who gets separated from the group  the other's insist on finding them the rich uncaring businessmen who are only bothered about money  various unlikely coincidences the only two vehicles on the island just happen to crash into each other? that leave our group of survivors in peril. Komodo moves along at a fair pace although thinking about it now not much really happened only three people die during the bulk of the film  it has relatively low ambitions as a spectacle. I don't understand why these Komodo's are so big nothing is ever mentioned  in fact Oates who also happens to be a biologist a complete co incidence of course claims they are just an endangered species. I've never know lizards that big. Also why does the oil company want to secretly kill these lizards? It's claimed because they don't want bad publicity which is fine but if their that concerned about publicity why not capture them  relocate them somewhere safe? Surely that would bring massive amounts of free positive publicity I mean an oil company caring for the environment right? The character's are paper thin  you can spot the ones who are going to die a mile off.Director Lantieri brings a degree of competence to the film but not much else. It has no real style tension or excitement. Having said that the Komodo CGI effects are surprisingly very good these don't look too far behind the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park 1993. The attack scenes aren't that great as the Komodo's walk so slowly most people could probably outwalk them. Forget about any blood or gore just a couple of Komodo bites.Technically Komodo is alright with a budget of about 15000000 Australian Dollars it's a nice looking film  well made. The beautiful Australian locations are the films one real highlight. The acting was OK but nothing outstanding.Komodo is an OK time waster but it brings nothing new to the monster on the loose sub genre that Jurassic Park didn't over six years prior. Just about worth watching if your desperate or if there's nothing else on.".

	schema:headline " A fascinating film with wonderful touching moments";
	schema:reviewBody "Poverty Charity and Obedience are extremely difficult... Detachment from family and friends is difficult... Detachment from things and memories is much more difficult...Silence detachment and mortification are the conditions of prayer and the negative aspect of a nun's spirituality while prayer and union with God are its positive aspects... To be firm prayer must be built on profound humility...Gabrielle Van der Mal is a morally powerful girl who wants from all her heart to be obedient to the bells of the congregation... She perfectly knows that her personal wishes come to an end when she enters that door... Her loving father remembers her 'If you ever decide this is not right for you there's no sense of failure coming back home.' The film's first part focuses on the making of a Catholic nun as it follows the young Belgian girl from the time she takes leave of her dispirited father to enter the rigorous Roman Catholic order until her appearance as an experienced nursing nun hopeful of following the medical vocation of her famous surgeon father...The story then moves to the Congo where God selects his moment to offer the most perfect alliance with each individual soul...

Detachment from things and memories is much more difficult...Silence detachment and mortification are the conditions of prayer and the negative aspect of a nun's spirituality while prayer and union with God are its positive aspects... To be firm prayer must be built on profound humility...Gabrielle Van der Mal is a morally powerful girl who wants from all her heart to be obedient to the bells of the congregation... She perfectly knows that her personal wishes come to an end when she enters that door... Her loving father remembers her 'If you ever decide this is not right for you there's no sense of failure coming back home.' The film's first part focuses on the making of a Catholic nun as it follows the young Belgian girl from the time she takes leave of her dispirited father to enter the rigorous Roman Catholic order until her appearance as an experienced nursing nun hopeful of following the medical vocation of her famous surgeon father...The story then moves to the Congo where God selects his moment to offer the most perfect alliance with each individual soul...

I thought fans of this film agruably Miss Hepburn's greatest performance might enjoy how someone living a life under religious vows views the film's accuracy. I'd also like to provide a few interesting historical facts about the way the Nun's story came into existence.Several contributors have commented on Hepburn's amazing performance given the fact that she had to rely on pure acting skill unaided by fashions and glamorous make up. Hepburn's son Sean Ferrer has said his mother considered her work in the Nun's Story to be the piece she was proudest of. It's easy to see why. There is nothing affected or stylized in her performance. It's honest pure and simple.Many of the customs of religious life depicted in the film were phased out deemphasized or abandoned after Vatican II. Orders that retain customs such as the culpa the Chapter of Faults have found ways to make the custom more of a simple acknowledgment rather than a public humiliation. The emphasis nowadays is on being honest about one's failings and less on a striving for a cookie cutter robotic conforming to a supernatural ideal. There is more of an emphasis on acceptance and charity than on penance.Dame Edith Evans as the superior general of the order Mother Emmanuel is both lofty and empathetic. Her few scenes in the film are some of the best. If anyone reading this has ever been a CEO or alone at the top of a chain of command you will understand the loneliness of her position. The superior general of a religious order like the one depicted in the film has no equal in rank anywhere in the entire community. The local superiors in the film Mothers Marcella Christophe Mathilde and Didyma at least have counterparts of equal rank within the congregation. They answer to the superior general. The actresses who played these parts gave very accurate performances. Even the seemingly cold Mother Didyma at the hospital on the Holland border from where Sister Luke leaves the convent was accurate. I've known superiors and novice guardians formerly called novice mastersmistresses who were just as rigid.Two of the most important parts in the film are Sister Margarita mistress of postulants and Sister William Sister Luke's idolrole model. The scene where Sister Luke returns to the mother house and encounters Sister Margarita and her current flock of postulants is very poignant. The fleeting smile of recognition and affection on Sister Margarita's face speaks volumes to Sister Luke. Particular friendships as they were then called were forbidden both as a guard against unnatural affections and as a way to preserve fraternal charity. The wonderful Rosalie Crutchley makes almost a cameo appearance as the mistress of novices her last film was Four Weddings and a Funeral where she plays the wedding guest who asks Kristin Scott Thomas if she is a lesbian.Dean Jagger as Dr. van Der Mal Sister Luke's father is sympathetic and sad. Indeed families giving a daughter to God in those days rarely saw their daughters. Visits home were not permitted unless you were ill in hospital or traveling to your next mission you never slept outside of the convent. Your family could visit you four times a year. Letters were strictly censored and restricted.Much is made of the relationship between Sister Luke and Dr. Fortunati in the Congo years. Fortunati's assessment of Sister Luke's worldliness is dead on. Peter Finch gave just the right amount of sarcasm respect and adoration of Sister Luke in his performance.The bottom line is while the film and novel both sensationalize and dramatize religious life I've never heard of a superior suggesting someone fail an examination to show humility the depiction of religious life in the early 1900's is pretty accurate. One entered the convent in order to learn to love God more. Mother Emmanual states at the end of the film that Sister Luke's love of medicine must take a back seat to her religious life. Sister Luke's failure is due to her inability get her arms around the vow of obedience.In real life Marie Louise Habets entered the convent two weeks after a brief interview with the superior general Mother Xaverine. Today months if not a couple of years of discernment would take place and the aspirant would be expected to pass a series of psychological tests.Kathryn Hulme wrote a novel not a biography inspired by the life of a woman she met after WWII. Neither Hulme or Habets ever claimed the book was true from start to finish. One of the European publishers did that and thus created a myth that persists to this day.The Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary the order to which Habets once belonged were scandalized and devastated by the book. The publisher's claims of accuracy and truth shocked them. An internal document written by the assistant superior general a former classmate of Habets they entered on the same day and took vows on the same day strongly and vigorously denounced the booked and accused the former nun of betrayal and the worst form of pride imaginable.Hulme wrote a letter to Mother Xaverine explaining the misunderstanding and asking for her understanding. Hulme and Habets became life long companions.The Nun's Story is a beautiful and exquisitely crafted film. The direction acting sets and musical score are among the best.".

	schema:headline " the art of subtlety";
	schema:reviewBody "Perched high atop the list of the finest American movies of the 1950's Fred Zinnemann's The Nun's Story is an intensely beautiful and powerful film about a woman who undergoes a crisis of faith and through her struggle learns the importance of finding one's true path in life. Based on the novel by Kathryn Hulme the film tells the story of Gabrielle van der Mal a Belgian woman who enters the convent in the 1930's spends a brief period working as a nurse in the Congo then leaves the order after years of intense personal struggle with herself and with God. Among American films of its time The Nun's Story stands virtually alone in its ability and willingness to dramatize a conflict taking place in the deepest recesses of a character's mind and soul.Audrey Hepburn  sans makeup and the kind of fashionplate wardrobe that had already become the hallmark of her movie career  delivers one of her richest performances as the strongwilled and fiercely independent Sister Luke whose very psyche is torn asunder by the battle between her own innate personal pride and a sincere desire to live a life of obedience to the Church and its rules. With everything but her countenance hidden beneath a nun's habit Ms. Hepburn is forced to draw on her resources as an actress having to convey the titanic internal conflict taking place within her character almost entirely through facial expressions vocal intonations and body language. And she proves herself more than equal to the challenge. She is brilliantly complemented by Peter Finch playing the cynical but humane Dr. Fortunati a dedicated surgeon who is as concerned about Sister Luke's spiritual health as her physical health. The relationship between the two is handled with a great deal of subtlety and tact never allowing the obvious romantic attraction between the two attractive people to come too much to the fore. Rounding out the excellent cast are Dean Jagger as Gabrielle's loving and concerned father Peggy Ashcroft and Mildred Dunnock as two older nuns who help guide Sister Luke along the way and the incomparable Edith Evans simply astounding as the Reverend Mother who sees unwavering devotion to God and the Church as the one and only goal of a serious nun.Among other things The Nun's Story is that rare film dealing with religion and spirituality that doesn't contain a single hokey or sentimental moment that knows the difference between religion and religiosity that is respectful without being unduly reverential and that acknowledges the complexity of the human heart in matters of devotion and faith. It also is not afraid to take its time to set the scene and tell its story never feeling the need to rush headlong into the next dramatic moment just to keep the movie going. In a perfect blending of form and content the film is every bit as thoughtful subtle and contemplative as its subject matter its mood greatly enhanced by the rich and beautiful Franz Waxman score that underlines the seriousness of the work.In addition to all its other fine virtues The Nun's Story features one of the greatest final scenes and closing shots in motion picture history a masterpiece of precision and understatement that demonstrates the kind of taste Zinnemman always displayed as a director. The movie is made up of small beautifully observed moments that when put together provide a powerful glimpse into the heart and life of a fascinating caring individual who wants to do great things in the world but who realizes that the path she has chosen is not the one that will ultimately lead her to her rightful destiny.On every level of filmmaking this is truly one of the greats.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was amazed how a long fairly slow film like this could capture and keep my attention all the way through.....but it did. This is really a quality film as those who have seen it for years will attest. It's so well done in all phases that when the twoandahalf hours are up you just marvel and what you've witnessed.Anyone who has tried to live a perfect life to please God and never offend Him with sins of any nature knows it is impossible. It is a noble pursuit but an exercise in futility that can lead to utter frustration. That is the dilemma we witness here in this film through the life of a wellmeaning and sweetascanbe Belgian lady Gabrielle van der Mal who is renamed Sister Luke after completing her training as a nun in the 1930s. Audrey Hepburn is superb as this woman who has the greatest of spiritual intentions and a heart not only for God but to be a great nurse and follow in her father's footsteps a famous physician in his country.Can't she be both? The answer of course is yes but that's not the answer she receives periodically at the convent or interprets because she's so tough on herself and it causes great inner conflict.Hepburn doesn't have tons of dialog in here and doesn't require it. The different looks on her face during this long story especially when there is disappointment are priceless. They are so subtle but so telling. I am one who would vote for this film as Audrey's best performance which is saying a lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enjoyable as well colorful picture about a dedicated religious nurse who attempts to cure troubled people in the Belgian Congo . The melancholy tale from the Kathryn Hulme book dealing with a young missionary working as a nurse during WWII and based on the novel of the same name that told the story of the reallife Sister Luke MarieLouise Habets . Gabriella enticing Audrey Hepburn the character was suggested for Ingrid Bergman but Bergman herself said she was too old for the role and instead proposed Audrey is the daughter of an important doctor Dean Jagger who leaves the convent as Sister Luke . The movie has opening credits play out over street scenes of Bruges  at over 1500 years old  one of the oldest cities in Belgium and at one time the most important commercial city in the world . In 1939 while the Nazi regime subjugates European Nations Graciella travels to the Belgian Congo  her assignment in the Congo is at a European hospital under the atheist eye of a doctor called Fortunai Peter Finch. Slowly  Gabriella or Sister Luke heals ills  helps injured villagers and usually prays . But the Nazis rise to power and invade her homeland . Then  she returns Belgium  there questions her religious vocation and her moralizing comes back to haunt her .Director Fred Zinneman struck a correct balance of fine pace and sensitivity in the mesmerizing tale of a young Belgian girl who becomes a religious missionary and is sent to the Belgian Congo to work at a hospital . Finely starred by a luminous Audrey Hepburn as a dedicated nun who subsequently comes to question her vocation  as she is struggling to reconcile her free spirit and philanthropic wishes with the religious rigors  Hepburn chalked up another hit in this long but always interesting flick based on Kathryn Hulme's novel  being rightly adapted by screenwriter Robert Anderson . Spectacular settings and well staged scenes  in fact  members of the Rome Opera ballet corps were hired to play some of the nuns and complex convent rituals were literally choreographed for them . This agreeable flick packs an exciting screenplay  thoughtprovoking drama  fine interpretations and intelligent filmmaking . It's surprising that the movie didn't achieve any of the six Academy Award for which it was nominated  however  it won NY Film Critics to best actress and director and British Academy gave prizes to best actress and support cast . Casting is frankly well . Good acting by Audrey Hepburn as a beautiful missionary nurse who gains the trust of the locals  not only providing medical care but dealing with African people  this was one of Audrey Hepburn's favorite of her films and it was also one of her most financially successful . Excellent Peter Finch as a good surgeon  he doesn't quite hit it off with Gabriella at first but soon starts to develop deep affections for her . Furthermore  a nice support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Edith Evans  Peggy Ashcroft  Dean Jagger Beatrice Straight Rosalie Crutchley  Ruth White  Barbara O'Neil  Lionel Jeffries  Colleen Dewhurst and Niall MacGinnis  among others . Nun's story consolidated a subgenre about nuns or religious people in far countries  going on Heaven knows  Mr Allison by John Huston with Robert Mitchum Deborah Kerr  The Sins of Rachel Cade also produced by Henry Blanke and directed by Gordon Douglas with Angie Dickinson  Roger Moore and Peter Finch  too  and A Nun at the Crossroads with Rosanna Schiaffino and John Richardson  among others. Appropriate as well as sensitive musical score by the classic Franz Waxman . Glamorous and evocative cinematography by Franz Planer  though mostly filmed on real African exteriors  in fact  the film was shot on location in Rome Bruges Stanleyville and a real leper colony in the Congo . The motion picture well produced by Henry Blanke was stunningly directed by Fred Zinneman. This is one of various and pleasant works  some major and minor successes of his long career as a filmmaker . He was a Hollywood veteran director directing early movies and a long career until the 80s . With The nun's story Zinnemann chalked another major hit in this overlong but always absorbing tale . After acquiring the rights to Kathryn Hulme's bestselling novel Fred Zinnemann found that no one in Hollywood had any enthusiasm towards turning it into a film citing it as being devoid of action  but all that changed when Audrey Hepburn expressed a desire to take the lead role . Rating  8  Above average  well worth seeing .".

The motion picture well produced by Henry Blanke was stunningly directed by Fred Zinneman. This is one of various and pleasant works  some major and minor successes of his long career as a filmmaker . He was a Hollywood veteran director directing early movies and a long career until the 80s . With The nun's story Zinnemann chalked another major hit in this overlong but always absorbing tale . After acquiring the rights to Kathryn Hulme's bestselling novel Fred Zinnemann found that no one in Hollywood had any enthusiasm towards turning it into a film citing it as being devoid of action  but all that changed when Audrey Hepburn expressed a desire to take the lead role . Rating  8  Above average  well worth seeing .";

	schema:reviewBody "The Nun's Story 1959I knew I would enjoy at least Audrey Hepburn and she's fabulous. But the movie came on as a Christmas Day feature and I worried that it would have too many religious overtones. Then as the credits rolled I saw it was directed by Fred Zinnemann. Zinnemann? I wondered what would draw him to this kind of story. My expectations tripled.I was not disappointed. This is a measured but never slow movie. It's totally beautiful it handles the sanctity of the convent with respect never tipping into sappy adoration. Hepburn is what you want from her lively and independent and this is a natural conflict in a world of discipline and loss of independence. And it's also an evolving changing story with a couple of major twists as it goes. By the end you see very much why Zinnemann wanted to do this and I can't tell you that. See for yourself.The conflict between self and community between having your own opinion about something and being forced to follow a larger set of rules that might not always be best is the core of the film. When do you rebel? When do you submit? And if you have agreed beforehand to devote your life to submission do circumstances allow an exception? A total change of heart?If you think this sounds boring it is not. You might give Hepburn the biggest credit hereshe's a natural and you are nothing but sympatheticbut the directing the cinematography are huge as well. Behind the camera is Franz Planar who did such trifles as Holiday and Letter from an Unknown Woman as well as two Audrey Hepburn movies Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's. If you have seen any of these or all you'll know how really perfectly they are filmed with the camera in service to the story.The story by the say in The Nun's Story is very much the point even beyond the moral. When does a young woman leave a loving and comfortable home and join a convent face a loss of self and freedom and yet still feel useful to the world? Hepburn's character who changes names in part of the effort to leave the past behind wants to go to Africa to serve the needy. How this is thwartedor notyou'll see but you really root for her. You see her brush against her principles in every way. And you see a larger principle arisedo the right thing. And she does. It's beautiful. It ought to make you cry. It will easily engage and move you.".

	schema:headline " Audrey Hepburn Glows as Sister Luke";
	schema:reviewBody "An intense conflict between spirituality and humanity lies at the core of Fred Zinneman's excellent adaptation of Katherine Hulme's The Nun's Story. Young Gabrielle enters the convent and as Sister Luke strives to attain the difficult qualities of sisterhood but at the same time her talents and skills at medicine and research pull her in another direction. Gabrielle is taught that a nun not only takes vows of chastity and poverty but must also be obedient and humble. Although not overtly discussed Sister Luke's decision to enter the convent may have been connected to a romantic affair the only evidence of which are a ring a photograph and a comment from her father. Although Sister Luke tries to obey the rules of silence and obedience she is the daughter of a prominent physician and she harbors ambitions to work in medicine and serve in the Congo. The conflict between the two competing ambitions reaches a crisis point when a sister superior suggests to her that she fail her medical examinations in order to show humility.Audrey Hepburn imbues Sister Luke with a radiance and glow that illuminates the screen. In what is arguably her finest performance Hepburn displays the subtle shades of conflict and doubt that creep into her persona as she struggles between her roles as a Bride of Christ and a practical nurse to the sick and dying. Reportedly Hepburn's interest in helping the needy of Africa began during the location shooting for this film.A galaxy of fine actresses shine as the sisters with whom Sister Luke interacts. Such luminaries as Edith Evans Peggy Ashcroft Mildred Dunnock Barbara O'Neil and Beatrice Straight offer their own special glow as patient and understanding nuns. Colleen Dewhurst has only a couple of memorable scenes as a hospital inmate but with few lines of dialog she creates an enduring character. Peter Finch and Dean Jagger are solid and effective as respectively Dr. Fortunati who works with Sister Luke in the Congo and as Gabrielle's disappointed father.While The Nun's Story is comparatively long the fascinating detail of the young nun's years as a novice medical student asylum aide missionary and hospital nurse in Belgium and the Congo during the 1930's is engrossing and tastefully filmed by Fred Zinneman. With beautiful cinematography by Franz Planer and a spare but lovely score by Franz Waxman The Nun's Story is one of the most religious movies ever filmed. Few films have ever so successfully explored the demands of a spiritual life and the conflict those demands can create in someone with strong human needs. With Audrey Hepburn at her zenith The Nun's Story was among the finest films of the 1950's and still remains a rewarding emotional experience.".

He replies Still very lonesome for you. That scene alone is enough to break your heart.The Nun's Story is filled with such scenes.

Beatrice Straight Network Barbara O'Neill Gone with the Wind as well as a glorious performance by Dame Edith Evans as Mother Emmanuel.The amount of emotion that Audrey Hepburn can portray with just her eyes a turn of her head or a subtle facial expression is simply incredible. Without giving away any important plot element there is one scene where she is in her cell trying to cope with a letter that she received.  It is one of the most painful scenes in the entire film.Sister Luke's struggles are balanced by scenes that are so beautiful in their simplicity that to attempt description here would be impossible.And the film score by Franz Waxman is one of the best things he has ever written  most of the melodic motifs are based on ancient Gregorian chant and the orchestration is superb.  When we reach a climactic scene involving Colleen Dewhurst he switches from his Romanticized writing style to a 20th century 12tone technique and the shock of the dissonant music fits the action of the scene perfectly.Sister Luke's struggle is universal.  Anyone who has looked deep into their own soul for whatever reason can identify with her.When Sister Luke is asked by her father to describe her doctor in the Congo she smiles and says Exceptional.

	schema:reviewBody "The image of water gradually sharpens the reflections of objects above...as soon as we get to know the leading character of NUN'S STORY it is not hard to predict that it is all going to be an involving mesmerizing viewing experience  yet nothing for the vast majority of audience.In the eyes of her father Dr Van Der Mal Dean Jagger our protagonist  young Gabrielle Audrey Hepburn is not really a strong willed girl obedient to the bells. Perhaps he sees other future for her. However she makes up her mind to resign from engagement with one Jean and sacrifice her life for interior and exterior silence for the detachment of worldly goods for obedience and penance doing good and disappearing for the sake of the Kingdom of God. Although she manages to go through the agonies of various inner struggles and tests will she be able to exercise and bring into action the spirit of charity for all to face Christianity's hardest obedience  forgive everyone all evildoers for anything harmful done to them or their beloved ones? The truest merit of Fred Zinneman's movie at first sight seems to lie in the execution of the storyline the film's literary source is the book by Kathryn Hulme. It is as the title implies a nun's story not so much supplied with laughable aspects as it is the case with a number of movies nowadays but a very insightful thought provoking depiction of virtues enforced and exercised behind the 'bars' of the convent. With this in mind we deservedly prepare for an excellent glimpse of the atmospheric mystique for prayers hymns clothed in unearthly tunes of sublime music. Here great credit goes not only to the cinematographer Franz Planer a winner at Academy Awards who supplies us with cinematographic pearls including the tremendously effective shots of interior silence of the specific place but also to Franz Waxman for his brilliantly atmospheric accurate and vibrant music score. He memorably incorporates certain tunes derived from almost 'iconic' chants to particular scenes. In this way the score sets the right tone for the story changes and controls the moods of various scenes. That refers to such pieces of music as 'Salve Regina' and 'Veni Creator Spiritus'  milestones of Christian music.However the greatest praise is not deservedly directed towards the crew members even to the director Fred Zinneman but to Audrey Hepburn in the lead. It seems quite obvious that not every actress can play a nun convincingly. Simply because we as viewers with certain background experiences both visual and conceptual are heavily influenced by certain expectations even clichd expectations. In that respect Ms Hepburn really meets our expectations...more to say she makes for a perfect portrayal of a nun. There is a combination of certainty and doubt subtlety and strictness in her face and her entire portrayal which makes her character easily empathized with. Because the gist that lies behind the fact who GabrielleSister Lukas really is appears to be underlined in her struggles to learn obedience and humility. These virtues that are so memorably and timelessly revealed in Culpa and Penance evoke in her performance. Ms Hepburn portrays a very human character a very gentle young girl a subtle nun and a dedicated nurse. Simply a superb performance! A sophisticated portrayal! She is funny at times mind you the lovely scene with little Felix and genuinely dramatic when the moment requires that perfectly switching from one bunch of emotions to another. If I were to name her best scenes I think that task would be quite impossible. I would highlight some of her most memorable scenes which include the entrance to the convent the Congo sequence her collaboration with Dr Fortunati Peter Finch vs. the scenes with her father. The aforementioned Congo sequence belongs to the true pearls among the color films of the late 1950s. Authentic beautiful shots of nature and landscape the gloomy scene on the isle of the lepers along with the haunting score long lasts in the memory of a viewer. The film is worth viewing apart from Ms Hepburn masterful achievement for the sequence alone.The supporting cast include some solid performances from Peter Finch as choleric but caring Dr Fortunati Dean Jagger as wonderful Dr Von Der Mal Gabrielle's father what a brilliant father that is who says I don't want to be proud of you I want you to be happy! and the sisters are uniquely memorable you will never mix the characters due to their specific features underlined Peggy Ashcroft as Mother Mathilde Edith Evans as Mother Emmanuel Rosalie Crutchley note Acte from QUO VADIS as Sister Eleanor. They are recognizable.Finally let me quote Bosley Crowther the New York Times reviewer who said about the film Mr. Zinnemann has made this offbeat drama describe a parabola of spiritual afflatus and deflation that ends in a strange sort of defeat. For the evident point of this experience is that a woman gains but also loses her soul spends and exhausts her devotion to an ideal she finds she cannot hold. But what is superior in one's life? Blind obedience to an ideal or being true to oneself? Where are we in that dilemma? Where is our protagonist? What does the final drama indicate? Greater torments or relief? She turns right as she leaves so perhaps...Dare accuse yourself of seeing it critically but let yourself see it and think. Although the movie is more than half a century old it has not lost its charm and entertainment along with all the dilemmas herein incorporated. Worth viewing as not only a nun's story but a person's drama.".

However given the limited amount of movies I had to chose from I decided to give this movie a fair shot.  Wow.  To think that I only viewed this movie out of desperation is embarrassing!  The innerstruggle that Sr. Luke Audrey Hepburnundergoes from postulant to nun is incredibly human not strictly religious.  I thought given the movie's topic that I would be bored and lost yet found myself completely in touch with the reality of her life.  Its almost impossible not to become in touch with her character especially once she reaches the Congo and faces the underplayed romantic tension between herself and Peter Finch.  While I have absolutely no intention of suddenly becoming a nun or running off to the Congo I will always be up for another viewing of this movie.

However given the limited amount of movies I had to chose from I decided to give this movie a fair shot.  Wow.  To think that I only viewed this movie out of desperation is embarrassing!  The innerstruggle that Sr. Luke Audrey Hepburnundergoes from postulant to nun is incredibly human not strictly religious.  I thought given the movie's topic that I would be bored and lost yet found myself completely in touch with the reality of her life.  Its almost impossible not to become in touch with her character especially once she reaches the Congo and faces the underplayed romantic tension between herself and Peter Finch.  While I have absolutely no intention of suddenly becoming a nun or running off to the Congo I will always be up for another viewing of this movie.  So ignore the title and give this movie a chance!";

Much of the film is fiction inspired by real facts but fiction. Its a history of sacrifice overcoming love to a vocation and a profession medicine that the young nun exercises as religious. But its also a film about doubts inner conflicts and people trying to be better by facing their failures and humanity. Audrey Hepburn shone as GabrielleSister Luke her beautiful face gave her an almost angelic appearance and a truly powerful presence on screen. The way she counteracts with Peter Finch who played a doctor in Congo with very specific ideas and almost devoid of faith its delicious. The scenarios are very good recreating well the religious ambiance and the almost savage Africa that Europeans pioneered in those years.The end of the film is one of the most amazing I've seen mainly for two reasons First its absolutely silent having no music second after seeing this nun suffer so much by her dreams its impossible for her not to win the public's affection so the end becomes difficult to accept for the public.Decidedly this film is worthy and deserves to be seen more often by the current public.".

	schema:headline " Immortal faith journey depicts a nun's struggle of conscience";
	schema:reviewBody "This immortal masterpiece depicts the faith journey and conscience struggles of a Belgian nun in the 1930's and 40's. It can be appreciated by any viewer but will naturally have special significance to those whose faith whether Catholic or otherwise is important to them. The incomparable Audrey Hepburn brings great depth to the role of Sister Luke as she strives to keep her convent vows of poverty chastity and obedience in a world shattered by World War II.The film opens as Gabrielle Van der Mal a headstrong girl parts from her devoted father a physician to begin a new life in the convent where she is renamed Sister Luke. We follow her path of preparation for a life dedicated to God...first as a postulant then a novice and eventually her final vows. Her convent journey takes her from the Mother House in Belgium to a vocation as nursing nun temporarily in a Brussels mental sanitarium and later a hospital in the Belgian Congo. Finally circumstances force her to return to Belgium as all Europe is caught up in the drama of the Second World War.Sister Luke's inner struggles rather than external events occupy the main thrust of this film. She unsuccessfully battles against pride when the Reverend Mother asks Sister Luke who excels academically to deliberately fail an exam in tropical medicine in order to prove her humility. However perhaps because of her innate headstrong nature she experiences her greatest difficulty maintaining her vow of obedience first even in general hospital duty when she questions as nurse versus nun the bell that commands her to cease nursing duties in order to keep the scheduled convent prayer time. The ultimate test of her obedience comes after her Congo years when she struggles against hatred of the Germans. The nuns are expected to remain neutral during the war resistance against the occupying Nazis being forbidden by the Rule of the Convent. Sister Luke's devout faith is never at any time in question. Her struggles involve her attempt to force a round peg her strong will and individuality into a square hole the convent's insistence on unquestioning conformity and strict obedience.The film depicts very skillfully the anguish felt in those days by family members specifically her father in being parted from their loved one entering the convent. Also it paints a vivid portrait of many aspects of cloistered life during that era...the wearing of the habit and cutting of the hair the renunciation of individuality and possessions the withdrawal from worldly life and attitudes the complete devotion to God  unquestioning obedience to the convent's strict Rule...and especially of course the inner turmoil potentially involved at least for some nuns in keeping these vows. A compelling aspect of this movie is the close but strained relationship between Sister Luke and Dr. Fortunati the cynical but compassionate doctor in charge of the Congo hospital. Their religious beliefs are very different and the agnostic Dr. Fortunati frequently taunts the nursing sister about faith issues. However the two develop a mutual respect for each another's professional skills and also a genuine though rather tense personal friendship. A certain unexplored romantic  sexual attraction underlies all their interactions though such feelings are not given obvious or sensational focus. Physical touching between this pair is restricted to a handshake and a medical examination of the nun by the doctor. Of course Dr. Fortunati makes no sexual overtures and Sister Luke's inner strength  resolve would undoubtedly have ensured resistance to any such temptation. Frankly her struggles are with the vow of obedience rather than with chastity though the entire doctor issue definitely adds viewer interest in the story. The role of Dr. Fortunati is well captured here by actor Peter Finch.Audrey Hepburn is of course absolutely superb as she unfolds for us the dramatic tale of Sister Luke. She always appears radiant and serene even during moments of emotional conflict and intense turmoil. The film's quiet stark closing scenes are among the most powerful and moving in the cinematic world. A strong recommendation for this engrossing  inspiring film and also the book of the same name by Katherine Hulme.".

She says goodbye to her sisters Louise and Marie to her brother Pierre and to her beloved father and subjects herself to the stringent rules of the retrograde institution including interior silent and excessive humbleness and humiliation. After a long period working in a mental institution Gaby is finally assigned to go to Congo where she works with the Atheist and cynical but brilliant Dr. Fortunati Peter Finch.

Years later she is ordered to return to Belgium and when her motherland is invaded by the Germans she learns that her beloved father was murdered by the enemy while he was helping wounded members of the resistance. Sister Luke finally decides to leave the religious life since she is not able to feel neutral against the invaders of her country. The Nun's Story is a great film that tells the story of a young woman that decides to enter in a convent accepting all sort of humiliation in the retrograde institution. It is impressive the nonsense attitudes that the novice is submitted including selfinfliction of whipping absurd silence fail in an examination and be repressed for an excel work in the hypocrite name of humbleness. This is not vocation but abnormal brainwash of sick persons in the name of the faith. Audrey Hepburn is magnificent as usual and this film was nominated to 8 Oscars 13 wins and 12 other nominations. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Uma Cruz  Beira do Abismo A Cross in the Edge of the Abyss".

	schema:reviewBody " Possible Spoilers relating to final scene  I watched this movie fascinated for the first time on Turner Classic Movies recently. The fascination stems from the realization that though this film is only 44 years old it would be impossible to make such a movie today.To treat as serious subject matter a woman's inner spiritual struggles as she progresses from postulant to novice to nun and the crisis of faith that causes her to leave the order as serious subjects for a movie is something that could not happen today. To make such a story marketable the movie would have to have a healthy dose of secularism an antireligious tone an attempt to portray the strictures of the order as repressive and authoritarian. After all since the 60's our culture has taught us all that fulfillment comes from the fullest expression of one's innermost needs desires and aspirations. To portray a struggle to find fulfillment through complete selfabnegation and submission to authority as a heroic one would be viewed today as simply perverse. Thus the movie which makes absolutely no condescensions to secularism is an antique though a gorgeous and beautifully made one.The final scene which accurately recreates the process by which a nun leaves the order  alone with no handshakes or embraces or farewells in a bare room with a door that opens to an outside street  is one of the most powerful I have ever seen. The overwhelming sadness that Sister Luke must have experienced as she walks out that door and down the street her abandoned habit blowing gently in the breeze as it hangs on a clothes rack is almost palpable and is a testament to how powerfully the film has portrayed her struggle. We know that she has in a very real sense destroyed the most important part of her life as a result of her unremitting honesty. It is understandable why the director chose not to underline this scene with music the meaning is too powerful to be accented with music and to do so would actually undercut the scene's power. Watching it an analogous scene that came to my mind  looking out a door watching a conflicted figure walk away  was the closing of John Ford's 'The Searchers.' There are strong emotional analogies but I find the scene from the Nun's Story to be the more powerful  it is the climax to which the entire movie leads and is truly one of the rare moments where the cinematic art becomes transcendent.Having said that this clearly is not a film for everyone. The subject matter clearly limits its appeal to those who take faith and religion as real and serious subjects.Production values exquisite must be seen in widescreen format. Audrey Hepburn's performance perhaps her best. Franz Waxman's score based on an Ave Maria chant from the Liber Usualis superb.A film of rich beauty and lasting depth.".

Sister Luke Hepburn is constantly challenged in sticking to her vows especially the one of obedience.She chaffed at the rules that did not leave room for common sense. Is it better to strictly obey or to do more good in disobedience? It is a question asked over and over.Things become more difficult as WWII starts. Now the rules must be set aside to help the war effort. Eventually the conflict between the rules and her need for independence is resolved.Hepburn was fantastic as was Finch. Well worth seeing.";

Fred Zinnemann tells the story well effectively highlighting many good dramatic moments and maintaining the balance among the many rather weighty themes of the movie. Because of the challenge involved in keeping the story interesting and evenhanded it's really more of an achievement than some of Zinnemann's betterknown films.The atmosphere is consistently believable from the convent scenes to the mission settings to the hospital settings. Sometimes scenic sometimes grim they provide a fine backdrop for the story and characters.Hepburn is very effective in a role that allows her to work with a good range of dramatic material and a good variety of other characters. Many of the other characters are interesting in themselves and the supporting cast features some fine talent even in some of the smaller roles. The parade of other persons in and out of Sister Luke's life works very effectively both in developing her character and in depicting what her chosen lifestyle is like.The story is completely serious yet never overly heavy and it treats the characters and their beliefs respectfully  quite a rarity in films that deal with subjects like religion war and relations between different cultures. Perhaps the nature of the material will not seem interesting to many viewers  especially those jaded by a continual diet of the comic bookquality characters in presentday movies  but it is a most thoughtfully made and worthwhile film.".

	schema:headline " A Thoughtfully Critical Movie About Religious Commitment";
	schema:reviewBody "This Best Picture nominee from 1959 showcases Audrey Hepburn in one of her best performances and one that feels the least like the roles she usually played. Hepburn plays a young woman who is determined to take her vows despite a temperament that everyone close to her realizes isn't suited to the life of a nun. The film isn't exactly critical of religion but it does acknowledge that devoutness does to a certain extent require an abandonment of independent thinking and in some a voluntary sacrifice of natural gifts to a love of God. Hepburn's character has a gift for science and medicine and would make a gifted nurse. We realize that she could serve Christian ideals more effectively by abandoning her vows and doing what she actually wants to do but she doesn't see her lack of devoutness as anything other than a failure. She's a fascinating character and one that resonated strongly with me. As someone who isn't religious I'm constantly mystified by those around me who so narrowly define their world and their place in it in religious terms and think there's only one way to emulate the ideals our culture labels as Christian and yet are really just a guide to being a decent human being no matter what your religious beliefs.Peter Finch has a small but effective role as a doctor who is disdainful of the church and contributes to Hepburn's crisis of faith and Beatrice Straight is also memorable as a reverend mother who has a broader view of what it means to be a nun than many of the others with whom Hepburn comes in contact.The Nun's Story was nominated for eight Oscars but unfortunately went up against the BenHur behemoth and so won nothing. In addition to Best Picture it scored nominations for Best Director Fred Zinnemann Best Actress Hepburn Best Adapted Screenplay Robert Anderson Best Color Cinematography Franz Planer Best Film Editing Walter Thompson Best Dramatic or Comedy Score Franz Waxman and Best Sound.Grade A".

The scenes between Hepburn and Peter Finch as a Congobased doctor sizzle  but there's not a single kiss exchanged between them and with the exception of a handshake and a medical examination they never even touch. There is a sense of the forbidden here that is uncomfortable for Sister Luke the doctor and the audience. And all this is accomplished with looks. The sense of sexuality comes from what ISN'T said and done. We the audience know she won't give in to temptation. She knows she won't. The doctor knows she won't. Yet the very fact temptation exists makes for kinetic viewing.Hepburn was nominated for an Oscar for her performance but did not win. This is a pity as in my opinion she deserved an Academy Award for this performance more than any other film she made with the possible exception of Two for the Road.Throughout the film Sister Luke attempts to find perfection as a nun.

His southern county sheriff dominates this film. I would have to say it is my third favorite Greenstreet role next to The Maltese Falcon and The Hucksters. Joan Crawford good as she is loses all the joint scenes when she's on the screen with Greenstreet.Joan's a carnival girl stranded in Greenstreet's town and picked up by Greenstreet's deputy Zachary Scott. Greenstreet has big political plans for Scott which include a proper marriage with some modern version of Melanie Hamilton. Virginia Huston's the girl he has in mind.After Crawford doesn't take Greenstreet's advice and leave town he has her framed on a prostitution rap. After doing a six month stretch Crawford is understandably wanting vengeance. She takes a job at a road house run by Gladys George where a lot of the state bigwigs meet and enjoy all forms of pleasurable relaxation.The characters in Flamingo Road jump right out at you they really were made for a night time soap opera. Of course Crawford is great as she and new husband and ally David Brian gives her a new found respectability. The best portrayal in the film besides Crawford and Greenstreet goes to Gladys George. She's a southern version of the Texas Guinan like character she played in The Roaring Twenties. If you like soap opera and revenge this is the film for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like a dry Martini with just a tad too much vermouth garnished with an olive that hasn't been washed of its brine this one can leave a nasty taste if you're looking for something that goes down smoothly. But if you're not too fastidious this Crawford star vehicle is almost ridiculously entertaining. Joan might have been just a little long in the tooth to be playing a hoochycoochy carnival girl in the film's opening sequence but it isn't long before she's on her way up constantly being tripped on that inexorable climb by one of the slimiest villains that Sydney Greenstreet ever played. Warners trowels on the class A production values except for some glaring back projections at a construction site and Michael Curtiz's direction is as usual briskly efficient getting the best from everyone in the cast principal and supporting players alike except perhaps for Greenstreet who really doesn't look well at all and seems to be struggling against imminent collapse in some scenes. He made only one picture after this one and died from complications of diabetes about five years later.Max Steiner contributes his usual melodically overwrought score with heavy reliance on the popular song If I Could Be One Hour With You Tonight lushly orchestrated by Murray Cutter under the musical direction of that Warners stalwart Ray Heindorf. It's almost too distracting but the frequently crackling dialogue keeps the audience's attention focused on the pulpy proceedings. Ted McCord's blackandwhite cinematography is an outstanding example of why not every picture should be in color and I suspect that it was Travilla who was given the task of gowning Crawford once she'd finally crossed over to the right side of the tracks. Sheila O'Brien also credited probably ran up those nifty waitress uniforms and the prison garb Crawford gets to wear not once but twice!They really REALLY don't make 'em like this anymore and thank goodness Turner Classic Movies for instance trundles a tasty morsel like this out of their archives every once in a while for us to savor once again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flamingo Road is one of those Joan from the other side of the tracks ending up living large and it's great. After how many years of doing these roles at 45 Crawford still pulled them off with aplomb. She's wonderful to watch in this. I remember seeing this at a revival cinema on a big screen and it was the first time I realized how petite a woman she was  but she always seemed so tall! In this film Crawford plays a excarny girl who takes up with Zachary Scott. Scott is the protg of a ruthless political boss played by Sydney Greenstreet. He turns out to be too weakwilled to do anything but stay under Greenstreet's thumb. He marries someone more proper while Greenstreet does everything he can to drive Crawford out of town. When she winds up married to an even more powerful man than Greenstreet he seeks to destroy both her and her husband.David Brian is excellent as Crawford's husband as is Gladys George as a roadhouse owner for whom Crawford works briefly. Scott doesn't register as a wimp stripped of his romantic underpinnings in Mildred Pierce. And then we come to Sydney Greenstreet. You're telling me he lived five years after this film? I would have easier believed he dropped dead immediately afterward. He looks pasty and horrendous as he downs pitchers of milk slurs his dialogue and laughs in a very unworldly way  kind of a hahhah a sharp intake of breath and then a higher pitched laugh that sounds like a hiccup. Always a sinister presence on the screen Greenstreet comes off as evil all right but also ill in this production.Flamingo Road became a television series in the '80s. I'll take the original.".

Kael described it as overwrought but in truth it's good oldfashioned melodramatic storytelling with a smart literate script and refreshingly quick pacing. The only flaw that bothered me was a musical score that is at times laughably incongruous. The music swells bewilderingly and ominously when Crawford benignly offers Reynolds' Political Boss something for his hangover.Sure you can quarrel with the casting of Shakespeareanvoiced Sydney Greenstreet playing a Southern Sheriff but he's so unrepentently vile and villainous that he's convincing in every role he plays. It is a joy to watch two such formidable actors as Crawford and Greenstreet squaring off in big confrontations.It's not surprising that some 30 years later this became the premise for a nighttime soap opera starring I believe Morgan Fairchild. It has so many jealousies manipulations secret ambitions doublecrosses plots for revenge  it's just great fun if one doesn't take it too seriously. And clearly Crawford Greenstreet and the director Michael Curtiz didn't. They recognized the material for what it was  pulpy entertainment served up with wit and style.".

Her take on Lane Bellamy is vintage Crawford!This must have been a vehicle for the star right after her star turn in Mildred Pierce. It has some of the same people behind it like director Michael Curtiz and Zachary Scott. The dialogue is something to be treasured. They don't make films like this anymore. Just imagine what panache Ms Crawford brought to anything she appeared in. The cast that was assembled for this film is probably impossible to match. The great Sydney Greenstreet is so good as the evil sheriff Titus Semple that we stay riveted looking at his every move. David Brian as the man who loves Lane and rescues her from poverty is also an asset. The minor players Gladys George Fred Clark and Virginia Huston among others fit right into the story.But this is a Joan Crawford's film. She dominates every scene in which she appears. What power she conveys with only an economy of gestures. No one working in films these days can come near to this actress who left her own imprint in the canon of American cinema not to be equaled by anyone any time soon.".

You'd be surprised how much trouble it is to dispose of a dead elephant she tells Greenstreet having returned to town with a makeover thanks to her new husband Dan Reynolds David Brian a big wheel from Washington D.C. determined to put small town viruses like Semple in their place.This is a gripping political drama made the same year as the Oscar Winning All the King's Men and the lesser known Alias Nick Beal. The focus here is on the woman behind the scenes and Crawford is great even if her masculine hairstyle makes her appear older than the character especially in the opening carny scenes. Greenstreet revels in his villainy here even more so than in The Maltese Falcon his hatred of Crawford instant from the moment he sees her dining with his puppet. The wonderful Gladys George steals every scene she's in as the one person who sees through Laine but likes her anyway!. When Ms. George warns Greenstreet that she's the only one who determines who works in her place and dismisses him like nobody else besides Crawford has dared and that was with a slap across the face you want to shout out hurray!. Then she tells Crawford how much more she likes her now that she knows how Greenstreet feels about her. You just wish this character had more scenes.I've crawled into a bottle and I can't get out Scott reveals in a key scene as the weak Fielding and it is obvious that his character will end up being destroyed by the machine that's been protecting him. This leads to the cards stacking up against practically every character with Semple's destruction only a matter of a plot twist or two away. This is movie soap opera at its best and sure enough in the early 1980's it became one albeit sadly briefly. But the original movie which I must confess I didn't care for when first seeing it years ago has stood the test of time and today's political machine still cranking away today can be recognized in the cogs of the wheels turning here.".

The thing is  why they felt they needed this as a setup is beyond me. It was totally unnecessary.

All I could think about were those films while I watched this leaden potboiler lumber along. Yeah there are some great snappy lines of dialogue not enough yes Sydney Greenstreet who no matter what he does cannot drop his British accent makes a great villain and yes Joan can still wear a waitress skirt and sling hash with the best of them  but so what? Who cares?Here we have Joan go from 10 cents a toss veiled dancer to being the lady of a vast mansion on Flamingo Road  instructing her birdbrain maid when and where to serve tea and redecorating the entire place as if she was Martha Stewart's mother. It's incomprehensible.The other thing that I've started to notice after OD'ing on Joan films and I adore her is that if a man looks at her once that's it  the hot sex love and marriage are one kiss away  and there better not be another babe in the room  or on the screen. And yet Flamingo Road features the very pretty and young Virginia Huston as Annabelle Weldon the woman who Zachary Scott marries even though he's still in love with Joan and yet why? What the hell do they have in common?. Also in most of Joan's movies as with Streisand's Joan is always told how pretty she looks and what a great girl she is. Yeah well she was pretty at one time and she was a girl but she is neither in this film.At any rate the movie eventually becomes a repeat performance of so many other Joan movies which was basically the poor girl works her way up to the rich girl. The problem is We've been there done that and no matter what she does Joan can't save this clunker. I love you Joan but this was a big yawn. Thumbs down.".

Syndey Greenstreet has the performance of his career here as the evil and corrupt sheriff who seems to have too much power to be quite believable.

Syndey Greenstreet has the performance of his career here as the evil and corrupt sheriff who seems to have too much power to be quite believable. The film is a bit too long and the end seems forced and tacked on when Crawford and Greenstreet finally have it out. But  a must see for Crawford fans!";

Even in The Maltese Falcon Bogart paled when Greenstreet was onscreen.In many movies he even dominated all the other scenes as well where he was not onscreen.The guy made a little over 20 movies according to the IMDb in less than a decade from 1941 to 49 to be precise and FLAMINGO ROAD was his penultimate he was even in RUTHLESS one of the most underrated masterpieces of the 40ies !!!.Just take the intro it's less than 5 minutes into the movie that you see a car parking a guy leaving it. You just see his back. What a back! You don't even have to see the guy up front to know who he is. Massive.But what would YOU expect ?!!! Michael Curtiz one of THE directors of that time if not THE director of them all  look at his list of achievements was at it. This director clearly knew not only how to get the best out of the whole cast but also how to put them on screen the best way possible how to introduce them properly. Greenstreet was sortofalegend as character actor then already and this was the best way to introduce him just to show his huge back.Up he walks a veranda and gets his massive figure into an armchair intending to put is southern hat at the table besides the armchair but ... no table there. Not in a loud voice just casual he calls the then usually black and fittingly servant to tell him that nearly would it have happened that again! his hat might have fallen onto the ground and HE  Greenstreet would have had to pick it up like it had once ! happened in the past. He says it casual and without anger but it is easy to see that this must have been a major disappointment to him  regardless how many years ago this happened could have been a decade as well  which he still remembers like the day it happened like the day when he had his hat fallen in the dust and had to pick it up.Needless to say the servant had the table aside the armchair just seconds later.Enters Zachary Scott a competent actor as well also in RUTHLESS by the way! the deputysheriff and asked by Greenstreet what he'd done the whole day replies been fishing. He'd actually do something for his money says Scott if it would lead to anything clearly implying it would not but hinting he'd even be sorry for doing nothing. Says Greenstreet he should not ! worry 'bout that there would be many other people in  whatever the name of the town was  who would getearn a lot more money for doing a lot less than he's doing  fishing the day smile.Come on ain't that a scene ?!!! Ever seen something like this in a recent movie where a guy says not to worry about being lazy ?? Nope that's against common sense today poor times we're living in aren't we?!.All that is delivered almost casually without any effort completely easy just amazing !! This alone is worth watching the whole movie but there are many more great Greenstreetscenes coming more than I can recite here. Watch it !! This movie gets a 10 out of 10 for having such a fantastic role for Greenstreet but the movie itself is also pretty good would rate it 7 or 8. All the other cast is VERY competent the story holds interest throughout the ending is a little bythenumbers but satisfying all in all a great achievement and NOT a minor in anybodys career.As I said watch it you won't be disappointed at least if you love good decent movies and can watch a blackandwhite one smile.".

There are even familiar sets in style and moments including the splayed dead body of one actor who appeared splayed and dead in Mildred Pierce starring Crawford and directed by Curtiz just a few years before.And all of this is good. Whatever the movie lacks in originality it makes up for in style and drama. It's high drama for sure ranging from a traveling circus to a corrupt sheriff including murder and gambling and cross loves and sweeping through lots of great night and interior photography. It's a noir more or less the alienated lead character is a woman in this case and not a soldier adjusting to civilian life and it redeems sufficiently by the end. Look for lots of great bit actors and wonderful photography throughout.So why isn't this a great classic? Partly it's the story which turns to wellused devices and characters all along. Partly it's actually the use of Sydney Greenstreet as the heavyhe's quirky and wonderful but not quite convincing as a terrible power playing thug. Crawford is really at her usual best here some scenes she really emotes which isn't always her preference and she holds up some scenes that are otherwise more routine. Curtiz to be sure is brilliant at creating rich scenes with a lot going on picture the interior shots in Casablanca for example. He does that again here and you can just watch this movie for its feeling. It isn't as dark or brooding a film noir as the best of them and the villains here don't exude evil or dread the way the genre needs. But there is a steady tension and curiosity as events turn and turn.In the end this is a Mildred Pierce wannabe and it seems the studio and the director both knew that. So the story line lacks some clear momentum and the characters in general lack basic development. Watch for some pure Warner Bros pleasurethere is a lot here to just sit back and enjoy.".

As she's brought fullcircle with the man of her nightmares corrupt sheriff and state powerbroker Titus Semple Sydney Greenstreetin an explosive showdown at the conclusion of the movie Flamingo Road.Having no place to stay after her dancing troupe left the town of Bolden Lane is found sleeping in a deserted tent by deputy Sheriff Fielding Carlisle Zachary Scott Fielding. Sheriff Fielding gives Lane some money and gets her a job at the Eagle caf. Soon he begins to fall in love with the former dancer. Titus who's looking to put Fielding in the state Governor's mansion is upset at his involvement with the dirtpoor Lane and breaks up his relationship with her by threatening to destroy Fielding's future in state politics if he doesn't. Dropping Lane for the much younger and politically connected through her family Annabell Weldon Virginia Huston Fielding get's married to her. Later unknown to Fielding Titus has Lane framed and arrested for prostitution putting her in a women's work camp for thirty days.Out without a job or a place to live Lane is determined to go back to Bolden and put her life back together despite Tits's attempt to run her out of town as well as the state. Lane get's a job as a waitress at Lute Mea's place where there's a big convention going on of the state's political boss' including the big man himself Dan Reynolds David Brian.Dan get's to appreciate Lane when she cured him of a hangover and later falls in love with her because of her honesty something that's very alien to him about herself and her past. Lane for all her honesty doesn't tell Dan about her past involvement with both Titus and Fielding that almost destroys her marriage to Dan later in the film.By now Fielding's marriage to Annabelle is on the rocks and his future in state politics in just about history with an outraged Titus kicking him out of his job as state senator and having Fielding end up a pitiful drunkard. Titus now turning his rage on Dan Reynolds for daring to challenge his powerplans to run someone against Dan's handpicked man for governor Parkhurst and that being himself. Doing what he does best Titus has one of the men who works for Dan's construction company Burr Lassen William Haade blackmailed by framing his son on a bogus drunkdriving charge. This is done in order to frame Dan on a charge of having convicts work for him without pay. Meanwhile Fielding drinking himself blind gets up enough courage to see Lane at the Reynold's house to tell her what a fool he was by leaving her and thus destroying himself. Lane trying to get Fielding to stop drinking and sleep it off turns her back on him mixing him a drink of all things  for just a moment as he staggers into the bedroom and shoots himself.With the people of Boden being whipped up by Titus' stooges in the media to drive Lane out of town for being unworthy her past of her being arrested for prostitution is leaked out to live among them. An hurt and outraged Lane goes to Titus' place to get him to admit in public that he set up her husband or else she'll kill him. Titus seeing his chance to now get Lane implicated on an attempted murder charge underestimate her determination to stop him which backfires on him in a way he never expected it to do.A bit unrealistic but still very effective political power drama with Joan Crawford giving a stand out performance as the abused and maligned Lane Bellamy. A woman who's driven to the limit by those who are out to destroy her but instead stands firm and fight back.".

Lane get's a job as a waitress at Lute Mea's place where there's a big convention going on of the state's political boss' including the big man himself Dan Reynolds David Brian.Dan get's to appreciate Lane when she cured him of a hangover and later falls in love with her because of her honesty something that's very alien to him about herself and her past. Lane for all her honesty doesn't tell Dan about her past involvement with both Titus and Fielding that almost destroys her marriage to Dan later in the film.By now Fielding's marriage to Annabelle is on the rocks and his future in state politics in just about history with an outraged Titus kicking him out of his job as state senator and having Fielding end up a pitiful drunkard. Titus now turning his rage on Dan Reynolds for daring to challenge his powerplans to run someone against Dan's handpicked man for governor Parkhurst and that being himself. Doing what he does best Titus has one of the men who works for Dan's construction company Burr Lassen William Haade blackmailed by framing his son on a bogus drunkdriving charge. This is done in order to frame Dan on a charge of having convicts work for him without pay. Meanwhile Fielding drinking himself blind gets up enough courage to see Lane at the Reynold's house to tell her what a fool he was by leaving her and thus destroying himself. Lane trying to get Fielding to stop drinking and sleep it off turns her back on him mixing him a drink of all things  for just a moment as he staggers into the bedroom and shoots himself.With the people of Boden being whipped up by Titus' stooges in the media to drive Lane out of town for being unworthy her past of her being arrested for prostitution is leaked out to live among them. An hurt and outraged Lane goes to Titus' place to get him to admit in public that he set up her husband or else she'll kill him. Titus seeing his chance to now get Lane implicated on an attempted murder charge underestimate her determination to stop him which backfires on him in a way he never expected it to do.A bit unrealistic but still very effective political power drama with Joan Crawford giving a stand out performance as the abused and maligned Lane Bellamy. A woman who's driven to the limit by those who are out to destroy her but instead stands firm and fight back.";

The idea of an academic person accidentally making up The Copenhagen Criterias which are the catalyst for the movie and then later on regretting it to start an underground organization to curb it's effects is neither realistic or funny and the double crossing girl comes off as an irrelevant unbelievable and annoying character that shouldn't have made it to the storyline.Folkes discovery of his biological parents is another sidestory that just confuses and distracts from the main story.So what works well? The relationship between Folke and Major Christian is brilliant as is Christians numerous interviews with questionable citizens.

All this is beside the point! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! It's a satire! A political statement. But it doesn't even begin to actually address the problem it's supposed to be about. Maybe it was afraid of going too far? How cowardly. That's not art. It's not even real satire.Sren Pilmark a very serious and by now one of Denmark's absolutely senior actors was very good. He largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had. Everybody else nothing special well perhaps except for Lene Poulsen who did supply a convincing performance.In fact a problem with most Danish movies is that the language never sounds natural.

If it's a dramatic film you act in a drama Jean Claude Van Damme.Having seen 80 MILLION directed by Waldemar Krzystek on the big screen I experienced something not so common when applied to Polish cinema smiles of satisfaction. 80 MILLION selected for the Best Foreign Language Oscar proves a considerable achievement as a drama but foremost as an effective action movie. 80 MILLION beautifully meets the standards of any American film with some portion of violence sex but above all thrilling action. Although the film tells a story of true events that took place in historic for Poland December 1981 when the communist regime announced the martial law the action is set in Wroclaw and the film is shot on location there the content of the film does not require a viewer to be much knowledgeable about the historical events. Why? 80 MILLION in its background is a depiction of People's Republic of Poland in the early 1980s  the gray lives of people oppressed within regime. This historical backdrop however is used by the director as a clever conceit to frame the plot. Mind you that there is not one protagonist that would make a film a sort of appraisal of one person's heroism. It is neither a documented depiction of Solidarnosc movement and its ideals. There is nevertheless Lech Walesa in the background but rightly so he appears on TV  idea rather than a concrete character. Nothing is 'heroic' but rather 'humane' there are more people more simple members of Solidarnosc who are not afraid to oppose to the cruelty of those in power. In that respect Joanna Morena in her review on the film nicely observes that people are in the foreground. Wladyslaw Frasyniuk Filip Bobek Maks Marcin Bosak Staszek Wojciech Solarz represent those 'brothers in arms'  indefatigable in their fights. Much happens in their lives in these days and much is being photographed...They have their shortcomings sure but their mutual target makes them solidarity united. Their stories incorporate a wide range of experiences from courage to fear from loyalty to treason.80 MILLION is on the other hand a fine example of human complexity cinematically personified. It seems that villains though we don't like them are most 'unforgettable.' Are there any villains in this film? Here I would like to highlight the character of Sobczak skillfully and memorably played by Piotr Glowacki. He is seemingly the incarnation of the communist power...however in the long run it occurs that he is driven more by some personal hateful motives than ideals he hardly believes in. Sobczak shocks us as a character but at the same time he perfectly stimulates viewers to psychoanalyze a man who has 'some' power over other people. What hidden drives come out of him indeed his character reinforces the duality of human nature and his character is more complex than some viewers would expect. Consider the scene at the archbishop's palace and his vulgarism that works as a disguise of inner fear. He spills the beans about the state of communist regime of the time but foremost the state of his inner self...Full credit for the actor!80 MILLION is foremost an intriguing and thrilling detective story. The set of the gray People's Republic of Poland does not constitute any obstacle to execute an excellently absorbing action drama. The title 80 million Polish zloty which belongs to Solidarnosc is taken from the bank a huge sum for the time a few days before the martial law and hidden at the archbishop's palace. The tension that keeps a viewer in a chair while every little step is being counted is convincing. At the same time humor may leak through the walls of gray censorship. Many scenes in that respect make the film highly worth seeing.Riveting entertainment and a new glimpse of quite a depressing period of Polish history that did not lack creative and brave people anyway. Poland's effective story and an interesting gift of thrill to international audiences.".

	schema:headline " Political Heist";
	schema:reviewBody "In the early 1980s the Solidarity movement was at its strongest forcefully creating an opposition to the communist government. While the international focus was placed on the workers like Lech Wasa who jumped over fences to punch straight at the crumbling system it was actually the intelligentsia of Wrocaw who arguably were the operational brains behind the defiance. The local Solidarity movement was run by Wadysaw Frasyniuk Filip Bobek who helped organise an underground movement that help the unionbased anticommunist force to survive delegalisation and persecution.Flung back into 19801981 we see the final moments that led to Russianinfluenced Warsaw government to enact martial law that brought about catastrophic political tidal waves throughout the country. Already most of the society was too embattled with everyday life struggles such as constant standing in line to buy a loaf of bread or some toilet paper a centrally imposed tactic employed in order to distract people from the struggle. With the State of Emergency about to crack down on opposition movements one of the dreariest periods in Polish communist was about to occur.Within this backdrop writerdirector Waldemar Krzystek delivers a political heist movie which incorporates history with a truly enthralling action. The story itself centres around four key figures of the Wrocaw Solidarity labour union namely Frasyniuk Jzef Pinior Krzysztof Czeczot Piotr Bednarz Maciej Makowski and Stanisaw Huskowski Wojciech Solarz. With a very downtoearth character presentation which presents them as ordinary blokes who per chance deem themselves obliged to stand up for the everyday citizen and initiate a systemic fight each separately being a small cog in a societal behemoth the union had 10 million members before delegalisation. When the local structures are informed by an enigmatic Tadeusz Marku Stary Mariusz Benoit that any day now the powers that be will clamp down on the opposition and instate a state of national emergency effectively cordoning off the country with the aid of Russian forces the key question remains how will Solidarity function in this quasiwar state? Necessity will force them into the underground but in order to have money for paper printing machines to forward the struggle and general operational funds  money will be a necessity. With Union funds counting at about 80 million zotys deposited in the state bank the easiest option was to withdraw the money and store it away for safekeeping. With the local secret services led by the crass foulmouth captain Sobczak Piotr Gowacki following there every move and such a withdrawal bound to cause a stir amongst the communist elite this wasn't just an ordinary bank operation but in essence was more of a heist.Krzystek knowingly avoided spicing up the entire plot with more ludicrous concepts instead sticking relatively close to the original caper which was pretty simple in execution and may have never worked were it not for unforeseen allies of the highest order working for the benefit of a free democratic Poland. This keeps the story face front bringing credence and realism into proceedings.

	onyx:emotionText "In the early 1980s the Solidarity movement was at its strongest forcefully creating an opposition to the communist government. While the international focus was placed on the workers like Lech Wasa who jumped over fences to punch straight at the crumbling system it was actually the intelligentsia of Wrocaw who arguably were the operational brains behind the defiance. The local Solidarity movement was run by Wadysaw Frasyniuk Filip Bobek who helped organise an underground movement that help the unionbased anticommunist force to survive delegalisation and persecution.Flung back into 19801981 we see the final moments that led to Russianinfluenced Warsaw government to enact martial law that brought about catastrophic political tidal waves throughout the country. Already most of the society was too embattled with everyday life struggles such as constant standing in line to buy a loaf of bread or some toilet paper a centrally imposed tactic employed in order to distract people from the struggle. With the State of Emergency about to crack down on opposition movements one of the dreariest periods in Polish communist was about to occur.Within this backdrop writerdirector Waldemar Krzystek delivers a political heist movie which incorporates history with a truly enthralling action. The story itself centres around four key figures of the Wrocaw Solidarity labour union namely Frasyniuk Jzef Pinior Krzysztof Czeczot Piotr Bednarz Maciej Makowski and Stanisaw Huskowski Wojciech Solarz. With a very downtoearth character presentation which presents them as ordinary blokes who per chance deem themselves obliged to stand up for the everyday citizen and initiate a systemic fight each separately being a small cog in a societal behemoth the union had 10 million members before delegalisation. When the local structures are informed by an enigmatic Tadeusz Marku Stary Mariusz Benoit that any day now the powers that be will clamp down on the opposition and instate a state of national emergency effectively cordoning off the country with the aid of Russian forces the key question remains how will Solidarity function in this quasiwar state? Necessity will force them into the underground but in order to have money for paper printing machines to forward the struggle and general operational funds  money will be a necessity. With Union funds counting at about 80 million zotys deposited in the state bank the easiest option was to withdraw the money and store it away for safekeeping. With the local secret services led by the crass foulmouth captain Sobczak Piotr Gowacki following there every move and such a withdrawal bound to cause a stir amongst the communist elite this wasn't just an ordinary bank operation but in essence was more of a heist.Krzystek knowingly avoided spicing up the entire plot with more ludicrous concepts instead sticking relatively close to the original caper which was pretty simple in execution and may have never worked were it not for unforeseen allies of the highest order working for the benefit of a free democratic Poland. This keeps the story face front bringing credence and realism into proceedings. The grey Polish outdoors of a communist winter are juxtaposed with the lighthearted heroes wider story of hope through perseverance and a competent if at times unpolished script. To the movie's credit we thankfully move away from the typical and so irritatingly widespread tendency to pompously eulogising the struggle instead bearing the nittygritty.

I wonder how comes that Linus Roache is not a bigger star after having made this film about one decade ago. He certainly deserves to be in the same line as some of his generation colleagues who have succeeded that well in American and world cinema. Yes the film is controversial you may not agree with some of the ideas and it looks sometimes as a cinema manifest but it is still a good and human film. I less liked the final which is the only place in the script where art logic seems to surrender to the religious concepts.  910 on my personal scale.".

The characters grow out of the situation in a way that's surprisingly organic in today's movie scene where often the plot seems to be incidental to the characters or vice versa. Regardless of your take on the issues I think you have to admire that they are being presented not just talked about and the film does an excellent job of balancing both the potential enormousness of the questions it raises and the intimate personal nature of its story. After the script another reason to love PRIEST is the performances it is one of those few movies where absolutely everyone is excellent from Roache and Wilkinson down to bit players like the irate Housekeeper at the priest retreat and the young reporter who tries to corner Roache after his hearing. The film is shot very well especially considering they could have gotten away with a fairly straightforward point and shoot but no we got so amazingly well framed shots of the North Sea England in winter industrial vistas... And yes whether you agree with its stance or not kudos to the movie for taking a plethora of tough subjects like homosexuality religious guilt incest and life on earth vs. life in heaven and dealing with them in a mature and often compassionate manner as opposed to say the way Kevin Smith deals with them in DOGMA.

	schema:reviewBody "I just caught this movie on cable and found it to be one of the most touching I've seen. I'm Roman Catholic and unless you are the type to blindly follow the tenants of your faith without question you will likely find the questions raised by this film familiar. It really makes no difference whether the Priest is gay or straight as human beings they are undoubtedly often caught between the desire to respond to normal human needs and the requirements of the church. And while the Catholic church provides the setting much of what the older priest says in his sermon regarding what God finds worthy of His attention can be applied to most any religion as can the discussion near the end between the angry parishioners and the younger priest upon his return from exile. There are some very emotional moments in the film not the least of which is the ending. As Catholics we tend to forget that priests are human beings. This movie shows us that they are. I will warn you that if you tend to cringe at the portrayal of gay attraction as I do you WILL find yourself doing so at various points in this film Brokeback Mountain has nothing on Priest but nothing is ever presented in poor taste or gratuitously in my opinion. A film definitely worth viewing.On a side note I counted at least 5 performers in Priest that also appear in The Full Monty. Guess they needed to do something a bit lighter after this one.".

There are some very emotional moments in the film not the least of which is the ending. As Catholics we tend to forget that priests are human beings. This movie shows us that they are. I will warn you that if you tend to cringe at the portrayal of gay attraction as I do you WILL find yourself doing so at various points in this film Brokeback Mountain has nothing on Priest but nothing is ever presented in poor taste or gratuitously in my opinion. A film definitely worth viewing.On a side note I counted at least 5 performers in Priest that also appear in The Full Monty. Guess they needed to do something a bit lighter after this one.";

	schema:reviewBody "From the symbolic introductory scene of Priest wherein an old wearylooking priest yanks a huge crucifix from the church altar proceeds to carry it through the streets of his impoverished town as if he were Jesus himself and proceed to bash through the door of his presbytery you know you're in for something different  stimulating controversial thoughtprovoking.  Priest is VERY MUCH that movie.The old priest's clerical replacement comes in the form of Father Greg Linus Roache in a starmaking role a young fairhaired boyishly handsome visionary who with typically youthful verve strives to bring the Catholic Church directly to the people well to the Catholics anyway and receives his actions with decidedly mixed feelings.  The older priest still in residence Father Matthew the excellent Tom Wilkinson who has long settled into amiable apathy inclines toward drink while maintaining a relatively clandestine relationship with his black attractively careworn housekeeper the underused Cathy Tyson.  There is initial friction as the Old and New Worlds collide.  Father Matthew dismisses Father Greg's modernistic sermons while Father Greg frowns upon Father Matthew's casual stance on papal celibacy.  Eventually we learn Father Greg has his own difficulty with celibacy...but with other men.As the story proceeds we are drawn into the emotional and moral struggles of Father Greg as he wrestles not only with his own social and spiritual ethics but those of his parish.  In one particularly chilling confessional scene a male member of the parish practically flaunts his sexual desires while justifying his incestuous advances toward his teenage daughter.Priest is an important ambitious project and yields emotional power in its depiction of moral adversity.  But it's a mixed blessing.  Some of the scenes come off overbaked and melodramatic while the resolution of the piece should be more powerful and less compromising instead it comes off manufactured and unrealistic hurting its overall impact.In fairness Priest does bring out the hypocrisy in both priests as well as the parish.  Nobody comes off saintly here just flawed and human.  An interesting binote is that there have been no comments in the fact that the elder priest is having a sexual relationship with a BLACK housekeeper. Forty years ago according to religious purists the Bible interpreted ethnically mixed relationships and marriages as abominations as well.  At least some headway HAS been made.Is Priest antiCatholic in its message?  To an extent yes.  The Catholic's Church's unyielding unprogressive medieval doctrines are brought to task here never more pointedly than in the scene where Father Greg agonizing over whether to prevent the continued sexual abuse of the young girl and report the father to authorities or respect the confidentiality of the confessional and remain silent reluctantly chooses the latter.While I deem this movie to be a stronger platform for social tolerance Priest' still drums home beautifully the message that organized religion is still used as a tool to govern instead of instill moral standards particularly in other countries and as a persecutive weapon against certain sectors of society that do not conform to those rigid standards.  As a consequence the Church has provided a comforting harbor and hazardous safety zone for certain acceptable bigotries.We need more brave topical films like Priest to confront such important social issues and display them frontandcenter.".

He meets up with Graham Robert Carlyle and they fall in lovebut Greg feels guilty about it. Also a young girl tells him in confession that her father is sexually using herbut he can't tell anybody. Slowly these two issues start to drive him crazy...Excellent drama. This was attacked by the Catholic church who didn't see it as being antiCatholic. Director Antonia Bird said she wasn't trying to blast the Catholic churchand she doesn't! She's pointing out some issues that the Catholic church has and should be dealt with. The church is not demonizedthey show the good and the bad. The film is wellwrittenI never thought theological discussions could be interesting but they are! Also they don't pull backthere is some extreme antigay language but it is needed for the story. The sex scenes between Carlyle and Roache are pretty tame thoughespecially in the American version where they're edited stupid censors!.The acting is superb. Carlyle is just excellent Wilkinson was also good but Roache is just incredible. You see the pain in his face and feel his struggle trying to reconcile his faith with his orientation. The most powerful sequence comes when he breaks down in front of a cross begging God to help him.I don't want to make it sound like this is all gloom and doom. There are some very funny moments mixed in too. The ending is sad but realistic unfortunately. A powerful and moving film. A mustsee. 10 all the way.".

	schema:headline " Very intelligent and beautiful piece of film making";
	schema:reviewBody "Priest by Antonia Bird is very beautiful and also provocative film about faith church forgiveness and tolerance which all have as many shapes as there are human beings. The film tells the story of a priest who arrives to new town and soon he notices some things he don't consider too acceptable and learns also that incredible and selfish evil lives inside every human being including himself.The film is a powerful study about religion and many ways to interpret and obey its orders. How can a priest do his good job as he is rotten and evil inside and there is always the chance of Sin lurking somewhere? The main point is that no human is purely good and without any flaws and everyone sins priests too. The purification can be reach only by forgiving and being tolerant and loving towards others and thus the peace of mind and happiness may be reached trying to be as good as human being can. Forgiveness and love are the most important things and the film ends in extremely beautiful scene at the church as at least one little person forgives the priest for his crimes and sees into the heart and soul of the priest. We cannot judge someone for something because there are no sinless people in the world. The narrowmindedness is one problem the film deals with and it is sad to see that these things take place in real life too. The film is very deep and beautiful and also funny and it unfolds more and more with each viewing time. This should be seen by persons who cannot forgive someone for something heshe has done. What is the benefit people think they get by not forgiving someone and hating someone? As I mentioned the power of love forgiveness and tolerance are the main themes of the film so there are no people in the world who this film cannot be recommended. This is like Abel Ferrara's and his screenwriter's work but not as fierce and relentless as their work. Priest is a little more restrained and easier for everyone to watch version of the themes of Ferrara and St. John.Remarkable beautiful touching and forces the viewer to think. 910 masterpiece.".

In between is a searing indictment of the outdated practices of the Catholic Church and its breeding of intolerance and hate. Father Greg Pilkington portrayed with astonishing clarity and mesmerizing gutwrenching passion by Linus Roache is a young idealistic priest who is more than a little putoff by his unorthodox partner Father Matthew Thomas a wonderful performance by the great Tom Wilkinson who sings karaoke at the neighborhood pub and sleeps with the housekeeper. But Father Greg's smug little world soon begins to spin out of control as he attempts to deal with his own homosexuality and with a heartbreaking secret learned by him in the confessional. Roache's breathtaking performance is palpable and eloquently harrowing as Father Greg becomes more and more tortured by guilt and grief. Also in the film in a winning endearing turn is Robert Carlyle one of Wilkinson's cohorts in 'The Full Monty' as Graham the object and the victim of Father Greg's affection. 'Priest' is a remarkable and revelatory piece of work intelligent and gripping and deeply felt. Highly highly recommended.".

The film raises many issues making the question of celibacy only one of many points. There is also hypocrisy homophobia shame incest...it runs the gamut of emotions. Tom Wilkinson is also brilliant as the parish rector who is having an affair with his housemaid Cathy Tyson. The deepseeded condemnation of Father Greg who truly wants to practice his religious faith but is shamed into a failed suicide attempt is maddening. The first stone is cast repeatedly and there are no easy conclusions. The film ends with a beautiful example of forgiveness and empathy. This is an excellent film.".

The deepseeded condemnation of Father Greg who truly wants to practice his religious faith but is shamed into a failed suicide attempt is maddening. The first stone is cast repeatedly and there are no easy conclusions. The film ends with a beautiful example of forgiveness and empathy. This is an excellent film.";

I'm gay and nearly became a missionary for a Protestant faith that has strong prohibitions against homosexuality so I can relate somewhat to Father Greg.  I think that the weaknesses of Priest lay in the subplots.  I was very disappointed in Father Matthew for his sexual relationship with the housekeeper and his unrepentant attitude.  Regardless of whether priests should be allowed to marry Father Matthew took a vow not to get sexually involved with someone so that he can devote himself more fully to his parish.  I think his maritalstyle relationship was a betrayal of the trust that his parish placed in him.  I also wasn't keen on Father Matthew's vulgar language during one of his sermons.  While I appreciated the sentiment I probably would have walked out too.  I very much liked Father Matthew however and his supportive relationship with Father Greg.  The subplot with the incestual molestation added some great drama but the dilemma about the confidentiality of confession borders on trite.  Priest movies are almost as certain to include this storyline as submarine movies are to include that slow terrifyingly tense descent below the maximum depth for which the sub was designed.What I love about this movie is that it really isn't about whether homosexuality is OK.  Father Greg never attempts to defend his fling with Graham.  He acknowledges that it was a mistake and even asks for the parish's forgiveness.  I think the movie is a story of human xenophobia people's paranoid reaction to something they don't or can't fully understand.  I think it's about the parish's venomous lashing out against Father Greg when they would have been much more understanding had he slept with a woman.  He'd be breaking the same vow either way but if he breaks it in a way that someone else can't relate to or understand then just cancel Christmas.I live in a very conservative college town whose students threw a fit when the the university's film club held screenings of this movie on campus.  I wish I had seen it back then.  I wish more people from this town had seen it.  The film doesn't argue for or against homosexuality.  I think you can watch this film without having your stance on the issue challenged.  The film is about people's failure specifically Christian people's failure to react in a way that is responsible and caring and forgiving toward a neighbor who makes a mistake that they may not be able to fully understand.".

It is here that Fathers Greg and Matthew lay out the simple arguments of pro and con that support the premise of this thoughtprovoking and intelligent film.Aside from a hokey scene where Greg sheds his Roman collar opening his closet to reveal a hidden black leather jacket oddly reminiscent of Barbara Gordon's Batgirl costume behind a revolving bookcase PRIEST doesn't make a false step even in it's sensual and delicately constructed sex scenes.At times PRIEST almost threatens to try to cover too much territory  a closeup of a girl alterserver is blessedly as far as female director Antonia Bird goes with the quandary of the role of women in clerical life.

Slightly resembling Montgomery Clift in I Confess Roache possesses a rare ability to totally inhabit his character and his acting is simply faultless. Tom Wilkinson too is in top form. For their performances alone Priest is most definitely a must see.";

	schema:reviewBody "Of the 150 or so Georges Simenon novels I've read STRANGERS IN THE HOUSE at least the English translation by Sainsbury would rank in the lower third. It's an excellent character studyas is virtually any Simenon workand the concept is interesting but it lacks suspense and ends with a whimper not a bang. The film also is an interesting character study of a man here Anglicized and played by James Mason who was once a brilliant attorney but after his wife left him he became jaded and turned to drink raising his daughter here played by Geraldine Chaplin on his own but remaining very distant from her to the point that she has a separate life as a lateteenager that is completely unknown to him even though it's happening within his own large home. One member of the gang she hangs out with is killed in the home her boyfriend is charged with the crime and Mason comes out of semiretirement to defend him cleaning up his life in the process and getting a new sense of spirit and motivation. The general plot of Simenon's book has been retained but most of the specifics have been changed and a number of new elements introduced. Mason is quite impressive both as a cynical alcoholic and as a man reclaiming his spirit and his youthful idealism. Geraldine Chaplin looks quite young here and does fine as the marginalized daughter who eventually begins to trust and even somewhat respect her father again. Bobby Darin is cast as some kind of thug sailor who is older and more experienced than the gang of teens but becomes a member of their group and who is very different from Big Louie the equivalent character in the novel. When I first saw this film about ten years ago Darin's performance reminded me somewhat of Robert DeNiro in TAXI DRIVER although this second time I've watched the film I see less similarity. Still Darin's character is brooding thuggish and repeats Ain't it so or Aint' that so throughout the movie the song of the same name by Eric Burdon and the Animals is played a few times throughout the film. Mr. Darin probably viewed this as a good opportunity to rebuild his acting career as a character actor he later played the gigolo in Richard Brooks' THE HAPPY ENDING see my review of that and he certainly creates a memorable character here as much as we might like to forget this annoying character!!! The weaknesses in the film are manysome sections move too slowly others move too fast and lack tension. The ending for instance is quite abrupt and not adequately build up to. Some members of the daughter's gang are played by actors who do not convincePaul Bertoya as Chaplin's boyfriend a Greek Briton who faces discrimination is awkward and hurts whatever scenes he is in. Worst of all there's a phony swinging sixties and hippie undercurrent here that's a total misfire. Many films made then that attempted to be hip did succeedBLOW UP for instance and there's a brief homage to BLOW UP in one scene hereI'll let you find it yourselfbut these twentythree year old teenagers are laughably UNhip. At least when the thirtyfive year old Bowery Boys were playing teenagers they did it for laughs and the actors were in on the joke too. Here it's just grating and ridiculous. The teenagers depicted in films such as RIOT ON SUNSET STRIP or MARY JANE are far more realistic than the ones here and neither of those films is a masterpiece although Mary Jane is quite underrated. And the identity of the killer is telegraphed so far in advance and his character is played so broadly that only someone sleeping through the film would NOT know who did it! On the whole I can't really recommend this film except for James Mason's performance. If you are at home recovering from the flu and will watch ANYTHING that's on this is probably better than an OPRAH or MAURY show but don't go out of your way to see it. And why Anchor Bay Video released this in its ROCK AND ROLL CINEMA series is beyond me! Trust me except for bits of the BurdonAnimals song played here and there in the movie there is no rock and roll content whatsoever.".

One day Chaplin's clique happens upon the offkilter and perverse Darin and before long the teens are gravitating towards him and exploring avenues better left untraveled.  This is best demonstrated when Darin turns up dead in Mason's attic!  When Bertoya is fingered for the murder Mason must put down the bottle and defend him not only to free an innocent defendant but to purge himself and win back the affection of Chaplin.  If the plot sounds straightforward it may be but the film is presented in a choppy flashbackfilled style with pretentious cameraangles and framing and groovy music and of course the peerless fashions and hairstyles of the day!  It also has what have to be among the speediest opening credits in film history!  Mason gives a very strong performance and is allowed some really amusing moments as he blithely criticizes the world around him and gives no credence to the societal structure which he had previously been a part of. His scenes in the courtroom in which he plays with paper clips instead of crossexamining witnesses are a gas.  Chaplin does a decent job as well and holds her own against the far more experienced Mason.  This teen performance is a little jarring following her work in the monumental Dr Zhivago but she fits it okay.  Darin smothered in pancake makeup and indulging himself in all sorts of far out dialogue and behavior dates pretty badly.  Bertoya a sort of Latin John Derek comes across well but never really went anywhere after this.  Veteran actress Jenkins is way over the top as his worried mother.  Ogilvy as a cultivated and snotty rich kid does a good job and enjoyed a lengthy career.  There are a host of other seasoned British actors on hand to lend a little class and interest to the proceedings.  Even though the abrupt editing and shifting time elements were cutting edge and more in line with what today's audience is used to these gimmicks actually create distance between the audience and the story rather than uniting the two.  Perhaps it is the execution of these elements rather than the approach itself which fails to create a fully cohesive piece. Still for Mason's work and for a glimpse into swinging London and the comparison with the old guard pillars of society this film does provide some interest.  There is also a serious case of panty lines on the guy in the I Hate You All Tshirt at the beginning.  Next time just go commando!".

	schema:headline " Best underrated scifi action classic Van Damme martial arts movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Cyborg 1989 is one of my favorite Van Damme underrated PostApocalypticScience Fiction Action movie from the late 80's. The film is Very fastpaced under 90 min. cool post apocalyptic setting very epic they are great villains in here Awesome ass kicking with the knife boots Great score Van Damme did a awesome job showing body languagepresence and I knew I wasn't the only one who thought Van Damme had a Badass walk. Very underrated indeed. JeanClaude Van Damme is still today one of my favorite action stars I absolutely love his movies from his golden years. I grew up watching Cyborg as a kid. The movie wasn't my favorite Van Damme movie. I did not watch this movie so many times on TV like I have watched other his movie that I love. Watching countless today this flick I fall in love with it and it become one of my favorite Van Damme movies.In the barbaric plagueridden wasteland of the 21st century a beautiful halfhuman cyborg carries information that can save civilization. But only the strength and cunning of a lone warrior JeanClaude Van Damme can deliver her and her vital data from the clutches of the unspeakable Flesh Prates. That is the main plot about this film that it also involves revenge and the human character played by Van Damme which his character has a heart! I absolutely love Cyborg. JeanClaude Van Damme did a solid job acting in this movie which I thought was very brilliant and very fast paced. Sort of the movie reminds me on Mad Max 1  2 which I absolutely love those movies and Conan the Barbarian 1982 with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role. Because Fender kills Gibson's family and Gibson goes out for a revenge. He travels in the post apocalyptic world in which a plague known as the living death cripples civilization. When Gbson Van Damme was tied and was hanging from the mast watching into the sky the similar scene was used in Conan the Barbarian even Conan was looking for the people who killed his family. That is why Cyborg reminds me on these movies they are my favorite. As a kid I still remember seeing the VHS cover in the store of Cyborg and I was impressed. I could watch this movie countless times. I hope I could get this movie on Bluray someday but that will be really hard.Considering its' low budget it's an entertaining flick. Great fights cool villain great scenes like the 'crucified scene'... I seriously love Van Damme's kicks with boot knife. I love when Van Damme yells FENDEEEERRR... The final fight between Gibson and Fender was absolutely epic. The similar scene was also in Universal Soldier. I think cyborg is a bad ass film from Cannon Group. It is a shame that they can't make any movies today anymore.I can say something about the actors and the whole cast crew Beside loving Van Damme in here actress Deborah Richter as Nady Simmons the girl who helps Van Damme killing Fender Vincent Klyn and finding Pearl Dayle Haddon a female cyborg caring a cure did a terrific job she was very awesome gorgeous and very beautiful sexy. Haley Peterson as Haley the sister of murdered family by Fender was extremely gorgeous and fast feisty sexy babe on the screen ever. Vincent Klyn as Fender the leader of pirates was a real bad ass villain ever. I wish they would make movies like this today! About the sequels I don't care they all suck ass! Once I watch Cyborg 2 with Angelina Jolie and Elias Koteas and that movie sucked! Director Albert Pyun made a great job as the director. He directed terrific the angles of the picture.Cyborg is a 1989 science fiction post apocalyptic film starring JeanClaude Van Damme as a mercenary who while traveling the wasteland of what was the Eastern United States finds himself protecting a woman who could hold the key to restoring humanity. The film was directed by Albert Pyun. More action and high flying kicks nothing new except for a fun plot...to this day I still choose this movie over any other pointless movies that lead to nowhere. This movie get's a perfect 10 by me. I love this flick to death!".

I thought the costumes which people seem to call them were very well created and lots of thought went into every costume. I didn't see one single flaw in the production. I thought the freehanded and airbrushed visual of a deteriorating city at the opening credits was very creative and interesting.There's something different about this films footage I cant tell if its the kind of film they used but it seems very contrasty and almost has a grainy kind of look to it but very hard to explain. You'll recognize it as being unique when you see it. The chase scene where van damme fights 2 pirates in a swamp and then gets captured is phenomenal. The camera angles and shots were fantastic and the crossbow crucifiction only makes it sweeter! haha Van damme hits his acting stride in this movie and really manages to convey the emotion in his revenge. Especially the part where he chops down the cross with his heel to escape his soon coming death.The best asset in this movie is the well designed apocalypse city sets and the 2 story abandoned building set complete with pillaging pirates. The music and whatever that cape brandishing maniac was saying was outright terrible but if your not a jerk you'll understand why this movie deserves an eight out of ten.".

A woman named Nady Deborah Richter convinces Gibson to rescue Pearl  potentially help save the human race from extinction...Directed by Albert Pyun Cyborg was his breakthrough film he has since gone on to make dozens of awful scifi horror type films  is probably one of the worst genre director's ever right down there with Jim Wynorski  Jesus 'I have no talent' Franco. One of the first things that stands out about Cyborg is that it stars a young looking JCVD while this was released the same year as Kickboxer 1989 it was that film which basically made JCVD a star  not Cyborg so I guess that's one less thing to hate it for. The script by Kitty Chalmers is a sort of post apocalyptic action film that takes itself very seriously  is almost totally devoid of any sort of meaningful story. Cyborg is one of the most threadbare excuses of a film I've seen in a while the story revolves around the whole clichd post apocalyptic scenario where the world is in ruins there are few survivors there are large groups of bandits  scavengers who kill  steal  of course there's the lone hero the man who does what's right in a world gone to hell  yes you've guessed it he has even suffered from some kind of personal loss! Wow I'm not being funny here but Cyborg leaves no post apocalyptic clichd unused from abandoned buildings run down towns dirty futuristic costumes  one mans fight against evil. We've seen it all before  done much much better. Just watch one of the Mad Max trilogy as they are all far superior to this the character's are poor with little or no motivation or background there's barely any dialogue in it  what little story it tries to tell is shown through a collection of badly edited flashbacks littered throughout the film's scant 80 odd minute duration  even at only 80 minutes it felt much longer which is not a good sign.Director Pyun has made a career from making low budget crap  guess what? Cyborg pretty much proves he started out making low budget crap because it's well low budget crap the weapon of choice in the future is a paintball gun!. All the sets look really cheap the locations don't look post apocalyptic either they look exactly like what they are an abandoned factory some woods  a rundown building! The action scenes are not that great the editing is very choppy although I suspect that many of the more violent scenes were cut  according to the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section for Cyborg that appears to be very much the case. The special effects aren't too bad there's some OK matte paintings  some alright cyborg robotics effects as well. Cyborg was the film which finally bankrupt the infamous Cannon Films run by Yoram Globus  Menahem Golan as it was their last theatrically released film. Apparently Cyborg was written with the intent to use the sets  costumes that had been made for the planned Masters of the Universe 1987 sequel  a liveaction SpiderMan film which were both canned after Cannon Films suffered financial problems  Cyborg was written  made to utilise the money already spent.With a supposed budget of about 1800000 Cyborg looks really cheap on too many occasions it's competent but pretty bland  lifeless. The acting isn't up to much not that anyone is given much to do because of the very sparse script JCVD is no better or worse than usual Vincent Klyn who was apparently recognised as one of the worlds best surfers in the 80's has gone on to appear in eleven other Albert Pyun films which says how much of a career he has had since this.Cyborg is an average post apocalyptic action film it's watchable on a dumb level  there are one or two good moments but the story is so poor  the setpieces aren't that great so overall I didn't hate it but I didn't really like it either. Followed by the unconnected Cyborg 2 1993  Cyborg 3 The Recycler 1994.".

	schema:headline " Better than usual for Albert Pyun but...";
	schema:reviewBody "Produced in the dying years of Cannon films directed by Albert Pyun starring an early Van Damme claiming to be the first hero of the 21st century claiming to be a post apocalyptic battle and with the title Cyborg somehow I don't think it will bring many to a state of disbelief when I announce that it's a very poor film. Cheap and tacky in every area unless you're a huge fan of Van Damme it really should be avoided.For Albert Pyun in the 80's and early 90's a post apocalyptic movie was just an excuse to avoid any expense for sets and have a bunch of goons in ragged clothes running around large areas of open land or empty buildings. The post apocalyptic world Cyborg takes place in was filmed in North Carolina and looks likeuhNorth Carolina. There is action but it's all rather dull and extremely forgettable and the overly dramatic musical score which accompanies it is extremely irritating. Plus there's no buildup to them just randomly thrown together which throws away any excitement they may have had. On the plus side the fights aren't half as bad as those I've seen in later Albert Pyun movies but Van Damme has done a lot better.As far as acting goes you'll get zero. Not that you'd expect award winning performances in a movie like this but still Van Damme has absolutely minimal dialogue and could pass off for somebody who doesn't speak any English simply being told to speak his lines phonetically. He is that poor but at least it's evidence enough that he has tried in later movies. I do find many of his movies entertaining this isn't one of them. The villains are the complete opposite and they overact and make embarrassing howling and screaming when fighting Van Damme without being remotely scary in the least. Although it certainly doesn't say much for the state of humanity if the world was to be under threat for a second from these clowns!The post apocalyptic genre is generally one of the weakest in the field of Bmovies with the likes of Steel Frontier being one of the few exceptions and this is just about as poor as it gets. Not good enough to be worth watching or not even bad enough to be funny. At best it's tedious and dull so unless you're a huge fan of Van Damme I recommend you to stay away. On the plus side it remains the best film by schlock director Albert Pyun I've seen to date but that's probably even more of a reason to avoid it than anything else.".

	onyx:emotionText "Produced in the dying years of Cannon films directed by Albert Pyun starring an early Van Damme claiming to be the first hero of the 21st century claiming to be a post apocalyptic battle and with the title Cyborg somehow I don't think it will bring many to a state of disbelief when I announce that it's a very poor film. Cheap and tacky in every area unless you're a huge fan of Van Damme it really should be avoided.For Albert Pyun in the 80's and early 90's a post apocalyptic movie was just an excuse to avoid any expense for sets and have a bunch of goons in ragged clothes running around large areas of open land or empty buildings. The post apocalyptic world Cyborg takes place in was filmed in North Carolina and looks likeuhNorth Carolina. There is action but it's all rather dull and extremely forgettable and the overly dramatic musical score which accompanies it is extremely irritating. Plus there's no buildup to them just randomly thrown together which throws away any excitement they may have had.

It tries so hard to be a mix of Mad Max and Highlander with a pinch of The Terminator but throwing in some characters taken from that Michael Jackson's video called Thriller with obvious paintings in the background.The only redeeming feature is the roundhouse kicks in slow motion... Even the fights are pathetic with stupid overuse of knives while they have big guns hanging on their backs. Oh and guess what? The movie is called Cyborg but Van Damme is not a cyborg nor his opponents! The only cyborg here is a second line woman who actually does not behave as a cyborg at all. She is just a woman with some kind of electronic implant in her head an implant that wasn't even necessary to begin with. She could have had a device in her pocket and it would have been the same. The title for this should be Zombies since most of the characters look and act like that.More about women... The Van Damme's buddy is an ugly whiny woman I hated from the start. I found myself cheering the moments she seemed to be killed. I didn't hate her because she was ugly but because she was annoying as hell. Not even her gratuitous nudity is enjoyable. And what about that girl who is supposed to be Van Damme's stepdaughter? She is about 12 in the flashbacks but later she is in her 20's and Van Damme looks exactly the same! What the hell? Van Damme doesn't age in the movie or what?You will enjoy this movie only if you take it as a comedy. In any case it is quite boring and slow with almost no dialogue. Oh! And be prepared for the tons of synthesized music that screams 80's and makes the movie instantly outdated!".

Perhaps somebody was expecting to see The King's Speech and got disappointed there is no too much dialog. What dialog do you expect from someone running for their lives?! I thought the JCVD character of a tired man still fighting on the edge of his strength was really well conveyed. Fender was cool as hell. The women were pretty memorable and unique. The pirate's act of meaningless but aesthetic movements and screams were very cool and entertaining. Cheesy sells... If you don't know this watch Titanic and look at it's sales.

Sure! he's a pitiful actor who should have his lines cut down to almost nothing but he sure as hell can sell a fight scene.  This movie is no exception. He won't win any academy awards with his performance but he does sell the i'm super ped and your gonna die look pretty well.  That being the major reason why i enjoy the film.  So if your looking for some solid fight scenes without a hole lot of plot i highly recommend the movie.

It was exciting and scary back then somewhat similar to the depressing soviet movies of the late 80s with a creepy synthesized soundtrack about the rise of crime breakdown of society etc.Right now it doesn't feel quite so good because it enforces the idea of revenge and hate though hidden under the pretense to save humanity.A Christian must understand this and instead should strive to follow Jesus' teaching to love our enemies and leave the justice to God as clarified by saint PaulDo not take revenge my friends but leave room for God's wrath for it is written It is mine to avenge I will repay says the Lord. Romans 1219An interesting idea are the present Christian symbols  crosses crucifixion references to hell a wonder of fast healing. It seems the original idea of the film was more about the battle of God's forces vs satanic forces though later converted mostly to a scifimartial arts B movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film may be interesting for those who like dark postapocalypse martial arts 80s electronic soundtrack and some Christian allusions.I've seen this movie before by God's grace I became a Christian. It was exciting and scary back then somewhat similar to the depressing soviet movies of the late 80s with a creepy synthesized soundtrack about the rise of crime breakdown of society etc.Right now it doesn't feel quite so good because it enforces the idea of revenge and hate though hidden under the pretense to save humanity.A Christian must understand this and instead should strive to follow Jesus' teaching to love our enemies and leave the justice to God as clarified by saint PaulDo not take revenge my friends but leave room for God's wrath for it is written It is mine to avenge I will repay says the Lord. Romans 1219An interesting idea are the present Christian symbols  crosses crucifixion references to hell a wonder of fast healing. It seems the original idea of the film was more about the battle of God's forces vs satanic forces though later converted mostly to a scifimartial arts B movie.";

	schema:headline " Sometimes Simple is Best";
	schema:reviewBody "Cyborg is pure SciFi for the old school of tin foil sticky back plastic and silver spray paint specialeffects team. Sets range from rubbish tips to derelict buildings and sewers there's no complex story lines to dwell on. Just a plague induced apocalypse and a personal vendetta for justice to set the backdrop for some of the greatest choreographed fight scenes of alltime. A nobody cast of big body nasties who look the part and have little to no dialogue. It's this perfect brew that allows the directors vision to come through unadulterated and yet in spite of it's simplicity Cyborg manages to be deep and meaningful for those who care to look. For example in the closing scene upon delivering the cure Gibson refuses the hospitality of those in Atlanta stating to his partner we're needed out there let's go. Also Gibson's vendetta towards Fender is for revenge for the murder of his adopted family and the attempted murder of himself. This narrative is told through flashbacks throughout the movie in which he recalls his surrendering his way of life as a Slinger laying down his arms to live a life of peace with the woman who has taken him as her husband and the children who have taken him as a father figure to them. Their murder is recalled by Gibson as he hangs from the crucifix crafted by Fender's cronies it is his recollection of laying injured at the bottom of a well alongside their corpses and his realization that he IS still alive that prompts him to climb despite his injuries despite his grief toward the daylight and in defiance of the evil of the world in which he lives fight for life and civilization and this in turn spurs him to fight free from the crucifix on which he hangs. This is to me symbolic in a religious sense a man put to death on the cross returning to claim victory over his enemies. Also it speaks of the indomitable human spirit that refuses to admit defeat Gibson's chosen life as a Slinger which his murdered spouse questions as little better than that of the Pirates. Gibson could just as easily join a pirate gang and become party to their evil if he were willing to sell his soul and take pleasure in the pain of others yet he chooses to retain his individuality and in turn his integrity.There's nothing to not love about this movie if you want a kick arse no brainer action movie you got it but if you care to look you've got great action to keep you entertained underwritten with a deeper lesson about the human spirit to survive.".

I liked a lot of his movies like Hard Target Sudden Death Kickboxer Bloodsport Death Warrant Universal Soldier In Hell etc but if there was one movie I had to single out as Van Damme's worst it would have to be Cyborg.Story GibsonJean Claude Van Damme is out for revenge after a gang of punks lead by FenderVincent Klynkilled his family. He ends up having to look after a cyborg that holds a cure for a disease that has wiped out half of the world.We could talk about how bad the acting is but that's preaching to the choir. The sets look like crap and the whole film reeks of low budget. The villain Fenderwho looks like a rejected Garbage Pail Kid wins the ham of the year award in 1989 hands down. He is some cornball that beats up on people and is used to spouting silly lines like take you to the murder show and I like the pain I like the misery I like this wooooorrrld!. The fights sceneswhich are usually the bread and butter of JCVD movies suck horribly and top it off the movie is boring. Everybody looks like they've been mud wrestling all day and for a hero of the movie Gibson spends most of the time getting his butt kicked. The final battle between Gibson and Fender is downright cheesyand not in a fun way I might add. In short Cyborg is JCVD's worst movie and yes I've seen The Order Street Fighter and Universal Soldier The Return. Even JCVD most cheesiest films have an entertainment value to them but not Cyborg. Its a boring mess that is quite possibly the worst postapocalyptic film of all time. I guess I shouldn't expect a decent film under the same director that gave you Adrenalin Fear The Rush.".

Van Damme got so freaking lucky by having that music on the film too. the best part of the soundtrack is when they're running away from the Fender gang and they get to the water i like the punching bass part on that even the music matches when they kick and use their weapons it's pretty good.

	schema:reviewBody "Albert Pyun's Cyborg 1989 stars JeanClaude Van Damme as Gibson who is a lonely avenger in the postapocalyptic future world in which sadistic hooligans kill and torture people in Mad Max tradition. Damme's character is after the bad guy who killed his family and the film follows his quest to capture and vengeance the ugly baddie and his thugs. What follows is the usual Damme action with plenty of kicks and hits.This film is technically occasionally interesting but for most of the time just stupid and unintentionally trashy. The editing in the action scenes is irritatingly restless and pointless as the film tries to show many things with these fast edits but manages in fact to show only less by these too plenty edits. The cinematography is occasionally almost great and the long segment at the abandoned storehouse offers a great opportunity to use camera with space and thankfully Pyun can use his camera and make his films look professional and interesting and that storehouse segment is definitely among the more interesting in this film. Otherwise the acting is the usual Damme level and the baddies are very irritating as they yell and scream without any point like some drunken indians. As an action scifi this is grade B but fortunately directed with skill so it is pleasant thing to watch if one can stand the stupidities and hollowness of this film.There's plenty of violence in forms of kicking hitting punching slashing snapping and so on so this is no less violent than your average SeagalDammeNorris vehicle which always tend to share these same no brains elements but also sometimes something cinematically noteworthy and interesting. Cyborg gets 410 from me and I would've given it much more if it had at least some point and less stupidities in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "By far my favourite film I've seen so far this year A Screaming Man is an extremely captivating and thought provoking film that doesn't have to try too hard to get its ideas across. I think it says a lot without having to say so much and in that simplicity the viewer can find a whole world of complexities lying under the characters and their tale. I don't know why but this film just really spoke to me on a lot of levels as a employee as a son and as a man. I'm really glad to have decided to check it out as I had originally thought this film would be unrealisable to me and possibly boring but it's quite the opposite It's a film I'm going to be thinking about for quite some time and engaged me thoughtfully the entire way through.Meet Adam he's is fiftyfive years old and has spent thirty of those as the pool manager at the nearby hotel in an unknown village in the country of Chad. Adam is content with his life as it keeps him considerably happy and even allows for his son to have a job as his assistant. But all of that changes when the hotel changes hands to new owners unfortunately they do not see the worth in this long time employee and former swimming champion. Complacency gets the best of Adam when he is informed he no longer the pool assistant and instead manning the front gate of the hotel. This shift to a job he does not like is further impacted by jealousy as he watches his son take over the position he never wished to give up. What is more is that Adam's village is become a more hostile place by the day as warring rebels seem to draw closer to home. It is here that Adam makes a regretful choice with the leader of the resistance movement leading to the heartbreak for himself and his family. Can Adam learn to accept his fate and make better the things he did to try and divert it or will he be lost in the growing turmoil of war and suffering that will leave him A Screaming Man? Wow I did not expect this movie to be this way. I actually thought this film would be slightly jarring given the title but no real screaming or profuse anger exists here the screaming is done within the mind. And what a mind to try and unravel Adam is easily one of the years best characters and performances. It's certainly a quiet performance but it says so much without having to I really enjoyed that about the character he wasn't entrenched in some well said dramatic dialogue instead it's felt and experienced along with the character. Youssouf Djaoro is ridiculously on point with the role capturing all the confliction and anger of Adam in a single glance I really felt for and rallied behind this person from the start easily the best performance I've seen this year just so perfectly done. The story itself is surprising and the emotions presented within feel really honest. The film also allows for brilliant moments of humour and introspection to go along with its more serious events and the world around Adam is smartly realized. The pacing of the film is really solid and the direction is flat out brilliant the story wouldn't of worked without director MahamatSaleh Haroun eye for nuance and simplistic effectiveness. I found parts of the film quite intense though there is little action in the film the title of the film is apt in that way no one screams but the strength of the story doesn't require them too it is written all over their faces with brilliant ability. I only really take issue with the ambiguous ending which left me confused at the films final events I suppose it's open to interpretation this way but I think it wasn't really necessary perhaps the director felt without it the film would seem clich but I found everything up to that point brutally original and eye opening. Overall I just really loved the story and a better film could not be made from it this is a very close call with cinematic perfection in my eyes and one that will most likely to remain at the top of my list come years end quite happy to have been afforded the opportunity to travel the dusty roads and narrow alleys with this character. If I can track down a copy to buy I most certainly will by it without hesitation.So I truly do recommend this film as a great example of effective filmmaking. I didn't know what I was going to get with this one but the results we're overwhelming in a good way. If you get a chance to see this film do not pass it up as far as dramatic films go for the year this is among the best you'll find. Unfortunate that it's joint sponsorship will make it ineligible for consideration in the AMPAS foreign film category perhaps a group such as the Hollywood foreign press Golden Globes who define the category as foreign Language will show it some love. Either way A Screaming Man is an extremely well played meditation on what it is like to have your world flipped upside down in a heartbeat and how one makes amends with the unpredictability of life. Highly Recommended.".

But as civil war slowly envelopes both the country and the film it is Adam's aka The Champ son Abdel who is causing turmoil for his father.As it's noticed by the foreign hotel ownermanagers that Adam is taking things more leisurely these days and he gets shuffled over to gate duty dolled up in a starched uniform his son gets his old job. This naturally causes ripples and resentment that go beyond the Hotel.This beautifully shot movie from director MahamatSaleh Haroun is more observational than it is about making statements and stuffing opinion down on us. The story and the characters unfold naturally we can take it at the steady pace that it is set and enjoy it as such. Or you can really dig yourself deep within the different culture and attitudes to status relationships Imperialism and War and soak it all up. I hope to do the latter when I watch it again via the recording I made of it.However it is the final 15 20 minutes that turn this drama into something much more profound and moving. I promise you you will change your seated position clear your throat and maybe inwardly murmur something to yourself as you sense a change of the overall stature is increased.I'm not saying that A Screaming Man has to be seen by everybody or that it is the best Foreign language film of that year. It's different enough to get noticed is topical without trying TOO hard and we are rewarded with a final chapter that is undoubtedly emotionally very moving. That's not a bad combination....".

And while I would recommend you see it it's the sort of film that most folks simply wouldn't sit through and SHOULD have been better.The movie is set in Chad. It appears to be sometime around the present day though this is uncertainas civil wars have been going on in the country off and on for decades and WHICH one this is isn't explained. This isn't really a problemjust go with it. The story centers around an older man nicknamed 'Champ' as he was a Central African swimming champion back in the 1960s. His job since has been to work as a pool attendant at a resort in his country. While to Westerners this might seem like a dull or unimportant job it was everything to Champstability and a sense of importance. And when his boss began firing and rearranging things at the resort Champ is panicked when they decide to have Champ's son take over the job alone they'd both been working together and move Champ to the job of gate keeper. What Champ does to cope with this is fascinating and makes for an interesting twist but unfortunately though MOST of the film Champ just keeps silent and broods. There is almost no visible emotion at alljust brooding and silence. And after a while the film gets VERY difficult to continue watching because of this. However if you've invested this much time in the film keep watchingthe ending though very sad does tie everything together well. My overall verdict is that with more energy and life this could have been an amazingly good film. Now however it's interesting to very patient folks onlywhich is sad as we never get to see films about Chad and its people.".

Extract from Aim Csaire's poem Notebook of a Return to the Native Land 1939Chadian filmmaker MahamatSaleh Haroun's fourth feature tells the story of Adam or The Champ Youssouf Djaoro as he is also known a former swimming champion in his mid fifties who works as a hotel pool attendant a job in which he takes immense pride. Adam's closest colleague is his son Abdel Dioucounda Koma a twenty year old who documents every day of his life with his camera. Father and son make a harmonious pair and their family is a happy one despite an intensifying civil war and the plans to privatise the hotel where they work. That is until the day the hotel management's cutbacks hit the family and Abdel is made pool attendant in his father's place. The looming threats of armed rebels approaching the city offers an unfortunate opportunity for Adam to restore himself or at least that is what he whose identity is intrinsically tied to his job and his past achievements thinks.A Screaming Man talks about loss of self not as a consequence of happenings beyond our control but of the choices we make when life throws us off guard. Life continues says David Marius Yelolo the hotel chef and Adam's close friend who is among the first to be affected by the downsizings. Both men struggle to come to terms with the realisation that their passion and zest for life is of little value to anyone but themselves. The problem David concludes is that we put our destiny in God's hands  a God he still believes in but in whom he has lost faith  thus implying that there is room for human intervention regardless of the magnitude of the challenges we face. That it is in fact up to ourselves to decide what kind of person we want to be and how to express and live up to the decision once it has been made.Adam's wife Hadje Fatime N'Goua scolds both her husband for having changed when he meets danger with passivity and the invisible neighbour who thinks nothing of asking for favours without ever offering anything in return. She knows that there is pride in cooking in singing and in caring and providing for one's family. In having a purpose and in trying to be the best one can be. And she knows that inherent in pride is the sense of dignity that helps us to treat others and ourselves with respect. Just before we lose ourselves we lose the little things the subtle detail the unsaid and the almost unnoticed like the acts of saying thank you after supper. Haroun evokes the ordinary not horror or deprivation which he merely illustrates by the absence of what used to be. The civil war like the rationalising process at the hotel is but a backdrop and a circumstance not a defining factor.In his characteristic careful and understated manner MahamatSaleh Haroun shares the secret behind a decent life with an audience who has time for the mundane and the slow unfolding of seemingly undramatic events brimful with meaning. A secret spelled dignity and pride be it that of a father a professional or a frightened man who has decided that his best years are behind him.Talented South African filmmaker Khalo Matabane once tweeted Great art speaks to the essence of what it is to be a human being not only material and physical aspirations but existential too. A perfect description of A Screaming Man a brilliant work of art in its own right and in the way the film relates to its characters' ability and need for full selfexpression through cooking singing swimming or tending to a pool.This and other reviews available on the blog In The Words of Katarina wordsofkatarina.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The Chadian film Un homme qui crie was shown in the U.S. with the translated title A Screaming Man 2010. The movie was written and directed by the Chadian filmmaker MahamatSaleh HarounYoussouf Djaoro portrays Adam Ousmane who is called Champion. When he was younger he won the Central African swimming championship and the name has stayed with him. His son Abdel Ousmane Diouc Koma works with his father in a highend hotel in the nation's capital. Both of them work at the hotel's swimming pool where Adam is respected and Abdel is adored by everyone because of his good looks and his easygoing manner.This movie reminded me of a Greek tragedy. That's not because the father and son come into unwilling conflict but because Adam has to make a choice between two terrible options. How can you do the right thing if either path you choose is the wrong path? When there are two compelling demands and each precludes the other what happens to the protagonist?Adam is caught in just such a situation. There's a war going on and the local political boss demands payment to the government. Adam although not poor doesn't have the money to make the payment. What are his options?This movie is worth seeing on its own merits. That fact that it's from Chad makes it even more important to view it. If I counted correctly less than a dozen films have been made in Chad. The superb Dryden Theatre at The Eastman Museum in Rochester is showing five of these movies as part of a MahamatSaleh Haroun retrospective. My compliments to the Dryden for giving us the opportunity to see these movies on the large screen. Some of Haroun's films are available for the small screen but some are not. Seeing these movies on the large screen was truly a privilege. Un homme qui crie is a great filmsee it if you can. P.S. Even with the resources of the Eastman Museum a print of Haroun's Bye Bye Africa couldn't be located. If you know someone who has a print of that movie please notify the Dryden Theatre.".

I understand that slow movies still have a meaning and a story behind them but it did not seem so as much in this film. It was not that clear to me how Abdel manages to take his dads job. How did it happen? What did he do? Because I know they called Adam into to office to ask if two worker were to many people for the pool and he said no it was a good amount of people. So I am assuming Abdel was like I think two people is one to many. The movies was full of selfish characters to me. Abdel took his dads job and his dad gets sent to work at the gate. Adam is not a fan of this and then gets him drafted into the civil war. This means that Adam gets his job back. He basically murdered his own son by sending him into the civil war. You can tell the movie is not an American movie y how slow it is. American movies move at a much faster rate. While I was watching the film I noticed globalization the women from China was the head of a hotel in Chad. If I was to put myself in the shoes of one of the characters. I would have made it so Abdel as told the women from China that they needed two workers by the pool because that would have solved many conflicts throughout the film. If I could have changed the ending I would have made it so that the son does not die and that the family gets back together and Abdel's son is born.".

This triggers his silence and eventually the son is taken by the army and is drafted and the father does nothing to try and stop it. I believe this was out of greed and selfishness. The father let his son be taken so that he would get his life guard job back and to me that is ridiculous. I think this because later in the movie he regrets his decision and claims that he was wrong. He goes to save his son but he is greatly injured and on the ride back he dies.

Some different short scenes seemed very unnecessary with the lack of actual relevant talk about the true message and reason for the movie. For example when they were eating dinner the scene seemed to simply just drag on with long silences and uninteresting small talk. It was a little weird how Champ decided to send his son off to the war. Then he wanted to go back and rescue his son later on in the movie. I also was not a huge fan of the ending. I found it weird that he found his son dead when driving home. After that he laid with his son's dead body watching the water. Though it may have been symbolic I was a little creeped out by the whole idea. There were also a lot of questions that went unanswered. The whole war got brushed under the rug when it appeared to be getting pretty serious. People were fleeing the country due to the big war but nothing was mentioned about what happened.".

The contradictions in this film is if his father Adam sent him to the army for sacrifice or if he did that for selfish reasons to get his pool job back.

Another thing I noticed that was very interesting was that there were very little characters. There were maybe around 6 actors that actually contributed to the main plot. This was also similar to Ixcanul as there were 4 main characters the mom the daughter the dad and the daughter's husband. Something that really estranged me in the film was when Abdel's girlfriend came to his house. His parents didn't even know he had a girlfriend by the looks of it and then proceed to take her in as their daughter. I just don't understand why they did that. Doesn't she have parents too? Some thing I liked about the film were its simplicity and some of the views of what its like in Africa as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Screaming Man directed by Mahamat Saleh Haroun depicts the struggles of a Chadian man during the recent Civil War. Adam commonly referred to as Champ is a Chadian father who works at a pool for the local hotel with his son Abdel. Almost immediately into the movie Champ is approached by the management of the hotel and asked if the pool tending is a oneman job. Eventually his son takes over the job per the hotel management's directions and Champ is forced to be a gatekeeper thus taking his friend's job. Later Abdel is drafted into the army to fight for the Civil War this lets Champ regain his job at the pool. Then due to the problems from the war and the hysteria it created Champ is the only worker who shows up to the hotel to work. Another plot twist occurs when a mysterious girl who we later find out is Abdel's girlfriend of one year appears at Champ's house. While learning of his new daughter Champ develops a plan to help steal his son from the army. Champ then executes his plan and he steals Abdel from the frontlines and drives him back to the house. Eventually Abdel dies from wounds and tells his father to float him down a river. Throughout the movie silence during scenes is use to help further emotions and maybe even drive anticipation. This part of the movie makes the movie where slow and boring. I would not recommend this movie to those who are not accustomed to slow un American movies. This movie really opened my eyes to the different varieties of movies out in the world as I have never watched a movie that utilizes silence so often.".

I don't think that we realize how much time alone as humans we actually have and how much silence we actually have in our lives and this movie was basically a reflection of that. It seemed slow because we are used to seeing fast paced American movies that are made to keep your attention. During this movie I was not entertained the entire time but that is okay because we are not entertained in everyday life all the time. I felt bad for Adam because he was so sad and I could tell he felt really bad for sending Abdel into the military. Although I do not agree with his choice to do that I can understand why he did it since he was in a bad state of mind and also very poor. Sometimes people make choices in the moment for their own benefit that they do not know will turn out badly which is what I think Adam did but he didn't mean to make things worse. I didn't like however when Abdel's girlfriend was crying on the bed and he covered her mouth muting her screams. At first I thought he was trying to kill her or hurt her in some way which made me uncomfortable. I did like the scene when he put Abdel's body into the water and it faded out. I thought that was a really pretty and peaceful way to end such a thoughtful movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Screaming Man is a very slow paced movie but I feel it is necessary to get the point across of all the emotion. I had trouble keeping up with the slow pace as I am used to movies that have something going on every five seconds. The movie starts off with Adam who is the father of Abdel and he works at the pool with his son. The hotel they work out is beginning to fire the older workers that do not do as much for the hotel and Adam fears that he will lose his job at the pool. After his interview with the lady in charge of the hotel he is confident that his place will remain the same at the pool. His son Abdel also speaks to the manager and becomes distant for the rest of the day to Adam as Abdel soon replaces his father and becomes solely responsible for the pool. Adam is moved to the front gate. During all of this there is a war going on between the army and the rebels. Everyone is being forced to help the army either by money or giving up a son. Due to Adam's anger about losing his position at the pool he offers his son up to the army. His son is taken and eventually Adam is torn apart as he realizes that Abdel has a girlfriend who is pregnant and that he tore apart the family. He goes to retrieve Abdel but he is badly injured and eventually dies as they arrive to a nearby river. To me the ending means Abdel was killed by what Adam loves most which is swimming and now to pay for it he loses his son. I would recommend seeing this movie Even though I just gave most of it away.".

This is the most satisfying of his four films. It is nearly perfect.Every detail of the protagonist's life  Adam  stands for Chad's struggles Tension between the new age of technology and the older perspectives that are seen as unnecessary to a brave new world that includes colonisation by stealth from China in the form of business investments. From factional fighting that would destroy the country and its young men while making refugees of the rest of the population. To questions about the wisdom of the elders and faith in God. It is not just Adam who screams but Chad. I will not elaborate on the story because other reviewers have fulfilled that role. The story is only one element of the plot as there is the political subtext as well as personal suffering that the director serves hence the film's epilogue.Youssouf Djaoro is the tall charismatic actor who plays Adam in all his complexities. His is a fine and nuanced performance. The decisive moment in the film where father betrays son was artful as the camera moves in slowly towards Djaoro's inscrutable face. It is a profound betrayal of much that Adam and so Chad were invested in. It is terribly sad as is the consequences of the betrayal again delivered in an acutely poignant manner.The film is slow and still. It requires attention to the little that is said to how things are portrayed and to what is unspoken and unexplained. It features the young actress and chanteuse Djnba Kon who I have just discovered is missing and presumed dead having disappeared in Mali in 2011. Discovering this after seeing the film has deepened my sorrow and is a cruel if not poetic footnote to the film.".

One night John and Ellen see a meteorite crash in the desert. John drags his friend Pete out of bed to take him over to the crash site in his helicopter. Once there John climbs down into the crater. Unfortunately he does so alone as Pete and Ellen wait for him. John is the only one who sees the spaceship before a landslide covers it.

The alien crew kidnaps several inhabitants of the local  town and assumes their form. A writer of science articles Richard Carlson who lives on the outskirts of the town witnesses the crash although he thinks it's just a meteorite. When he goes down into the smoking crater he sees the open hatchway of the spaceship and an alien creature within it but when the alien closes the big hatch it starts a landslide in the crater which covers the ship.  Afterwards none of the local authorities will believe Carlson's story about a buried spaceship filled with alien invaders.A moody and beautiful movie with fine music by Henry Mancini.  Many fans of Jack Arnold's scifi films consider this one his best although personally I prefer The Space Children'  and so did Jack Arnold according to his own statement.Charles Drake Tobor the Great' is the skeptical sheriff.  Russell Johnson plays both a human and an alien a treat for genre' fans.  The supporting cast includes Joe Sawyer and Kathleen Hughes.  Special effects by David S. Horsely and the great Clifford Stine.  Makeup by Bud Westmore of the famous Westmore family who contributed much to all the Star Trek' spinoffs.Originally released in 3D.  A 3D tape was available a few years ago but the quality was not good . . . sad to say.".

	schema:reviewBody "This modest science fiction film from Ray Bradbury's short story The Meteor is perhaps the mostimitated film in the history of cinema.. The screenplay for this feature was written by Harry Essex with direction by veteran actionfilm expert Jack Arnold. It is set on the edge of the desert and involves in its storyline the crash of a mysterious meteor. Investigating it a scientist living nearby discovers it is an alien spacecraft he glimpses an ugly amoeboid creature like an octopus with a giant eye. Its next efforts cause a landslide which hides the spacecraft under a landslide so no one else can see what he saw. The next development when no one believes him is that local people lawenforcement and others start acting like zombies his wife believes him but when the folk start coming into town he knows he needs to do something. Heading to the site again he contacts the alien minds who tell him they only wish to escape Earth where they do not belong. He gives them the help they require and the ship takes off the next day heading home and leaving him and us with a genuine mystery and an important question about parochial attitudes and out fitness to extend man's reach into the Galaxy when this urge has not been conquered. The production in BW is a very good one for a B film I assert. Joan St. Eigger did the hairstyles Rosemary Odell the costumes Russell A. Gausman and Ruby R. Levitt the sets with Bud Westmore handling the unusual makeup challenges. The very fine art direction was done by Bernard Herzbrun and Robert A. Boyle with luminous cinematography by Clifford Stine. In the solid cast are Richard Carlson Barbara Rush Charles Drake as the Sheriff Joe Sawyer Russell Johnson and Kathleen Hughes. it is arguable that Richard Carlson talks too much about the mysteries of the desert in this film as n allegory for the dangers of the unknown the wild the asyetuntamedfor space itself but the dialogue is goodenough the situations genuinely eerie and the style of the film its crisis and its and pacing farabovetheexpected. In lesser hands this production could have been less effective this has become a classic example of how to handle several scifi situations. It earns the stature of being fundamentally scary yet it is also thoughtful and interesting at the same time by my standards. This is scifi noir of a very high sort.".

Out of the blue they witness a meteor crash in the desert. They fly to the location with their friend Pete in his helicopter and John decides to go to the bottom of the crater to investigate. John sees a spacecraft but there is a landslide and the ship is covered by earth. John discloses his discovery to Sheriff Matt Warren Charles Drake who is his rival and is also into Ellen and to the inhabitants and they believe he is a daydreamer. John wants to prove his finding and meets his acquaintances Frank Daylon Joe Sawyer and George Russell Johnson repairing telephone cables on the desert and they find disturbance in the cable. The workers follow the cable and meet an alien that takes the form of George. Soon John and Ellen note that a group of dwellers are acting strange and they believe they have been possessed by the aliens. When Ellen is also abducted by the aliens John contacts them and discovers their intention. Are they friend or hostile invaders? It Came from Outer Space is another delightful scifi from the 50's with a story of Ray Bradbury. Years before Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind the writer John Putnam has an encounter with aliens that explains that we are not ready to contact them. The low budget of It Came from Outer Space is not a problem since the story is very well constructed.

	schema:reviewBody "I always find it hard to judge films like this when I wasn't even relatively close to being born when this film first came out and how different films are of today compared to then.  You can't really give it an objective review because we've been spoiled with superb morecontemporary science fictions films.  But nonetheless I try to be as objective as possible and while I watch a film like this I try very hard to keep in mind when this film was made.With all that said I'll get on with the film review.  I thought the story in this film was pretty interesting and well done.  The story really does have some cool things in it although it is a very simple plot.The special effects are very light in this film which shouldn't be that surprising being made in the early 1950's.  But when they do use them they're pretty good and somewhat impressive.The acting in this film is nothing terribly great but it certainly isn't bad either.  The acting is pretty much what you'd expect from a 1950's scifi movie lots of screaming scared looks and what not.  But all in all there's nothing really to complain about.I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but I would recommend it to anyone that truly loves the scifi genre like myself or just wants to compare this film to scifi films made today.  I think it's good to see a film like this so that you can appreciate how far we've come with film making and special effects and all that great stuff.  Anyhow if you do see the film I hope you enjoy it for what it is.  Thanks for readingChris".

You can't really give it an objective review because we've been spoiled with superb morecontemporary science fictions films.  But nonetheless I try to be as objective as possible and while I watch a film like this I try very hard to keep in mind when this film was made.With all that said I'll get on with the film review.  I thought the story in this film was pretty interesting and well done.  The story really does have some cool things in it although it is a very simple plot.The special effects are very light in this film which shouldn't be that surprising being made in the early 1950's.  But when they do use them they're pretty good and somewhat impressive.The acting in this film is nothing terribly great but it certainly isn't bad either.  The acting is pretty much what you'd expect from a 1950's scifi movie lots of screaming scared looks and what not.  But all in all there's nothing really to complain about.I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but I would recommend it to anyone that truly loves the scifi genre like myself or just wants to compare this film to scifi films made today.  I think it's good to see a film like this so that you can appreciate how far we've come with film making and special effects and all that great stuff.  Anyhow if you do see the film I hope you enjoy it for what it is.  Thanks for readingChris";

Jack Arnold has done some really great movies. I really think that he has created true master pieces and this is one of them. I really like the way you could see trough the eyes of the aliens. The script was really clever. At the beginning you couldn't be sure who is the bad guy and who the good. The story takes place in a quite small town where everybody knows each other and nothing can be kept a secret for very long. Everybody knows what the people next to him are doing. A meteor falls in this town and a writer and his girlfriend are the ones who discover it. From here on things are starting to become strange...and the story starts. It has to do with the fight inside each of us not to judge the others by their appearance. Is something which is unknown always bad? Is something that looks really horrifying bad? And when someone does things that we don't understand does that mean that he wants to hurt us in anyway? Well you just have to see it to find out. Don't forget though that this is an old bw movie when you see it. If you get pass that you will see that is really quite nice and interesting.".

Then in the late 1980s I made the mistake of seeing these films in Sydney theatres with people who were not really in tune with 1950s movies.

Later one character describes Richard Carlson as a man who thinks for himself the laughing was louder this time. And again Carlson looks into space and starts talking to himself out loud about aliens. The laughing was getting stronger. And so it went on. What was once great mystery and suspense such as Russell Johnson looking into the sun was now comedy. They had good reason to laugh as it was funny. But this crowd destroyed a childhood favourite of mine. I did'nt like this film being laughed at. I did'nt want to know the funny side. Other cinema screenings of Forbidden Planet and The Incredible Shrinking Man were given the same reaction. For a while I wondered if all of my 1950s1960s scifi favourites were just ... bad in the eyes of the public. Or was it just the Australian sense of humour?I will rate this film by my 1970s reactions. It is a classic. The music score is dated but everything else is fine. The desert creates such mystery. Great scifi.".

Naturally nobody believes John's story but he sets out with Ellen to prove it's true. Soon some of the townspeople begin to act strange and John comes to the realization they are really aliens from the ship.The credit for the script to this film is a matter of debate. Ray Bradbury is only credited with a story idea and the official line is that he did a story treatment and Harry Essex did all the scripting. However legend has always persisted Bradbury wrote a first draft script complete with dialogue that Essex simply changed some things and took full credit. Whether this is true or not I don't know. But I do know there are distinctly Bradburian lines of dialogue in this film that don't fit with Essex's other films. So take that for what it's worth. Regardless of who deserves the credit the script is excellent and one of the best of the alien invasion films of the '50s.This was legendary director Jack Arnold's first scifi film. Arnold would go on to direct such classics as Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Incredible Shrinking Man. He imbues the film with a great atmosphere and makes terrific use of the 3D technology in ways few other directors have then or now. The wonderful score was composed in separate parts by Irving Gertz Henry Mancini and Herman Stein. The cast is really good with Richard Carlson and gorgeous Barbara Rush giving particularly effective performances. Also of note for fans of Gilligan's Island the Professor himself Russell Johnson has a dual role. Really a phenomenal scifi film. A classic everybody should see.".

He can't convince anyone of the UFO crash he sighted and the aliens who have taken human form while repairing their ship aren't making it any easier.Excellent adaptation of Ray Bradbury's story with smart  thoughtful screenplay by Harry Essex who distinguish with snappy pacing a genuine heartfelt enthusiasm for the genre and plenty of scary atmosphere and eerie events. The picture contains supremely suspense  thrills  tension  spooky scenes and acceptable special effects by that time . It deals with outer space creatures taking over the bodies of earthlings and was the first time to utilize this issue  subsequently ordinary theme on the science fiction genre . Moody black and white cinematography by the cameraman Clifford Stine . Solid acting by Richard Carlson usual actor in sciFi genre and a gorgeous Barbara Rush .

The motion picture is well directed by Jack Arnold in his first foray into the SciFi genre. He reigns supreme as one of the greatest filmmakers of 50s science  achieving an important cult popularity with classics as The Creature from the Black Lagoon and its followup titled Revenge of the Creature that was a nice sequel . Tarantula was likewise a lot of amusement . The Incredible Shrinking Man attained his greatest enduring cult popularity  it's a thoughtprovoking and impressive classic that's lost none of its power throughout the years . Arnold's final two genre entries were the interesting Monster on the Campus and the outlandish The Space Children . And of course It came from outer space  that still hold up today . It's followed by an inferior remake 1996 for TV .".

My favorite was when Carlson swung a telescope to the audienceI actually thought it would hit me! And the aliens POV shots had them looking through a bubblecause it looked good in 3D.3D aside this was a wellmade and deadly serious movies about aliens. The script was pretty intelligentfor its era. Also this is the rare scifi movie where the aliens were NOT evil. Still they looked pretty gruesome gave me nightmares as a kid.Carlson is surprisingly very goodhe has some difficult lines but pulls them off. Rush isn't given much to do but look beautifulwhich she does well! And there's a very funny sequence with Kathleen Hughes playing a blonde bombshell. Also it's fun to see Russell Johnson in an early role before he became The Professor from Gilligan's Island. Nice eerie music score too.Considered quite rightfully as one of the top scifi films of the 1950s. Recommended.".

The picture is also notable for it's use of POV shooting from the alien perspective all fuzzy focus from a spherical single eye it works real well and would be something that many other film makers would use from here on in. This is not a film that relies on its creatures to see it home safely in fact we barely glimpse the creatures here but we don't need that to be the case because they make their mark regardless all of which leaves It Came From Outer Space as a very knowing and quite often intelligent piece of work. 810".

Supposedly a meteor lands in the Arizona desert near a small town but in fact it is a space ship carrying an alien race quite repulsive to humans. With a smart script that questions our inability to wait before pulling out our guns and firing and telling us that the aliens aren't always a threat to humankind It Came from Outer Space tried to provoke our thoughts away from believing that those from outside our world land here to hurt us. Richard Carlson is kind of a Bmovie icon for many of us mainly due to his association with Creature from the Black Lagoon and this film. He is the lone scientist a star gazer in this film considered by the papers who mock his claim that it was a space ship that landed in the desert not a meteor as suspected who tries to speak for the aliens hoping to convince the sheriff Charles Drake that using guns won't solve anything except perhaps hurt those taken captive by them in order to use their likenesses in town to secure hardware needed to fix their vessel and produce a weapon to protect themselves. With Barbara Rush as Carlson's love interest and eventually kidnapped herself naturally and Russell Johnson of Gilligan's Island fame as the employee of an electrician Joe Sawyer in the cast this is actually a respected scifi film not relegated to the cheesy conversation of many of its ilk. There are some imaginative firstperson perspective shots seen through the eye of the alien as it descends upon and spy on humans. The special effects aren't the bright spot of this one its budget is obviously low as the alien is a rubbery monstrosity that could have been made by Paul Blaisdell and the ship is basically a ball probably inflatable. I always find myself engaged in the presentation though as it has that Invasion of Body Snatchers meets Day the Earth Stood Still feel to it. Carlson was always reliable and interesting and he conveys the frustrationsdismay of being dismissed for his claims of the spaceshipalien presence conflicted agonizing anxiety at if he should believe in what the race of aliens are telling him regarding peaceful nonthreatening motives on earth just repairs and accidental crash on the planet not willing to confront the earthlings due to our shoot first ask later response to beings unlike us and struggle to maintain a posse led by the sheriff when it appears the townsfolk are being kidnapped and possibly in harm's way. The setting in Arizona actually shot in California is quite refreshing THEM also has that as does Arnold's own Tarantula and it is used expansively. One good scene I like has Joe's electrician listening to strange noise through the power lines with Carlson getting an ear of it commenting on how the desert has its own voice. The Joshua tree even gets a good bit of oogabooga use as Rush screams when it is shadowed in darkness as she believes it is the alien. The zombielike movements of alien clones of the human locals is quite podlike and the simple small town rural sense of place within the enveloping desert landscape does create a bit of perfect cover for aliens needing to get their ship in orderor else. The reliable scores of these kinds of 50s scifi shows itself effectively here in this film as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Star Trek's Dr. Leonard McCoy aka Bones always said it best when confronted with a new and unknown alien Why do we always call it it or that thing?Universal Pictures has made some great horror and scifi pictures during the twentieth century. One of the most original was the 1953 scifi film adaptations of the famous author Ray Bradbury's story of the xenophobic and paranoiac from both sides of the point of view of human and alien It Came From Outer Space.This was a 3D film of course lost on the TV and DVD transference. It would be awesome to see the original 3D film in the theater. Regardless this relatively new DVD black and white transference is very good atmospheric dark but not muddy and silver when it counts.The story is about an alien space craft that crashes accidentally on Earth. The aliens want to repair their ship and leave. To further their cause the aliens kidnap humans and take over their physical likeness to aid in the repair of their space craft.Interwoven in this theme is the typical scifi romance a macho confrontation and the town posse sent to destroy the aliens.Regardless of this typical contrivance most of the script is literate with Bradbury's unique introspection woven within poetry as prose.In the ending the aliens do leave Earth somewhat peacefully and we humans are left with a sense of wonder. This is the stuff of future Spielberg's E.T. and Close Encounters type films which are the ultimate alien encounter movies. In these stories both human and alien are xenophobes fear of the outsider not understanding each other always with early mutual mistrust and then with communication comes an understanding.A word about the cast. Richard Carlson portrays the dreamer and stoic astronomer that first meets the aliens and believes in them in this play. Carlson is somewhat known for his cast in The Day the Earth Stood Still as a heel and his scientist cum tough guy performance in The Creature from the Black Lagoon.His girlfriend in this film is cast with such breathtaking femininity by the incredibly beautiful Barbara Rush who is the hero's rock and lioness in belief of her man. Barbara Rush is one of the 1950's almost forgotten but unforgettable women. She was so lovely and when ever I see her on the silver screen my heart always skips a beat. And like all scifi heroines of that age she gets wide eyed and SCREAMS really well when terrified.This movie is intelligent well written aptly acted with eerie score and filmed in the lonely desert with the adept eye of the macabre.Highly recommended as one of the really great scifi films of the the golden age of the genre the 1950's.I give it four stars out of five.".

The answer is simple  Jack Arnolds direction is spot on  the script by Harry Essex  based on a Ray Bradbury story  The Meteor  is well above average for 50's scifi  the special effects are excellent  for the period  the acting  particularly  by the leads  is excellent  the music is genuinely spooky  the camerawork showing things from the aliens point of view is very effective and it has some original ideas . For example  it was the first movie to have aliens replicating humans and  in an era where the alien was invariably a man in a rubber suit  there was a genuine attempt at making the alien original and scary . All on a budget of less than a million dollars  which for its day was a decent amount and was definitely not a b picture budget ! Comparing it with todays mega bucks films with their CGI special effects is not being in the least bit fair . I note that a lot of reviewers are of the opinion that Space Children was Jack Arnolds favorite movie and his best . I have seen all of Jack Arnolds films and consider Space Children his worst . Even Monster On The Campus was better ! I have looked everywhere and can find no reference to Jack Arnold referring to it as his favorite movie . I suspect it falls into the urban legend category . In my opinion Jack Arnolds best scifi movie was The Incredible Shrinking Man  thanks to a superb script by Richard Matheson and what was the most incredible thing about that movie was that the studio heads allowed that ending .".

But take my word for it It Came from Outer Space is one of those older films you should see in particular if you're a scifi or genre fan to any degree. It's got a campy element going for it as well as was just about anything made in Hollywood in 1953 the Best Picture Oscar that year was given to The Greatest Show on Earth probably the worst film awarded the prize in the history of the Academy well besides Crash anyway.None other than the great Ray Bradbury wrote the story to It Came from Outer Space. It tells of a couple astronomerauthor John Putnam and teacher Ellen Fields that witness a great meteor crash outside the small town of Sand Rock Arizona. Once they reach the impact site John comes to realize that it was actually a crash landing by aliens. Unfortunately due to circumstance beyond his control a highsterical natural disaster the people in Sand Rock do not believe John's story. But soon folks in town begin to disappear.

Thankfully the sheriff sees the light but not in the way that our hero John nor us had hoped. Soon chaos ensues. Panic all around. What do they aliens want? Are there even aliens? Are people truly behaving strangely? And what about the poor little owl? And is a peaceful solution really part of the vocabulary outside of the Bay Area?Directed quite skillfully by Jack Arnold It Came from Outer Space is arguably the great '50s scifi invasionpanic film along with Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Day the Earth Stood Still. Arnold is one of the unsung American directors of genrefilmmaking having also made the stillformidable Tarantula Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Incredible Shrinking Man. All of these films including It Came from Outer Space have atmosphere for days and most importantly they have scripts that aren't inane but rather urbane and intelligent. The performances are a hoot as well. Richard Carlson also the star of Creature from the Black Lagoon is such the posterboy for '50s cleancut and forthright heroes and kinda cute to boot. Adorable Barbara Rush however steals the scenes away from Dick with her amazing portrayal of Ellen Fields. Believe it or not she was awarded a Golden Globe for her turn in this movie.It Came from Outer Space is truly a fantastic time to be had. It's campy it's fun it's fast paced and it's moody.

Watch this movie and think about what congress was doing at the time! It's right there like a scoop of ice cream that's fallen out of the cone splat! I couldn't help but see the similarities and you won't either. I hope this isn't considered a spoiler I would never spoil a movie for anyone knowingly. Just check it outlook for the similarities and see if you notice them too! I am still not a scifi fanatic but I will admit this film helped to change my mind! I hope you get a chance to watch this soon I saw it on TCM on September 1st 2006! It's available at any hip video stores and maybe a chain store if they have a decent scifi section. Enjoy!".

Although the defence of Rome has become impossible Garibaldi declares his intent to continue the struggle for republican liberty and a unified Italy. With a following of four thousand men he begins a march across the Apennines with the aim of reaching Venice which is under siege but still resisting. However the Bourbons and the Austrians pursue the volunteers who have in their ranks Frattini a traitor secretly working to disunite the small but brave force. Many in fact desert and even the most loyal officer Bueno gives in to Frattini's proposals to impose summary justice. Anita Garibaldi whom her husband had left behind in Rome because she was expecting a baby rejoins him and her influence courage and vivacity succeed in restoring unity. San Marino gives refuge to the surviving force and the Austrians offer a ceasefire. But the terms of surrender proposed by the Austrians are so severe ...";

And with a cast including Peter Saarsgard Sienna Miller Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari this seems like a nobrainer.It is. Literally.Jon Foster stars as Art Bechstein the son of a mobster Nolte who recently graduated with a degree in Economics. Jon is in a state of arrested development he works a minimum wage job at Book Barn has a vapid relationship with his girlfriendboss Phlox Suvari which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion.One night at a party an exroommate introduces Jon to Jane Miller a beautiful smart violinist. Later that night they go out for pie and she asks Jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence I want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul. If you do it will make this night indelible. Jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by yet none of them look him in the eye. I imagine it must be what death feels like he says.The next day Jane's wild boyfriend Cleveland Saarsgard kidnaps Jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill and soon Jon Cleveland and Jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol. This doesn't sit well with Phlox who pushes Jon for a more personal relationship namely letting her meet his new friends and his father. The film then attempts to take us on Jon's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father Phlox and his deadend job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane.There is a problem having us follow Jon throughout the film he's completely uninteresting. He has no ambitions passions or goals. He walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to Jane the night they met. At the outset this isn't a problem. But he never gets any more interesting. He's a completely passive character. He simply follows along the bohemian Cleveland and Jane but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself.Consequently the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party have sex and get in arguments. In other words much ado about nothing. What we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside. Sweeping cinematography ponderous voiceover with characters staring off into the distance lots of sex scenes both straight and gay big arguments more angry sex a chase scene and a tragic death... but it doesn't seem to matter. Ironically at one point Jane confused at a number of Jon's aimless actions asks him What's going on Jon? What is this all about? Yes Jon do tell. We in the audience are dying to know too.The title The Mysteries of Pittsburgh must refer to the characters themselves because that's what they are. They are all facades onedimensional standins for actual people. The film never lets us in. We never know what makes any of them tick. We see them do lots of things but we don't know why. And the absence of why is one of the worst things a movie can have.".

The bizarre interactions among these characters drive Art to make many decisions and discoveries  including his falling in love with both Cleveland and Jane. The summer winds down with Art finally discovering his own identity despite the clouds of mystery that have surrounded his life. It is a piece of life as lived by disparate characters whose direction in life seems at odds with the natural flow of finding happiness and success. But then the question is asked  what is happiness and what is success if not survival? For this viewer the explanation by the makers of this film was interesting enough to encourage a repeat watching of the movie. A good movie not a great movie but it still tastes strongly of Michael Chabon's genius. It deserves more attention than the critics have given it.....Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Chabon's 1988 novel  The Mysteries of Pittsburgh was a novel about coming of age for a young man. The book is a fine account of a summer in the life of Art Bechstein the son of a mobster who falls for Jane a young woman who is in love with another man. There is no doubt in our minds Rawson Marshall Thurber had the best intentions when he decided to adapt then direct this beloved work of many for the screen.The problem seems to be in the way Art comes out in the movie where he also serves as the narrator as well. The way Mr. Thurber conceived his main character does not resonate with the viewer. It is never quite clear what did Jane and Cleveland see in this bland person to befriend and be part of a group they are unevenly matched to say the least.Cleveland is the most complex character in the novel. He is a bisexual man that is in the equation for the thrills he can get out of his situation with Jane. Art finds out soon enough what Cleveland is all about but in the end he too is seduced by a guy that is a manipulator of the worse kind. It is also hard to believe the way Cleveland is presented in the film he is the criminal he is supposed to be. Art on the other hand appears to be a closet homosexual in spite of the sexual relationship he was having with Phlox something that seems contrived and phony.Any film in which Peter Sarsgaard appears is worth a look. He is the most lively character in the picture. Mena Suvari shows up as a brunette with such a different look. It is hard to recognize her at first. Ms. Suvari is at her best in the film. Jon Foster is too bland to get anyone's attention. Nick Nolte plays Art's father. Sienna Miller in spite of her looks is an enigma in the movie.One thing that plays well is Theodore Shapiro's fine musical score. It gives the picture some class. Michael Barrett captures the spirit of the city and its surrounding area in great images.".

The book is a fine account of a summer in the life of Art Bechstein the son of a mobster who falls for Jane a young woman who is in love with another man. There is no doubt in our minds Rawson Marshall Thurber had the best intentions when he decided to adapt then direct this beloved work of many for the screen.The problem seems to be in the way Art comes out in the movie where he also serves as the narrator as well. The way Mr. Thurber conceived his main character does not resonate with the viewer. It is never quite clear what did Jane and Cleveland see in this bland person to befriend and be part of a group they are unevenly matched to say the least.Cleveland is the most complex character in the novel. He is a bisexual man that is in the equation for the thrills he can get out of his situation with Jane. Art finds out soon enough what Cleveland is all about but in the end he too is seduced by a guy that is a manipulator of the worse kind. It is also hard to believe the way Cleveland is presented in the film he is the criminal he is supposed to be. Art on the other hand appears to be a closet homosexual in spite of the sexual relationship he was having with Phlox something that seems contrived and phony.Any film in which Peter Sarsgaard appears is worth a look. He is the most lively character in the picture. Mena Suvari shows up as a brunette with such a different look. It is hard to recognize her at first. Ms. Suvari is at her best in the film. Jon Foster is too bland to get anyone's attention. Nick Nolte plays Art's father. Sienna Miller in spite of her looks is an enigma in the movie.One thing that plays well is Theodore Shapiro's fine musical score. It gives the picture some class. Michael Barrett captures the spirit of the city and its surrounding area in great images.";

The cast is superb and I found Jon Foster's voice and performance refreshing inside a seasoned cast of Nick Nolte Sienna Miller American Beauty's Mena Suvari and the incredibly talented Peter Sarsgaard. Reviews have been mixed on the film but I thought it took off in the second act with humor of the challenges facing the characters and the pathos of how love can take a turn when you least expect it. The dialog at times witty and with a cynical barb to it and the location of Pittsburgh with its hills and older homes adds to the story. I really liked this film and once again the cast is delicious to look at and watch.".

The film is infamous for being the film Sienna Miller took simply to get away from the paparazzi she got into even more trouble by bashing Pittsburgh in several off handed comments. It was then barely released to theaters before being dumped on to DVD. This is a good little film. I liked it. My only real complaint outside of Nick Nolte's performance it just doesn't work here is that the film is trying way too hard to be quirky. Its not bad but there are these small turns and asides Joe Namath's picture during a sex scene that didn't really need to be there. I'm sure they were in the novel but at the same time in the real world of the film they come across as out of place. Worth a look probably on cable.".

	schema:headline " Beloved novel is drained of its wit in film";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Chabon is one of our generation's greatest writers having earned the acclaim of awards and prizes that he deserves. Wonder Boys was made into a very good if uneventful film and one has high hopes for Kavalier  Klay. The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about Art Bechstein the young son of a gangster who does not want him to follow in his footsteps. Art has majored in business but has no taste for it. It is the summer after his graduation and he is supposedly studying for a test that will license him to work in high finance though he spends his time enjoying the summer as the last of his youth.Art works at a bookstore and meets Phlox an attractive young woman. He also makes friends with a gay man named Arthur Lecomte who introduces him to Cleveland Arning. Art meets Cleveland's girlfriend Jane who is striking and mysterious to him. Art spends his summer in relationships with these people and learning more about himself.The tone of the book is one of the great accomplishments of Chabon's writing. It is wry and witty and ever so slightly tongue in cheek. My favorite line in the book is the last in which Art tells us this summer was a turning point for him or maybe he just made it all up. Art is a cousin to Holden Caufield with his attitudes but he takes himself far less seriously.This film is not the trainwreck that many would have you to believe including devotees of the novel. While some criticize the glossy cinematography I would argue that it is one of the few things that work in this film. Pittsburgh has a fascinating aesthetic that deserves to be filmed well and the cinematographer accomplished that.The overall problem with the film is that it never comes even remotely close to capturing the tone of the novel. The wit and humor are gone completely. The tone of this movie is so deathly serious that none of the events that were shocking in the novel are the least bit surprising in the film. It is the equivalent of sitting in the parlor of a funeral home.Jon Foster is an exercise in bad casting. He looks like what one imagines Art to look likemildly handsome lanky a nonshowy intelligencebut never once plays the character properly. There is no slyness no humor no wit or warmth in this performance and that is about 60 of what's wrong with the whole film. Foster does not even come remotely close to the character we followed in the novel. A toned down Topher Grace is what the part called for but all we get is an actor who is so bland and dull that we couldn't care less about the character he is playing.Peter Sarsgaard was perfect casting as Cleveland and has a resume of similar successful roles in his past. However Sarsgaard plays Cleveland with all the seriousness of a war veteran who's lost his legs. The unpredictability and wildness that makes up the book's character is not in the film.Sienna Miller's Jane is an overinflated part about a character who was only meant to be an enigma in passing sort of like Suzanne Somer's Girl in the White TBird in American Graffiti. Her mere beauty is supposed to mean more to us than it ever does.Only Mena Survari as Phlox and Nick Nolte as Art's gangster father manage to properly convey what we knew about the characters. Unfortunately the likable Phlox is reduced to being a clingy nymphomaniac as opposed to the sweet likable free spirit in the novel. Still Survari made the part work despite limited screen time.Art's sexual awakening is glossed over and Cleveland's bisexuality is treated more as pansexuality. The film has the nerve to show the men in embrace but cuts to the morning after in chaste fade away.Even the Cloud Factory is given a short shrift. A prominent fixture in the book it is also a big player in the movie but as with the characters it is also played as a serious location rather than a humorous one. The actual plant in the novel is a working facility at Carnegie Mellon University. In the film it is an abandoned facility outside of town about which Cleveland says no one knows why smoke still comes out of the stack. Well actually smoke can only come from a stack if it is fed coal or some other energy source which someone must purchase. So if no one is buying coal for it then such a thing is not even possible. Smoke doesn't just appear! And that sums up the problem with this film. Smoke appears out of nowhere and for no reason as do the human emotions. We don't see any motivation or reasoning and we never understand why any of these boring people want anything to do with each other.Pittsburgh is a fascinating city with a rich history Chabon's novel is a great book with rich characters. Both got the short shrift in this plodding and pointless film. The only way to enjoy it is to put it on TV at a party and turn down the sound while playing a music CD. The visuals make for great music video and replace the characters who never muster any personality in the atmosphere of the film. Like most films about ennui we become bored with watching boredom.".

I was warned to stay far away from this movie.But I FINALLY saw it anyway almost 7 full years after Sienna Miller made entertainment headlines trashing Pittsburgh in an interview while filming there on location. The film wasn't easy to track down as I found a DVD through an interlibrary loan. I'm glad I watched it but can't really recommend it.As indie movies go I thought it had decent production values including respected actors Nolte Sarsgaard Suvari  Miller. I was unfamiliar with the work of Jon Foster but his brother Ben can really bring it at times and thought he was just OK as the lead. Perhaps a more dynamic young actor would have brought more to the production but he's not the reason I'm giving this a belowaverage rating.The story was decent enough but it just never really felt like I was watching a movie set in '83. Outside of Sienna's beat up VW Beetle and Sarsgaard's convertible there was nothing to peg this as early 80's! I realize Pittsburgh has had roughly the same look for years but couldn't they at least have thrown in some more visuals or music from that era to bring home it was 1983? The producers could have used more early 80's indie rock during the movie if they couldn't afford the rights for major label material from that era. And that punk club scene looked more like something you'd see in a retro themed innercity dive in Chicago these days than a packed bar in Pitt. 30 years ago. I'm giving this 1 extra star 4 instead of 3 for having the punk band play a cover of The Replacements' God Damn Job off their '82 EP Stink. I never ever thought I'd hear that cut in movie! This movie is worth a look only if it pops up on IFC or Sundance at some point but I've never seen it playing there.".

We find that his dad fantastic portrayal by Nick Nolte is an organized crime chief of the local mob and is proud of his son graduating and does NOT want his son to go into organized crime.

The next day Cleveland a tough biker type comes to the bookstore and gives Art a deal he cannot refuse which is a ride on the bike to a local abandoned factory site. At the factory site is a smokestack that still belches out clouds even though the factory has been shut down for thirty years! Why? It is a mystery a mystery of Pittsburgh. Why is does Cleveland turn to be actually friendly towards a potential rival? Well that is another mystery of Pittsburgh.The movie portrays the last summer of youthful abandon and care set in surprisingly beautiful settings of a city that is reinventing itself from the traditional smokestack technology to a more greener environment. Yet the problem with the movie is its unrealistic portrayal of male and female friendships. It was a very good movie showing Sienna Miller for example doing some very good driving of golf balls at a party. Yet this subplot never plays out never explains why she is shown doing something so atypical. Loose ends poor connections double meanings that invoke something that is hard to believe even with the typical suspension of disbelief found at movies.

I even hesitate to say what was the topic. I assume it was about the comingout of the main character but even that I am not sure.Plus I can't say Jon Foster the main actor is captivating. So why did I like ?I think the main thing I appreciated in that film is the atmosphere of mysteries. As the title suggests it all along the film provides an imperceptible mystery. Because it plays with suggestions and switches. The storyline helps for sure to plunge into this atmosphere as the storyline is a mystery in itself ! But there are other causes. The photography for example which clearly remains in my mind. Although Pittsburg is not a beauty on its own the director manages to capture some good photos of it. Also the director did well regarding the changing weathers and lights. Switching between sun and rain lights twillights and darkness.The soundtrack follows the mysterious atmosphere well too.Saarsgard plays an interesting character as he acts an ambivalent tough but sensitive bisexual. There is also the constant hesitations of the main character. Obey his father or not ? The dark haired girl or the blond one ? The girlfriend or the boyfriend ? We can also capture the questionings of all the others characters.All this provides a sentiment of interrogations.So this atmosphere the director manages to render leads us not to be surprised when the main character admits at the end he is confused because this is the feeling we have too.Mysteries. This is what I appreciated in this film I guess.".

	onyx:emotionText "Comments are so tough with the film that I feel alone in the camp of the positives.OK this film is far from being a perfection and I think I will never understand the very purpose of it. I even hesitate to say what was the topic. I assume it was about the comingout of the main character but even that I am not sure.Plus I can't say Jon Foster the main actor is captivating. So why did I like ?I think the main thing I appreciated in that film is the atmosphere of mysteries. As the title suggests it all along the film provides an imperceptible mystery. Because it plays with suggestions and switches. The storyline helps for sure to plunge into this atmosphere as the storyline is a mystery in itself ! But there are other causes. The photography for example which clearly remains in my mind. Although Pittsburg is not a beauty on its own the director manages to capture some good photos of it. Also the director did well regarding the changing weathers and lights. Switching between sun and rain lights twillights and darkness.The soundtrack follows the mysterious atmosphere well too.Saarsgard plays an interesting character as he acts an ambivalent tough but sensitive bisexual. There is also the constant hesitations of the main character. Obey his father or not ? The dark haired girl or the blond one ? The girlfriend or the boyfriend ? We can also capture the questionings of all the others characters.All this provides a sentiment of interrogations.So this atmosphere the director manages to render leads us not to be surprised when the main character admits at the end he is confused because this is the feeling we have too.Mysteries. This is what I appreciated in this film I guess.";

It holds back for space takes time in roundabout exploration of childhood memories in a turnofthecentury backwoods village yet it picks up steam doing this builds in emotional resonance as though even the sounds and images which compose it become imbued by sheer association with their subject matter with that quality of fierce tireless quiet dignity that characterizes the Soviet working spirit. Konchalovsky celebrates Soviet collectivity but in an almost revisionist way to paeans like Soy Cuba and Invincible the mood turns somber and reflective. So eventually the Revolution the one thought to matter. News of it reach the secluded Siberian village only through the grapevine. Worse with the fruits of its labor these reach the village only when a world war calls for the young men to enlist.But although the scope appears huge and daunting Konchalovksy zeroes in on the individual the face behind the history with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fianc who never came back waited long enough to go out and become a barmaid in a ship with velvet couches and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the fianc's father with an axe the irreverent folly of the fianc who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to drill oil for the motherland the despair and resignation of the middleaged Regional Party Leader who comes back to his small Siberian village with the sole purpose of blotting it out of the map to build a power plant. The movie segues from decade to decade from the 10's to the 80's with amazing newsreel footage trailing Soviet history from the revolution to war famine and the titanic technological achievements of an empire terrific visuals here! pure futurism of kinetic violence and skewed angles and flickering cramped shots of crowds and faces but the actual movie focuses on the individual on triumphs and follies small and big. By the second half a sense of bittersweet fatalism creeps in of broken lives that never reached fulfillment choking with regret and yearning. It can't matter seems like the world is saying to which Konchalovksy answers it must matter because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption.Yet behind this saga of 'man against landscape' something seems to hover shadowy almost substanceless like the Eternal Old Man hermit who appears in every segment to guide or repudiate the protagonists sometimes a mere spectactor sometimes the enigmatic sage a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible ultimatums challenges and affirmations of the human characters something invisible seems to lurk. Ghosts of the fathers appearing in sepia dreams repeated shots of a star gleaming in the nightsky a curious bear indeed the Eternal Old Man himself Konchalovksy calls for awe and reverence before a mystical land of some other order. In its treatment of a small backwoods community struggling against nature progress and time and in the ways it learns to deal with them often funny bizarre and tragic at the same time and in how the director never allows cynicism to override his humanism it reminds me of Shohei Imamura's The Profound Desires of the Gods. When in a dream scene Alexei tears through the planks of a door on which is plastered a propaganda poster of Stalin to reach out at his dead father as he vanishes in the fog the movie hints at the betrayal of the Soviet Dream or better yet at all the things lost in the revolution this betrayal made more explicit in the film's fiery denouement. The amazing visuals elegiac and somber with a raw naturalist edge help seal the deal. By the end of it an oil derric erupts in flames and the movie erupts in a wild explosion of pure cinema.".

The film takes you on a ride but that is not an easy joyful ride it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people's lives. What I loved was the inner logic the film followed logic which just like logic in life was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end when I thought about it all the events and twists made sense. It makes no sense though to try to retell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time. I also liked very much Nikita Mikhalkov's character Aleksei and the way he played it as some critics would saw with restless abandon. What I didn't like about it was that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksei in films like Cruel Romance Zhestokij romans which I actually love and to some extent in The Insulted and the Injured Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye. Sibiriada shows I think what a great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski was before he went to Hollywood and made forgettable films like Tango and Cash and less forgettable like Runaway train.

	schema:reviewBody "Siberiade is a magnificent epic. The story takes place mostly in the Siberian village Yelan near which large deposits of oil lie. Two generations of villagers get caught up in turbulent times when there was expansion in the Orthodox Civilization. The 1979 film is all about the characters. Wellknown Soviet actors were cast in the leading roles including Oscar winner Nikita Mikhalkov Natalya Andrejchenko and Vitaly Solomin. Their losses are truly emotional yet they also go through periods of exaltation. The revolution brought hope but difficult struggles followed too. The cinematography by Levan Paatashvili captures the beauty of Siberia's wilderness in a simple but well done manner. Black  white footage of heroic periods in Russia's 20th century history bridge the eras in the characters' lives. Director Andrei Konchalovsky wasn't afraid to show a few uneasy scenes and there's even a bit of female nudity. Yet his direction is effective and he succeeded in telling an absorbing epic of an interesting time in Russia's history. The film is known for Eduard Artemyev's memorable electronic score. The score was even released internationally and I heard a piece of it in CNN's Cold War 1998 documentary. Siberiade won the Special Grand Jury Prize at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival and I highly recommend seeing it.".

The story starts at the turn of the century 1900 in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times i.e. the 1960s.The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. He later joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. His son by the local beauty fights the Germans during the Second World War. When he returns to the village the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some Soviet economic idealism.This film is long and slow but utterly logic and very well made. It can be seen in three parts.".

Equally inexplicably Solaris is called the Russian 2001 because. Heck because it has space hardware. Jees.The structure of 2001 is its reason to be a fight among three narrative perspectives. We never know who wins the human machine or divine. Each is presented in a way that could be interpreted to subsume the others and we are never grounded. Its sublime each level above the other in a sort of Escher narrative.This is the same very deliberately so. We have the same three we have the human story of sex love community and how that embraces everything Miss Marplewise. We have the machine or the revolution and its apparatus some figurative and some literal. And we have the mystical energy and laws of nature which are deliberate clear pervasive here. If there is something particularly skillful in this project cinematically it is how this mystical mist pervades.Its not at all as deft in the balance as Kubric's masterpiece. But you can see the three climbing over each other and the standoff presented at the end.Its a long slog and you'll have to wade through overly optimistic celebrations of revolutionary purpose. But its rewarding in a sort of Polish meaning dreamy way.On a second viewing I have to remark on how the fundamental nature of this is different from most else that I watch. I'm particularly sensitive to the fact that most every element that I see in every film project is a matter of market forces. An artist can modulate within that pull but never really escape the senderreceiver dynamic. This film differs in the way that some monumental architecture does from what surrounds it. In the soviet system you pay your dues and prove that you are a worthy artist. That means of course that you have to satisfy the artistic bureaucracy the nature of which one can only imagine. But once you achieve some level of power you become a dilettante with amazing reach. Everything we see here is because it was envisioned to be so quite apart from what we normally have to deal with in the free world. Its the inversion that is striking. This film really is perfect in many ways. You can see that every frame and nuance is the way the filmmaker wants it regardless of whether he thinks people care. I didn't care much because the thing is as soulless as most other Soviet art. But its very clean and big and sentimental. And its different and that's a welcome shower.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " History is a sad though heroic story";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is probably a master piece. To summarize the history of Russia and the Soviet Union in some four odd hours is in itself a miracle. But what's more it concentrates on Siberia and it follows one little village Elan in this region and in this village essentially three generations of the Ustyuzhanin family in fact Afanasi the grand father then Nikolai the father and Aleksei the son as opposed to the other family in the village the Solomins. The first family are the poor ones the underlings before the revolution the others are the top family. The revolution of course transforms these relations and we follow the lives of these three men essentially in their village when they are there since they are often rejected or they just go away and then they come back. Dramatically.Afanasi is the only one who does not come back. He is always there and lives alone with his son and no wife.Nikolai comes back as a Soviet officer a Communist cadre and it is dramatic because he had been thrown away at the beginning of the revolution and his paramour from the other family had escaped from the village to find him and follow him. It will be a difficult situation since she will be burned to death by the white Cossacks during the civil war after the revolution. He comes back with his young son in the 1930s and is killed by the other paramour of his wife the one she left behind. Aleksei is sent to an orphanage then on one visit to the village and his relatives a recruiting unit at the very beginning of the war against Nazi Germany accepts his enlisting though he is slightly too young and he will be a hero in the war saving his captain all by himself. But in the 1960s he comes back as a master driller to drill for oil in his village because he knows there is some he discovered it with his father when he was a kid when they marched into the marsh known as the Devil's Mane and there oil was oozing out all over the place and they managed to set it on fire accidentally. Aleksei though wants to leave after a while with the woman he had taught how to dance when just under 18 before he enlisted and it is when he finally can go and is going to go alone because the woman refuses to follow him he goes say goodbye to his drilling mates and it is then oil is struck and starts bursting out. But it gets on fire for some unimportant reason and the derrick falls and traps one man. All the others go and Nikolai manages the situation to save that man but Nikolai is caught by the fire and dies.But the film is a lot more important than that. It is a real film about history. You cannot force history to do something it does not want to do because you have to work with people and people do not necessarily want to change and you have to convince them. It may take three generations to move from the superstition about the Devil's Mane to the acceptance that the village is going to be completely transformed by that oil and the most dramatic war possible in the meantime after a very dramatic and heroic revolution.The film then shows how at the beginning of this political revolution Nikolai was nave and thought it was easy to make people do what they did not want to do and he is killed just because his rival in love refuses to follow him and kills him. It fails because of some private business and affair a love story that had not gone the way one of the lovers wanted. Trite and yet history is also the result of such capricious and unpredictable elements. It will take thirty years and one generation for what was then possible in the 1930s to become a reality in the 1960s.And in the 1960s we are no longer speaking of that kind of romantic revolution Nikolai had in mind. Aleksei and the other oil drillers around him are confronted to the stubborn desire of the central authorities in Moscow to develop the country and to decide in Moscow what is best for everyone and the small village and the country around is going to become the largest manmade sea with the largest hydroelectric dam and factory on the Volga. It is a pure miracle that makes oil burst out of its underground lair on the very same day killing Aleksei as the central committee of the Communist Party or some other bureaucratic authority like this one is meeting to take a decision in favor of the dam. The events stop the dam project in its shoes and in its trail. Unluckily and Konchalovsky knew all about it in 1979 that was the last moment when history was right against the bureaucrats. After that the USSR entered a very dark time when bureaucracy was the only possible authority and initiative from people was discouraged and even choked and stagnation started leading finally to regression and the fall of the USSR. We feel that end the director could not know under the open discourse about the heroism of this Aleksei. . . . I must reckon it is not easy to find that film in DVD. I got the US edition in NTSC in Russian with English subtitles. But it was worth it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

	schema:reviewBody "The Russian films from the Soviet era do not really fit in with the European tradition. The tragic history of Russia has left an indelible imprint on the cultural and artistic expressions. For centuries the society was based on an agricultural feudalism. At the start of the twentieth century the Tsarist regime made an effort to transform into an industrial state. However the arrears was already insurmountable. The country lost several national wars and already in 1905 a truly revolutionary spirit had seized the leading parts of the Russian people. When the regime was dragged into the first world war it lost all credibility. When finally the Tsar left only misery was left. Am I right? The war was followed by the Bolshewist revolution and by a cruel civil war. But worse was to come during the second world war that was to a large extent fought on the Russian territory with incredible cruelty from the Nazis. Clearly the early Bolshewist promise of a happy and united future had failed. After WW2 something of an economic miracle developed including cosmonautics but it was too little too late. The film follows the lifes of three generations of a Siberian family during those uproarious years. The plot is what is called in German an Aufbau build up story. We see how a hamlet of very primitive peasants transforms into an industrial oil district. Indeed one of the main characters has vague dreams about the founding of a sun city which he probably read in a propaganda leaflet. But unlike the upbeat German Aufbau the atmosphere remains depressing. In fact there is not a single scene that elicits a smile. Amazing isn't it? In many aspects the characters are trapped by the traditional mysticism and ties with the harsh natural conditions. Life is slow and so is the film. The plot consists of two parts. In the first part we witness the decay of the agricultural society. The second part describes the settlement of the oil industry. In both cases I find it hard to relate and empathize with the events even though I had previously seen many an American Go West western movie. Probably the story contains lots of interwoven symbolism. For there are obvious hints in a scene of the late fifties when the main character enters a deserted shack with Stalin pictures on the wall. However being a Dutchman I am not sufficiently accessible to possible other signals. What remains is a display of folk customs which is perhaps amazing but not really appealing. I can understand that it never became an international block buster.".

	schema:headline " The Crazy Gang's best film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Crazy Gang were three sets of comedy doubleacts who separately got star billing in Britain's variety halls and who occasionally got together onstage or in films as a sixman comedy troupe. The most popular team in the act were Flanagan and Allen who deservedly get the most footage in every Crazy Gang film. Bud Flanagan was a large raucous East Ender similar to Stanley Holloway. Chesney Allen was handsome and wellspoken he could have had a film career as a leading man but he retired at a young age and was replaced in the Crazy Gang by Monsewer Eddie Gray an unfunny dialect comedian with a phony handlebar moustache. Some of Flanagan and Allen's crosstalk routines are similar to Abbott and Costello's routines. In The Frozen Limits when Allen mentions gold ore Flanagan asks gold or WHAT? Another English comedy team from the same period Jewel and Warriss came much nearer to imitating Abbott and Costello. In their stage act Flanagan and Allen sang sentimental ballads between their comedy routines.The second doubleact in the Crazy Gang were Nervo and Knox. Teddy Knox was a dapper man with a pencil moustache. Early in The Frozen Limits he dresses up as a woman using a handbag to hide her moustache. Jimmy Nervo came from a family of circus performers he never learnt to read or write but he was too vain to admit this. During rehearsals for the Crazy Gang's films he would always claim he'd left his readingglasses at home and Knox who knew his secret would read Nervo's lines for him until Nervo knew them off by heart. Nervo was the boyish member of the Crazy Gang during one scene in The Frozen Limits he impersonates a child. The least interesting doubleact in the Crazy Gang were Naughton and Gold two short Scotsmen who look like William Frawley and speak with thick Glesga accents.The Frozen Limits is the Crazy Gang's best film full of antics and lunacy. At one point they do an audacious spoof of Disney's Snow White even whistling HiHo HiHo It's Off to Work We Go. There's also a very funny song Always Getting Our Man performed by a camp chorus of Mounties on horseback.Some of the jokes in The Frozen Limits will go right past American viewers. Lines like I must spend a penny and Mother Brown's got her knees up are very funny to me but Yanks won't know the cultural references which make these lines so funny. The film also includes references to Joseph Chamberlain Neville Chamberlain council housing and so forth ... which are clearly MEANT to be funny but which are inaccessible to Americans.Bernard Lee best known as M from the James Bond films gives a fine performance here as the villain. Also noteworthy is Moore Marriott an elderly comic actor who gave impressive support to nearly every major British comedian of the 1930s.The Frozen Limits is so funny you'll enjoy it even if you miss half the jokes ... and it's a delightful artefact of wartime Britain.".

	schema:reviewBody "After getting thrown out of their last job and finding employment scarce in the United Kingdom the six members of the Wonder Boys better known as The Crazy Gang see an advertisement for employment in the gold strike town of Red Gulch in the Yukon Territory. It's from a newspaper clipping and on the back there's a story about Chamberlain saying the country better be prepared for war. Off they go to the Yukon and The Frozen Limits.By the way it's case of misplaced Chamberlains. The clipping is forty years old and it refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War rather than Neville in the current crisis. But that's typical of how things go for this crew. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake.Of course when they get there it's a ghost town inhabited only by young Jean Kent and her grandfather Moore Marriott. He's getting on in years and is a bit touched in the head. Marriott's got a gold mine that he's misplaced somewhere that he goes to in his sleep that is when he's sleepwalking. The Gang better help him find that mine or otherwise pretty Ms. Kent won't marry stalwart trapper Anthony Hulme but rather saloon owner Bernard Lee a fate worse than death.This was my first exposure to the Crazy Gang and I can see both why they were so acclaimed in the UK and why they never made any impact across the pond. The jokes come fast and furious and then were a number of things that the Code in the USA just wouldn't allow. The jokes are also strictly topical British and a lot just wouldn't be gotten over here.The sight gags are universal the final chase scene is worthy of anything that the Marx Brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you watch The Frozen Limits tape it if you have a working familiarity with British history and run it two or three times just to make sure you pick up everything. It will be worth it.".

In the main the group's six men were Bud Flanagan Chesney Allen Jimmy Nervo Teddy Knox Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. Hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then Royal Family. The plot here sees them as the Wonder Boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in Alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. Only problem is is that when they finally get to Red Gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late!I often cringe when I see the statement it's very British because it implies that those not of the British Isles may struggle to get it. The reason it bothers me is because in this wwwinternet age I have garnered a ream of non British film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of Ealing Will Hay and the imperious TerryThomas. So then is it true that something such as The Frozen Limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non British audience? Well yes it's true so much here is topically British but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal. With the anarchic not so wild west make over an absolute winner. A winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an American audience now than it will be by a British audience. Not all the comedy works and in truth the big 6 are trumped big time by a film stealing Moore Marriott. But there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts. You are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like I did because of an Ovaltine gag but if you be a classic comedy film fan? I feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here.Now then does the Mounties always get their man? 810".

	schema:headline " An amiable little comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I found this film on DVD I had never heard of The Crazy Gang...and I assume most outside the UK could say the same thing. This group of six comedians apparently took a burlesque style act to the big screen. While there is quite a bit I didn't like the overall effort was pleasant and watchable. However these guys will not make you forget Abbott  Costello whose roots in were American burlesque. Stylewise they are a lot like Bud and Lou actuallyinfused with the energy of the Marx Brothers. This makes their humor far from sophisticated but what they lack in style they make up for with high energy. My biggest complaint about the men in that with six there isn't a whole lot of chance for them to develop unique personalities. Still the film makers did manage to make the most of this doing a very cute parody of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfssomething you sure can't do well with smaller comedy teams! The film finds the Crazies in their native land trying to entice suckers to come in and see their act. However they are flat broke and no one is interested. Suddenly one of the Gang finds a newspaper article about a discovery of gold in the Yukon and off they go to strike it richnot realizing the newspaper is 40 years old! Once in the town mentioned in the paper they find it deserted except for a crazy old man and his sweet daughter. The two take in the Gang and feed and lodge them. In gratitude the guys come up with a scheme to help their benefactorspretend that there is gold along various places owned by the pairknowing that suckers will jump at the chance to buy their land. Now there really is gold...one piece. So they recycle the same piece again and again until finally the suckers catch on and want to hang them! To avoid the rope one of the guys eventually agrees to get marriedsomething you really need to see to believe.All in all the film had some nice moments though there were quite a few flat ones. My favorite bits were the Snow White section as well as the singing Mounties. My biggest criticism of the Gang was that they spoke way too fast. It wasn't that I couldn't understand them with their accentsit's just that the delivery was forced and I think it would have been a bit funnier if they'd slowed down a little. Still I liked it enough that I'd be happy to see another one of their filmsthough they are as rare as hen's teeth to find.".

This makes their humor far from sophisticated but what they lack in style they make up for with high energy. My biggest complaint about the men in that with six there isn't a whole lot of chance for them to develop unique personalities. Still the film makers did manage to make the most of this doing a very cute parody of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfssomething you sure can't do well with smaller comedy teams! The film finds the Crazies in their native land trying to entice suckers to come in and see their act. However they are flat broke and no one is interested. Suddenly one of the Gang finds a newspaper article about a discovery of gold in the Yukon and off they go to strike it richnot realizing the newspaper is 40 years old! Once in the town mentioned in the paper they find it deserted except for a crazy old man and his sweet daughter. The two take in the Gang and feed and lodge them. In gratitude the guys come up with a scheme to help their benefactorspretend that there is gold along various places owned by the pairknowing that suckers will jump at the chance to buy their land. Now there really is gold...one piece. So they recycle the same piece again and again until finally the suckers catch on and want to hang them! To avoid the rope one of the guys eventually agrees to get marriedsomething you really need to see to believe.All in all the film had some nice moments though there were quite a few flat ones. My favorite bits were the Snow White section as well as the singing Mounties. My biggest criticism of the Gang was that they spoke way too fast. It wasn't that I couldn't understand them with their accentsit's just that the delivery was forced and I think it would have been a bit funnier if they'd slowed down a little. Still I liked it enough that I'd be happy to see another one of their filmsthough they are as rare as hen's teeth to find.";

The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love Buddy Buddy and The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure.

	schema:reviewBody "Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli's follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had but FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it's own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie GRUMPY OLD MEN I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat followup as we find how Max Goldman Matthau finds his new mate Maria Ragetti Sophia Loren. It also settles the future of Max's son Mayor Jacob Goldman Kevin Pollak and John Gustafson's Lemmon's daughter Melanie Darryl Hannah and gives a bittersweet farewell to John's father Burgess Meredith.I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck Ossie Davis who had only recently been their rival for Ariel AnnMargaret showed them to be human beings  not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson ironically Burgess Meredith's final role  and a fittingly good one for that fine actor. In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure over ninety years old but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa  he is seen telling Allie Katie Sagona the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears with his own modern interpolations and then singing Dream a Little Dream of Me to put her to sleep. He is vulgar but in a loving sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter he suggests that it is normal  all kids swallow or try to swallow coins  and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can't get Arial he can!. Here he meets somebody to romance Anne Gilbert and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95 God finally comes for Grandpa and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa's ashes are scattered.The continuity theme is also in the portion about Catfish Hunter the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John at one point that the catfish was old when he was a boy which begs the question why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams?  long after Grandpa's youth. The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night alone into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight  the monarch of the lake. But at the end when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together Lemmon probably influenced by AnnMargaret who did the same thing in the first film gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake where it can join Grandpa's ashes. So the legend is returned to it's base.Even in the final moments of the film with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film's conclusion suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed this is one sequel that works very well.".

But the real scene stealer in Grumpier Old Men is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men's beloved bait shop into a 'ristorante' as she puts it. The grumps don't like that one bit and try to drive her out of town but ends up falling for Matthau. It's great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it's predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. 12 out of four".

And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film.Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for AnnMargret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait but also liked to hang around just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann MorganGuilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else.And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids.Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman.Grumpier Old Men keeping the LemmonMatthau standard of comedy high.".

I disagree on both points. The dialogue doesn't have as much shouting this time around and Matthau's girl is most certainly NOT fortysomething. Believe it or not she was 61 at the time and I must say it's quite amazing how good she looks for a woman her age Matthau was 75a pretty big age difference true but I can't imagine there's a lot of men to choose from when you're single and in your 60s!. I hate to chastise another reviewer like this but I thought it was worth mentioning.So in conclusion... it's a good movie. Doesn't deserve its bad rap.710 stars.".

I've liked her in other films but she is so flat in this she's a distraction. She doesn't have the feel for these characters not even her own and so doesn't quite fit. She's not even credible as the mother of the young girl who is so important in her relationship to greatgranddad Burgess Meredith. There must have been some plot device they could have come up with to leave her out of the picture altogether oh well.Now the really good news Sophia Loren. I admit I have always had a crush on her since I saw Houseboat as a kid and when I saw the shower scene in Arabesque i couldn't sleep for a week.Her performance here is splendid romantic comedy is one of her strengths after all but the really really good news is that she was past sixty when she made this film and she looks hot enough to burn a young man's fingers! Really  if I'd been Walter Matthau in that bar scene I'd have gone out with a heartattack right there  and smiling.With an adequate script and such superb actors Deutsch wisely lets the formula roll on without interference. Consequently whatever the shortcomings there's plenty to remember fondly from this film.Oh and don't miss the blooperreel that runs under the final credits  Matthau and Meredith are having a grand old time.Oh and Sophia Loren is still hot.".

Some of it may be a bit farfetched in real life a store owner would get the cops involved but it's good fun.Sadly the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith's final film. On the plus side he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer's. You can really feel the talent in his character.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first go round was such a hit that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau got together for this sequel to the 1993 smash hit Grumpy Old Men. And Grumpier Old Men is every bit as good as the first film. It has some new characters and the scene changes from winter to summer then winter and spring. Most reviewers don't talk about the surprise of the wedding in the first film. And I won't do that for that film or this one. John Lemmon and Max Matthau team up for a time in the movie to plan the wedding of their daughter and son Melanie and Jacob played by Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak. And later to try to thwart the conversion of their bait shop into an Italian restaurant. Sophia Loren is the added ingredient for much humor as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti. She's a cousin of Spaghetti Ragetti whom John and Max know. Her mother is in the picture Mama Ragetti played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. And grandpa Gustafson is back with Burgess Meredith now a couple years older. He tells son John as they sit by the lake drinking beer that he sometimes thinks God has forgotten about him. The hijinks and capers in this film include some hilarious pranks the two friendly enemies pull on the Ragettis. As with the original film this one supposedly takes place in Wabasha Minnesota. While it is a real town on the Mississippi River border with Wisconsin the filming for this and the earlier movie was done in a number of places around that area of southeastern Minnesota. So anyone going to Wabasha won't find the fishing lake the town overlook or some other scenes shown in these films. With the 10 films they made together  especially the nine comedies Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have delighted audiences for decades. May they outlive Catfish Hunter and continue amuse people for decades to come.".

The original film Grumpy Old Men takes place during a picturesque Minnesota winter with snow used to charming effect. The followup capitalizes on a Midwestern summer.

That it is totally 100 predictable every step of the way is only one of its charms... its how you get there where the fun is. And these actors turn in surprisingly memorable performances for such a slight film. I thought Sophia Loren turned in one of her most charming and funny performances as did everyone else. The story was just more interesting and three dimensional than the first film and flowed more organically.The story line is simple ancient classic romantic comedy that these veterans had done so many times it seemed for them like doing a wellknown dance. The fun is not in surprises but in going through the old steps with joy. The actors move through their paces with simplicity and enthusiasm and the film actually captures very well the effects of love.The whole film hangs together and works in a way that for me the first one didn't. It gets airborne. It deserves a higher ranking than my seven except the story is a little too wellworn. It also allows the two protagonists to get a little more real with each other.Even the three charismatic animal actors get caught up in the spirit of fun.One thing about the film that gave me trouble was that all four women being courted in the film are talented accomplished strong and magnificent while all four of the men are hamstrung. I found it mysterious that these women dropped by some miracle into this tiny town would be so strongly attracted.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beneath the Valley is one of Meyer's better known works largely due to its broader distribution overindulgence of feminine beauty and crass humor. These are all timehonored features of Meyer in his films but as his last feature Pandora Peaks typically isn't counted in terms of conventional Meyer timeline everything gets laid on extra thick. Meyer tests the boundaries of just how far he can go before the viewer reaches sensory overload. Nonetheless the impeccable Kitten Natividad and the often unmentioned but still unforgettable Ann Marie stay true to Meyer fashion and manage to suck in the viewer while Meyer dishes out social taboos and common problems associated with the modern couple. Nobody is safe from his scathing satire. The homosexual professional the selfdefeating redneck and the twofaced nature of radioTV evangelism all get a thorough walloping in this film. This film also serves as the epitome of Meyer's work with photography and cinematography. His virtuallypatented up through the bed springs shots are unmistakable and this film serves as the perfect showcase and record of this unique yet effective technique. Never before has any director opted to shoot the love scene from the mattresses point of view! Although this film does indeed lack in comparison to Supervixens or Up! as one of Meyer's late '70s style flicks in terms of dramatic story complexity it's still Russ Meyer and that alone makes the film worthwhile.".

There were a lot of women with oversized breasts like Uschi Digard or Kitten Natividad combined with grotesque and cynical humor. Russ Meyers film was a completely new experience for me it made me interested more and more in independent and underground movies films that you arent able to see very often which are normally not featured in commercial cinemas or difficult to rent in conventional video stores. Films that later followed were Supervixens Up! or Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!. Even masterpieces like Romeros Night of the living dead presented me a completely new side of film making that I hadnt known until then. Lovers of softfocus lens erotic  la David Hamilton surely wont like Russ Meyers movies in any way because his flicks are vulgar obscene and provoking. For all others like me he is a master of the modern pop culture. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Russ Meyer's films may be silly and irreverent but they're also great fun and while Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens is not his best work it's still great fun to watch and certainly comes recommended to Meyer's fans! In my opinion Meyer is at his best when he's mixing comedy porn with a thriller plot structure  with Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! and Supervixens being the best examples of his work. Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens is basically your average porn movie with a focus on a load of setpiece situations but Meyer keeps the laughs coming and there's no shortage of big breasted ladies to keep the audience interested. There isn't really much plot to speak of but the film centres on Levonna  Lamar a couple in Smalltown USA. They're having problems in you guessed it the bedroom as Levonna wants to have sex normally but Lamar only likes to go in through the backdoor. Levonna becomes frustrated so she does what any woman would do  gets herself a wig learns Spanish and pretends to be a Mexican dancer to try and change Lamar's sex preferences...The plot isn't really relied upon and the film is more of an excuse for Meyer to present a load of silly scenes but that isn't a problem. The situations that various characters find themselves in generally are funny  with the scenes that sees Levonna get her wig and Spanish phrase book and a sequence taking place in a dentist's surgery being the highlights of the film. There's plenty of nudity as you might expect and all the girls have overly inflated chests in the true Russ Meyer style. The sex is not exactly hardcore but there's plenty of it and it's not disappointing. The style of the film seems to be a parody of the American apple pie theme and the story is told by a narrator who seems to be taking on the role of the all American workman the twist being that he's always talking about perversion. I don't think Russ Meyer was really trying to say anything with this film  there's a slight hint of a point stemming from the idea of Smalltown USA is a normal small town but look what goes on behind closed doors! but it's not implemented well enough to have much meaning. Overall this is a very decent little porn flick from Russ Meyer and while I'd recommend other films of his over this one Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens is worth a watch.".

The dentist who's a psycho queenie homosexual man who wants to bed Lamar the main character of the film?

People's blood being different colors including a black man who bleeds white blood? The appearance of Russ Meyer during the nonsensical ending?I love earthy movies. And BTVOTUV is definitely earthy but it's too crude and unsophisticated to be enjoyable even as a sex comedy. I mean we're talking about something that's less sophisticated than an Austin Powers movie. Yessh! And the constant talking and music gave me a headache. This is Russ Meyer's last film and was cowritten by Roger Ebert!!! and even if it never takes itself seriously it's an extremely overindulgent film about everything including the pervasive political incorrectness which usually doesn't bother me but not this time.

If it was just this movie BTVOTUV his genius could easily be considered a fluke. But no Motopsycho Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and Vixens is proof enough that BTVOTUV was not a fluke. Now to the movie. The story is fast and entertaining. Don't expect hardcore porn. Instead expect a SkinaMax flick. Imagine the documentary that would have come in the late 1960's and early 70's  as a result of the beginning of deindustrialization in the US of the diminishing smalltown American town complete with a common town folk narrator and characters that have sex as the end all be all. The plot is laughable. A main character that is oblivious to his hot horny wife but somehow likes sodomy. The wife being a woman obviouslywho must concoct some lame plan to gain her husband's attention through sex with various men throughout the town. We are give a documentary type descriptions of the town and its happenings through the narrator. You have to love Russ Meyer's choices for backdrops and locations  including  scrap yard garbage dump desert car interiors strip club river radio station radio station bathroom bathtub. The narrator is great for his dry documentary style monologue yet comical for that same reason. I recommend this movie for people who like MST3k type films. Those films that are bad but so funny. If possible see the other Russ Meyer movies. He's a rare .. very rare talent. Gotta love the names of the characters. One word to sum up BTVOTUV  Zebulon !!Celluloid Rehab".

	schema:reviewBody "It was Russ Meyer who pretty much launched the new Sexploitation industry in 1959 when he made THE IMMORTAL MR. TEAS the first nudiecutie which grossed onemillion dollars and spawned a new breed of adultsonly movies throughout the early60's. Nudiecuties and nudistcolony movies then became a bore among the male audience so they began to mature. Roughies were films which mixed nudity and violence with women getting what they deserve. By that time around the mid60's the Sexploitation era was at it's peak with Roughies like OLGA'S HOUSE OF SHAME and THE DEFILERS along side more creative and even more entertaining nudies like KISS ME QUICK knocking 'em out at grindhouses along 42nd street. By the 70's the innocence of Sexploitation had transformed itself in to porno. Old masters obeyed their audiences' lusts and turned up with more dirtier flicks containing more nudity and less artistic touches. Some usually went overboard while others like Russ Meyer kept their brains in their head to create more funnier and sexier films which we can now look upon as art that has been lost through this age of videotaped and digitised filth.Meyer's 70's features were usually lots of fun. Films like SUPERVIXENS and UP! are highly original and humorous spins on society with the typically great Meyeresque cinematography editing and dialogue. BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRAVIXENS is his last film to date made in 1979 the comingapproach of videocassette in which men could just go their local videostore to get aroused instead of their local grindhouse. It was also a year where things were really changing in the Sexploitation industry and even auteurs like Russ Meyer seemed to be going along with the flow. ULTRAVIXENS is a pretty outrageous film but that does not necessarily mean it's a great film. Stuart Lancaster repeats his role from SUPERVIXENS as a farmer living in Smalltown USA narrating the tale of Lavonia Kitten Natidad and her husband Lamar who does not seem to be as horny as the rest of the town. They go around laying the town's small population and end up happily laying each other again. ULTRAVIXENS contains lots of exaggerated sex and lowerdeck nudity. A bouncyboobed evangelist makes it with Martin Boorman to 'OldTime Religion' while Kitten is fully naked for over half the movie making it with lingerie salesmen nurses and underage boys. So basically this is a movie that will satisfy the more perverse members of the audience. You can be anything but a porn freak to enjoy most of Russ Meyer's movies but it is a completely different case here. His amazing twentyyear career in filmmaking explored a whole range of Sexploitation subgenres nudiecuties documentaries on busty women backwoods dramas morality tales and bigger budget films for Fox Studios all make up for this a tasteless boring totally unsophisticated piece of pornographic crap which seems to crave for more of it's director's special touches. You do get in very small proportions his snappy editing cinematography and characters from previous films. Stuart Lancaster who had been appearing in Meyer's films on and off since 1965 can sometimes be entertaining to watch Uschi Digart once again plays Soul humping her 15yearold son Henry Rowland as Martin Boorman and even RM himself shows at the end.  During the last forty years men's entertainment has depended on it's mostly male audience and what they enjoy viewing. THE IMMORTAL MR. TEAS was made at a time when most bachelors were cleancut and sophisticated. Today's hardcore nonsimulated sex viewed over the internet seems to be aimed at brainless sleazebags who have never had a girlfriend or for that matter many friends. Meyer made this right in between these two eras and seems to be confused whether he's doing another one of his standards or a film for perverts. It's hard to sit through a film who's director does not know what he's getting at. Basically Russ should have stopped with UP! Like the rest of the reviewers some of you may enjoy ULTRAVIXENS more than I did.".

Russ eventually decided to swap his stylish penchant for sex and violence for what I suppose is meant to be a sex comedy with some 'social commentary' thrown in.You would think wouldn't you that a movie which has Martin Borman having sex in a coffin sex at a baptism rape within marriage pedophilia incest and endless nudity including about 30 minutes of Kitten Natividad waving her tits about would somehow manage to be provocative or outrageous. It's not. It's just really boring. I saw it when it came out and it was boring then too. At the end of the movie when the narrator inexplicably walks in on his fourteen year old son screwing his Austrian wife why Austrian? and decides he wants a bit of junior too you ought to be shocked right? Nope. You just think What the fk is the point of this scene? What's the point of any of this?The feeling I get all the way through this movie is that Meyer is trying to show John Waters a trick or two. Forget it. Compare this rubbish with Water's hilarious 'Polyester' from the same year which is far more outrageous funny and subversive and didn't even cop an R rating. Come to think of it I think Divine is probably sexier than half the women in this film. The Christian radio announcer with the absurdly large breasts who goes on and on and on and on in scene after scene is so excruciatingly tedious that I just had to hit fast forward whenever she started up. The endless bonking screaming and bad music will set your teeth on edge.Alright are there any redeeming features in this movie? Well there is one  count it  one  slightly memorable line. The two white trash junkyard workers who are 'bitterly envious of the lower classes' but God if that's the best he can do...There is a thing with colour. People keep bleeding weird colours. But Meyer is no Peter Greenaway. The Uncle Tom black character bleeds white which might have been subtle if one of the characters didn't heavyhandedly point it out to us in case we missed it. Similarly the one potentially clever scene in the whole movie  where the main male character gets locked in a closet by a gay marriage therapist  is ruined by the latter character telling him to 'get out of my closet' about fourteen times. Besides which I'm not sure why why we should infer from said male lead's preference for anal sex with his wife that he's a closet gay anyway.I can only conclude that Meyer had completely lost his talent by this stage. He's never made another movie except some recent DTV thing apparently and frankly who cares?".

'Beneath..' follows a similar format to those two classics but does so with more coarseness and less fun. Meyer takes advantage of the more liberal censorship laws of the late 70s and makes his most explicit movie yet but loses much of his sense of smutty joyfulness. The one thing that saves this movie is the exuberant performance from the dynamic Kitten Natividad. If you are a fan of Kitten and her sensational body then this is the movie for you! Otherwise I could name at least a half a dozen Meyer movies to watch before this one. A disappointment this but still has enough glimpses of Meyer's genius to make it worth a look.".

All the Meyer traits are here  blockhead male chauvinists sexmad townsfolk a grizzled narrator women blessed in the mammary gland area  and are loosely stringed together in what makes up the 'story'.Set in the small town of er Small Town USA our narrator The Man From Small Town USA Stuart Lancaster shows us all it's wacky inhabitants. There's a wellendowed evangelical radio preacher Ann Marie who has sex inside of a coffin a maneating junkyard owner June Mack and a randy dentistmarriage counsellor Robert E. Pearson. In the centre of it all is the beautiful bigbreasted Lavonia Kitten Natividad and her lughead husband Lamar Ken Kerr. They are happy enough only Lavonia's unquenchable thirst for sex and Lamar's preference to 'entering through the back door' means that they must find themselves before they can finally 'come together'. Cowritten with Roger Ebert Beyond the Valley of the UltraVixens is less a story and more a collection of comic fruity vignettes. Some of sharp energetic and funny others can be plodding. The satire is less sharp here than in his better movies for instance Beyond the Valley of the Dolls 1970 or Up! 1976 but his admiration of the female form is possibly clearer here than any of his other movies. He's often called antifeminist but with Meyer it's the women who hold all the power outwitting and overpowering the numbnut males even raping one a 14year old boy I may add in one scene. He certainly doesn't seem to mind though. It's often delightful and even titillating but ultimately lacks the sharpness and daring of Meyer's best work.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

The opening scene with radio evangelist Ann Marie  100000 watts of faith healing power  mounting Martin Bormann in the open coffin is probably one of the most sexiest scenes even put on celluloid. As far as plot goes as concocted and written by Meyer and sometime cowriter Roger Ebert suffice it to say that a complete dolt of a husband is married to Kitten Natividad and the only way he can get an erection or have sex with her is by going through the back door. Stuart Lancaster a mainstay in Meyer films is the onscreen narrator. Ann Marie finally cures the dolt and Uschi Digard turns up near the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRAVIXENS is a Russ Meyer directed boobs butts and bush extravaganza where the plot really only has one purpose  to put the severely siliconeenhanced females in the film in as many clothesshedding situations as possible...and I for one am totally OK with that.The story surrounds several inhabitants of Smalltown USA who are all pretty much a bunch of backwoods nymphos. The main storyline focuses on slowwitted Lamar and oversexed Lavonia played by supersexy Meyer exgirlfriend Kitten Natividad... a couple who have their own unique sexual problems. Lamar can only get turned on by screwing Lavonia in the ass and Lavonia is an insatiable nympho that just can't get enough dick or pussy in some cases from anyone that's around. The film follows the antics of the couple as they try to work through their issues. Along the way the audience is introduced to several other equally endowed women and equally IQdeficient men which leads to some pretty comical encounters...The plot may be gaunt but the female flesh on display sure isn't. BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRAVIXENS has more gigantic tits asses and furry '70s pussfros on display and even a few boners for the ladies... than you can shake your dong at. Again the plot isn't anything to really write home about  but the situations that the characters are thrown into are pretty damn funny in most cases and the virtually nonstop assault of semiexplicit softcore sex scenes should keep any sexploit filmlover more than amused. My only real complaint would be the gross underusage of Uschi Digard Ann Marie and Sharon Hill  all of whom are just as if not hotter than Natividad  especially Uschi who only gets one very short scene. Even so  sexploit fans will rejoice over this one. Not as memorable as BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS my personal favorite of the handful of Meyer films that I've seen but far more laden with nudity and sex  and I'll never complain about that. A fun and truly funny sexromp that is well worth a look...810".

I thought the first woman was great and liked the way she dance'd before she went in the coffin. I like'd this whole 70's look and style of the film and the lighting and all these colours and how they played together it was just visually stunning. The only thing that bothered me was that everybody was always balling and it did get a bit to much. The black woman was really scary and just ugly. But i thought Kitten was great. I read somewhere that she's russ's wife. She was great and horny as hell. I think this was russ meyer's last fil i'd give it 67 of 10. not as good as Up witch is great and i give 89".

	schema:reviewBody "First I must respectfully disagree with one reviewer here who kept describing the film as a screwball comedy. Even in the 1930s every comedy was not a screwball comedy and this isn't one despite one kinda goofy car episode. It's not a drawing room comedy either. It's simply a domestic comedy...in fact is it really a comedy. Let's see you have an obsessive boss that has no real personal life a sister that's a terrible prude and suppresses any family joy in life a young daughter who is so unhappy that she's become a terrible brat a young lady Colbertwho has her eyes on her boss but then finds herself in an unsatisfying marriage and a little girl who then pines because the stepmother who has brought some joy into her life then leaves home. In many ways this is a pretty serious story  with some comedic moments.Several reviewers have wondered why the Colbert character is interested in the Melvyn Douglas boss character to begin with. A fair criticism. The screenwriters and director sure haven't given us much of a clue about that. But how many of us have found ourselves in an unfulfilling relationship or marriage ultimately realizing we made a mistake. And I tried to remember that this film was made in 1935. Films were not always very sophisticated back then...they were slowly growing up...and the story here is certainly more sophisticated than many other films from the same time.Claudette Colbert is quite good here though obviously not quite as well developed as an actress as she was in the 1940s. Melvyn Douglas was good in the role he played although it's rather hard to like that role. Two standout performances were 12yearold Edith Fellows as Douglas' bratty daughter who develops into a rather nice child once the home situation improves and Raymond Walburn as Douglas' butler the scenes of Douglas and Walburn in a drunken state were among the better drunk scenes I've seen.If you see this movie for what it is  a drama story with comedy overtones  you'll really enjoy it. It's far better than many other mid30s productions...and 1939 was just around the corner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sold as and considered a comedy SHE MARRIED HER BOSS is actually a lighthearted women's picture with only occasional comic moments. Claudette Colbert stars as the executive secretary of department store owner Melvyn Douglas who has secretly been in love with him for seven years although he has never seen her as anything more than a very valuable assistant. Wealthy Douglas lives in a mansion with his frosty hypochondriac sister Katherine Alexander and his bratty nineyearold daughter Edith Fellows product of his one unhappy marriage it's never stated if Douglas was widowed or divorced but one presumes the latter given the hostile memories both he and Alexander have of his former wife.Claudette's moneyed pal Jean Dixon is appalled how she is wasting her youth pining for this uninterested man and tries to break her away from him and toward rival store owner Michael Bartlett. When Dixon informs Douglas that Claudette is quitting her job to work for Barlett untrue Douglas is desperate to keep her and learns part of the reason is her desire to someday marry he proposes to a surprised Colbert who happily accepts the scene is curiously not filmed only to learn shortly after the marriage that it basically remains little more than a business relationship. Meanwhile Bartlett is not giving in even with Claudette now a married lady after all he himself is still legally wed! This is a pleasant film smoothly directed by Gregory LaCava but it really needed a rewrite and maybe revised casting. Claudette is perfection as always in this type of role but Douglas whom often comes across as the dull suitor who loses the girl in the romantic comedies in which he is actually the real love in the picture fails to show any hint of charm that might have bewitched her all these years although his poorly written character doesn't give him much to work with. The delightful comedienne Jean Dixon  so wonderful as the maid in La Cava's MY MAN GODFREY  is badly cast as Claudette's chic older sardonic buddy in a part that cries for Helen Broderick. Edith Fellows however is terrific as one of the most realistic brats on screen in the 1930's a pathological liar who talks back to adults and bullies dogs. Edith's scenes with Claudette as a nononsense but warm stepmother tries to reach out to her are extremely believable and sensational. It's also a pleasure to see Grayce Hale usually cast in unbilled bits as fat and stupid women given a fairly sizable supporting role as Claudette's assistant at the office that completely lacks the ridicule she usually is given onscreen. Katherine Alexander is acceptable as Douglas' sister and comedian Raymond Walburn unrecognizable in his early middleage from his best known period a decade later in movies is for the most part excellent as the longsuffering butler.The movie has a shocking lapse of taste in it's use of drunkdriving by Walburn as comedy in crowded city streets no less!! although this may have been a period when the issue was not taken as seriously as it should have been. SHE MARRIED HER BOSS is definitely lesser Colbert but this is one actress who is always worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Claudette Colbert as a Smurfette.";
	schema:reviewBody "I used to deal in oldmovie memorabilia. In the 1960s while running a stall in the Portobello Road I acquired and resold a fullcolour poster for 'She Married Her Boss'. What a bizarre piece of artwork! The poster depicted Claudette Colbert with blue eyes blue hair and blue skin she looked a proper Smurfette or perhaps an OompaLoompa. Worse luck the blue Colbert was placed against a background in the same shade of blue making her seem to vanish altogether ... except for her lips which were bright red. For decades I wanted to view this movie to find out if it was as weird as the poster art.It turns out to be even weirder. Who designed the costumes here? In the opening scene Colbert wears a dress with some nice gauntlet cuffs but it also has a titchy little bowtie and a pair of lapels the size and shape of an aircraft carrier. In a later scene Jean Dixon wears an outfit with what appears to be a springboard jutting out of her left shoulder. In the final sequence Colbert sports raccoon shoulder pads that are so enormous she looks like a linebacker.This is a screwball comedy but it's screwier than it needs to be. Michael Bartlett plays a lounge lizard who charms Colbert by telling her she ought to have a mole on her chin. Ugh! You know those horribly phony camera setups in which an actor sits at a piano keyboard pumping his elbows and we're expected to believe he's playing? Bartlett does that here in one of the fakest versions I've ever seen.On the positive side there's a standout performance by 12yearold Edith Fellows as a spoilt brat. Fellows was an immensely talented child actress who had the misfortune to be much less pretty than Shirley Temple so she got lumbered with Virginia Weidler roles. Colbert hauls Fellows offscreen and gives her a spanking which would have been funnier if shown on screen. I was delighted by the performance of Raymond Walburn as Melvyn Douglas's butler amiable loyal and eventually drunken. Walburn usually played blustering shysters or roguish criminals so it's a pleasure to see him given this change of pace. Grace Hayle a character actress whose heavy physique usually cast her in buffoonish roles is personable here in a nice bit role as Colbert's assistant.Although the plot is unbelievable even by screwball comedy standards individual set pieces are delightful and funny. Colbert and Bartlett host a cocktail party in the shop window of Douglas's department store with shop dummies as the guests.The climax of the movie is meant to be funny and romantic but I found it saddening and maddening. Douglas pretends to abduct Colbert at gunpoint we know he's faking but she doesn't and she's evidently terrified. Douglas and Walburn both drunk to the eyebrows take Colbert speeding through the city in Douglas's motorcar the stonkered Walburn at the wheel whilst an undercranked camera shows the car speeding wildly through the streets. I can laugh at comedy based on drunkenness but it stops being funny when the drunks grab a steering wheel there have been so many drinkdriving tragedies I just can't laugh at the notion of an inebriate operating a car.Talking of booze this movie was directed by Gregory La Cava a hugely talented and underrated director who ruined his career through alcoholism. Maybe I'm reading too much into this but quite a few of La Cava's films  including this one  depict characters who solve their problems by getting drunk. I'll rate 'She Married Her Boss' 7 out of 10 but I wish someone could explain this movie's weird Smurfette poster and those ridiculous costumes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read the other comments that talked about aspects of this film that are dated offensive or just plain bizarre. I was rather surprised that no one brought up the movie's cringeinducing gender stereotypes. Anyone who has seen Claudette Colbert or Melvyn Douglas in the films they made before the introduction of the Production Codein mid1934 would immediately recognize the heavy hand of the censors who did their best to impose on Hollywood their narrowminded idea of family values. On the basis of this film it would appear that allowing married women to pursue a career would bring about the end of American society but child abuse and drunk driving are just good clean fun! Though the cast and plot look good on paper the result is strained and uneven as if the script had been written to PreCode standards and then hastily cleaned up so as not to offend the censors.Claudette Colbert plays Julia Scott a bright capable and confident executive assistant at a large department store. She runs the busy office like a welloiled machine and clearly enjoys the work. It's hard to fathom why she's spent six years mooning over her boss Richard Barclay. The way the role of Barclay is written the usually charming Melvyn Douglas comes off as a humorless sexless cipher. All the more jarring then to hear Julia talk about her desire to give up her terrific job and marry Barclay. Without a trace of irony she describes marriage as a woman's REAL career. Okay she wants to get married. But why on earth would the lovely and vivacious Julia want Barclay as a husband? Not only is he dull as ditchwater he treats her as if she were a piece of superefficient office equipment. Once they're married he ridicules her for assuming the stereotypical role of housewife despite the fact that she's set his chaotic home in order and tamed his obnoxious brat of a daughter. There's nothing in the movie to explain Barclay's eventual change of heart apparently it's brought on by a quart of whiskey. So much for good old family values. The film is so devoid of any hint of sexual attraction that we don't see a single cuddle or smoochnot even at the very end when it's clear that the newlyweds will finally get around to doing what newlyweds are famous for doing. Julia has more physical contact and chemistry with Leonard Rogers her sweettempered playboy suitor who's a lot more appealing as husband material than that cold fish Barclay.Solid performances are turned in by familiar actors in some of the secondary roles Raymond Walburn as the perfect butler Katherine Alexander as Barclay's dramaqueen sister Edith Fellows as the evil daughter and especially Jean Dixon as Julia's wisecracking matchmaking best friend.Would love to have seen this film made just a year earlier before the Hays Office started taking their moralizing hatchet to so many of the things that made movies of the 30s worth watching.".

On the other hand the male lead Melvin Douglas plays such a onedimensional character that he is tough to like. It really looks as if the writers just didn't bother to write his part with any depth or care. As a result Colbert comes off like an angel and Douglas comes off as a complete putz. Had this difference not been so extreme and his character a been written a bit more believably the film would have no doubt become a classic.Colbert plays the brilliant and indispensable secretary to the head of a department store owned by Douglas. However despite Douglas having lots of money his home life is a mess. He's a widower his young daughter is a beastly little brat and his sister who lives with them is a bitter old hen who does much to make the home a mess. But because he's totally blind to the truth Douglas can't figure out how to make his home work as well as his office which is essentially run by Colbert. So in desperation he asks Colbert to marry him and work her magic in his personal life. There are two major problems with this however. First while Colbert adores him his feelings are rather indifferent. She is saddened to see that it's more a marriage of convenience than anything else what a jerk Douglas turns out to be!. Second the sister does everything she can to ruin the marriage. For a while at least Douglas is blind to the truth and the marriage is a failure. Naturally by the end all is patched up and its happily ever aftera clich I know but an ending most out there wanted to see.There are a couple elements to this film that might alarm some. The bratty child truly was in need of a lot of discipline and when Colbert administers it with a hairbrush I am sure some out there might flinch. Well considering the child was a pathological liar and vicious the corporal punishment seemed justified though perhaps not with a brush. This part didn't bother me at allI just wanted to see Colbert then turn the brush on her sisterinlaw!! Second in the end there was a very irresponsible scene that made drunk driving seem fun! In addition this was just dumb and made me flinch at the notion of sober Colbert hopping a ride with a drunk driver! Still despite these odd scenes the film is entertaining and a great showcase for Colbert.".

The problem is Robert marries her thinking that she is not like other women  that she is efficient and practical not womanly and needing love. But she has been secretly in love with him from the start and is dismayed that he wants her to continue in her executive position at the office when all she wants is to be a wife.Edith Fellows definitely showed that movie brats had more fun and for the first half hour she did  throwing major tantrums going on a hunger strike and just being obnoxious but after Rita took to her with a hair brush she suddenly became another movie darling  singing reciting poems with even a crying scene at the end!!! The movie was extremely fortuitous for Melvyn Douglas whose career before this was at a low ebb. Columbia was finding it difficult to get a big enough star to bask in Claudette's shadow.

	schema:headline " Should be a wonderful comedy but some scenes will jar a modern audience";
	schema:reviewBody "Most modern viewers of 1930's comedies will be accustomed to the necessity of suspending disbelief and modern sensibilities to entirely enjoy these films. However She Married Her Boss contains one or two scenes which make this a difficult task. The main problematic scene is the drunk driving scene which is sufficiently reckless as to be just plain alarming to modern audiences but fortunately occurs at the end of the movie so as not to be troubling throughout. The second such scene however is the aural scene of Julia Claudette Colbert spanking Anabelle several times with a hairbrush. In modern times with the idea of physically punishing children being so controversial this scene refuses to simply fade into the background of the film and become simply a comedic scene and lingers in a slight feeling of unease in watching the remainder of the film despite Annabelle's growing affection for Julia. Simliarly Julia's friends taunts of Annabelle appear somewhat cruel being adults ganging up on an unhappy child no matter how obnoxious her behaviour.Although some of the comedic aspects of the film may not translate to a modern audience the film nevertheless contains some gems of serious scenes  Claudette Colbert's reaction to her husband mocking her for behaving like a woman and his criticism that she is making their marriage just like any other marriage. Similarly the shop dummy scene can be enjoyed on a number of levels the drunken comedy is delightful but also wonderful is Colbert's pained expression and declaration that Julia doesn't live here anymore. Finally my favourite scene of the film when Melvyn Douglass confronts Colbert after her antics in the shop window appear in the press effectively calling her second hand goods. Colberts reactions from resignation to pride to hurt to confrontation are a pure acting lesson.While some of the comedy may struggle to appeal to modern audiences the scene of the new bride Colbert being carried over the threshhold by her new husband's butler remains one of the funniest moments in 1930's comedy and Julia's kicking of the child shop dummy surely a reaction to her troubled stepdaughter remains a guilty pleasure so that despite some reservations the film continues to work on both the dramatic and comedic levels despite some need to be prepared more than usual to put modern considerations aside to entirely enjoy this.".

	onyx:emotionText "Most modern viewers of 1930's comedies will be accustomed to the necessity of suspending disbelief and modern sensibilities to entirely enjoy these films. However She Married Her Boss contains one or two scenes which make this a difficult task. The main problematic scene is the drunk driving scene which is sufficiently reckless as to be just plain alarming to modern audiences but fortunately occurs at the end of the movie so as not to be troubling throughout. The second such scene however is the aural scene of Julia Claudette Colbert spanking Anabelle several times with a hairbrush. In modern times with the idea of physically punishing children being so controversial this scene refuses to simply fade into the background of the film and become simply a comedic scene and lingers in a slight feeling of unease in watching the remainder of the film despite Annabelle's growing affection for Julia. Simliarly Julia's friends taunts of Annabelle appear somewhat cruel being adults ganging up on an unhappy child no matter how obnoxious her behaviour.Although some of the comedic aspects of the film may not translate to a modern audience the film nevertheless contains some gems of serious scenes  Claudette Colbert's reaction to her husband mocking her for behaving like a woman and his criticism that she is making their marriage just like any other marriage. Similarly the shop dummy scene can be enjoyed on a number of levels the drunken comedy is delightful but also wonderful is Colbert's pained expression and declaration that Julia doesn't live here anymore. Finally my favourite scene of the film when Melvyn Douglass confronts Colbert after her antics in the shop window appear in the press effectively calling her second hand goods.

	schema:headline " Dysfunction galore in this comedyromance";
	schema:reviewBody "She Married Her Boss is a pleasant comedyromance with some lessons about workaholics and dysfunctional families. Claudette Colbert is Julia Scott the sixyear manager behind the scenes of the Barclay Department Store in New York. While a superb business manager she has pined for years for the boss. Melvin Douglas is he Richard Barclay. Having had a marriage that ended in divorce he's now all business and scarcely notices women other than as employees or customers.Without a loving wife's touch at home the Barclay household has become a den of dysfunction. It starts with Richard's sister Gertrude played very well by Katharine Alexander who can't begin to manage a household. It includes his daughter Annabel played by Edith Fellows who has become a spoiled brat. And it involves servants who have used the family dysfunction to line their own pockets.That's the setting when Julia and Richard eventually tie the knot. And the changes she brings about work for the better for everyone except  you guessed it Richard. Douglas does a fine job of playing a hardnosed business type who just won't be enticed to warmth love and the rest of the trimmings  even with his attractive new wife and household manager.This is billed as a comedy and that it is. There isn't a lot of witty dialog but some situations that would otherwise be considered drama have a spark when Julia takes charge.It's an enjoyable film but one that is most interesting for how Julia handles the Barclay dysfunction all around her. Colbert shows her great talent as an actress in this role that dallies between comedy love seriousness sadness and taking charge to make changes and get things done.The funniest single aspect in this film is Gertrude's penchant for fainting at things that seem too ghastly for her blue blood to endure. One time when she tells Richard she may faint he says Go ahead! and walks out of the room. There is a little bit of screwball comedy toward the end when Richard gets soused with his butler Franklin played very well by Raymond Walburn. I won't give away the shenanigans they and Julia get into but let's say it might be a scrape with the law. Toward the end Richard and Franklin are waiting for Julia to come down the stairs and Gertrude faints  plop on the floor and they don't know where she went.".

For 6 years Julia has been waiting for Richard to ask her to marry him. But he's shown zero romantic interest in this gorgeous brainy woman. For one thing seems he had a very bad experience with his exwife and is shy about getting into another relationship. But when Julia gets a job offer in Paris at double salary he's finally persuaded to marry her with no wedding party frills to avoid losing her help at the office. But Julia has other ideas about what kind of life she wants as a married woman. She wants to be a pampered 'stayathome' wife and mother rather than continue the hectic life of a career woman.. At first Richard argues against her idea. But when she's about to run off with a business associate he gets drunkalong with the butler and tells her she's going for a little ridesaid with the suggestion of an ominous outcome. The drunk butlerchauffeur weaves through city traffic to a destination where they pick up a few bricks. She suggests they are going to weigh her down in a river drowning. Actually they have another purpose for the bricks in the whirlwind finish which I will let you find out for yourself. The majority of the humor relates to Richard's bratty halfgrown daughter AnnabelEdith Fellows. At first she hates Judith and her unfamiliar ways.

It's clear that both Gertrude and Richard have been too soft on Annabel and have no idea how to play with her to make her happy.

Not only because of what I learned in the movie itself but from the reading I have done after wards because it awakened my interest and curiosity. Good historical movies shall work just like that  and for a good cause a little poetical license is acceptable! Because without the unconsummated and tragic love story also if it did not happen in reality this movie would not have been half as thrilling.Some reviewers here have complained that Spencer Tracy looks too old to play Captain Jones but I find this strange as the real Captain Jones was the same age as Tracy... and as Jones also partook of the hardships on board not only on this famous voyage but in a whole life at sea and in fact died only a year after he returned to England HE probably did not look like a spring chicken either... I also must admit that I at least find Tracy attractive in this part!The best thing about this movie is the dialogue there are many lines that are as beautiful as poetry. Captain Jones' words when he talks of his broken ship his lonely nights and his feverish longing for Mrs Bradford is some of the best dialogue I have ever heard in a love scene written for a movie. Very pungent and erotic with a feeling of impending doom...The feeling of being transported to the time period is very good. The sailing part is as far as I can see accurate  you get to see a little of the sailors really working the sails pulling up the anchor etc. I would have wanted more of this. The photo is beautiful and there are impressive storm scenes etc..There is one thing lacking though I would have expected more religious ardor from the passengers. More spirit. After all these are the founding fathers!!! I think they come out as too ordinary too preoccupied with practical matters like any migrating peasants.".

This is a film adaption of a novel by Ernest Gebler in which the author threw some things in there that never happened or are the subject of much speculation.Gene Tierney's character of Dorothy Bradford did in fact drown under unknown circumstances but there is no reason to think it was suicide as opposed to an accident and her yearnings for Captain William Jones of the Mayflower is just part of the Gebler's fertile imagination. He was certainly imaginative enough giving a little scandalous romance into the Puritan community.Plymouth Adventure is a nice tribute to those brave and hearty souls who set forth into an unknown land in which half of them died the first winter but those who survived creating an American national tradition in the Thanksgiving Holiday. And a black day for turkeys everywhere.Lately the religious right has latched on to the Pilgrims in their efforts to prove America is a Christian nation. Of course once they got here they ran what became the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a theocracy. Still they were an intrepid lot and their courage is beyond question.Spencer Tracy gives a fine performance as the rugged and cynical sea captain of the Mayflower the chartered ship which takes the Pilgrims from Southampton to an unknown world. I think Tracy drew a lot from some of the characters in Eugene O'Neill's plays in his portrayal of Jones. He has a moment in which he says that people have disappointed him but the sea never let him down. Could have come from any of O'Neill's works.An Oscar for Best Special Effects went to Plymouth Adventure showing some of the travails at sea the Mayflower went through. Back in its day MGM had a huge water tank that was used for all the sea sagas filmed there. Occasionally other studios rented it out the facility was that good. Tracy has been there before when he was in Captains Courageous in spirit so to speak.Players like Van Johnson Lowell Gilmore Dawn Addams Noel Drayton Barry Jones Kathleen Lockhart play some of the Pilgrim names come down from historical legend. Leo Genn is William Bradford author of the Mayflower Compact which is cited interminably now by fundamentalist TV reverends as proof of our Christian heritage. Genn who rivaled Ronald Colman as possessor of the most beautiful speaking voice in the English speaking world would be a pleasure to listen to reading the Erie County phone book.My favorite in this is young Tommy Ivo who played William Button the only voyager on the Mayflower to die at sea. His death scene is a heart string tugging experience.Not the real story of the Mayflower voyage Plymouth Adventure is still good entertainment and a stirring tribute to those who formalized the giving of thanks and the reasons they had to be thankful.".

However apart from a little artistic license here and there the essence of this story is quite true and the film is very watchableeven if a few plots here and there are hooey. The worst is the supposed suicidewhich is not confirmed in the contemporary accounts of her death. In fact this entire story line is a problem as it almost certainly never occurred. But apart from that and a few bits of artistic license the tale is pretty good historically speaking. And also the film fails to really discuss the true cost to the settlers as they lost half their people in the first year in Plymouth Colonysomething the film never mentions as it ends just after their arrival.The story chronicles the journey from England to the New World and shows the hardships that the passengers and crew endured. Fortunately the film pointed out that not all the settlers were religious pilgrims but a mixed bag seeking a new life in America. Their hunger thirst and sickness were all featured in the filmthough a bit sanitized as few in the audience really wanted to see all the vomiting and fever that really occurred! So is this a perfect film? No. But considering the average film of the era about Americana tended to play very fast and loose with the facts this one stands up very well. And because of this it is still very watchable today. Good acting a pretty good script and good directionit's much better than I expected.".

The worst is the supposed suicidewhich is not confirmed in the contemporary accounts of her death. In fact this entire story line is a problem as it almost certainly never occurred. But apart from that and a few bits of artistic license the tale is pretty good historically speaking. And also the film fails to really discuss the true cost to the settlers as they lost half their people in the first year in Plymouth Colonysomething the film never mentions as it ends just after their arrival.The story chronicles the journey from England to the New World and shows the hardships that the passengers and crew endured. Fortunately the film pointed out that not all the settlers were religious pilgrims but a mixed bag seeking a new life in America. Their hunger thirst and sickness were all featured in the filmthough a bit sanitized as few in the audience really wanted to see all the vomiting and fever that really occurred! So is this a perfect film? No. But considering the average film of the era about Americana tended to play very fast and loose with the facts this one stands up very well. And because of this it is still very watchable today. Good acting a pretty good script and good directionit's much better than I expected.";

There were 102 passengers  the majority of them becoming the settlers of Plymouth Colony in what is now Massachusetts and the crew is estimated to have been about 30 but the exact number is unknown . The pilgrims are looking for a land where they can worship according to their beliefs . Captained by Captain Christopher Jones Spencer Tracy who piloted and helped the valiant pilgrims  he stayed at the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts  waiting for favorable weather to return home to England on the Mayflower . This voyage has become an iconic story in some of the earliest annals of American history  with its story of death and of survival in the harsh New England winter environment . About half of these emigrants died in the first Winter . Many Americans can trace their ancestry back to one or more of these individuals who 'Saints' and 'Strangers' together would become known as the Pilgrims . Thirteen of the eighteen servants listed were attached to Leiden families the other five were families who boarded in London . Four of those travelers listed were small children  to be classed as indentured servants . Other notorious pilgrims were John Alden Van Johnson  William Bradford Leo Genn  Gilbert Winslow John Dehner  Edward Winslow Lowell Gilmore  and William Brewster Barry Jones . Luckily  it took place the culmination of the voyage in the signing of the Mayflower Compact was an event which established a rudimentary form of democracy with each member contributing to the welfare of the community . The Native Americans living in the area  the Patuxet were totally wiped out by a series of epidemics between 16161619 caught from English fishermen who landed regularly in the area . Indian tribes ran away and fell ill  and then the colonialists built in the cleared area where the Indian village stood and utilized the cleared farm land that the tribe had abandoned . However  actually  after landing in Massachusetts  the colonists tried three times to sail southward to Virginia but was driven back by storms .Interesting historical film about the famous feat based on the novel by Ernest Gebler with screenplay by Helen Deutsch  describing trials and tribulations of the risked sea journey  a fundamental event in American history . It packs emotion  drama  love stories and historical happenings . Very good cast plenty of familiar Hollywood faces as Spencer Tracy who has an illstarred romance with the wife of a religious fanatic well played by Gene Tierney  both of whom had an affair that lasted for the duration of filming . Support cast is frankly excellent  such as  Leo Genn  John Dehner  Barry Jones  Dawn Addams  Lloyd Bridges  Paul Cavanagh and Van Johnson  though filmmaker Clarence Brown later said casting him was a huge mistake . In addition  other uncredited players  John Dierkes  John Alderson  Murray Matheson and Rhys Williams . The film is well based on historical events  though including some fictitious incidents  as Dorothy Bradford did indeed fall overboard and was drowned while husband William was exploring for a site for the establishment of Plymouth . For once  the colonists are correctly shown building framed houses and not log cabins as is commonly supposed . Decent production design by prolific Cedric Gibbons  though most film is set on the vessel  being some claustrophobic . Colorful cinematography in Technicolor by William Daniels  Greta Garbo's regular cameraman . Evocative and thrilling musical score by Miklos Rozsa .The motion picture nicely produced by Dore Schary was professionally directed  though with no enthusiasm by Clarence Brown . Clarence studied and learned with French director Maurice Tourneur . He directed several actors in Oscarnominated performances. During his career Brown directed or produced more than 50 widelyacclaimed fulllength films  many during his long association with prestigious MGM and worked with many of the industry's most illustrious performers . Clarence got a lot of successes  such as  Anna Karenina  Maria Walewska  Intruder in the dust  The yearling  National velvet  Song of Love  among others .".

Actually Hollywood was not primarily responsible for the plot fabricationsas the film was based upon the then recent novel of the same title by Ernest Gebler. In contradiction to some reviewers I consider this Spencer Tracy's greatest characterization albeit a superficially negative one. All the major characters were well cast even if Gene Tierney made an unlikely beautiful Dorothy Bradford whom Tracy as Captain Christopher Jones lusted after. Some object that Dorothy could not have found Jones romantically attractive being old very grumpy and contemptuous of the colonists. I sensed that it was more a case of pity on her part and may have included some dissatisfaction with her husband and hope that she could charm Jones into not leaving for England until spring. Without the ship as a sanctuary until the colonists built adequate housing they surely would all perish from exposure and starvation. Dorothy presumably felt that this divided loyalty between two men was an unforgivable sin or an unsolvable problem necessitating her death. Would Jones have stayed with the colonists overwinter had she not presumably killed herself? I doubt it. It was her sacrificial death that shortly preceded his changed attitude toward the colonists.John Aldren's flirtation with the comely teen Dawn Addams has possible historical accuracy as they would eventually marry....Lloyd Bridges is great as Jone's piraticallooking swarthy first mate and enforcer ready to lead a mutiny when Jones inexplicably decided to stay the winter with the colonists.The long episode of the severe storm is quite riveting. The bit about a large passenger screw being used to help support a cracked beam is historically true....Actually it was another passenger not William Brewster who was washed overboard during a storm. Making it Brewster added to the drama with Jones over Dorothy.The screen writer presumably followed Gebler in exploiting several common myths to add important fictional plot components. Thus the implication that the initial landing near Cape Cod instead of the targeted Chesapeake region was a planned conspiracy by financial backers with the cooperation of Jones is an unnecessary clear fabrication if adding to the frictional drama between the colonists and Jones. In contrast to common myth the agreed upon target was the present NYC area which was included in the Virginia Charter of the times not the present state of Virginia! Most of the Separatist colonists had recently been living in Holland and had heard good reports of this area from the Dutch. After making landfall in the Cape Cod area due to repeated storms the Mayflower made an attempt to sail south to this area but weather and current difficulties along with the stormbattered condition of the Mayflower caused them to return to their original landing area. Of course the Dutch would soon begin settlements in the NYCHudson area.The central lovehate triangle between Jones William and Dorothy Bradford has no historical support if much adding to the drama. Dorothy did die of drowning after disappearing from the Mayflower soon after it docked along Cape Cod. However there is no clear reason to believe it was a suicide rather than accidental.This accusation originates from a mid19th century fictional magazine story presumably repeated in Gebler's novelwhich I haven't read.The characterization of Captain Jones as a disagreeable extreme worldweary cynic has no historical support. There are however several historical facts or misconceptions that might lend some credence to this characterization. He had fathered 10 children most of whom had died as infants or small children. Secondly during the 19th century it was thought that the captain was one Thomas Jones a sometimes pirate and slave trader thus presumably a rather rough cynical character. This might also lend credence to the rather piratical charisma of the first mate Mr.Coppin a genuine historical name. Thirdly there was a seaman who repeatedly belittled the colonists as having no chance of surviving this voyage or their desired destination. Interestingly this seaman was one of only two to die during the voyage! Surprisingly this seaman is not included in the film story hence probably was incorporated into the Captain's character.Some reviewers think Tracy was too old for the part of Captain Jones. Well the real Jones was only 2 years younger and died only a year after returning to England..Incidentally his return trip took only 1 month compared to the more than 2 months getting to Cape Cod. This shows the influence of favorable winds the Gulf Stream and generally fewer storms in spring.".

It certainly has a lot going for it  Tracy Gene Tierney whose costarring role is pivotal yet smaller than one might expect Van Johnson and Leo Genn. The scenes at sea are done well particularly the storm sequences. Yet somehow this film seems to come up just a bit short.While it's definitely fictionalized there's a lot of history here too. I tend to read up on historical films and this one seems more realistic with the history than one is used to. Oddly enough Van Johnson  in my view an okay and pleasant enough actor  probably comes off best of actor in this film. Spencer Tracy comes off waaaaay too dour for most of the film although that does facilitate his redemption after landing at Plymouth I would have to say that in regard to that characterization perhaps the director overdid it. Gene Tierney plays who role well but I think she might have been disappointed in the scope of it. There appears to be at least a possibility that her character did indeed commit suicide in real life as portrayed in the film. Leo Genn does well as William Bradford husband of the Tierney character. Lloyd Bridges isn't quite a swashbuckler here  too earth for that but plays his role nicely.So what is it that's missing here. Well perhaps its that this is a story that should have been inspiring yet in this rendition seems depressing. A number of Clarence Brown's director films are quite notable and enjoyable and he had worked with Tracy as Edison before. But this time the results are disappointing. Interestingly although this was his last film 1952 he lived another 35 years. Perhaps he realized he no longer had the spark.".

Mr. Tracy doesn't let his passengers know they are headed for New England instead of Virginia. But in the end the local savages are more friendly up North we are told...How these adventurers survived the hellish conditions is revealed to be due to Tracy's forbidden love for the wife of passenger pilgrim Leo Genn a Godlyclean and goodlooking Gene Tierney as Dorothy Bradford.

Mr. Tracy doesn't let his passengers know they are headed for New England instead of Virginia. But in the end the local savages are more friendly up North we are told...How these adventurers survived the hellish conditions is revealed to be due to Tracy's forbidden love for the wife of passenger pilgrim Leo Genn a Godlyclean and goodlooking Gene Tierney as Dorothy Bradford.

As usual an amazing demonstration of acting skill by Tracy.Van Johnson basically a humble kindly sort of actor is appropriately cast as a poor man in the hardworking carpentry profession. Leo Genn of the golden voice and saintly countenance is well cast as a gentle religiousminded leader. Actually Genn's voice is beyond golden I would describe his voice as 24carat gold or maybe even platinum. Gene Tierney a complex and tragic beauty and fine actress is cast as what else... you guessed it her character is beautiful and tragic. And on and on I could comment about the triumphs of good casting that add immeasurably to the success of Plymouth Adventure.The script is not very dynamic and while not intense in the moviedrama sense manages to avoid all the maudlin or preachy traps that it could have fallen into.

Tracy reminds us again of the reason he is regarded as one the greatest actors of his generation. No doubt that the love interest between him and Bradford's wife is probably apocryphal and was inserted to fulfill Hollywood's requirement for a romantic angle but so what? Leaving that aside the movie is a pretty engrossing depiction of the trials and travails of the Pilgrims although the conditions on their actual voyage were probably a lot grimmer than Hollywood could politely depict in those days.

That is 1620 AD. Henry Cabot Lodge was one of the passengers. Well he might as well have been. The reason the Pilgrims were moving from Plymouth to Plymouth Rock was that they'd been subject to religious persecution in England. They didn't feel that the Church of England had moved far enough away from the sybaritic splendor of the highly ritualized Roman Catholic Church. It's a little complicated but that's the general idea.Well it was a perilous trip across the North Atlantic in 1620. They used sailing ships in those days and they were almighty slow so people ran out of food and water and stuff like that. Not like the today's QE2 where I left the hair salon with a pompadour that made me look like Donald Trump  proud and unashamed. I'm not sure the British cuisine on the QE2 was that much of an improvement over the Mayflower's but so be it. Boy the Mayflower passengers were lucky to make it at all. But they did and they gave us the American Revolution the Constitution baked beans four presidents and ultimately this movie.This is an MGM product so you get solidasarock family entertainment with magnificent production values. The special effects are fine. There is an exciting storm at sea that threatens to destroy the Mayflower. Every story of a ship at sea must include a scene of a storm. All the studio's talent is deployed including a stellar cast. Spencer Tracy is Captain Jones skipper of the Mayflower. Gene Tierney is the poutylipped married passenger whom he loves but whom he treats as an ordinary doxy. In supporting roles are rough sailor Lloyd Bridges solemn preacher Leo Genn civilian carpenter Van Johnson sturdy diarist and narrator John Dehner and reliable stalwarts like John Dierkes.There are two problems with the movie and they're both pretty big.The casting decisions are inexplicable. Spencer Tracy as a consistently contemptuous cynical moneygrubbing underhanded Captain Queeg with glands? Hardly. Spencer Tracy is a man who carries moral authority along with his common sense Americanism. He's the firm authoritative slyly wisecracking but empathic boss you wish you had.And Van Johnson as an unemployed carpenter saying lines like I had hoped to find me a berth for the night sir? Not a bit of it. Van Johnson is the optimistic rosycheeked guy next door. He's polite cheerful and in love with Phyllis Thaxter. In any case he's a lead not a supporting player.That's the casting problem. Then there's the problem of the plot. How do you fill up an hour or more of a ship at sea full of relatively dull people? I mean they're not pirates or mutineers. So you invent an intrigue between the gruff Tracy and the winsome Tierney that struck me as completely lacking in credibility. Tracy is not a romantic lead. He's short and rather dumpy and though handsome in a manly way looks nothing like Cary Grant. Tierney suffers because she is torn between her love for the adamantine Tracy and the pious Genn. She finally offs herself. Actually she didn't. Two people died during the voyage both of illness.I will bet though that there was genuine drama aboard the Mayflower. Here's why. There were about 130 people aboard including both passengers and crew and the ship itself was about 100 feet long. There was also every bit of cargo that a new community would need in a demanding new environment. One hundred feet is peanuts. The tween decks where many slept was a space probably about four feet high. The people must have been piled on top of one another but you'd never know it. Space and violations of space are not very dramatic. We watch scenes of Van Johnson showing Dawn Addams where he goes when he wants to get away from things and be alone. It's the ship's rope locker and it's about the size of the Garden Court Restaurant in San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel. Kids Googling will lead to goggling. You should have LUNCH there if possible. Try the cottage cheese. Tell them I sent you.Anyhow there's no gainsaying that MGM was the biggest most powerful studio in Hollywood at the time this was released but that doesn't mean that somebody didn't make a couple of big mistakes.".

	schema:reviewBody "PERHAPS WITH AN eye looking back at the success of historical novels having been brought to the screen the form of highly ucceful films at the Box Office MGM took this story of the Pilgrioms' flight to the New World and gave it a whirl. Their reasoning was sound for after all hadn't there been both critical acclaim and popular acceptance of the story of the French  Indian Wars in NORTHWEST PASSAGE MGM 1940? IN MUCH THE same manner this PLYMOUTH ADVENTURE took some top stars from the MGM stable adding some new ones and even borrowed Miss Gene Tierney from 20th CenturyFox just for good measure. Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson headed up the fine cast which also included Leo Genn Dawn Adams Lloyd Bridges and Welshman Rhys Williams.AS WITH MANY a Sure thingCan't miss project it sort of fell short of its expected mark. While providing an interesting and obviously embellished version of the trials and tribulations of this outlawed religious sect it left us just a little bored at times.RELYING ON STRONG characterizations the story gave us a great contrast in personalities. The protagonists ranged from the cynical and world weary Captain Jones Spence skipper of the Mayflower to the fine and virtuoussuch as portrayed by Miss Tierney and Mr. Genn to the totally unscrupulous merchant Rhys Williamsand the insubordinate and mutinous first mate Lloyd Bridges. True to the characterization by one William Henry Longfellow the character of military man Miles Standish is relegated to that of comic relief.IN SOME WAYS the movie has the look of a History Channel docudrama what with the costuming and the sets often seeming to take on more importance than the story line. Indeed much of the scene location imagery looks very much like it could be used as illustrations for junior high school level history books. Even the selection of the level of color being used seems to be a level or two below that of the previously mentioned NORTHWEST PASSAGE.HAVING BEEN RELEASED for the Thanksgiving Holiday in 1952 PLYMOUTH ADVENTURE certainly must have been well received even to the extent of being in the mode of those films that were endorsed by educators as being recommended for the whole family. Which makes us wonder if this was at least the partial motivation in making the movie. You know it was sort of MGM's contribution to the National Image. the popular myth knda like Ma's Apple Pie. Oh excuse us please. We meant Pumpkin Pie! We almost forgot about which Holiday we were celebrating! NOTE  The full title included a subtitle. It was and remains in today's prints NORTHWEST PASSAGE BOOK I ROGERS' RANGERS.".

While providing an interesting and obviously embellished version of the trials and tribulations of this outlawed religious sect it left us just a little bored at times.RELYING ON STRONG characterizations the story gave us a great contrast in personalities. The protagonists ranged from the cynical and world weary Captain Jones Spence skipper of the Mayflower to the fine and virtuoussuch as portrayed by Miss Tierney and Mr. Genn to the totally unscrupulous merchant Rhys Williamsand the insubordinate and mutinous first mate Lloyd Bridges. True to the characterization by one William Henry Longfellow the character of military man Miles Standish is relegated to that of comic relief.IN SOME WAYS the movie has the look of a History Channel docudrama what with the costuming and the sets often seeming to take on more importance than the story line. Indeed much of the scene location imagery looks very much like it could be used as illustrations for junior high school level history books. Even the selection of the level of color being used seems to be a level or two below that of the previously mentioned NORTHWEST PASSAGE.HAVING BEEN RELEASED for the Thanksgiving Holiday in 1952 PLYMOUTH ADVENTURE certainly must have been well received even to the extent of being in the mode of those films that were endorsed by educators as being recommended for the whole family. Which makes us wonder if this was at least the partial motivation in making the movie. You know it was sort of MGM's contribution to the National Image. the popular myth knda like Ma's Apple Pie. Oh excuse us please. We meant Pumpkin Pie! We almost forgot about which Holiday we were celebrating! NOTE  The full title included a subtitle. It was and remains in today's prints NORTHWEST PASSAGE BOOK I ROGERS' RANGERS.";

	schema:reviewBody "A full six months after Reservation Road was supposed to release in theaters it did only in a very quiet handful the film is finally and again very quietly put out on DVD. I had been looking forward to this film for some time and had been shocked by it's illtreatment from Focus Features. After receiving it from Netflix and viewing it I went out the very next day to purchase it. Where I was expecting a slow wrenching exploration of grief and loss this film actually surprised me with an untold amount of suspense and thrills. It certainly is not a thriller perhaps but where the story goes and how these characters react leaves you on edge in several instances where you're not only unsure of what they will do next but you're not sure what you would do next.I had read a lot about this movie before seeing it so there were some reveals that I already knew about from my own curiosity as well as some misguided choices in what is shown in the trailer. I would have liked to see it fresh so I will give plot points sparingly. Ethan and Grace Lerner Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly respectively are a welltodo couple living in an affluent Connecticut town who lose a child in a hit and run accident. Dwight Arno Mark Ruffalo is speeding home to deliver his young son to his exwife Mira Sorvino and leaves the scene. The unfolding story effectively explores how the Lerner family struggles to cope with an unimaginable loss to an unknown perpetrator and how Dwight wrestles with his fragile conscience while trying to hide his crime from the authorities. I think it works better to not know how Ethan and Dwight meet and proceed to dance around this event but when they do is when the real enjoyment of this film begins.Sorvino does a fine job and Connelly in a larger and more difficult role does a very good job but this film belongs to the male leads. Ruffalo is great playing a seemingly decent man who commits a heinous crime he desperately tries to hide. This is Ruffalo's best work to date and if this film had been appropriately marketed and acknowledged it would have been a breakout for him.As our main lead Phoenix is just wonderful. Ethan is a devoted husband and father whose world suddenly ceases to make sense following this tragedy and seeing him pull away from his family as he gets lost in his depths of grief and fanatical in his quest to find the killer gives Phoenix room to further display his remarkable range. An actor who is blessed with naturalness and unbridled by affectations and shortcut tendencies his portrayal of a man eaten away by unspeakable sorrow and incalculable rage is harrowing. There is a confrontation scene late in the film when Ethan is so incensed he's physically shaking his words come out as a jumbled growl and it's startling to witness. Seeing Phoenix actually show that level of anger makes you wonder how or what he did to get to this place. That I can't know but I do know that it's terrifying to see this man come undone from the inside out.Reservation Road is sad but it doesn't wallow in a way that feels exploitive or cheap. It's a dual journey into one man's struggle to deal with a tragedy that feels beyond him and the cowardice and humanity of a hunted man dogged by his own shaken ethics. This is a provocative moving story that really deserves to be seen.".

If that death is caused by a hit and run driver is even worse. Unfortunately in most cases guilt and shame play highly on the mind of the perpetrator. While the decent thing to do is to stop and go back to the scene of the crime most people will run out of fear of facing their own responsibility.Ethan Learner and Dwight Arno are two men that love their children. In the case of Dwight a divorce has limited the way he can share time with his son Lucas. Ethan suffers a tremendous blow when Josh who has strayed from the parking area to liberate fireflies is killed by what appears by all indications of the carelessness of a drunk driver or some other person who decides to flee the scene of the crime. Both men go through hell in different ways. Dwight suffers the guilt of his cowardly act and Ethan because after losing Josh he can't stop planning to get his own justice when everything else fails him.This film was an adaptation of the novel by John Burnham Schwartz we haven't read. It was adapted for the screen by the author and the director Terry George whose Hotel Rwanda made an impression on this viewer's mind. Mr. George makes a character study of the two fathers at a time of crisis.The ensemble cast does a good job. Mark Ruffalo comes out best as Dwight. Mr. Ruffalo clearly shows why he is one of the most versatile actors of his generation. Joaquin Phoenix who plays Ethan does justice to Josh's loving father. In a way it's a shame Mr. Phoenix has decided to abandon his film career in order to pursue his music. Jennifer Connelly is Grace the grieving mother of Josh who sees in horror how she is losing her husband who is hellbent in avenging Josh's death. Mira Sorvino appears as Dwight's former wife Ruth.Despite the uneasiness we felt watching this film it is worth a look to see how an act of carelessness affects the lives of two men.".

	schema:reviewBody "You wonder what goes through the minds of those involved in hit and run accidents. In that split second after impact you are presented a choice and your life will change one way or the other. One probably has to consider whether to stop and render assistance and in doing so owning up to the accident but having a chance to save a life if the circumstances allow for it. Or to hope that nobody saw you did what you did and bolt. Negligent drivers either through drink driving or being distracted while on the road probably won't elicit much sympathy especially so from the family of the victim and in Reservation Road powerful drama is weaved amongst the characters on both sides of the hit and run equation.Reservation Road refers to the scene of the crime where the Learners  dad Ethan Joaquin Phoenix mom Grace Jennifer Connelly and daughter Emma Elle Fanning lose their sonbrother in an accident caused by a man in a baseball cap driving an SUV. On this angle we follow through the pain of the family who suffer a terrible loss. The dad Ethan slowly degenerates into an obsessive wreck trying in vain to pursue the perpetrator who's out there through his own dogged investigations when he realizes that the cops can only do what they can given extremely limited leads which yielded no progress. The mom Grace while at first finding it hard to accept the truth  and in the initial days the simplest of reasons to pin the guilt in will resonate deeply  but we see how she draws strength in the hope of keeping the family spirits up. And the daughter finds ways to cope with the loss through channeling her energies into performance.On the other angle Mark Ruffalo plays Dwight the lawyer who's estranged from his wife Ruth Mira Sorvino and has visiting rights to their son. When the accident happens in that split second he made the inevitable decision for self preservation and while he may have momentarily escape from justice and the law negative karma dictates that he will live his life being tormented by guilt from that point on all this while trying to provide reason that he based his decision on being able to be free from jail to continue seeing his son. Confession and owning up will see himself in the slammer and probably losing everything. I thought this part of the story was the more interesting one. On one hand we judge that he's a coward of not being a man in owning up to the wrong that he did. On the other we also realize his pain and his fear  it takes a lot to own up especially when it involves lives being taken away and from people we remotely know no thanks to six degrees of separation.Based on the novel by John Burnham Schwartz who also cowrote the screenplay with director Terry George Hotel Rwanda some might wonder if the coming together of the key characters are a tad convenient. We have father to father in a lawyerclient position and one mother being the teacher of the other's child. Putting them together will lead to the inevitable but it is this unravelling of the truth that keeps us engaged to a gripping ending. Scenes that will make you seethe with rage and probably whisper a silent curse will be those where opportunities for confession are presented but each time spurned. As the saying goes a lie begets a larger lie and it will snowball before you realize that the lie becomes to difficult to cover up.Kudos go all round to the entire cast save for Sorvino's role which is more cameo than supporting mainly also because the tanglement of the complicated situation doesn't affect her character directly. Ruffalo put on a commendable performance as the man wrecked by guilt and he fleshed his character with incredible nuances we usually associate when we are fearful and guilty. You can feel pain through Joaquin's performance of the dad looking for justice but finds himself being unsatisfied by the system of the law and learns that sometimes the law and justice conflict each other and offer the layman little or no protection unlike those such as diplomats who have powers at their disposal. Jennifer Connelly of late plays nothing but pained wivesmothersgirlfriends A Beautiful Mind Hulk Dark Water Little Children so there's nothing really new in her role her. But I would like to single out little Elle Fanning. While her role here is fairly simple I thought she had exhibited much more screen presence and likability than her more illustrious sister Dakota who has disappeared after her last outing in Charlotte's Web. Hopefully we get to see more of Elle taking on challenging kidteen roles in time to come.Reservation Road is recommended for being a powerful drama with excellent an excellent cast. Usually movies like these will have the mothers bawling and the picture being a weepy drama but here the movie shifts its focus to the love of fathers toward their sons and that makes it well worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Astounding. Impeccably crafted drama. The story is sad and very serious but this is one of the most perfect examples of the art of simple dramatic filmmaking that exists. This is film storytelling at its pinnacle. On a scale of four stars this is a five star movie. It is mature thoughtful and thoughtprovoking. This is a story of regular people regular middle class white people that is who experience a personal tragedy. How do they each handle the tragedy? What do they become in its wake? This is the role of a lifetime for Mark Ruffalo and he shows us what dramatic acting is at its finest. The rest of the cast is superb too from the other leads to the bit players. Even the kid actors are incredibly good here. Joaquin Phoenix also gives a performance of a lifetime Jennifer Connelly is superb Elle Fanning is haunting. Every actor down to the minor parts does a fantastic job  which lets you know the director made this possible. So GREAT directing!This movie also has a perfect script. It is a classic literary work with all the right elements of cohesive story with bigger thoughts and themes multidimensional characters with moral shading and growth emotional fullness. The story and characters are deep rich fully realized. This must have been written by an English major or serious playwright since it has all the elements of good dramatic writing. The direction is also perfect and unobtrusive. This movie is directed so flawlessly that the viewer never notices a shot it is so perfect that there is only this onscreen reality no presence whatever of a camera or even of a movie. This directing was there to give the actors what they needed to fully realize their characters. The editing is utterly astoundingly perfect. Again this matches the simplicity and unobtrusiveness of the directing. The cinematography is simple and perfect appears to be shot on high quality video. The music is also perfectly placed and matched to this film. This movie is so good that I imagine they had incredible gaffers and drivers and caterers.We the viewers were thoroughly engrossed in the places and the people. The audience in the movie theater was silent absolutely silent from the start to finish of this movie. This is a story we will think about for days and weeks to come. The only slight bad thing about this movie is the title. I had no idea what it was supposed to be about when I was going to see it. From the word reservation I thought maybe it was about an Indian reservation. The promo photos make it look like some sort of adventure flick. I think the name and the ads might keep people from seeing it and for sure will confuse them about what it is. I guess theis movie will be depending on word of mouth so I am happy to say here  Go see it.".

It is a classic literary work with all the right elements of cohesive story with bigger thoughts and themes multidimensional characters with moral shading and growth emotional fullness. The story and characters are deep rich fully realized. This must have been written by an English major or serious playwright since it has all the elements of good dramatic writing. The direction is also perfect and unobtrusive. This movie is directed so flawlessly that the viewer never notices a shot it is so perfect that there is only this onscreen reality no presence whatever of a camera or even of a movie. This directing was there to give the actors what they needed to fully realize their characters. The editing is utterly astoundingly perfect. Again this matches the simplicity and unobtrusiveness of the directing. The cinematography is simple and perfect appears to be shot on high quality video. The music is also perfectly placed and matched to this film. This movie is so good that I imagine they had incredible gaffers and drivers and caterers.We the viewers were thoroughly engrossed in the places and the people. The audience in the movie theater was silent absolutely silent from the start to finish of this movie. This is a story we will think about for days and weeks to come. The only slight bad thing about this movie is the title. I had no idea what it was supposed to be about when I was going to see it. From the word reservation I thought maybe it was about an Indian reservation. The promo photos make it look like some sort of adventure flick. I think the name and the ads might keep people from seeing it and for sure will confuse them about what it is. I guess theis movie will be depending on word of mouth so I am happy to say here  Go see it.";

I'm not sure if it was Joaquin's character the script the direction or what but he did not keep me riveted as he usually does a bit overacted perhaps. Jennifer delivered a couple of lines that didn't ring truecould have been an editing problem. The obsession of angerjustice seems a bit premature. It would have been better to see a progression.

It's there that in one quick moment of tragedy Josh is accidentally hit and killed by an SUV driven by lawyer Dwight Arno Mark Ruffalo frantically rushing his son home to his exwife after a Red Sox game.Compounding the tragedy is Dwight's decision rendered in a split second to speed away from the scene leaving Ethan with only a blurred fleeting glimpse and little else to aid the police with their investigation.In the days that follow the inner torture that both sides face threatens to destroy the very fabric of their souls.Directed by Terry George Hotel Rwanda and based on the critically acclaimed novel by John Burnham Schwartz who cowrote the screenplay with George the story adds a darker layer to the human tragedy when Ethan unwittingly opts to hire Dwight as his lawyer to help ensure the killer is prosecuted to the full extent of the law should he be captured.Both Phoenix and Ruffalo turn in impressive performances as two men whose insides have been rendered asunder by the accident. Rufallo is particularly convincing in that even though his character has full access to the police investigation and knows that he will likely never be caught he cannot escape the torment that what he did was wrong and must somehow be put right.There's no easy answers to be found along Reservation Road only choices the choice to forgive or to hate to admit one's guilt or bury it to live a life of eternal torment or move on however difficult that may be.

This film however has brought me about as close to the living hell of what that awful experience would be like as a person can be without the actual first hand experience of living it. This is an excellent film written well filmed well directed well and with actors as good as you'll ever see in anything. And it will never get the respect it deserves because it eschews the Hollywood proforma cadence of either a tiding happy ending or complete descent into carnal madness. Instead it goes to where things are real and much more difficult to take in.The main story revolves around two families connected by the same tragedy. Specifically two fathers played by Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo. They are quite literally unbelievable two great actors at their greatest. Along with Jennifer Connelly these three take you to a shattered place that is hard to look at and you never want to go to for yourself. It is a dark place where there are no winners and seemingly no hope. It is a place that you can only hope to survive. And if you are a survivor you will never be the same or as good as you were before. Your marriage will not be the one you had before. Your relationship with your children will never be the same. All that being said this is not a hopeless story. It is just a difficult one to watch because anyone can identify with it at a human level.More than the unfolding of this story there is an unsettling tightening of the narrative as this plot develops. Unexpected cross currents in the lives of its antagonists are revealed bringing this story of grief and loss to a boiling point. The victim's father and the perpetrator unbelievably have overlaps in their everyday lives separate and apart from the one that will link them together forever. Their climactic encounter will leave you shaken.I knew nothing about this film when I watched it a couple of years ago. Literally nothing. I watched it for two reasons Mark Ruffalo and Joaquin Phoenix. I was expecting a lot but I got so much more. I tend to go into a lot of detail when writing about a film as good as this one. The 1000 word limit that IMDb allows would never be enough to cover the multi amazing facets of this work. And doing so would require going more into the plot than I think would be useful for or do justice to this sorrowful gem. Watch it for yourself. It needs no explanation from me or anyone else.

It really ended up surprising me because I hadn't heard anything about it and wasn't really expecting too much out of it. In the end though I ended up liking the movie a lot. There were parts where I was very very moved and it was just too hard to not be on the side of Joaquin and then moments later you flash to Mark Ruffalo and I understood in a way what he was going through. Throughout the movie my feelings for Ruffalo changed greatly. At first of course it was immediate hatred for him but as I got to know him I started to feel for him before again being completely sickened by him in the end. Most movies can't take you on a ride the way that I was taken for this one I was really moved at parts and completely sickened at others. These days you don't get many movies that take you on this kind of a journey and I salute any film that doesn't just stick with a simple cookie cutter plot that I can predict before it starts. Sometimes we need something like this to remind us what good movies really are. For me the acting was superb and the plot kept you thinking. This is definitely one that I think you should go out and watch.".

And I was not wrong.After viewing a baseball match with his son lawyer Dwight Arno Mark Ruffalo by mistake drives over and kills the child of Ethan Learner Joaquin Phoenix and Grace Learner Jennifer Connelly. Dwight is scared and drives away and hides this fact from everyone. The police are in search of this hit and run offender who no one except Ethan has seen only as a glimpse in the night  Dwight with a baseball cap. Ethan approaches a lawyer's firm and hires Dwight to fight the hit and run case. As the time passes there is no evidence that the hit and run offender would ever be arrested that makes Ethan desperate. As events unfold when one day Ethan sees Dwight in the night in a baseball cap he remembers the uncanny resemblance of Dwight to the hit and run offender. In the end Ethan plans to take the law in his own hand and kill Dwight  what happens next? I won't tell here The movie's plot is simple and an event that could happen to anyone. But the psychological trauma everyone undergoes through is portrayed brilliantly here. Not only of the family and parents of the lost child but of the hit and run offender. Our heart goes out for Dwight's plight who wants to confess his crime but is so scared. Mark Ruffalo scores full marks for portraying the hidden emotions of trauma on his face and body language.An excellent performance indeed. I need to see this fellow's a few more movies to know whether this performance is a fluke? Nothing to take away from Joaquin Phoenix who is so sincere in his acting that one can not take away the despair from him. He is perfect. Jennifer Connelly at times overreacting as the character demanded is also good in her role.The direction is fantastic and keeps the audiences glued to the sit throughout. The events unfold keeping you guessing continuously every turn of events brings Ethan closer to his suspect Dwight and that is great to watch. I would recommend the scene when Joaquin calls Mark at the scene of the crime knowing Mark could be the suspect. The scene is terrific especially the ending of the scene when the camera walks along with Joaquin's face and Mark standing still behind. Fantastic! A very well directed movie by award winning Hotel Rwanda director Terry George who has cowritten the screenplay of this movie with John Burnham Schwartz who has written the novel by the same name.A highly recommended movie.Stars 7.75 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Human suffering is an interesting subject because of its relative ease in connecting with audiences and evoking emotions. Reservation Road succeeds in emphasizing the catastrophic events of a hit and run accident with astoundingly powerful performances from everyone in the cast. Where it fails is in its documentary approach at portraying the mental aftermath of a tragedy and the dearth of a plausibly satisfactory conclusion. As Reservation Road reluctantly concedes early on when none of the characters win neither does the audience.Ethan Learner Joaquin Phoenix his wife Grace Jennifer Connelly and their two young children Emma and Josh stop at a gas station on Reservation Road and have their lives unsuspectingly swept out from under them when Josh is killed by a hitandrun driver. The driver Dwight Arno played by Mark Ruffalo in shock and afraid of losing his own son who he struggles to see despite strict court orders from a divorce attempts to hide his damaged SUV and any signs of the crime. But with unnervingly unforeseen coincidences Dwight is hired as a lawyer to investigate the crime while his wife tutors little Emma. Wrought with guilt and the fear of judgment by his impressionable young son Dwight weighs his options as his world crumbles around him. Meanwhile Ethan overcome with grief seeks vigilante justice due to the ineffectiveness of local law enforcement.First and foremost the acting is peerlessly superior to just about everything else so far this year. Undeniably Academy Award worthy performances pours forth from Jennifer Connelly Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo. Each of these characters suffer in different ways but their portrayals are so accurately riveting that every time they burst into tears so do we. Few performances are able to elicit such striking emotion from its audience but Reservation Road's cast does so with ease. Of course its tragedyrich plot line is an easy target for sympathy.Early on it is undeniably apparent that Dwight's flight from the hitandrun accident was caused by a combination of fear and ignorance. But his continual suffering from his conscience eating away at him allows the audience to take pity and we don't necessarily want him to die  especially because of his child. This leads to a problem for the audience the antagonist is made to suffer allowing for little satisfaction when his sins catch up to him. When every character loses the audience often also loses out on a satisfactory resolution in this case leading to a very abrupt finale. Reservation Road makes the mistake of creating very emotionally powerful pieces that overshadow the truncated conclusion and the film as a whole.While the end itself pales in comparison to the panicinducing build credit is due to the nailbitingly suspenseful and complexly brilliant first two acts. Dwight is unable to completely hide from Ethan's vengeful suspicions due to increasingly unexpected twists. Connelly's tearjerking anxiety and Emma's innocently nave queries to her mother add a dash of lemon juice to the wound of deathrelated heartbreak.Reservation Road wastes no time careening right into the nerveracking plot and with powerhouse performances that won't be forgotten during awards season it tells a woeful tale with countless layers of grief anxiety and regret. While it may fail to thoroughly entertain with its loselose approach it is a film that is not easily forgotten.Mike Massie".

Meanwhile Ethan overcome with grief seeks vigilante justice due to the ineffectiveness of local law enforcement.First and foremost the acting is peerlessly superior to just about everything else so far this year. Undeniably Academy Award worthy performances pours forth from Jennifer Connelly Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo. Each of these characters suffer in different ways but their portrayals are so accurately riveting that every time they burst into tears so do we. Few performances are able to elicit such striking emotion from its audience but Reservation Road's cast does so with ease. Of course its tragedyrich plot line is an easy target for sympathy.Early on it is undeniably apparent that Dwight's flight from the hitandrun accident was caused by a combination of fear and ignorance. But his continual suffering from his conscience eating away at him allows the audience to take pity and we don't necessarily want him to die  especially because of his child. This leads to a problem for the audience the antagonist is made to suffer allowing for little satisfaction when his sins catch up to him. When every character loses the audience often also loses out on a satisfactory resolution in this case leading to a very abrupt finale. Reservation Road makes the mistake of creating very emotionally powerful pieces that overshadow the truncated conclusion and the film as a whole.While the end itself pales in comparison to the panicinducing build credit is due to the nailbitingly suspenseful and complexly brilliant first two acts. Dwight is unable to completely hide from Ethan's vengeful suspicions due to increasingly unexpected twists. Connelly's tearjerking anxiety and Emma's innocently nave queries to her mother add a dash of lemon juice to the wound of deathrelated heartbreak.Reservation Road wastes no time careening right into the nerveracking plot and with powerhouse performances that won't be forgotten during awards season it tells a woeful tale with countless layers of grief anxiety and regret. While it may fail to thoroughly entertain with its loselose approach it is a film that is not easily forgotten.Mike Massie";

	schema:reviewBody "This is not only a riveting film that deals with courage and lack of it. This is a devastatingly eviscerating moral parable about a victim's need for closure and a perpetrator's battle with his guilt. Only a very few movies have dealt with the struggle between a man's tortured conscience and his denial on one side and mourning and letting go on the other. One story line brings Dostoyevski's Crime and Punishment to mind while the other one evokes the story line of Brad Pitt's character in Babel.Jennifer Connelly's depiction of a mother suffering an unbearable loss is so heartbreaking it cuts right through you with its fidelity to genuine real life pain. Joaquin Phoenix portrays desperation with such force you understand and sympathize with his character and what he's going through. The intensity and emotional impact of this movie is as great as The House of Sand and Fog The Shawshank Redemption and Five Easy Pieces. The ending holds a thoughtprovoking revelation for the main character that reads like an epiphany as he understands what his only rescue is from the crushing injustice bearing down on him.Reservation Road deserves to be considered a classic in retrospect since it has that unique power to hold you in its grip and not letting go until the credits roll. Every nuance in the narration achieves a resonance of truth and the viewers will be thinking for a long time about its implications on their lives. Ultimately it's a story about love and how the loss of what we treasure most changes our lives forever how our undying love in the time of death makes us suffer and seek revenge and retribution but in the end prevail it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Synopsis Ethan Learner Joaquin Phoenix his wife Grace Jennifer Connelly their 10year old son Josh Sean Curley and younger daughter Emma Elle Fanning are going home after Josh's musical recital. On their way home Ethan stops at a gas station on Reservation Road. What was a simple act of stopping at the gas station turns into a life changing event. In a split second Josh is hit by an SUV and killed. Dwight Arno Mark Ruffalo is the driver of the SUV and for a split second he stops because it was an accident then he panics and runs. The state police are called and they begin to investigate the hit and run. As time goes by both men are living in emotional turmoil and agony over this event.My Comment The movie is an emotional tugofwar from start to finish. The father and mother are in pain with losing a son from the hit and run car accident. The person who ran the boy over with his SUV is in pain every day with seeing the accident in his head. This is one situation where a person really doesn't know how he would react until it occurs. Through your survival instincts would you run or would you do the right thing and stop. The story is true to life as to how people react to a tragic event. Emotions are intense where everybody is blaming each other for the accident just as in real life. Many people can only feel better about themselves if they can deflect blame by claiming an unfortunate or tragic event is someone else's fault. It is human nature also to play the if only role  if only I hadn't stopped at that gas station. But that is what accidents are all about and hindsight is 2020. Ethan must make the choice to hate and get his revenge or to forgive and move on with life otherwise he will lose the rest of his family. Dwight must choose to admit his guilt or bury it inside himself and live in torment. The movie makes you confront your inner self which guides you to do the right thing in life's hard situations or to choose to give into fear pain or shame and take the superficial easy way out and live with the inner self blame and sorrow that follows. If you see this movie you will be emotionally drained by the time you leave. Focus Features Run time 142 Rated R610".

As the film reaches its climax the level of suffering displayed by Phoenix is eroding his logic and making us gasp as he takes an unbelievable approach to solve the situation.There are of course other affected relationships and the supportive work by Jennifer Connelly helps us witness the domestic disintegration of Phoenix's family. She somehow slowly learns to cope with the loss of their child and we are witness to her emotional turmoil. Her mind remains lucid and she finds incomprehensible what she notices is happening to her husband. Something is going and yet she can't understand the intensity of the negative effects on her husband.The film reminds of Little Children where dark forces seemed to be stronger than logic and compassion. In this one the thirst for justice evolves into a mad search for revenge and ways to exorcise demands that terrorize us. It's a powerful movie that came a bit short of being perfect but that holds well because of the exquisite work by all of the performers involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "For convenience I'll use the actors' names as if they were the characters'. Two families are sent by fate into a collision course in a small community is Connecticut. In a model of a perfect family Joaquin Phoenix an affluent professor heads home with his wife and 2 grade school kids after attending the son's performance in a school concert. In a situation less fortunate but by no means uncommon Mark Ruffalo smallfirm lawyer delivers his son back his divorced wife after an overlong Red Sox game. Hit and run Ruffalo hits and kills Phoenix's son at the edge of the highway in front of a gas station.We have parallel stories an agonized father consumed in fury trying to hunt down the murderer initially to bring him to justice and later to take justice into his own hands an equally agonized perpetrator struggling with his conscience debating whether to turn himself in. This is good dramatic material but unfortunately not well presented but salvaged somewhat by good acting. The result is an uneven movie that falls short of expectations particularly in view of the cast which includes in addition to the aforementioned leads two Oscarwinning best supporting actresses.Unlike many others I don't consider Ruffalo being the lawyer that Phoenix employs to find the murderer an unacceptable contrivance nor the fact that Ruffalo's estranged wife Mira Sorvino is the piano teacher of Phoenix's daughter Elle Fanning Dakota's younger sister. After all this is a small community and you will see coincidences ten times as incredible in eight out of ten other movies. What I do consider a contrivance is crafting something for Jennifer Connelly to blame herself for her son's death just to add more dramatic conflict to the movie or simply to give her a more explosive scene. Connelly is a good enough actor to give any scene she is assigned something better than most others can as she has demonstrated again in this movie.The psychology of the couple facing the cruel tragedy is interesting. At the outset they both have finding the killer very much on their minds. But it soon becomes clear that she only uses that to shield the pain of the devastating loss. As the story develops she is ready to put the past to rest and face the future. On the contrary after starting out as the more rational and selfcontrolled he becomes more and more consumed in anger when hunting down the killer becomes a blinding obsession. As mentioned Connelly has brought more to the role than most others can. Phoenix has done as much as he can with the unhelpful script. But if you have watched In the bedroom 2001 you will recall Sissy Spacek clearly superior bloodchilling portrayal of the bereaved mother seeking vengeance. And if you look up the history of Oscar for that year you'll see that it did not go to her but instead to a thirdrate amateur who confused howling and yelling with acting the biggest joke in Oscar's history.The other story gives Ruffalo a fair challenge and he has given it a respectable show. If anything is to be blamed it's the lame script particular the ending in which he points a gun to his own head pleading Phoenix to tell him to shoot himself. It's difficult to imagine a more unrealistic and moronic line and it's an insult to ask a respectable actor like Ruffalo to deliver it.The climatic ending as many pointed out is lame and a letdown. There is nothing wrong with the ending itself and indeed that is what most people would expect anyway. It's just the sloppy way in which it's written. The REAL climax and quite a good one is where Phoenix meets Ruffalo at the crime scene. On the surface it's the client asking the lawyer to help him reconstruct the events. But the palpable tension underneath is intense and certainly measures up to most thrillers. Here is one of the scenes where the script doesn't get in the way and the actors are allowed to deliver  Phoenix darkly menacing and Ruffalo beautifully underplaying. This one scene which is close to the end of the movie should not be missed.".

Perhaps forty percent more I can distinctly remember having seen and a few minor plot elements but no more. Only a percent or two of those movies are truly memorable  are ones that you find yourself quoting i.e. Go ahead make my day etc. This movie however falls somewhere between those two places.I can remember watching this movie. I can remember quite a bit of it despite having watched it months ago  probably a whole lot better than I can remember the other movies I watched at that time. I can also remember having been enthralled by the film. And yet for the life of me I cannot possibly remember why I liked it so much. Had I rated this title the day I watched it I'd have probably given it ten stars yet after only a few months the reasoning has completely escaped me. I typically give this type of movie a seven star rating but something tells me it was far better than your average similarthemed drama.The plot was good  with a tad too much irony as is common in most Hollywood films. It's not much of a SPOILER but I'll list it as a SPOILER alert because I wouldn't have wanted to know had I read a review before having watched this movie. The man who hits and kills Joaquin's character's son is the same lawyer whom Joaquin hires later on. Out of all the lawyers to be found in whatever city you are in they make up a good 50 pages of my local telephone directory he had to hire his son's killer. Sure without that touch of irony the movie wouldn't have been half as good as it was yet something about it still though making the movie ruined it as well.Anyway this is definitely a movie I'd recommend and have recommended to anybody looking for a good heartfelt drama.".

Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas is the only villian in the movie and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan is delightful as the owner of the title shop Mr. Matuschek and his familiar manner is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart as Pirovitch. Very believable in every facet of his role.The two leads are equally accomplished with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate neurotic yet charming and attractive woman.This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart when he is fired from his job because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock anger fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes so perfectly. In my estimation James Stewart is without question the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie he still had most of his career ahead of him yet he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies and also one of the sweetest most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I greatly recommend this movie especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart.".

Everything fits together and runs like a Swiss watch.With its flawless screenplay and cast it's the most subtle discreet and understated of romantic comedies.  What other film manages to be so warmhearted yet so rigorously unsentimental?  What other movie story is so exquisitely planned and executed?Margaret Sullaven isn't sexy it's true but this isn't a film about sex. It's about love in the human heart and mind.  A sexier actress would have thrown things outofbalance.  As always Lubitsch knew exactly what he was doing.  Just as he knew ace comedian Frank Morgan the WIZARD OF OZ's Wizard had hidden depth which this film so beautifully reveals.They don't make them like this anymore  they didn't make them like this back then either.  SHOP was underrated in 1940 when it appeared.  It's simply too subtle too intelligent and disciplined for the average viewer or critic.Nothing overdone or exaggerated.  Nothing outofplace.  If Mozart had been a filmmaker he would have made this one.  Warm charming adult quiet intelligent knowing touching ... perfection.".

SHOP was underrated in 1940 when it appeared.  It's simply too subtle too intelligent and disciplined for the average viewer or critic.Nothing overdone or exaggerated.  Nothing outofplace.  If Mozart had been a filmmaker he would have made this one.  Warm charming adult quiet intelligent knowing touching ... perfection.";

	schema:reviewBody "With a very good cast a nice blend of wit and sentiment and many other pluses this classic remains as enjoyable and charming as ever.  The fluffy but pleasant story benefits greatly from the Lubitsch touch since he had the knack of giving significance to little things without taking them or himself too seriously.  Presenting his characters honestly yet sympathetically he makes the somewhat contrived situation seem believable and worth caring about.  Its appeal comes across as almost effortless but you only have to compare it with the less effective 90's remake to see how important the right touch is with this kind of story.The atmosphere of life in the Budapest shop is set up efficiently and convincingly and the cast all settle into their roles seamlessly.  As the leads Jimmy Stewart works perfectly of course and Margaret Sullavan conveys the right balance of spunkiness and vulnerability.  Felix Bressart is invaluable giving perhaps the finest performance among his many character roles.  In some of his scenes he barely has to say a word to make you smile.  Frank Morgan is surprisingly good in a role rather different than usual for him Joseph Schildkraut is effectively oily as the deceitful Vadas and the others all help out too.  Lubitsch gives all of the characters a chance to come to life without pretense just by using simple details effectively.It all fits together very well moves at just the right pace and makes you a part of the characters' world.  It makes for a very enjoyable movie that holds up very well even after several viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Shop Around the Corner 1940' is a pleasant romantic comedy not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation. By 1940 director Ernst Lubitsch had long ago taken Hollywood by storm and his famed Lubitsch touch had become a sparkling commercial trademark. This film was planned for a 1939 release but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming. Rather than substituting either of his main stars Lubitsch decided to postpone production in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in 'Ninotchka 1939.' When it was finally completed 'The Shop Around the Corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference receiving zero Oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by Samson Raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and Frank Morgan in a supporting role. Time nevertheless has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence with highprofile remakes including 'In the Good Old Summertime 1949' and 'You've Got Mail 1998.'At its surface one might assume 'The Shop Around the Corner' to simply be the story of two lovers Klara Novak Sullavan and Alfred Kralik Stewart who love each other without knowing it. However Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that. It's the story of Matuschek and Company a stylish gift shop in Budapest and the various human relationships that make the store such a closeknit family. When storeowner Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife we witness the breakdown of two families both at home and at work. There's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the United States  perhaps in the blustery streets of New York  but Lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in Europe the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep. This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful personal touch to the film  in fact even as I write this review I'm beginning to appreciate the story even more.Sullavan and Stewart are both lovely in their respective roles but I think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film. Each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable. I especially liked how Lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards Hugo Matuschek who in any other film would have been restricted to an underdeveloped twodimensional portrayal. Matuschek may have lost the love of his family but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees and you feel a heartwarming glow when in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm he finds companionship in a frecklefaced young errandboy Charles Smith. This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder's later creations for example Boom Boom Jackson in 'The Fortune Cookie 1966' or Carlo Carlucci in 'Avanti! 1972.' Of course it doesn't really need saying but Billy Wilder learned from the best.".

	onyx:emotionText "'The Shop Around the Corner 1940' is a pleasant romantic comedy not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation. By 1940 director Ernst Lubitsch had long ago taken Hollywood by storm and his famed Lubitsch touch had become a sparkling commercial trademark. This film was planned for a 1939 release but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming. Rather than substituting either of his main stars Lubitsch decided to postpone production in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in 'Ninotchka 1939.' When it was finally completed 'The Shop Around the Corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference receiving zero Oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by Samson Raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and Frank Morgan in a supporting role. Time nevertheless has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence with highprofile remakes including 'In the Good Old Summertime 1949' and 'You've Got Mail 1998.'At its surface one might assume 'The Shop Around the Corner' to simply be the story of two lovers Klara Novak Sullavan and Alfred Kralik Stewart who love each other without knowing it. However Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that. It's the story of Matuschek and Company a stylish gift shop in Budapest and the various human relationships that make the store such a closeknit family. When storeowner Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife we witness the breakdown of two families both at home and at work. There's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the United States  perhaps in the blustery streets of New York  but Lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in Europe the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep. This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful personal touch to the film  in fact even as I write this review I'm beginning to appreciate the story even more.Sullavan and Stewart are both lovely in their respective roles but I think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film. Each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable. I especially liked how Lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards Hugo Matuschek who in any other film would have been restricted to an underdeveloped twodimensional portrayal. Matuschek may have lost the love of his family but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees and you feel a heartwarming glow when in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm he finds companionship in a frecklefaced young errandboy Charles Smith. This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder's later creations for example Boom Boom Jackson in 'The Fortune Cookie 1966' or Carlo Carlucci in 'Avanti! 1972.' Of course it doesn't really need saying but Billy Wilder learned from the best.";

It is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again simple yet profound. The dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days. All the acting is magnificent. Even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other perfectly. He was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days. Some of her other films are worth catching. As Mr Matuschek Frank Morgan is amazing. His moment of truth is very moving. Gold stars all round to the performers.It is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to The vague remake 'You've Got Mail' was dire but in this case it is true. The director Lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit charm and warm humanity.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Budapest in The Shop Around The Corner is fixed on love and shopping essential bourgeois habits. But do not be deceived by the precious delicacy  like a fine music box  of the film. Ernst Lubitsch knew the risks lovers ran. You can feel his crossed fingers. This may be Hollywood's most poignant love story set amid the fussy heightened naturalism of a little shop where everyone is a character. At work Alfred and Klara do not get on no matter that they are James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. They are vexed by misunderstandings and crosspurposes. But they share one thing they are both writing heartfelt letters to an unknown correspondent and through this epistolary communion they have fallen in love. Of course a moment of discovery will come and the great Felix Bressart makes it as tense as some moments in Hitchcock films. American film has no more heartbreaking shot than that of Sullavan's face gazing into her empty letterbox. Lubitsch had come so far  from German costume dramas and romantic comedies to Hollywood and Paramount where he was put in charge of production. He enjoyed considerable acclaim for his silent pictures including Lady Windermere's Fan 1925 and in the 1930s with the advent of sound created a further series of successes  The Smiling Lieutenant 1931 Trouble In Paradise 1932 Design For Living 1933 The Merry Widow 1934 Angel 1937 and Ninotchka 1939. He was a master of sophisticated comedy whose light touch inspired people like Billy Wilder who really got his break writing scripts for Lubitsch. The Shop Around The Corner is something of a departure for the director in that its characters are poor and hardworking and also because the film relies on the ambiance of the shop. It is also the picture in which Lubitsch himself seems most moved and anxious for his lovers. It's a grave and lovely film as well as a secure masterpiece. In 1940 the US was not yet at war and Hungary was still free from the worst Nazi domination but the idea of Christmas at Matuschek's was already farfetched.".

	schema:reviewBody "A warm sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it. The key to this film's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give lowkey unfussy performances. As a result you fall in love with virtually all of them.There's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated. Loneliness is a major theme most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager played wonderfully by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it. This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant because they're both reaching out to this unseen other who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met. Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy.Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry. The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family and that's exactly how it feels to us as well.This is a wonderful unsung romance.Grade A".

If you want to see a great movie this is it. Jimmy Stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is spellbinding. Morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing. William Tracy as Pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances. Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic performance as Perovitch a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with. It is a simple story of how close coworkers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances.".

It's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times. The acting is so perfect the story is so beautiful that if you haven't seen it I wish to urge you to see it today. I'm not against remakes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one but this time have to admit that You've Got Mail is a poor adaption of this classic.

	schema:headline " A love story as great as it is real...";
	schema:reviewBody "THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feelgood romantic comedies ever made. There's just no getting around that and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words. It's not one of those films that tries too hard nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end. In fact all its charm is innate contained within the characters and the setting and the plot... which is highly believable to boot. It's easy to think that such a love story as beautiful as any other ever told could happen to you... a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies however sweet and heartwarming they may be. Alfred Kralik James Stewart and Clara Novak Margaret Sullavan don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop Matuschek  Co. he's been working in for the past nine years asking for a job. They clash from the very beginning mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's openedhe thinks it's a ludicrous idea she makes one big sell of it and gets hired. Their bickering takes them through the next six months even as they both unconsciously of course! fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box 237. This would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on except that THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is expertly fleshedout with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters from the fatherly but lonely Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan himself who learns that his shop really is his home Pirovitch Felix Bressart Kralik's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion smarmy pimpdujour Vadas Joseph Schildkraut who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous Kralik and ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona William Tracy who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for Matuschek  Co. The unpretentious love story between 'Dear Friends' is played out in this little shop in Budapest Hungary in which Kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirdstobe along. It's nice that everyone gets a story in this film the supporting characters are welldeveloped and Matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one Alfred and Clara share. His invitation to new errand boy Rudy Charles Smith for Christmas Eve dinner made in the whirling beautiful snow of a Hungarian winter makes the audience glad that he is not alone we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell. Aside from the love story I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film. He doesn't play the fullfledged Jimmy Stewart persona in this film cf 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for that in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind. He's rather a brusque man in fact with little hint until perhaps the very end of the awshucks downhome boyish charm Stewart would soon come to patent. When he finds out before Clara that they have been corresponding in secret in fact Kralik doesn't 'fess uphe waits it out to see how far he can take the charade especially since he quickly realises given his stormy relationship with Clara as boss and underling that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself. His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin what a name! who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her. Stewart plays this role perfectlyhe keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr. Kralik as she is often wont to do even and especially to his face. And yet one believes underneath the brusqueness and professionalism that he could reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer hope as he eventually does. Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well. Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film but she really comes into her own in the closingshop scene on Christmas Eve when she almost gets her heart broken again by Alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart. Frank Morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous Hugo Matuschek driven to nervous breakdown the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to 'grow old with him'. And Felix Bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal Pirovitch wonderfully a Lubitsch regular since he appears as a hilarious Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKAof particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend Alfred get the Christmas present the latter really wants... a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on. Ernst Lubitsch really does himself proud with this filmfor example the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort right down to the Hungarian names on the door the wares and the cash register and so on. But even though Lubitsch chose to have the story set in Hungary the setting is actually universal it could happen anywhere it could happen to you. Therein lies the charm of this simple story these believable characters who really are people. The snow on Christmas Eve is real as well or at least as real as Lubitsch could make it he had snow machines brought in at great expense. It is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated. No not even in a remake like YOU'VE GOT MAIL.  This is really the Jimmy Stewart Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Not to detract from the merits of that other film but there'd be no harm and in fact a lot of good done in watching THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER this Christmas instead. It's sweet funny charming and Stewart is impeccable in his role. We should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could.".

When Klara Novak Margaret Sullavan seeks a job position of saleswoman in the store Matuschek hires her but Kralik and she do not tolerate each other. Meanwhile the lonely and dedicated Kralik has an unknown pen pal that he intends to propose very soon however he is fired without explanation by Matuschek in the night that he is going to meet his secret love. He goes to the bar where they have scheduled their meeting with his colleague Pirovitch Felix Bressart and he surprisingly finds that Klara is his correspondent however ashamed with the unemployment he does not disclose his identity to her. When Matuschek discovers that he had misjudged Kralik and committed a mistake he hires him again for the position of manager. But Klara is still fascinated with her future fianc and does not pay much attention to Kralik. The Shop around the Corner is a delightfully naive romance and this is the type of film that deserves to be watched many times. It is charming and innocent and James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan show a wonderful chemistry even in their arguments. I love this period of classic romantic comedies when society was satisfied with a screenplay that does not need to use sex scenes and other diversion but great dialogs supported by outstanding direction and acting. In 1998 Nora Ephron updated this film with the remake You've Got Mail without any reference to the work of Ernest Lubitsch. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Loja da Esquina The Shop around the Corner".

She only had a few truly great roles but this was one of them. She and James Stewart compliment each other perfectly in this exquisite picture.This is a story of a shop around the corner  in Budapest and the people who work there. Family man Pirovitch Felix Bressart two faced sly Ferencz Vadas Joseph Schildkraut who was so sympathetic in Orphans of the Storm1921 unassuming Alfred Kralik Jimmy Stewart Flora Sara Haden flighty Ilona Inez Courtney and cocky Pepi William Tracy. Alfred has received another letter from his secret pen friend  her letters transport him to a pleasanter place than his humdrum shop life. That day Klara Novak Margaret Sullivan comes to the store  desperately looking for a jog. She is told there are none to be had but after ingeniously selling a musical box as a candy box to an overweight customer she is in!!! But she is out with Alfred they antagonize each other from the start from the particular colour of her blouse to the right way to pack boxes. Of course she is the girl of Alfred's dreams his pen friend but neither of them know it and they have agreed by mail to meet at a particular cafe. He is to wear a buttonhole and she is to carry a book Anna Karenina by Tolstoy.The store's owner Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan is having his own problems  the money he is giving to his wife is sending the store into bankruptcy. He is also suspicious of Kralik  he thinks he is having an affair with his wife!!! Events escalate and Alfred is sacked  Matuschek has had his wife watched and his fears are confirmed  she is seeing another man  but it is not Alfred it is slimy Mr. Vadas. When he realises he has sacked the wrong man Mr. Matuschek tries to kill himself. He makes things right from his hospital bed Alfred is reinstated as the new manager and Pepi who saved his life is promoted to clerk!!! Even Vadas gets his comeuppance.Everything works out perfectly in this perfect film. James Stewart is as far from a lowly clerk in a notions store in Budapest as you can get but this could be his most memorable role. Actually this film had an earlier remake than You've Got Mail. In 1949 MGM remade it as In the Good Old Summertime with Judy Garland and Van Johnson. It was set in a Chicago music shop around the early 1900s and was a good excuse to give Judy some popular music of the time to sing.Highly Recommended.".

Even the dialects are well done with some understandable exceptions sometimes Roney is back in Stockholm but it's hard to blame him.The only problem from my point of view is that Troell is Swedens Orson Welles! Just like Welles he made the movie of his life on his first try. Troells Hr har du ditt liv 1966 is such an amazing accomplishment that it is simply impossible for him to beat and you always get the feeling that he is trying! Well he didn't pull it of this time either but possibly this should be higher than my 710.".

Based on a reallife person who looks a lot wackier than Robin Williams who plays him in this movie the story has its usual rebel fightsthe straightlacedestablishment clich but is a warm sentimental film that can't help but make you feel really good when it's all over. It's hardly all sugar either as there are not only frustrations but an immenselyshocking tragedy in here.For a nice family movie the profanity and sexual innuendos are a little much so I don't think is one for the kids. They wouldn't like it anyway. Adults shouldn't mind. The language isn't that bad anyway.Patch's remedy for not only sickness but to getthegirl is humor. It takes him awhile but he softens the hardshell woman he's after Monica Potter and even the super stiffass roommate Philip Seymour Hoffman in the end. This film is tailormade for Williams and his great sense of humor and ability to adlib. He has a lot of funny lines in here.There is one little kid in here who's smile is one of the best I've ever seen on a human being and I wish the boy had more scenes. The touches of sentimentality he brings along with the laughter is wonderful to see and heart warming to say the least. This is an inspiring story with comedy and romance and drama. That's what makes it so effective a good combination of genres. One minute you're laughing a few minutes later you have tears in your eyes. A wonderful story nicely acted and nicely told.".

	schema:reviewBody "During a family day at the movies over Christmas weekend most of my family picked You've Got Mail.  But I pretty much detest romantic comedies so I picked Patch Adams instead.  How much did I like it?  I went and saw it again the next day dragging the whole family with me this time.Don't let the previews fool you this is not a comedy.  This is a very moving drama based on the real life of Hunter Patch Adams and his trials on the road to becoming a doctor and attempting to revolutionize the health care industry by creating a free hospital in West Virginia which has come to pass and is presently being constructed or so the overlayed tagline at the end of the movie claims.Williams delivers a stellar performance as Patch who practices Laughter Is The Best Medicine and entertains and amuses hospital patients in an effort to befriend them and ease their pain.  So as you can imagine Williams' clownish personality and humor seep in and bring an incredible vibrance to the character.  His performance alone is worth your ticket but the supporting actors Philip Hoffman and newcomers Daniel London and Monica Potter also deliver great performances and add a lot to the story.  The plot is well done being partially written by Adams and the story may inspire you.My only major complaint about the movie and why I say it's a hair off center is the very stereotypical and uberevil portrayal of the dean of the medical school who has a vendetta against Adams but for which a real reason is never given.  This could be attributed to Adams' hand in the scripting but I doubt it.Beyond that this movie is very enjoyable very touching and very awardworthy.  If it doesn't show up at least a couple times at the Oscars I'll be very disappointed.  But just go see it for yourself.  And if you don't cry at least once before the end be worried there is probably something wrong with you.If you enjoy the movie you may also want to check out the book by the real Patch Adams entitled Gesundheit! Bringing Good Health to You the Medical System and Society Through Physician Service Complementary Therapies Humor and Joy.  Amazon.com carries it as should any other reputable bookseller.".

This movie is Robin Williams Goes to Med School. Any attempt at portraying a real person is instantly forgotten as Williams' manic needy comedy overtakes every sequence from the absurd opening at the mental institution to the rebel without a clue university years...Love ME!! Laugh at ME!!

'Medicine is important' Patch postulates 'but what a doctor really needs to know is how to make his patients laugh.' Bullsh!t. What can be said about a movie that makes a mockery of doctors and nurses who spend lifetimes studying and toiling in obscurity to heal and cure in order to praise a clown with an enema bulb on his nose? The movie doesn't just ask you to love Robin Williams... the movie insists you love NO ONE ELSE! Characters are either ineffectual pawns his Jewish nebbish of a best bud the patients or villains Bob Gunton who stand in the way of Patch's violent oppressive comedy. A terminal cancer patient throws Patch out of his hospital room insisting he doesn't want to be cheered up but Patch will have none of it! He dresses as an angel and sneaks his way back in and beats the man over the head with jokes until he finally relents... Patch wins! This movie is all about hostility disguised as comedy... you have to laugh or Patch will destroy you!Smarmy schmaltzy and sometimes infuriating Patch Adams crosses the line by sanctifying its subject and refusing to consider any other point of view...

Enrolling at medical school to become a doctor Hunter became a flag waver for the laughter is the best form of medicine train of thought. Something that simultaneously irked his superiors and garnered a lot of patient support. A fascinating tale is given the Hollywood treatment with Robin Williams slotting into the role of Hunter Adams.Not only is Patch Adams a fascinating story in itself the reaction to it pro  con is also of high interest. I first ventured into this film a couple of years ago believing it to be the devil's spawn. That belief was born out of the disdain brought down on it from the revered critics of the time. It's also suffered kicks a plenty from many a film fan during the advent of internet movie sites and the snowball effect that comes with such communities. I revisited the film just this last week to see if my initial positive reaction to the film still held. It did. What I found out was something I never knew the first time that I watched the film namely it was well regarded enough to be nominated for awards. And not some by the bye magazine awards either. Williams was nominated for best actor at the American Comedy Awards and the Golden Globes while the film itself was nominated at The Globes in the best picture category. It should also be noted that the film was a success at the box office. Made for 90 million it's Worldwide gross in theatres was 203 million and it was the number one box office film in America at Christmas 1998.Why do I tell you these facts? I do so because sometimes the reputation of a film is distorted such is the case with Patch Adams. Look It's not a masterpiece or anything it's an odd mixture of humour and drama and for Williams haters it's a definite no no. But it still has something for the discerning viewer. It's a film that is loaded in the protagonists favour I mean who in their right mind could not side with the guy who makes the kiddies on the cancer ward laugh and cheer? Exactly. Things are further loaded by the portrayal of Dean Walcott by Bob Gunton it's all snarling pomposity of the highest order the suit you just love to hate. Then coming in from the side is Philip Seymour Hoffman as jealous swot roommate Mitch. Make no bones about it the makers here are telling Hunter Adams' story thus the other side of the fence is barely given any credence or intelligent debate. That's an itch that will not go away but it barely stops Patch Adams being an emotionally driven and potent viewing experience.If you have not seen it then you now have the facts to hand it wasn't a bomb the kind of lead balloon release that some would have you believe it was. It's divisive for sure and yes it has problems that us fans are fully aware of. But maybe you will become a fan too? Williams is on full tilt animation mode able to make one laugh and make one cry all in the confines of one little movie. And the ending coming after the rollercoaster has done its run on the emotional track is itself a form of medicine that you just can't get from the chemist. 810".

It is based on the real doctor who offers to share a real love of medicine with anyone who chooses to become a doctor. His seeming ambivalence towards established rules and protocols and his unorthodox manner in treating patients is irritating to Dean Walcott Bob Gunton who tolerates Adams until he can summon enough evidence to expel the Excessively Happy medical student from the school. Although the role is a direct shadow of Williams's career as a comic it is also a mirror image of his soul when he displays his sorrow and despair. It is during those touching moments we can see how much the master comic suffers for his character. When viewing this fine film be prepared to journey with Williams through the happiness and tragedies his character experiences. An excellent example of an artist at work. Easilly recommended for all.

No can't happen especially at Mr. Adams' age.  How is the university with the top medical teaching in the country supposed to accept Adams just out of the blue?  Wait doesn't Adams have to go through community college first?  Yes then a four year college THEN University of Virginia medical school.  But NO the film never explains the progress.  It automatically assumes Adams was so successful that it didn't need to be explained how he got accepted into University of Virginia.  2 How are we supposed to believe laughter is the true key to medicine when it seems every patients can be cured by laughter.  WHAT?!  What kinds of patients are these?  Probably just ones with physical injuries.  I know that for a fact that autistic children wouldn't respond to Robin Williams' Patch Adams.  It's just not possible.  The patients just get instantly cured by Williams' pranks.  How is this possible?  Nothing is ever explained it just happens.  God Steve Oedekerk is a terrible writer.3 Why is Patch Adams in such an opposition in this film to doctors?  What from his mental institution experience with doctors?  Bah.  The fact is you need a doctor who can treat you with the right prescription medicine and treatments.  You DON'T need the fictionalized loony Patch Adams in the film. Stay AWAY from him as far away as you can.  Now there is a Patch Adams in real life.  I'd rather be interested in hearing about how he was able to do his laughter for medicine in his patients versus this film.  As a film based on real life it's the worst ever made.  Again read these words and remember them... if you can't tell the true story right why tell it at all?  STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS!

	schema:reviewBody "Is it possible to be obnoxious and funny at the same time? Yes I believe it is. But Patch Adams is just obnoxious while thinking itself not merely funny but noble as well. Robin Williams has played this sort of character before the compassionate rebel in other films based loosely on true stories like Good Morning Vietnam and The Dead Poets Society. If this film doesn't work as well as the others it is because it oversimplifies what otherwise would be an attractive theme namely that doctors should strive to improve the quality of their patients' lives rather than to postpone death. I wish there would be a movie that expresses this idea in a nuanced and believable fashion. Here it's nothing but cheap shots at the establishment.One of the major problems is that Patch Adams just isn't very funny which undermines the whole point of what he's doing. I laughed during one scene involving a catatonic patient but most of the time I just sat there looking about as stonefaced as the pretty medical student Patch flirts with. Considering how awkward and obtrusive most of Patch's jokes are it's a wonder the movie never considers the possibility that the patients might not be amused indeed even the most irritable ones eventually succumb to his charms. If the real Patch Adams was truly like he's portrayed here I doubt he'd have had any success with his method. Perhaps the doctors who opposed his behavior actually had a point and weren't simply the stuffy analretentive stereotype this film shows them to be. This film seems to exist in a onedimensional world where comedy automatically means dressing up as a clown and doing unsubtle slapstick and where the only people who fail to appreciate such antics are those totally lacking in any sense of humor not to mention humanity. In a particularly ironic scene a fellow medical student played by the wonderful actor Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a heartfelt speech about the harm in Patch's failure to follow procedure. I actually found Hoffman's argument a lot more convincing than the movie wanted us to think.In my experience I've met a variety of medical professionals ranging from those who only seem concerned with the technical aspects of their profession to warm funny individuals who care about their patients' feelings in addition to their health. The latter can be accomplished without acting obnoxious arrogant and immature like Patch Adams comes off in this film. I couldn't relate to the film because both sides seemed too extreme and there wasn't the slightest hint that a broad middle ground exists. It was like having to choose between fascism and anarchy.Eventually the film resorts to an implausible manipulative plot device so as to give the Patch character a moment of doubt which the situation hardly merits. Or at least he's doubting the wrong thing. What he should be doubting is not whether humor itself has a legitimate place in the medical profession but whether his particular brand of humor does. The movie's ideas are stronger than its execution and at the end Patch gives an inspirational speech that actually impressed me. If only the rest of the film lived up to the strength of his words.".

He previously made The Nutty Professor and Liar Liar. Robin Williams is carrying the film as someone who goes from depressed state to reaching a purpose. Monica Potter serves only as a love interest who will meet tragedy. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is flat as Patch's roommate. Bob Gunston plays the stereotypical dean who dislikes Patch's practice and basically has a stick up his ass. Peter Coyote plays a patient whom Patch attempts to cheer up but only succeeds in pissing off. We are given much insight into this individual that deserves better writing.

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I know this movie is based on the real life of Patch Adams but all the events in the movie feel overthetop and highly unlikely that they really occurred. Its the reason why the dramatic scene's in the movie simply didn't worked for me.First of all I couldn't even always sympathize for the main character Patch Adams played by Robin Williams sometimes he's a bit overthetop in some dramatic scene's but overall he gives a very solid performance.. I mean seriously Patch Adams really pushes it at times and simply goes too far in his methods. I even found myself on the side of Dean Walcott a very typical Bob Gunton stereotype role ala The Shawshank Redemption and Glory. at times. It is not a good sign for a drama when you couldn't even always sympathize for the main character. This alone is already a reason for why this drama is a failure.All of the events in the movie felt highly unlikely and unrealistic. No way you can convince me that some dying 70 year old could be entertained by a bunch of balloons. Yes there really were some 'dramatic' scene's in the movie that simply made me cringe. Its the kind of drama that is really embarrassing to look at. The drama in the movie is very childish and way too clich.

Yes every scene that he was in was a highlight for me. This movie is really a waste of a great cast. Its not the cast their fault that the drama doesn't work I think its director's Tom Shadyac who manages to deliver the drama in an highly unlikely and unbelievable manner.

	onyx:emotionText "Yes I know this movie is based on the real life of Patch Adams but all the events in the movie feel overthetop and highly unlikely that they really occurred. Its the reason why the dramatic scene's in the movie simply didn't worked for me.First of all I couldn't even always sympathize for the main character Patch Adams played by Robin Williams sometimes he's a bit overthetop in some dramatic scene's but overall he gives a very solid performance.. I mean seriously Patch Adams really pushes it at times and simply goes too far in his methods. I even found myself on the side of Dean Walcott a very typical Bob Gunton stereotype role ala The Shawshank Redemption and Glory. at times. It is not a good sign for a drama when you couldn't even always sympathize for the main character. This alone is already a reason for why this drama is a failure.All of the events in the movie felt highly unlikely and unrealistic. No way you can convince me that some dying 70 year old could be entertained by a bunch of balloons. Yes there really were some 'dramatic' scene's in the movie that simply made me cringe. Its the kind of drama that is really embarrassing to look at. The drama in the movie is very childish and way too clich.

The humor in this sequel is a little more strained or I was a little more sober but the film has other virtues that make it not a bad way to spend 80 minutes on a Saturday night with some friends before you go out dancing. Get off your high horses all you other commenters who complained about the near constant seminudity and decried the notion that people would choose to see this movie rather than other quality offerings. Men and especially gay men like skin! We like to see beautiful guys in various states of undress! And we don't always want to have to resort to outandout porn to see it! Has the gay population been overrun by a bunch of prudes almost as bad as the exgay group depicted in the film? Have you become as neutered as most of respectable gay cinema is these days produced by filmmakers who would rather cut off their youknowwhats before showing a naked guy and run the risk of being labeled frivolous? Watch this movie with your GAY friends if your straight ones are too uptight to deal with the stomachlicking and full frontal nudity. And try and wrap your heads around this weenies you can watch serious quality films AND silly sexy fluffy ones. You can go see The Queen or The Departed one night and Eating Out 2 Sloppy Seconds the next. See how easy that was? The only thing that really detracted from this movie is that Marco Dapper obviously shaves his groin men should be men not plucked chickens. Thank you.".

Perhaps they could have taken a page out of Strangers With Candy and been blunt about the lessons they learned perhaps even learned the wrong lessons? Contrary to most I thought Marco Dapper delivered an acceptable but not great performance. He was definitely cast in this movie for his looks.I thought Brett Chukerman really mastered the role of confident guy on the prowl for his next conquest as he teased Troy while changing for art class in the restroom. Andrew Ley's brief appearance in the opening scene really impressed me as well.The stereotypical flaming art instructor was a throwaway role nothing to get upset over. Emily Brooke Hands was fairly convincing as being interested in her art. Rebekah Kochan fared better than I thought she might in the role of the selfproclaimed slut. A good cast for what this movie was.As for those who think this flick gives the socalled gay community a bad name not to worry the gay community determines how it is perceived all by itself. I don't see people bashing the straight community because married men cheat on their wives left and right. Men like sex whatever their persuasion. This movie presents the lengths to which some might go to get it.Speaking of which...if you watch this in the theater be sure to stay all the way to end after the final credits roll.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this on October 1st 2006 at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. I had the chance to briefly meet the writerdirector and he is amazing! and very humble I've read the negative comments on this movie and I could not disagree with them more. The judgments they have made on the film are based on it being a realistic comedy when in fact it is a farce. It is sad the we have homogenized the categories of film so much that we really don't get to see outstanding examples of the diverse genres out there. Desperate Housewives another guilty pleasure and a national hit almost didn't make it to the airwaves because Marc Cherry was selling it as a farce and people did not know what that was. Sad because Shakespeare did very well with the genre. DH had to be categorized as a soap opera before the networks would pick it up. Here is the definition of farce 1. a light humorous play in which the plot depends upon a skillfully exploited situation rather than upon the development of character. 2. humor of the type displayed in such works. 3. foolish show mockery a ridiculous sham. That said this is a great movie that is hilarious to experience. I was one of many that despite the reviews and comments LOVED the first movie. It was not without flaw but overall it was wonderful. This one was in my opinion slightly better. Yes it had stereotypes and ridiculous situations see definition of farce above. That structure allowed some very clever dialogue some hilarious scenes and some mockery of society's need to categorize gay into any specific pigeon hole. This movie makes fun of those stereotypes and in the process gives you the chance for introspection after the film.I think the actors male and female do an incredible job. Rebekah Kochan Tiffani has done a body transformation since the first installment. She looked good in the first one she looks amazing in this one. Both Emily and Jim are fun to watch. The hot guys... well they are very enjoyable to watch. I was a little afraid that I wouldn't like the character of Marc in this sequel he was played by Ryan Carnes now famous for his role in Desperate Housewives as Bree's son's boyfriend... in the sequel he is played by Brett Chukerman. By the second scene Brett was in I was hooked. He did a great job of taking over an existing character.Overall if you go into this film seeking reality you will walk away disappointed. If you go in looking for a good time and realize it is supposed to be a farce you will leave with a smile on your face from the laughter and poignant moments in the film. Mink Stole's final scene in the movie actually brought a tear to my eye. What gay son wouldn't want to hear her comments? I would say check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival this week and I totally loved it!!!!! Even more than the first. If you are ready for a Clich stereotypical and yet totally hot and fun gay comedy then sign yourself up for Sloppy seconds. This sequel is very much that all the while pushing the envelope so much further than the first chapter Eating Out . Be warned this time its full of much more shocking and crazy situations yet guaranteed more laughs than the first so in fewer words if you liked the first you will love this one even more. On an exciting note this is the first ever American gay movie sequel. If you remember in part one Kyle convinces his straight roommate to pretend to be gay to get the girl he was attracted to. Well in this journey Kyle is the one who is pretending in order to get the surprisingly hot model Troy. Kyle fell in love or should I say lust with Troy when he modeled nude for Kyle's art class. The funny thing is Kyle pretends to be an Ex Gay to get to spend time with Troy. While doing so he gains self confidence and esteem. To be honest the acting in this movie is clearly not the best but you soon forget about the over acting once the movie gets started. Even right from the opening scene which basically sets the mood with a homo erotic scenario where two guys were getting ready to go at it of course with a gay guy seducing a straight guy. This movie is full of hilarious one liners like when Tiffani says that she wishes a guy would say I love you instead of Take it you tight little .. that and many more.I will however say that the most interesting twist is the whole ex gay ministry segment with their homo no more movement lead by Allen who obviously gets off on the other ex gays telling of their sexual slip ups with men. This movie was Brilliant and funny yes clich as in it portrayed the stereotypical gay characters that we usually think of for gay drama. However I honestly know many people like this. They are often shallow and manipulative on their journey to get sex sex and more sex. So to be honest this movie was not only full of super hot some of which get fully naked yes inclusive with cock shots but it was also believable enjoyable and ridiculously funny to the point that I was screaming. PS. Some may say that this movie gives gays a bad name. Well if the shoe fits wear it why do you think bath houses and the adult book stores with glory holes are so popular? Most men have a one track mind and its sad but true but it doesn't mean its not funny to watch".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this film at the Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival this week and I totally loved it!!!!! Even more than the first. If you are ready for a Clich stereotypical and yet totally hot and fun gay comedy then sign yourself up for Sloppy seconds. This sequel is very much that all the while pushing the envelope so much further than the first chapter Eating Out . Be warned this time its full of much more shocking and crazy situations yet guaranteed more laughs than the first so in fewer words if you liked the first you will love this one even more. On an exciting note this is the first ever American gay movie sequel. If you remember in part one Kyle convinces his straight roommate to pretend to be gay to get the girl he was attracted to. Well in this journey Kyle is the one who is pretending in order to get the surprisingly hot model Troy. Kyle fell in love or should I say lust with Troy when he modeled nude for Kyle's art class. The funny thing is Kyle pretends to be an Ex Gay to get to spend time with Troy. While doing so he gains self confidence and esteem.

Supernatural yes from old incredible and unforgettable Marianne de ma jeunesse to minor but beautiful modern flicks like Va petite. Throughout history we can find several great andor popular SF movies like Alphaville 451 Fahrenheit or Fifth Element but they are rare as galaxies in the endless space.A ton image is a real SF but made as a subgenre that has been spreading for several decades in American production the plot is not SF at least not a classic one but only one premise of the whole movie is fantastic. So once you accept that this premise is real you don't feel that you watch SF movie any more because the development of the plot is perfectly logical and realistic.And in this case if you accept that human clones can be made what is more than certain and that they already exist among us what hasn't been proved so far you probably have some idea what their problems and ones of their family friends teachers etc might be. We can have prejudices that come from science this movie includes some suspicions from early days of cloning the mammals when the movie was made but haven't been proved to be a scientific truth later or from another movies even horrors. And A ton image uses all clichs they could remember.However apart from SF the movie is surprisingly fresh. So we get a feeling that once again French authors didn't even care to make a decent SF but only used some of its premises as a basis or background of a family drama. No wonder this is something where French are at their best.The authors are interested in the family. Already in danger on the edge of collapse and extinction the family life created by father mother and children will face new challenges and perils. If a person can be given a clone then single parent family gets a new meaning. The other parent even if on the list of family members loses all traditional roles but as we can see can be given new ones however though a family life can be hard and stressful due to differences of its participants the equality of them can also be hard or impossible to handle.Also the authors cleverly decided to avoid usual family problems and family relations that are endlessly repeating in movies during a decade or two. There are no drugs but alcohol is a real problem yes in 21st century. The mother's dark secret is not a child molestation in early years. And blasphemy for modern movies the daughter still approaching teenage years tries to seduce her father it can happen gentlemen from police and social services! and her father resists yes it can happen as well though modern movies and TV programs tell us that every man is a predator just for having Ychromosome and a molester just by the fact he is a father. So I wonder if this movie will ever be allowed to cross the ocean.Christopher Lambert is better than I've ever seen him that isn't a compliment and Nastassia Kinski... I won't comment her acting because for me she is a reason good enough to watch any movie. Anyway her acting is light years away from her Tess period when she used to have expression No 1 No 2 and No 3 and change them at random. With a lot of help of young Audrey DeWilder and less young Rufus the very variegated casting list does an unexpectedly good job. Good camera work and editing can hide some weakness in the screenplay. Anyway this is a movie that should be given a chance.".

The idea of a sterile woman with a guilty complex for the loss of her unique son and submitted to a cloning experience and her beloved daughter being an evil replica of her is excellent and updated. Unfortunately the direction is too cold without feelings and in the end this movie is only reasonable. Anyway I think it deserves to be watched at least once.

Throughout the film he only exists. only at the final scene Nastassja Kinski shows some acting and feelings. Lambert and Kinski don't fulfill the expectations and stay below their capability. i think the theme is not really meant to be a drama more a thrillerpsychothriller but the development of the moviestory is too slow fur such a genre.

The film is also visually flat photographed by Gerard Sterin Taxi Wasabi and other Luc Besson  produced works who's a nice cinematographer actually but that's the look modern sleepy thrillers fashion requires. There's a really goofy scene when mother and daughter buy identical red dresses and put on red wigs and jump out at Lambert from behind the tree and start singing some really stupid song. There was no music to speak of but some sounds that were used were really creepy. The screenplay is weird senseless and full of clichs.

It is Animal House. It is Porky's. It is every cliche one comes to expect from such a picture  from wild frat house parties to girls wrestling in KY jelly. And strangely enough it delivers... with a good cast and a fresh twist. For the group of guys that assemble to start the fraternity that is the heart of Old School are all in their early to mid thirties. They are family men. They are husbands. They are fathers. They are boyfriends involved in serious relationships. They have all grown up.Or so thought Mitch Martin Luke Wilson the Godfather of this return to the dorm comedy. When Mitch returns from a business trip to find that his girlfriend Juliette Lewis has been hiding from him a rather unnerving secret sex life the guy begins to question the choices he's made in his life. And his friends are there to help. Best friend and selfmade successful businessman Beanie played with perfect comic timing by Vince Vaughn suggests they take advantage of Mitch's new found freedom and start a fraternity. And it isn't long before every disillusioned and disenfranchised thirtysomething wants to join  to either recreate their days of reckless youth or finally belong after years of being an outsider.Among such misanthropes is Frank the Tank a character that Will Ferrell makes his own. Literally baring all for the camera Ferrell like Saturday night live alum John Belushi before him plays the wild but affable frat brother  the sad clown the loveable loser. Ferrell gets all the best lines but a few are reserved for the sardonic Vaughn. Wilson to his credit plays it straight and the supporting cast including Leah Remini Artie Lange and even the usually annoying Andy Disk in a hilarious cameo is quite good.Certainly Old School is not Oscar material. It's not meant to be. And it makes no pretension to comedy of the kind that My Big Fat Greek wedding brought back into vogue. This is not a feelgood romantic comedy. But it is also not to be dismissed as some insipid throwaway college romp. Old School is intentionally sophomoric all the more so as it is director Todd Phillips' second big studio comedy. It is genuinely funny in parts and a healthy hour and a half return to those days of reckless abandon that many of us dreamt we either had back  or had had in the first place.".

Well unfortunately that didn't turn out to be the case.  However that doesn't mean its a bad movie.  In fact I loved it and would highly recommend it.As someone in the same age group as the main characters perhaps I related too much but the idea is great  Three 30something guys who are solidly on the path of a normal mature life marriage kids real job etc... decide to start a fraternity and recapture their college glory days.  No there's no real reason to do this and no its not realistic at all. But who cares?  Anyone who has ever been to a raging college party done a few beer bongs and whippits screamed along with some loud music and hooked up with a random coed can immediately relate to this film.  Not to mention there really are some gutbusting funny scenes throughout.  Luke Wilson is the perfect actor for the steady reserved professional guy.  Will Ferrell is hilarious of course and Vince Vaughn does what he does so well playing the instigator trying to help a best friend have fun again.  Unfortunately one of his funniest scenes only made it to the deleted scenes section of the DVD.Which brings me to my main gripe with this movie what was left on the cutting room floor.  The deleted scenes which can be seen on the DVD of course aren't just trivial sections that you can understand were cut some of them are classic.  The movie was only an hour and a half long and for the life of me I can't figure out why the 10 minutes of deleted footage didn't remain.  I think some of them really would've changed the entire feel of the movie.  The last act kind of changes into this Rushmoreish Wes Anderson knock off and I think at least a few of the deleted scenes would've helped it make more sense.Despite that this movie ranks alongside Dumb  Dumber Meet the Parents Kingpin and American Pie as one of the best comedies of the last decade or so in my humble opinion.  No it's not a classic but it will stand the test of time as a very good comedy that you'll laugh at with each replay.".

This movie is jam packed with endless comedy of course it's Will Ferrell you can't help but laugh at the dude every time you see him. Old School when it hit DVD was the number one rented movie in North America thats quiet good for a movie anyone barely heard of when it first came out. But this movie caught the eyes of many fans. It should have a higher rating but I guess some people thought it was average. but to tell the truth it kicked some major comedy's to the curve. Not using so much of a teenage scene they conquered the mix of adulthood with college students forming a fan base for both a younger and older audience. By younger I mean 16 and up but usually movies either aim for 16 to 25 years of age. But this movie provides an entertainment that everyone can enjoy yes even your grandma.

This movie is jam packed with endless comedy of course it's Will Ferrell you can't help but laugh at the dude every time you see him. Old School when it hit DVD was the number one rented movie in North America thats quiet good for a movie anyone barely heard of when it first came out. But this movie caught the eyes of many fans. It should have a higher rating but I guess some people thought it was average. but to tell the truth it kicked some major comedy's to the curve. Not using so much of a teenage scene they conquered the mix of adulthood with college students forming a fan base for both a younger and older audience. By younger I mean 16 and up but usually movies either aim for 16 to 25 years of age. But this movie provides an entertainment that everyone can enjoy yes even your grandma. This movie definitely deserves a 10 and I have the power to do that. Buy this movie for god sakes it's a great movie to add to the comedy collection.";

But if you live overseas be cautious with your children if you have because the movie was allowed to all audiences in most of European countries. Prevent them from watching this awful and very vulgar recipe. All you will find in it is rubbish at all levels. Not even a piece of laughter.

The movie starts out funny but it loses steam. Most of the characters are funny and Will Farrell is probably the funniest of the cast. Cuthbert is smoking hot with her cameo which is alright by me.The director has some funny jokes but it's not enough to reach a full potential like 'road trip'. If he took more time with the jokes and the plot then this movie could of been a classic 'frat pack' movie.This is definitely a guilty pleasure with some laugh out loud jokes and funny situations.

Poor Marcia threatened with a knife is being kidnapped in the name of love and her life turns upsidedown in a flash. Her boring monotonous world suddenly becomes an exciting unpredictable and sometimes even scary adventure. Development and transformations of the characters are done marvelously and black and white division of between them in the beginning of this black and white film gets newer richer spectrum and wider variety of gray shades. What looked like a funny ontheroad film in its beginning slowly becomes a drama. Widening the focus from three teenage girls to the characters of different generations and occupations shows that nothing is as simple as it looks at the first glance. Special credits go to the old Lenin's auntie whose appearing brings genuine sincere and deep emotions.I am not sure whether flattering comparison with Jim Jarmusch's films gains the point. You cannot say there was nothing Jarmuschian in this film i.e. fabulous scene when five characters sit together around the table after the aunt has died but it is far from copying the probable hero. With his clear expression an evident messages Lerman cuts deep into the womb of a society. The simple fact he sees the way out of crises in connecting understanding and supporting within family and friends is so human and well meant. Should you see this film? You bet!".

Filmed in 16mm black and white by cinematographers Diego del Piano and Luciano Zito and reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch's episodic style Lerman's first feature has according to the director contradictions reveling in contradictions.The film contains moments of comedy but these are undercut by a mysteriously sinister air that keeps us guessing as to where the film is headed. Marcia is scared but does not attempt to run away and seems curious about their overtures. The tough young women hijack a taxi and drive Marcia to visit Lenin's seventyyear old Aunt Blanca Beatriz Thibaudin who lives in Rosario a seaside town near Buenos Aires with her two tenants the shy Felipe Marcos Ferrante a Biology student and Delia Maria Merlino a painter and parttime teacher. Aunt Blanca in a fine performance by Thibaudin is one of the few sympathetic characters in the film and her unconventional warmth allows Lenin to connect with the value of relationships.When Marcia tells Mao that she enjoyed being with her she tells Marcia to shut up and go to sleep. Mao is an unpleasant bully who after consummating her relationship with Marcia neglects her and rudely shifts her interest to Felipe. Passive to the end Marcia does not stand up for herself or try to leave. Felipe seems bewildered by the girls but supports Mao in a shoplifting spree without considering the ramifications. Suddenly is a strangely involving film that shows great promise by the director but the lesbian butch women are caricatures that detract from the film's message which after all is quite simple  when people are finished playing ego games with each other what is left is love.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released and ignored in 1973 Black Christmas became a forgotten classic. The Canadian shocker was eventually rereleased as Silent Night Evil Sight in order to avoid confusion with the blaxploitation films of the time but it bombed once again. In the early 80s it was broadcast on cable as Stranger in the House in order to snatch up some rantings. Right when the movie seemed dead NBC decided to cancel a primetime airing of it because it was deemed too scary for network television. This was all filmbuffs needed to go back and discover the wonderful cool movie that you never heard of that is Black Christmas.Before I go on here it goes Black Christmas is one of the scariest and finest horror films ever made. Major credit must go to director Bob Clark who went on to direct the epic Citizen Kane remake and because of legal reasons had to change it's title to Porky's who like John Carpenter in Halloween is able to create a current and simplistic creepy atmosphere. Black Christmas is indeed very similar to Halloween Both movies are themed with a particular time of year both movies feature a killer with breathing problems who loves POV shots and both movies have a long and slow buildup that makes the audience care for the characters that are about to get slashed. The difference is that Black Christmas does it much better in fact I think it is a superior film.The movie begins with a shaky POV shot of a stranger who decides to sneak inside a sorority house in order to get some fresh meat. That's it! Plain and simple. There is no your father killed my cousin's cat motive the killer wants to kill because he simply wants to. Isn't it much scarier like that? No motive at all?The cast is not your usual teen slasher stereotypes There is the notsovirginal sweet leading lady Jess Olivia Hussey who is having trouble because she wants to have an abortion. Her boyfriend Peter Keir Duella eventually disagrees. In the sorority house there are many other odd characters including chainsmoking foulmouthed heavydrinking Barb ironically played by Margot Kidder who steals the show with the muchneeded humor. Unlike the countless other slashers out there Black Christmas takes time for the audience to get used to these characters and actually care for them. Unlike in Halloween the entire topnotch cast in Black Christmas give excellent performances. Olivia Hussey is perfect as notsoinnocent Jess Keir Duella is scary and misleading as her deranged boyfriend. And of course Margot Kidder steals the show with an excellent and amusing take playing herself. Also noticeable is cult star John Saxon as Lt. Fuller who many years later started showing his personal love for Black Christmas on interviews.The wellbalanced doses of drama and comedy connects the audience to the characters on screen so strongly that they sometimes we forget it is a horror movie. And when something scary eventually happens it comes as a total shock. Bob Clark eventually became famous for his comedies and you can sense his upbeat sense of humor though the entire film. Recent movie audiences lost their patience so movies like that can't be made anymore. And there is a good reason Black Christmas is currently labeled as a comedy at the IMDb it is really funny. So many memorable quotes here These broads could hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa if they could get to top of it! or I'm a drunk? Here we have the queen of vodka herself! and of course the whole Fellatio address.But isn't this a horror film? It really lives up to it's tagline. To begin with the killer is not a silent invincible maniac on a Santa Claus costume. Instead he is never seen. Most of his moments come from POV shots and dark takes. He is confined to the sorority house's attic for most of the time. How is that scary? Sound comes to play. The killer calls the sorority girls though the phone many times early shades of Scream and When a Stranger Calls and uses some of the most disturbing voices you will ever hear. He imitates pigs squeaking perverted dirty talk animal noises screaming heavy breathing and many other weird sounds. Does it work? Of course. This guy makes Norman Bates look like Richard Simmons.These disturbing elements are all put together though the brilliant cinematography by Reg Morris who is able to capture the silent Christmas atmosphere perfectly with the wonderful use of silent snowcovered streets and decoration. Let's face it Christmas is a bit creepy isn't it? It certainly will be after watching this flick. The piano score by Carl Zittrer is simplistic and effective as well. The repetitive use of Christmas carols also add up to the tension.Ignored over the years and unknown outside the cult horror fans this is an underrated classic that deserves much more attention that it ever got. Everything is perfect in this Canadian chiller The atmosphere the music the overall spooky look and one of the scariest villains in history. No gore although the killings are so disturbingly shot they don't really need any no sex no nudity just plain oldfashioned horror. This is Black Christmas Snowcovered silent streets creepy Christmas carols spooky use of lightening and color scary atmosphere and the overall look of the plastic bag suffocated victim in a rocking chair staring from the attic window. Trust me you will never go to your attic the same way again.Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house a creature was staring...".

Although Italian director Mario Bava had previously created what some see as the first slasher movie Bay of Blood' 1971 it was Black Christmas' that was to become recognised as the catalyst for one of the most lucrative subgenres of horror cinema. Bob Clark who previously made the kooky enjoyable lowbudget zombie film Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things' 1972 still at this point something of an amateur director took a simple yet naturally frightening concept and turned it into one of the most unsettling and nervewracking one hundred minutes in cinematic history. Only a select few films such as The Haunting' 1963 and Alien' 1979 are atmospheric enough to truly equate to the eeriness and feelings of apprehension that are to be induced by Black Christmas'.The simplicity of the production is what makes it so endearing. There are no overly bloody death sequences or unlikely comicbook style events the viewer is just presented with an unnerving tale which could easily have a strong basis in reality. Inventive camerawork and POV shots as well as a superlative use of lighting are the elements that combine to achieve the desired results. The often pseudoclaustrophobic environment of the sorority house from where the vast majority of events occur offers the perfect vulnerable and unguarded location susceptible to intrusion and thus attributes to the continual foreboding atmosphere. Clark was not afraid to take time building both the story and characterisation as well as introduce the viewer to the aspects that he would use to build the suspense. This is prepared before plunging the viewer into a seemingly uncontrolled nightmare that one experiences along with the protagonists. Another aspect that firmly stands out is the mysterious way that everything is presented even at the very end very little has truly been explained yet everything seems like it should have an obvious explanation. Even in its undoubted simplicity Black Christmas' has complicated facets that require thought from the viewer to entirely comprehend the film. In some ways the concealing of several key points puts the viewer's knowledge of events on a par with the actual characters.Black Christmas' is also complimented wonderfully by strong acting performances from Olivia Hussey Margot Kidder John Saxon and a highly pleasant and amusing turn from Marian Waldman. Despite the tiny budget this is a highly polished horror film that genuinely belongs among the elite of the genre. This is where it all started and those familiar with later slasher films such as Halloween' Friday the 13th' 1980 Slumber Party Massacre 1982 and The House on Sorority Row' 1983 should be able to spot several of the nowclichs that first materialized in Black Christmas'. My rating for Black Christmas'  810.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I rented this film around the Christmas season of 1999 I did not know what to expect. The only reason why I rented it was that Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea were in the leading roles I have a strange and sick obsession with Olivia Hussey and I liked Keir Dullea in 2001. But then when I first watched it that dark and cold Saturday night I was amazed.The film's style was very dark and mysterious as well as bizarre. While watching the film I saw where John Carpenter might have gotten a lot of his filming technique from his 1978 classic Halloween one of my personal favorites. It like Halloween involves the murders of young women. And in the case of Black Christmas it's sorority girls.What set this apart from Halloween is that the killer is less human than Michael Myers. You saw Michael Myers but you do not see the killer in Black Christmas. Plus the killer is insane especially when he rants. His rants make no sense making his intentions unknown. He just kills not for revenge like most horror films. But he just kills. I don't know about you but that is what makes this film even scarier aside from the spooky musical score.They say that Jamie Lee Curtis is the scream queen. Well whoever thinks that obviously has not heard Olivia Hussey's lungs in action. That woman can SCREAM.It's best if you watch this film alone in a quiet house at night during the Christmas season. I did that the second time I watched it. I tell you the truth I had a hard time walking downstairs to go to the bathroom I was so scared. And no horror film has ever done that to me since the first time I saw Scream about three years ago.Some may argue that the characters in the film are not very developed but that does not matter because most of them die anyway. One of the few characters that stood out in this film was Barb Margot Kidder. She is a drunk trashtalking sorority girl who manages offend just about everybody. The woman who played the sorority house mother Mrs. Mac Marion Waldman also stood out as a trashtalking drunken woman. Olivia Hussey's character is a bit snobbish like any sorority girl but not to her other sisters. Keir Dullea's character is highstrung and unpredictable which adds to the film mysterious style. But as for the rest there really was no room for them to grow. Besides like I just stated most of them get killed off anyway.The end really surprised me. I mean really. No questions asked. It even shocked me but I'm going to spoil it for anyone. But if you loved John Carpenter's Halloween you'll love this film even more. I guarantee it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Long before Jamie Blanks turned popular urban legends into a theme for his routine slasher franchise director Bob Clark took one of the most vigorously touted of those fables and created a genre staple that would become the forerunner of the stalk and slash cycle. Comparisons can obviously be drawn between this and Halloween including notorious but unconfirmed reports that Carpenter's film was in fact based upon an unproduced concept that Clark had earlier initiated as a sequel to this 1974 sleeper. Both efforts certainly have a lot in common with one another including two excellent steadycam openings  putting the viewer in the killer's shoes as he enters his 'soon to be' scene of a crime  that are almost interchangeable. On the 'making of' featurette for the 25th anniversary of Halloween perhaps one commentator is fairly unjust when he states that it was that movie that started the excessive use of point of view shots that are so often imitated in horror cinema ever since. Black Christmas was equally as effective with its application of first person cinematography a feat that John Carpenter clearly recognised before incorporating and perhaps improving upon it for his further acknowledged masterpiece.The story concerns a group of sorority sisters that are preparing for their Christmas celebrations in a remote house. They have been receiving bizarre and threatening calls from what sounds like a group of insane people although no one takes them seriously at first believing that they're just a typical prank from a few of the local town boys. However fears are ignited when one of the students Claire Lynne Griffin doesn't arrive to meet her father on time and is reported missing. Later a child is found butchered in the park whilst all the while the Looney continues his demented ringing and terrorising the young women. Before long Lieutenant Fuller John Saxon realises that there may be a link in the occurrences and asks Jess Olivia Hussey to remain close to her phone so that he can trace the line when the lunatic next rings. But will there be anyone left alive when that happens?Although this movie is neither graphic gratuitous nor particularly unpleasant by today's standards it remains one of the most disturbing and chilling 'slasher' movies ever made. Perhaps as mysteriously alluring as the exploits of Michael Myers and certainly far more alarming than any of the endless Friday the 13ths could ever hope to be. The killer creates the fear himself but not in the typical methods that have become somewhat oldhat in more recent efforts. This assassin doesn't wear a mask probably doesn't possess any superhuman attributes and may only be threatening towards the female of our species. But his enigmatic ranting and crazy excessive skips between multiple personalities that are portrayed superbly over phone calls which are all but too short effortlessly allow him to become one of the creepiest wackos ever set to celluloid. Never has a telephone been implemented as a tool for creating fear so efficiently there's something really unsettling as this Jekyl and Perhaps ten Mr. Hydes argues potently with himself. He changes his pitch from that of a high female to a deep and aggressive male and then back again in a manner of pure and unadulterated insanity that really sticks in your throat. He perhaps reaches his most bloodcurdling moment when he drops all the wacky personas to adopt a civil yet curt voice and mutter once I'm going to kill you'. Proving to be the one and only direct threat that he makes in the whole movie.Where as Michael Myers' success was brought about by the mystery that surrounded the little that we knew of the true motivations of his character a similar method has been used here. We never actually see who's terrorising these girls and we are never given a reason for his dementia. He often refers to himself as 'Billy' or 'Agatha' in his one sided conversations but we never learn of the events that made him spiral into such mindlessness. In a movie like Scream aka The Outing  not Wes Craven's this just feels like lazy and incompetent filmmaking however Bob Clark puts it across in a manner that makes you want to learn and know more and he teases you with revealing that you never will. His talents as a director certainly reached their peak with Black Christmas.  Helped excessively by some great cinematography and neatly planned lighting effects that often evade the more recent slasher movies Clark proved himself as a great filmmaker that would have his inspiration cemented over the years that followed. He produced fairly original ways to keep the killer obscured from view whilst not forgetting the fundamental silhouette and shadow play. If you do predict the twists in the plot then it's only because they have been carbonated so many times since this hit the shelves that they now feel second nature to any horror fan. It's good to remember that this was one of the first to use these elements and you must also note how perfectly this holds up against the less than impressive attempts that have been released up to three decades after.Some brilliant supporting actors whom themselves would make their own slight impressions on the genre  Margot Kidder The Clown at Midnight Lynne Griffin Curtains and John Saxon Nightmare Beach and The Babydoll Murders are sadly let down by a weak lead in Olivia Hussey. She's certainly not terrible but at times her performance was fairly improbable when she could have found chances to shine. Kudos however to the actors that performed the terrorising calls I don't think titans like Brando or Nicholson could have played them any better! Credit has to be given to whoever helmed that crazy dialogue for without it the movie certainly would not have been so fearfully memorable! Perhaps a little further explanation on Peter's Keir dullea exact involvement may have helped make the end a little clearer admittedly I was a little confused. Although I must confess that I can't be sure if that was my fault for not watching properly it was late at night or it was crafted deliberately to help cloud the mystery? But those gripes are hardly damaging and mainly I really enjoyed Black Christmas.The slasher genre has gained a reputation over the years for being somewhat over populated by incompetentamateur filmmakers. But efforts like this Halloween and The House on Sorority row prove that the category is a necessary ingredient to cinema history when it's handled properly often able to generate superb and noteworthy results that rank up with any of horror's acclaimed pieces from the past. This has recently been rereleased on DVD with minimal extras but maximum value for money and really does warrant a purchase. There's really not a lot more to be said to convince you this is a true cultclassic and your collection is poorer without a copy. As stylish as the best Giallos and as disturbing as Friedkin's Exorcist this is certainly worthy to hold its renowned status for years to come. Maybe next time you are bothered by a crank caller you'll be a little more cautious as to how you handle the situation.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was really great to watch when I saw it last Christmas. I was expecting more of a Halloween type film except the fact that the always brilliant Margot Kidder was in it. So I was into it from the start. The film follows a sorority house on the days proceeding Christmas when a psycho stalker starts getting into the house and quite frankly under the girls skin. Then the murders begin. Thesetting has been seen before and so have the P.O.V. shots but who cares?This film was scary anyway.Olivia Hussey is terrific and tense as the lead sorority sister Jesse who has the burden of dealing with all the other sisters' crisis problems.

The rest of the cast does just fine particularly Andrea Martin as the soft spoken sister John Saxon as the police chief who only wants to find the answer and the actress who played Mrs. Mac was certainly worth the view too!Writing wise this film was greatly and adroitly planned. The central theme of this film is that you can't trust anyone friend or foe and the scares are genuine and come psychologically instead of in your face like Halloween or Friday the 13th. Bob Clark is in love with his actors as he photographs them in brightexuberant colors while his killer is photographed in jaundiced grainy colors. All in all a very artistic film and very creepy to the bone. Great atmospheric music too!".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was really great to watch when I saw it last Christmas. I was expecting more of a Halloween type film except the fact that the always brilliant Margot Kidder was in it. So I was into it from the start. The film follows a sorority house on the days proceeding Christmas when a psycho stalker starts getting into the house and quite frankly under the girls skin. Then the murders begin. Thesetting has been seen before and so have the P.O.V. shots but who cares?This film was scary anyway.Olivia Hussey is terrific and tense as the lead sorority sister Jesse who has the burden of dealing with all the other sisters' crisis problems. She looked really great too! And in the finale she really played her role out for all it was worth.Kier Dullea was descent.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film during the holiday season a few years back and have come to the conclusion that Black Christmas is a neglected classic and in my opinion is the first and best slasher film ever made. Guaranteed fans of John Carpenter's Halloween will love this film some may find they love it even more than Halloween. And even though I thought I'd never say that after viewing Black Christmas a few times I found myself enjoying it much more.Black Christmas starts off with a Christmas party at a sorority house. While the festivities are taking place a stranger is breaking into the attic upstairs while the unknowing sorority sisters are enjoying themselves. The phone rings and we are introduced to Jessica Olivia Hussey our main character. A strange person on the phone makes obscene comments speaking in different voices while the sorority sisters listen in disgust. As the sisters flood out all leaving to visit family and friends and whatnot only a few are left at the sorority house among them are  Jessica Barb Margot Kidder and Phyl Andrea Martin. Clare Lynne Griffin a fellow sorority sister has gone missing and Clare's father comes to investigate along with the help of law enforcement and her friends. The strange phone calls continue and get more and more disturbing as time goes by until Jessica is forced to call the police. Could it be her boyfriend Peter Keir Dullea playing some sort of sick joke? Or is someone watching the helpless girls from within the house? As the holiday nears the psychotic killer sets in motion his bloody agenda while the local police try and track him down before more murders are committed.Before Bob Clark went on to direct the family holiday classic A Christmas Story he took a darker look at the holiday season with this hidden gem. Black Christmas is a masterpiece horror film and surprisingly predates the classics by many years such as Halloween and Friday the 13th which get most of the credit for creating the slasher genre when in fact this little Canadian chiller started it all. The plot was very original at the time and contains some very scary moments  the scenes in the attic with the killer are among the scariest and strangest scenes I've ever watched and the phone calls are flat out bizarre. The movie reeks a very dark foreboding atmosphere despite it taking place during the holidays that never lets up throughout the film's entirety as it slowly builds suspense before reaching the climax. It takes place during Christmastime which honestly doesn't matter to the plot it could've taken place at any time of the year but the fact that it's set during such a joyous festive season gives it a little more of a sinister quality and makes it a perfect holiday horror movie.The acting in this film was excellent. Olivia Hussey is our lead and she plays her character with vulnerability and innocence putting the audience on her side the whole way. Margot Kidder plays the loudmouth drunk sorority girl and is also excellent in her performance being a boisterous yet a likable character at the same time. Her character is probably the most memorable of the bunch. Andrea Martin plays Phyl the quiet but friendly girl and is also very good in her role. And Keir Dullea plays Jess's suspicious boyfriend well  the audience isn't sure if they should consider him a suspect or not and he plays that perfectly. The rest of the cast includes numerous Canadian performers all whom turn in convincing performances. There is even a little comedy thrown into the mix an example being the alcoholic sorority housemother Mrs. Mac. and her witty oneliners. The humor is subtle and is easily overlooked by the movie's grim demeanor but it's in there for sure. The movie also contains some very creative death scenes especially Barb's glass unicorn death and the plastic attack in the closet but even though these are present it's really not a gory film we mostly see the aftermath. The deaths aren't very bloody tending to rely much more on sound which is equally effective. One of the major things I admire about this movie is that the audience never knows who the killer is  he's kept a mystery even at the shocking conclusion  the audience ever really gets a resolution and we aren't given any answers something that I find to be very effective. I like the fact that we are given so little information on the villain because it makes his presence much more terrifying. The tricky camerawork prevents us from ever seeing his face in fact all we really see is his body shape hair style and his hands. We hear his voice though as he harasses the sorority girls over the phone muttering vulgar and disturbing phrases and making death threats which were very well done I might add. Even scarier is the fact that he's hiding in the attic the entire time. This movie completely shatters the idea of feeling safe in your home... you can lock your doors and windows but what if the killer is already inside the house and you just don't know about it? Very scary concept. To sum things up Black Christmas is an overlooked classic that deserves so much more recognition than it's gotten over the years  I'm sure any horror fan would love to find it in their stocking. Hopefully the upcoming remake will gain the original film some longdeserved attention. Black Christmas is the ultimate holidayhorror film for fans of the genre and is the best slasher movie ever as far as I'm concerned. An underrated masterpiece. 1010.".

It's crazy that it was directed by the same man who did the perennial Christmas family fave A Christmas Story and Porky's. All of the actors did a great job especially Margot Kidder as the drunken sorority girl. She was my favorite I think. Also in this is Andrea Martin most recently famous for My Big Fat Greek Wedding as one of the girls. I watched it right around Christmas time and it freaked me out like y'all wouldn't even believe. Of all the Holidaythemed horror movies Silent Night Deadly Night My Bloody Valentine etc. I think this is right up there with Halloween.

I tend to go back and forth on which film I prefer but most of the time I do like this film better. it is a very stylish and slick film with a brisk pace that keeps you indulged in what's happening on screen. the atmosphere is genuinely chilling and the Christmas setting is used to deliver some dark and unique tones which is impressive. most of the time when a Christmas setting is involved we are treated to more of a campy and fun style but this film grits its teeth and stays dark and mysterious. the score is also great and complements the films visual style and setting very well. adding to the already intense and enthralling atmosphere. not only is the atmosphere an excellent aspect of the film but we also get some genuine suspense in multiple scenes. I'm aware that the film is old but for those of you that haven't seen it I won't spoil anything for you but I will say that there are a few chilling scenes that really show us that bob Clark knows what he is doing behind the camera. he knows what to show and when to show it to get maximum effectiveness out of each scene. so of course this means the camera work is wonderful and another aspect of the film that is a true strength. the acting is also very good john saxon margot kidder Olivia hussy and keir dullea all give excellent performances. their characters are by no means complex but for what they have to work with they do do an exceptional job. even the supporting cast are pretty good especially considering for the most part they are all no name actors with little to no experience to my knowledge. the killer in the film is also a very memorable and iconic villain and his phone conversations with the sorority girls are definitely disturbing and riveting.in truth there really isn't anything wrong with the movie I give it a perfect 1010".

	schema:headline " Gothic suspense film noir at its best";
	schema:reviewBody "Black Christmas is truly a forgotten gem.  Even though the producers intended the film for cinema Black Christmas has the look and feel of its precursors the madefortelevision gothic suspense thrillers between 1969 and early 1974.  This four year period featured inexpensivelyproduced but having hiquality production values that older viewers will remember. These include A Howling In the Woods When Michael Calls How Awful About Allen Don't Be Afraid of the Dark Home for the Holidays et al. Black Christmas produced at the tailend of this shortlived genre clearly displays the same suspenseful and moodily atmospheric elements involving human angst fears anxieties and complicated sometimes destructive relationships.  In one small aspect Black Christmas is a transitional film set between the television gothic supsense thrillers and the onset of the slasher genre epitomized by 1978's Halloween and 1979's Friday the 13th.  The violence was certainly more graphic than its television precursors but not gratuitous.  Foul language sprinkled throughout Black Christmas would never have made it past the television censors.  And look again at Halloween.  It's reliance on atmosphere moodiness suspense and the fright of awaiting something that is surely around the next dark bend of the house harkens back to the early 70s gothic thrillers.  Black Christmas is from a unique genre long gone and will probably not return but for those seeking quality shockers without the schlock will no doubt find repeat viewings of this suspense film noir satisfying.".

Even though the producers intended the film for cinema Black Christmas has the look and feel of its precursors the madefortelevision gothic suspense thrillers between 1969 and early 1974.  This four year period featured inexpensivelyproduced but having hiquality production values that older viewers will remember. These include A Howling In the Woods When Michael Calls How Awful About Allen Don't Be Afraid of the Dark Home for the Holidays et al. Black Christmas produced at the tailend of this shortlived genre clearly displays the same suspenseful and moodily atmospheric elements involving human angst fears anxieties and complicated sometimes destructive relationships.  In one small aspect Black Christmas is a transitional film set between the television gothic supsense thrillers and the onset of the slasher genre epitomized by 1978's Halloween and 1979's Friday the 13th.  The violence was certainly more graphic than its television precursors but not gratuitous.  Foul language sprinkled throughout Black Christmas would never have made it past the television censors.  And look again at Halloween.  It's reliance on atmosphere moodiness suspense and the fright of awaiting something that is surely around the next dark bend of the house harkens back to the early 70s gothic thrillers.  Black Christmas is from a unique genre long gone and will probably not return but for those seeking quality shockers without the schlock will no doubt find repeat viewings of this suspense film noir satisfying.";

Then when I read about the original which I recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day I saw that the real money is on Black Christmas which apparently beat everyone to the the caller is in the house punch. So I Netflix that and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its very long wait. All this time I am getting more and more eager to see it! Then one day out of the blue it finally arrives! ...And it's a total snore.Sure maybe I had elevated expectations but I don't think it would have gained more had I seen it fresh. The thing is it's Christmas in some Canadian college town and there's this sorority having a party. We see some killerPOV shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic. So we KNOW he's in the house. Then we're introduced to our charactersOlivia Hussey as the mousy whiny Canadianaccented Jess. Margot Kidder as the annoying overtly aggressive alcoholic Barb. She's so annoying even her mother disinvites her for her Christmas festivities. There's also this irritating Janis Ian clone Phil and this alcoholic den mother Mrs. Mac seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house. We also meet Jess's highlystrung boyfriend Peter played by Keir Dullea of 2001 and Bunny Lake is Missing fame though halfway through the film I was still asking myself Which one's Keir Dullea?So it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls but this was before email so they couldn't ask him to send a photo. Thenwell you know how they say those plastic drycleaning bags are not a toy? One of the sisters finds that out the hard way. Don't worry if you don't catch the first 14 shots of the plasticencased corpse face as it reposes in the atticthere'll be 28 more interspersed throughout the film obviously there to make you say Oh my God! There's a corpse in the attic! Though after the first hour that changes to How come the dumb police haven't found the rather prominentlyplaced plasticencased corpse in the attic? Especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house. Really any time before CSI came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime the cops are so dumb. Fortunately some of them look like John Saxon.Anyway after a lot more darn boring human drama the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavylooking trap door that rests atop it those wily cats! for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble. Now we have two corpses up in the attichey why don't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now TWO corpses in the attic?So by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously and tap the houses' phone and station a cop outside. They inform Jess and her pal Janis Ian that if the obscene caller calls back they need to keep him on the phone. Jessica who has grown even more whiny mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller Who is this? What do you want? Who are you? after like the first 89 calls when it is clear that he is not going to answer her. Isn't that like a sign a developmental disability? The inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something? And what's he going to do suddenly say Oh yeah hi it's Bob from the Laundromat? Dumb Jess.Spoilers! Anyway soon Janis Ian and Lois Lane Kidder are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces this film's idea of gore and idiot Jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked. Hello? Are you being stalked or what? Then the cops realize that the killer is in the house and call Jess and tell her don't ask questions just do as I say walk to the front door and get out. So what does moron Jess do? Starts screaming Phil? Barb? Phil? Barb? Hey great idea sister. Now why don't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking? Of course she does and sees her former friends all splashed with ketchup prompting this viewer to scream at the screen Have a clue now?!Now obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place and that it doesn't move to the same pace we're used to and seeing a plasticcovered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably WAS scary back in the day and people weren't used to being stalked by psychopaths so they wouldn't think to you know lock the doors or windows. And they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there. You see people were stupid back in the 70s. We have to understand that. One of the big shocks is that we don't even see our protoFinal Girl kill the psycho. But believe me that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for. Spoilers end!  Hey check out Cinema de Merde my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown in. You can find the URL in my email address above.".

	schema:headline " A fairly unheralded true classic of the horror genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Halloween 1978 is often credited for kickstarting the slasher film craze that went into hyperdrive after the subsequent success of Friday the 13th 1980. But it could be reasonably argued that there were much earlier films which could more accurately be said to have laid the groundwork for this subgenre such as several Italian gialli such as Mario Bava's Bay of Blood 1971 or Sergio Martino's Torso 1973. But it should also not be forgotten that the Canadian film Black Christmas touched on many of the ideas that would become slasher clichs in later years and should most certainly be considered a hugely influential and significant work. For my money this one tops all of the aforementioned movies and remains one of the absolute classics of the horror genre. Set during the Christmas holidays a psychopath surreptitiously enters a sorority house and hides out in the attic from here he commits a series of brutal murders.This one scores in that it manages to combine what was a pretty original horror concept in 1974 within the framework of a story populated with wellrounded characters and a sense of realism. The cast is great and all do fine work here. We have a commendably serious performance from Olivia Hussey as the main protagonist better still is Margot Kidder in a scene stealing role as the constantly drunk livewire Barb Marion Waldman puts in an amusing turn as the alcoholic dorm lady Doug McGrath is very funny as the idiotic inept cop at the station genre favourite John Saxon is great as ever as the police captain and Keir Dullea is suitably odd as the slightly unhinged music student boyfriend of Hussey's character. This type of top drawer talent and properly thoughtout characters are very welcome in a subgenre which would go on to be synonymous with paper thin characters who were little more than cannon fodder for a maniac. In Black Christmas we have an actually rather disturbing killer who is even more frightening in that he stores the bodies of his victims in the attic totally unbeknownst to any of the other characters. He also indulges in some highly creepy obscene phone calls to the girls in the house  these were practically as disturbing as any of his acts of murder. In fairness the film is not overtly violent and much of its fear factor comes from the more psychological end of the spectrum.In amongst all this is another surprise  humour that is genuinely amusing. The scene where Saxon confronts McGraths dozy cop about the questionable name of the sorority house he had witlessly taken down is comedy gold. Director Bob Clark's previous film the quirky zombie film Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things 1972 was far more directly about eliciting laughs but it sort of failed to be scary at all. With Black Christmas he delivered a far superior product and truly directs this one with great skill. The festive atmosphere really works in this one's favour too with the snowy Christmas background adding a lot of additional atmosphere. This is also a film which is not afraid to ultimately hold back information and never feels the need to explain absolutely everything. This mystery which can never be fully explained adds additional intrigue to proceedings and ultimately winds up with a rather bleak yet very effective ending. In summary Black Christmas is a genuine horror classic and a film so well made that it rewards repeat viewings.".

The festive atmosphere really works in this one's favour too with the snowy Christmas background adding a lot of additional atmosphere. This is also a film which is not afraid to ultimately hold back information and never feels the need to explain absolutely everything. This mystery which can never be fully explained adds additional intrigue to proceedings and ultimately winds up with a rather bleak yet very effective ending. In summary Black Christmas is a genuine horror classic and a film so well made that it rewards repeat viewings.";

	schema:reviewBody "25 Days Of Christmas Cheer Day 13Before John Carpenter's Halloween there was Black Christmas and no it's not a Tyler Perry holiday special. It's a slick little slasher set in a 1970's sorority house during Christmas break when many of the girls have gone home. Suddenly mysterious phone calls start to plague the ones still there and one by one a murderous unseen prowler starts to murder them. The phone calls themselves aren't overly threatening but instead sound like the nonsensical babbling of someone who is a couple reindeer short of a sleigh making them all the scarier. I remember watching this years ago and being far more creeped out at the phone calls rather than the actual murders. That is a perfect example of using atmosphere to get under your audience's skin rather than straight up gore and a testament to the fright films of the 70's and 80's which really seemed to have all the atmosphere vs. gore dials in the right positions. This positively drips with tension and ambiance. The silences in between screams are almost deafening in their vacuous anticipation of terror to come and strange as it sounds there's actually a nice Christmasy feeling in places where the fear hasn't yet struck despite it being a horror movie. Olivia Hussey plays Jess the main target of the killer with appropriate wide eyed intensity Margot Kidder is briefly seen as the house mother and horror regular John Saxon shows up as a suspicious Police Chief as well. I'd say this one achieves a state of suspense and atmosphere that can step up to the same plate as Halloween any day it's just a little overlooked I suppose. The house they are in is the perfect setting a sprawling Yuletide manor of creaky hallways desolated basements dark dingy attic space and an uneasy thrum of awaiting gloom that gives the words Silent Night a new meaning. The poor girls just never know when a shrill telephone ring will slice through the eerie corridors forcing them to answer it and hear an unnerving voice warble out It's me Billy on the other end. PS avoid the remake at all costs. It takes everything that was creepy and restrained about this classic and turns it into a disgusting nightmare.".

	schema:headline " A Happy Kind of Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "A case of mistaken identity causes concern conflict and consternation among the residents of a small town in Texas the results of which are often unexpected but always hilarious in Happy Texas' directed by Mark Illsley.  A comedy of incidents and errors it illustrates what can happen when trust is placed in the wrong quarter and interestingly enough the good things just may outweigh the bad depending upon which side of whose fence you're standing on at the time.  One thing is certain before it's all over there are those who will know a lot more about themselves as well as some of the others in town and one way or another Illsley makes sure that there's plenty of laughs in it for his audience along the way.Harry Sawyer Jeremy Northam and Wayne Wayne Jr. Steve Zahn escape from a Texas chain gang along with killer Bob Maslow M.C. Gainey to whom they just happen to be shackled.  When Maslow takes it on the lam Harry and Wayne steal an RV that belongs to a couple of gay entrepreneurs David Tim Bagley and Steven Michael Hitchcock who are en route to Happy to produce a beauty pageant.  For personal reasons the couple do not report the theft of their vehicle.  Meanwhile as this pageant is a big event in Happy the local sheriff Chappy Dent William H. Macy is on the lookout for David and Steven and when he spots their RV he personally escorts them into town where Harry and Wayne who quickly catch on and become Steven and David' are welcomed and handed some money.  It doesn't seem like a bad gig considering the alternatives so they take the money and go along after all how hard can producing a beauty pageant be?  Suffice to say being perceived as gay' is going to be the least of their problems over the next few days.  And with that the merriment begins.Humor is the main course served up by Illsley in this rather offbeat and quirky feast of funniness which often takes the road less traveled to come out a winner.  It's a comedy with a twist rarely associated with the prevailing attitudes among the folks residing in the good state of Texas wherein macho' holds sway and those who wear a badge must necessarily conform to the shadow cast in the image of no less than John Wayne.  With Illsley's offering however we get to see the other side of the coin and it's refreshing as well as funny.  In the end we realize that nature' will have it's way in every conceivable way shape and form and there's no getting around it it's a little thing called life.'  Illsley though is not attempting to make a statement with his film or even send a message of any kind.  This is first and foremost a comedy Illsley's intent is clearly to entertain and to make his audience laugh and in this he succeeds.  He begins with an interesting concept builds a good story and populates it with some bona fide characters' brought to life by a solid cast of talented actors.William H. Macy just may be the best character actor alive and his portrayal of Chappy helps to make the case even stronger.  His resume reads like a who's who of a cross section of the earth's population  From his memorable turn as Jerry in Fargo' to Mystery Men's' Shoveler Walt the director in State and Main' Lawrence in Focus' to his poignant and unforgettable performance as Bill  in Door To Door' and everything inbetween Macy makes whatever character he's playing unique perfect and interesting.  He's a star who can carry a film on his own or give the kind of support in a smaller role that elevates whatever project he's working on to a higher level and there are very few actors around who can lay claim to that kind of range and success.  As he does with Chappy he has the ability to make his characters convincing and entirely real bringing them to life without any discernible trace of Macy the actor to be found.  Chappy Dent for example is a sheriff in Happy Texas with no connection whatsoever to a guy named William H. Macy.  It's the highest compliment one can pay an actor and Macy deserves it tenfold.In the realm of character actors it must be noted too that Steve Zahn is well on his way to establishing himself among the best of the best.  Like Macy's Chappy in Wayne Wayne Zahn creates a character with a decidedly unique perspective on the world and his own place in it.  And like Macy Zahn has the ability to disappear into a role.  Consider some of his characters from Lenny in That Thing You Do' to George in You've Got Mail' Fuller in Joy Ride' to his role here of Wayne and you would be hard put to find any semblance of the real' Steve Zahn.  He has yet to establish his ability to carry a film on his own but he has certainly demonstrated how invaluable his presence can be to any film. Of the entire cast in fact it is leading man Jeremy Northam known predominately for period piece dramas Mr. Knightly Emma' Sir Robert An Ideal Husband' and Ash Possession' for example who seems to be the fish out of water here.  As HarrySteven however he rises to the occasion and gives a convincing performance that is yet another plus' to the film.  it's a role somewhat against type for him but he pulls it off nicely.The supporting cast includes Ally Walker Josephine Illeana Douglas Doreen Ron Perlman Marshal Nalhober Jillian Berard Maddie and Paul Dooley The Judge.  A feelgood film made for fun and frolic Happy Texas' may take a side door to the humor but it finds it and makes good on the promise of what comedy' is all about  Plenty of laughs.  810.".

It was silly of course but not dumb. The plotline is ridiculous in theory but is carried out quite well. In fact I found this movie to be rather sweet and charming and very funny in parts. Not hysterical but entertaining.The thing I was most surprised about while viewing HAPPY TEXAS was how good the acting was in parts. Every actor was good in both their comedic and dramatic moments. Steve Zahn was hilarious as Wayne while Jeremy Northam was good in a mostly dramatic role. William H. Macy was excellent as he always is as was Ally Walker.All in all HAPPY TEXAS is a pretty average comedy. There are some good humorous moments but they come somewhat few and far between. The pacing is a little too slow and it gets a little boring at times but it's a cute and fairly original movie. Better than most of its kind and pretty entertaining. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie seems strangely unfocused with the apparent central concept of their masquerade as gay quickly downplayed and Zahn's assimilation of the pageantmaster role confined to a few montages  when he suddenly becomes a dedicated inspirational achiever it's a bit jarring. Instead the film meanders through pretty conventional strands about Northam finding himself by serving as Walker's gay confidante admittedly a winning plot strand planning a bank heist and other snippets of nothing in particular. There's a slapdash quality to the casting withNortham ineffective as the solid centre and Zahn getting by on a weird collection of mannerisms rather than a coherent character  Macy is affecting in his role but the film is a bit fuzzy about the details of his personal selfdiscovery. Even the closing pageant is barely exploited for comic value. The movie might be deliberately going against the grain of standard plotting but it doesn't really seem so  it's a not particularly interesting mix of obvious setups and plot gambits and discursive if not arbitrary execution.".

There's a slapdash quality to the casting withNortham ineffective as the solid centre and Zahn getting by on a weird collection of mannerisms rather than a coherent character  Macy is affecting in his role but the film is a bit fuzzy about the details of his personal selfdiscovery. Even the closing pageant is barely exploited for comic value. The movie might be deliberately going against the grain of standard plotting but it doesn't really seem so  it's a not particularly interesting mix of obvious setups and plot gambits and discursive if not arbitrary execution.";

Happy Texas is a rather fastpaced comedy which holds your attention.

He was SO wonderful and open and vulnerable as the sheriff with a secret that I really felt for his plight as you would for a friend. He was really the most developed and likable of the characters here. And I think it's good that the audience at least as I saw it is much more concerned with whether he'll end up happy than anyone else. There were a lot of annoying inconsistencies like where the two convicts are getting their fabulous wardrobe from. And why Ally Walker seems to have gotten a perm for one scene and then taken it out for the next. But the movie is so slight that it is't worth caring about. This is one of those Miramax movies that comes out and plays in smaller theaters even though it is every bit as slick predictable and mainstream as anything else out there.

Two escaped convicts pose as a gay couple in a small Texas town in order to evade the law while they bide their time in order to pull off their final big heist.  Their feigned homosexuality provides the premise for numerous misunderstandings and generally unfunny moments.  The more redneck con gets roped into having to teach little girls how to dance.  The possibilities for humour here exist but unfortunately are unrealized.  There's a corny romance that develops between the goodlooking con and the town's attractive banker.  This movie was a film without an identity rotating between an unfunny farce a cliched romantic comedy and the more tender and interesting William H.

	schema:headline " insufficiently funny comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Like so many quirky independent comedies of recent years Happy Texas' is a film that does everything but beg roll over and play dead to be loved. Yet for all its scattered moments of whimsical charm the film merely demonstrates that a cute premise and a genial tone are insufficient compensation for an underfed screenplay that fails to generate many substantial laughs.  Since even the premise itself lacks real freshness the movie must finally be judged on the quality of its execution.  This is the umpteenth version of that old chestnut in which two fugitives on the lam find safety by impersonating individuals with personalities completely antithetical to their own  we've seen them many times before  disguised as women priests nuns cruise directors choir directors you name it .  Finally unmasked for all to see in their nakedness and shame such characters inevitably find their redemption in the generous attitudes and forgiving hearts of the people they may have deceived it is true but also touched in some deep emotional way.   Following slavishly in the footsteps of all these previous films Happy Texas' fairs badly in comparison since although it sets up a situation rife with farcical possibilities it never really finds the manic energy or ingeniously convoluted and multilayered plot structure necessary to the success of such a film.  Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam charmingly portray chain gang partners who suddenly finding themselves escaped prisoners stumble into a small Texas town where they are immediately mistaken for a gay couple hired to direct a little girl beauty pageant.  The scene in which the two macho men discover the truth' about the men they are impersonating is genuinely hilarious and  betokens many more laughs to follow.  Yet somehow they never manage to develop.   For one thing the men essentially go their separate ways during the majority of the film's running time so the comic tension that exists between them simply dissipates.

	onyx:emotionText "Like so many quirky independent comedies of recent years Happy Texas' is a film that does everything but beg roll over and play dead to be loved. Yet for all its scattered moments of whimsical charm the film merely demonstrates that a cute premise and a genial tone are insufficient compensation for an underfed screenplay that fails to generate many substantial laughs.  Since even the premise itself lacks real freshness the movie must finally be judged on the quality of its execution.  This is the umpteenth version of that old chestnut in which two fugitives on the lam find safety by impersonating individuals with personalities completely antithetical to their own  we've seen them many times before  disguised as women priests nuns cruise directors choir directors you name it .  Finally unmasked for all to see in their nakedness and shame such characters inevitably find their redemption in the generous attitudes and forgiving hearts of the people they may have deceived it is true but also touched in some deep emotional way.   Following slavishly in the footsteps of all these previous films Happy Texas' fairs badly in comparison since although it sets up a situation rife with farcical possibilities it never really finds the manic energy or ingeniously convoluted and multilayered plot structure necessary to the success of such a film.  Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam charmingly portray chain gang partners who suddenly finding themselves escaped prisoners stumble into a small Texas town where they are immediately mistaken for a gay couple hired to direct a little girl beauty pageant.  The scene in which the two macho men discover the truth' about the men they are impersonating is genuinely hilarious and  betokens many more laughs to follow.  Yet somehow they never manage to develop.   For one thing the men essentially go their separate ways during the majority of the film's running time so the comic tension that exists between them simply dissipates.  In addition the beauty pageant concept is a dud since having these girls be of such a young age gives the men's forcibly repressed heterosexuality no room for comic play.  Thus the comic possibilities inherent in being a straight man trapped in a gay man's body seem strangely underplayed and unexploited. Moreover both the conventional romances between the lead characters and their respective women and the unconventional' one between Northam and the suddenly smitten gay sheriff William H. Macy fail to result in any real sparks or passion.

Besides the stellar performances by everyone in the cast I think special mention should go to Ally Walker as Josephine McClintock. The scene at her house where she and Jeremy Northam's character are painting props and all of the scenes between her and him are extremely welldone. Harry Sawyer's reserved rather civilized demeanor somehow works well with Wayne Wayne Jr.'s outspokenness and physical aggressiveness. The reintroduction of Bob Maslow was done at a perfect time and that is an unexpected twist in the plot. I appreciated many things about the ending scene at the prison performance by the Happy Girls Doreen and Wayne still wanted each other. Josephine and Harry still had a chance at a delayed reunion. Harry could be out in under two years. The girls' performance of What's So Great About Love complete with the spastic moves Wayne taught them was excellent. I love how the movie was filmed in big bright colors with lots of outdoor scenes None of the morose ashen tones that are prevalent today. The soundtrack is great. Some of the best scenes are between Northam and Walker Jo I haven't had a girlfriend in a really long time...Harry Neither have I. him having been in prisonJo That's funny. thinking he is referring to his gayness.and...Jo yelling from tow truck What are you doing?Harry I'm trying to save you!Jo Well stop!

	schema:reviewBody "At the time such an idea of having the heroes being the criminals was unheard of but Joseph H. Lewis's film deservedly has its claim of being the little Bmovie that could forgive the mechanical analogy by inspiring the French newwave and other films like Bonnie  Clyde. The idea of having a tragic love story pitted in the middle of noir facade was also seen in the equally powerful lowbudget They Live by Night. But while Nicholas Ray's film is more impressive on its emotional stakes Gun Crazy rakes up points for some of its technical achievements. The style implemented by Lewis and DP Russel Harlan also responsible for the great photography in Red River adds excitement to the more suspenseful even violent scenes and adds some sentiment to the softer ones involving the couple. And I love the scenes where young Bart can't seem to put away his fascination with guns.Bart John Dall starts off as a boy and in some of these early scenes some of the best in the film we see how he is changed by an unfortunate act and then the story skips ahead suddenly. Now Bart is an adult out of the army and gets reintroduced to guns once he meets his soontobe love and partner in crime Annie played by Peggy Cummins. From there after getting married and needing or rather wanting money they start robbing banks across country but soon to meet their demise. But more than anything the film's focus isn't one where 'crime doesn't pay' or some kind of typical oftheperiod nonsense. Like the Asphalt Jungle we're given these conflicted emotional beings who may meet their own ends with each other before the law. And in the filmnoir tradition it's the woman here who will act as a main catalyst for the end of them. It's psychological side of danger pathological lies and the pattern of a downward spiral in having to commit violent acts even unintentionally becomes what really pulls in the viewer into the picture aside from the more loose onlocation 'real' style and interesting camerawork. Under more 'Bmovie' conditions Lewis sneaks in plenty of chances to look past some of the more cardboard cutout forms the characters could have been. The acting by the leads is also very good the script mostly by Dalton Trumbo is one of his best and both understand how one reflects the other. Cummins is perfect in her part even if Dall isn't quite as much a standout though of course he's the sap to her more wicked side. Also out of the script comes cool lines like the one listed in the summary. It's a notch above many other Bnoirs of the period and should be seen by most serious fans of the 'mood' that came in noir films. A bit cynical fatalistic to be sure but it's smart too.".

But while Nicholas Ray's film is more impressive on its emotional stakes Gun Crazy rakes up points for some of its technical achievements. The style implemented by Lewis and DP Russel Harlan also responsible for the great photography in Red River adds excitement to the more suspenseful even violent scenes and adds some sentiment to the softer ones involving the couple. And I love the scenes where young Bart can't seem to put away his fascination with guns.Bart John Dall starts off as a boy and in some of these early scenes some of the best in the film we see how he is changed by an unfortunate act and then the story skips ahead suddenly. Now Bart is an adult out of the army and gets reintroduced to guns once he meets his soontobe love and partner in crime Annie played by Peggy Cummins. From there after getting married and needing or rather wanting money they start robbing banks across country but soon to meet their demise. But more than anything the film's focus isn't one where 'crime doesn't pay' or some kind of typical oftheperiod nonsense. Like the Asphalt Jungle we're given these conflicted emotional beings who may meet their own ends with each other before the law. And in the filmnoir tradition it's the woman here who will act as a main catalyst for the end of them. It's psychological side of danger pathological lies and the pattern of a downward spiral in having to commit violent acts even unintentionally becomes what really pulls in the viewer into the picture aside from the more loose onlocation 'real' style and interesting camerawork. Under more 'Bmovie' conditions Lewis sneaks in plenty of chances to look past some of the more cardboard cutout forms the characters could have been. The acting by the leads is also very good the script mostly by Dalton Trumbo is one of his best and both understand how one reflects the other. Cummins is perfect in her part even if Dall isn't quite as much a standout though of course he's the sap to her more wicked side. Also out of the script comes cool lines like the one listed in the summary. It's a notch above many other Bnoirs of the period and should be seen by most serious fans of the 'mood' that came in noir films. A bit cynical fatalistic to be sure but it's smart too.";

It was titled Gun Crazy. I thought it was great but it didn't receive rave reviews or last long in hometown theaters. I understand they renamed it Deadly Is The Female in 1950 for its release in England reason being that costar Peggy Cummins was British and emphasizing the female star would be better boxoffice.In the years that passed I wanted to see it again but it didn't appear on TV or later on any videotape that I knew of. In the 1983 Richard Geer film Breathless there is a chase scene where he is trying to escape by way of the stage behind a movie screen. On that screen was playing what I immediately recognized as Gun Crazy. Over the years since then I have continued to look for the movie but was unable to find it. Less than a month ago I found it on DVD and purchased an excellent copy. I found that the movie is just as good as I remember it.The film is essentially a story of a boy named Bart Tare Russ Tamblyn who loves guns for sport but refuses to harm any living being with them. After stealing one from a local store he is caught and sent to a reformatory. The story continues four reformatory years plus one army hitch later when an adult Bart John Dall is discharged. He and some friends go to a cheap carnival where he sees and immediately falls for a trick shot artist Annie Laurie Starr Peggy Cummins. He beats her in a shooting contest but is offered a job in the act rather than the prize he was supposed to win.Bart is unaware of her dark past which includes hints of prostitution and the murder of a man in St. Louis. After a showdown with the jealous carnival owner they run off together and get married. When their money runs out Bart wants to get a job but Annie Laurie's mind runs in a different direction armed robbery. Reluctantly Bart gives in and they set off on a spree of low paying stickups. By this time Bart is increasingly aware that Annie Laurie has homicidal tendencies that he is barely able to keep under control. They plan a bigtime robbery during which she kills two people without his knowledge. The rest of the movie deals with their flight from justice and ultimate payment for their crimes. In all it is a classic scenario of Bad Girl leads a Good Boy into evil.Personal opinion is that John Dall did a better acting job in this movie than he did in Rope. In a bit of selfanalysis I must admit that I have long been fascinated by Wicked Women. This movie alone placed Peggy Cummins among my favorite femme fatales which included the queen of mean Barbara Stanwyck Marlene Dietrich Beverly Michaels and other notables.If you like classic film noir it is a good movie to remember and see again.".

	schema:headline " Fine Precursor to Bonnie and Clyde";
	schema:reviewBody "The original title of Gun Crazy was Deadly Is the Female and they ain't kidding. If you thought Faye Dunaway's Bonnie Parker was the more ruthless member of the crime duo that gave Arthur Penn's 1967 film its name wait till you get a load of Peggy Cummins's Annie in this little known cheapie from 1949. I wouldn't want to get on this woman's bad side she can shoot cigarettes out of people's mouths for God's sake.Gun Crazy is such an obvious influence on Penn's Bonnie and Clyde that I can't believe the later film doesn't credit it directly. Though the 1949 film is based on a short story that appeared in the Saturday Evening Post and the 1967 film worked with an original screenplay both films could have been adapted from the same source. They portray the AnnieBonnie character as bored and restless turned on by the thought of crime and by a manly man who can really use his gun. The BartClyde character is tickled by the idea of being a virile stud in the eyes of his lover but is ultimately too sensitive for the life they choose. And both films do a good job of portraying the desperation that plagues both couples the isolation and loneliness they create for themselves and can never break out of and the ultimate futility of their actions since the law is going to catch up with them sooner or later.Peggy Cummins is really good in this. I don't know what else she's been in but her babydoll voice creates an effective contrast to her colderthanice attitude. She's crooning into her lover's ear one minute and itching to kill someone the next. And you have to dig those Frenchinspired fashions that would cause a sensation nearly 20 years later when Dunaway donned them again for Penn's film.I thought John Dall was at first odd casting for the role of Bart. Annie is supposed to think of him as a man's man and Dall with his willowy physique and gentle mannerisms is far from that. But then when we realize that he's at heart really too gentle for the life he and Annie have chosen for themselves his casting makes sense.There are some small touches to this film that really add to its immediacy and realism. I loved the scenes of Annie and Bart driving to and from their heist jobs shot from the back seat of the car as if we are a member of their gang. They have really funny and natural banter back and forth about where to park etc. which I have to believe was improvised to some extent. The ending of the film a face off in a creepy swamp is eerie and there's a small twist in the last seconds of the film that might be easy to miss but may give you some things to think about if you catch it.It's interesting and rather depressing that one of the main themes of this film is the obsession with guns and violence that pervaded the country nearly 60 years ago and here we are a handful of wars later still dragging around the same old obsessions. Michael Moore's recent documentary Bowling for Columbine could have just as easily been called Gun Crazy if that title weren't already taken by this forgotten little blast of a movie.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "What is the quintessence of a filmnoir? A good answer is an evil strong woman that manipulates a weak although basically decent man involving him in a crazy love doomed to a tragic ending. Then we can safely state that Deadly is the Female is a perfect instance of filmnoir. The movie has outstanding merits. The cinematography and especially the camerawork are excellent and comparable to the best achievements in the filmnoir genre. Justly celebrated are the scenes filmed with the camera inside the car like that of the bank shot in Hampton a true cinematic gem. John Dall and Peggy Cummins in the roles of the doomed lovers Bart and Annie Laurie make a great job. The story starts slowly a minor drawback but as soon as the two lovers cross the border of legality the movie acquires a quick exciting and ruthless pace and presents a powerful finale. The psychology of Bart and Annie Laurie is studied with care. Annie Laurie is a systematic liar. With Bart she always looks sweet deeply in love even subdued to her man. To justify her shootings and murders she always whines with Bart that she had lost her nerves that she was scared. But when Bart is not present the viewer gets from her body language and the cruel expression of her eyes that she just loves to kill. Great job by Peggy Cummins. So does Laurie just make use of Bart for her dirty purposes to satisfy her own depravity? Not at all. Oddly enough in another famous scene we see that Laurie really loves Bart with all her heart. Only she is bad and cruel that's her inner core. And is Bart so stupid and bewitched not to realize that Laurie is going to ruin him? No he knows it and he deeply suffers but ultimately he doesn't care. Only Laurie counts. Desperately crazy love... how fascinating! at least in a filmnoir. The script offers several memorable lines and the many subtleties give realism to the story. For instance Bart and Laurie are not professional criminals and they show it when they carelessly spend hot money which will cost them dearly. Deadly is the Female is an excellent film a relevant nugget in the filmnoir gold mine. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gun Crazy was an independent production made without any big name stars yet it fascinates me and I pull it out every now and then for a repeat viewing. The script when laid out blow by blow seems almost pedestrian  a Bonnie and Clyde story with no real surprises but without the Depression as a backdrop as a possible motivation for all of this mayhem.Unlike Bonnie and Clyde though this story is set in booming postwar America. Bart is a guy who loves guns but cannot kill. He killed a chick once as a child and as a result of the overwhelming remorse he felt cannot even bring himself to shoot a menacing animal with a bounty on it years later. Bart has good friends a sister who seems to be well grounded and has been taking care of Bart since their parents' death yet he commits a crime to get a gun when he's about fourteen when he's got to know this seemingly impulsive act will mean he's caught almost immediately  he is. He's sent to reform school for the theft goes into the Army for four years but does not see combat and here it is the present  1950  and he's returned home for a visit.So here Bart is an adult he has good support from family and friends but he's still gun crazy and has the misfortune of running into sure shot Annie Laurie Peggy Cummins a little lady who has big dreams without the problem of a pesky conscience. So Bart's dilemma is that of so many in film noir  a bad set of coincidences coupled with a fundamental character flaw  he just can't say no to Annie Laurie. If he hadn't gone to the carnival that night and done trick shooting against Annie Laurie in a scene that sure looks like foreplay with guns he probably would have gotten that job with Remington for forty bucks a week and been happy with that. But here he is in the sexual clutches of a femme fatale who is dead behind these eyes  to quote another movie entirely. Initially Annie seems to pick Bart because he is a straight arrow someone who genuinely cares for her and right before they marry she even vows to try to be good. Bart goes for Annie Laurie because he can't believe that a girl so pretty and so exciting seems to get him and actually wants an ordinary working stiff like himself  but isn't this how so many guys feel on their wedding day? Ultimately their curse is their first impressions of each other were correct  Bart is basically a straight arrow and Annie Laurie is exciting and craves a constant high level of excitement  and danger  in her life. So to keep Annie Bart has to feed her with big wads of cash and even bigger wads of excitement that can only come from robbery and with armed robbery there's always the chance of murder and we all know what happens to murderers in the age of the production code.This film is so visually interesting. One reason I think I like it so much is I like to look around in a scene and just not at the players. Also it has that great and powerful score going for it and Bart and Annie's song Mad About You which is so true of both of them but in very different ways. Plus you never get inside the characters to find out why they might have turned out this way. Why is Bart so weak? Why is Annie so bad? Remember this may be 1950 but these two grew up in the Depression and who knows what they saw as kids. It's all left for you to fill in the blanks. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a teenager growing up in the early 1970s I became fascinated by film noir. I devoured every book our local library had about these movies never having any idea that I would ever be able to see them. I had no crystal ball I couldn't imagine videotape DVDs and 24hour movie channels. It was an unexpected delight to find Gun Crazy in the library at Netflix.I never forgot a still from Gun Crazy that I saw in a book called Crime Movies by Carlos Clarens. It looked like a newspaper photo. It depicted John Dall and Peggy Cummins on the run apparently after committing a robbery. The picture stayed in my memory along with the commentary that accompanied it. I have to agree with Clarens that Gun Crazy is a movie the legacy of which Bonnie and Clyde Natural Born Killers Badlands etc. is far greater and its spinoffs much better known than the source. It's too bad because Gun Crazy has a verisimilitude all its own and a smoldering sexuality rarely seen in American movies of the late 1940s.Homicidal lovers on the run is a subgenre of film noir and rarely was the visceral erotic component that drives such stories as well delineated as in Gun Crazy. In fact thanks to censorship and writers not quite talented enough to circumvent its restrictions many B crime movies ignored the sexual tension that drew the lovers to each other to begin with. Often the couple's meeting and attraction to each other are so sketchily drawn that the killing sprees that follow seem to spring up from nowhere. The blacklisted Dalton Trumbo writing under the pseudonym Millard Kaufman who was actually a real screenwriter crafted the screenplay of Gun Crazy from MacKinlay Kantor's short story. The prologue bears a didactic fingerwagging mark uncharacteristic of Trumbo in a flashback establishing Bart's fascination since childhood with guns but a disdain for killing. Understanding this contradiction is the key to Bart's character but this sequence appears to come from one of those little educational films once shown to 8thgraders the hamhanded message of which invariably was that Crime Does Not Pay. So the film really kicks into high gear once the lovers Bart and Annie Laurie meet. Significantly it is only in this and the final scene that he ever has the upper hand over her. The screenplay's early missteps can be forgiven once the crime spree is underway most especially in the justifiably famous bank heist scene.It's no spoiler to say as is noted on the IMDb home page for this film that the bank holdup sequence was shot in one take its dialogue almost entirely improvised. Knowing these scenes were not blocked out and shot on a set only adds to the suspense. As Bart and Laurie drive through town his manner towards her is so gentle so felicitous it's almost as if he were a young husband teaching his wife to drive. But she already knows she is in the driver's seat. She gets them where they need to go it is she who makes certain of a clean getaway. Bart is really just her tool.Gun Crazy deserves to be seen not just by fans of film noir but by anyone who loves to stumble upon a surprisea forgotten jewel of a film ahead of its time and a standout of its genre. This film is crowned by a superb multilayered performance from Peggy Cummins. I think it's fair to say that her Laurie really is in love with Bart after all she has her chances to leave him. But he evokes in her a tenderness and reminds her of her desire for the ordinary life she has harbored but has always known would never be hers. Watching some of their quietly sexy scenes together you can almost hear Laurie purr I'm not bad I'm just drawn that way.John Dall is just as effective as Cummins in my view. Director Joseph H. Lewis was wise to go with a softer stifled version of a Fred McMurray whom Dall somewhat resembled. He was tall and lanky imposing but never threatening. Time in reform school and the Army didn't make Bart tough so it's unlikely that he would be immune to the charms of the steamiest of femmes fatale. Laurie is tough enough for the both of them almost all down the line.".

From the opening scene with a young fatally tempted Bart Tare stealing a gun from a hardware store to Bart and Laurie's inevitable yet still shocking deaths this is excellent filmmaking.

Others have noted how Cummins fails to make the distinction between coldblooded femme fatale and allAmerican or in Cummins case English girl. Well that's exactly the point Laurie is an enigma. Introduced with the names of two famed feminine sharped shooters tacked on to her real name and playing with costumes in their couple's run from the law one moment she's a bespectacled youngmarried the next a lone hitchhiker toting a gun it's hard to gage Laurie's true motivations. Oh she wants big things and she seems very trigger happy unlike Bart she will kill but she does love Bart and shows true vulnerability at times. Dall whom I enjoyed in ROPE has another interesting role in Bart Tare who from boyhood loves guns but can't bring himself to kill after shooting dead a chick at the age of seven. Others may call Tare stiff but I think he projects the exact quality the filmmakers were looking for.It's creatively shot and unusually rhythmic almost poetic for a B film or nervous A as it was originally conceived as.

Poor Bart he'd like to be just another married couple but temptress Laurie is just too much for his confusion. Plus it's not a ring that bonds them it's two clutching hands on a revolver that seals their love.

I'm amazed this movie was a low budget Bmovie you could've fooled me. This is just as good as those great Nicholas Ray movies this would make a great double bill with THEY LIVE BY NIGHT.

	schema:reviewBody "Usually I like to review films that are underrated. Every now and then I will take the other end of the pole and come before you kind reader shellshocked at how some critics can make so much out of nothing. A friend told me that this film was rated one of the 100 best of all time on a competing net database and supposedly a great example of film noire. Since I had never heard of it I borrowed his copy. OMG. Here are some notes. If you don't agree fine. I have some swampland in Boca you might find equally appealing 1. Aside from the date all the earmarks of a 50s Bmovie. Stars you may never have heard of unless they are relations. Bit parts go to the same group of character actors you see in every 50s film. Closeups for no other reason than they were popular in that era. Drenched with hidden moral judgements pregnant pauses ominous looks. 2. The music. Oh if you really wanted to make prisoners confess don't send them to Gitmo make them watch a dozen films like this one after the other. They will tell you whatever they know. While it is true that all 50s Bmovies are equally guilty any cinephile from an earlier period the 40s saw some of the best films ever made or a later period anything after 1979 would be able to stand no more than a few minutes of this overloud brazen intrusive unctuous music track and then ask the musical question what were these guys smoking? Did they have no concept that less is more? Answer no they did not. 3. Camera work is very 50s. It is as if they suddenly discovered that you get very high depth of field with certain apertures so the whole movie is filmed as though it were just one scene. To consider this film up there with the great filmes noires of the 40s is heresy. The only redeeming factor is the memorabilia from the era the cars the clothes even the diner where the two stars short of cash refuse onions on their burgers because it is 5 cents extra. A classic? What are you thinking?".

	schema:reviewBody "Deadly is the Female is a lame title but it captures the essence of this film better than Gun Crazy even though that is a much more pithy title. This is not a story about people obsessed with guns and killing. It is more about a sick relationship that involves two people who are pretty good shooters.In the first part of the film Bart is portrayed as a troubled young man who has a weird fascination with guns. He is sent off to reform school. So we may expect him to come out all twisted and ready to go on a crime spree but no He comes back as a nice young man who has served in the army and is now looking to carry on a normal life.Later when Bart comes under the spell of the blonde sharpshooter Annie Laurie Starr he moves pretty quickly into a life of crime. It seems a little odd that this cleancut guy would do this and I think it would have been better if he had shown some sign of the depravity the character had as a child.Of course there is the highly charged scene in which they engage in a shooting contest. Sexual tension is evident but since this was 1949 there is nothing too explicit.What really makes this film fascinating are the great scenes in which the characters go off on their robbery spree. The long onetake shot from the back seat of the car as they pull the bank robbery is terrific. Also the closeups on their faces when they are running from the law towards the end.Spoiler The final shootout is not as violent as you might expect given all that has gone before but it has a nice twist in that the guy who could not kill ends up killing the person he loves.The Bonnie and Clyde comparisons are inevitable. In some scenes Laurie wears a beret. The real Bonnie wore one in one famous photo so the filmmakers may have taken it from that. Some 18 years later Faye Dunaway had the same look. I am sure the producers of Bonnie and Clyde were influenced by Gun Crazy. I wonder why John Dall did not do more films. He is one of those actors with a distinct look. I remember him from Rope and Spartacus but it appears his last film was the Atlantis scifi movie from the early 1960's.This is a great film for studying technique.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Gun Crazy the combination of a selfconfessed bad girl a very malleable man and a shared obsession with guns creates passions which are so powerful uncontrollable and destructive that they soon lead to the young couple being despatched down the road to hell at such a velocity that there's no scope for a change of course. Their joint obsession and the dynamics of their relationship together unleash so much excitement that they become totally intoxicated by it and preoccupied by their basic instincts to such a level that any other considerations are completely ignored. This then becomes the catalyst for a crazy crosscountry rampage of robberies car stealing and killing that provides lots of thrills and danger but also determines their destiny.Considering its Bmovie status and its modest budget Gun Crazy is absolutely sensational as it tells its lovers on the run story with so much simplicity and energy that watching it becomes a riveting experience. The action is delivered at high speed and the movie's visual style is enhanced by some marvellous camerawork. Good use is made of high and low angle shots and various sequences are shot from interesting viewpoints such as the inside of a shop window or the back seat of a car. The dialogue is succinct and hardboiled and imparts expositional information and details about the characters with such economy that it also contributes strongly to the pace of the film.Bart Tare John Dall was fascinated by guns from a very early age and his inability to resist the temptation to steal a revolver from a shop window led him into trouble and a stint in reform school during his teens. This experience was followed by Army service before he returned home to the small town of Cashville where he intended to get a job and settle down. After meeting up with a couple of his friends they all decide to visit a travelling carnival where they watch a performance by an attractive sharpshooter called Annie Laurie Starr Peggy Cummins.Bart is enthralled by Laurie's act and when the carnival owner Packett Berry Kroeger invites members of the audience to take part in a shooting match with his star attraction Bart is happy to accept the challenge. He displays better skill and accuracy than his opponent and is offered a job by Packett but far more significantly the chemistry between him and Laurie is palpable and eventually leads to them both getting fired by the very jealous carnival owner.Bart and Laurie run away together get married and enjoy an extended honeymoon but when their money runs out and Bart plans to get a job Laurie dismisses the idea because an ordinary wage could never be sufficient to meet her high aspirations. She's determined to get what she wants at any price and makes it clear that she's intent on pursuing her ambitions with or without Bart. His passion for her is so great that he casts aside his own reservations and allows himself to be persuaded to join her on a wild crime spree during which they rob a variety of businesses and a bank before their story reaches its violent conclusion.One of the most memorable parts of the movie is the scene during which the couple first meet. Their expressions and body language convey very clearly just how powerfully they're attracted to each other and the atmosphere is absolutely electric. Peggy Cummins is brilliant in this scene and also in some others where the level of excitement that she derives from the couple's various escapades is obvious and intense. John Dall is also great during the couple's first encounter but throughout the entire film he portrays Bart's sensitive nature naivety and lack of guile with tremendous conviction.Laurie is a manipulative psychopath who's totally unencumbered by any morals or principles and finds it incredibly easy to use her sexual allure to get Bart to do whatever she wants. Bart's fixation with guns had always been based on the fact that they made him feel awful good inside like I'm someone but equally strong was his inability to even contemplate killing any living creature. At various times during their relationship Bart becomes troubled about what they're doing and especially about the killing but he never has the strength of character to distance himself from Laurie or their criminal activity.Gun Crazy makes a terrific impact has great drive and is simply an exceptional movie.".

John Dall is also great during the couple's first encounter but throughout the entire film he portrays Bart's sensitive nature naivety and lack of guile with tremendous conviction.Laurie is a manipulative psychopath who's totally unencumbered by any morals or principles and finds it incredibly easy to use her sexual allure to get Bart to do whatever she wants. Bart's fixation with guns had always been based on the fact that they made him feel awful good inside like I'm someone but equally strong was his inability to even contemplate killing any living creature. At various times during their relationship Bart becomes troubled about what they're doing and especially about the killing but he never has the strength of character to distance himself from Laurie or their criminal activity.Gun Crazy makes a terrific impact has great drive and is simply an exceptional movie.";

It reminded me of Borzage's Moonrise one of my absolute favourites very few films capture the sheer terror of presiding over a less powerful being's fate this well... In Moonrise it's a raccoon in a tree shaken loose for the dogs in GC it's a fuzzy baby chicken killed with a bb gun... and there are echoes of this nightmarish power all through the film. These aren't your typical frightened killers on the run. They're frightened alright but mostly they're frightened of their own superior firepower...But this isn't Natural Born Killers either... Nor is it some bland argument in favour of gun control! More than anything this is a brilliant dramatization of how badly things can deteriorate for two people once they decide that they can live for love alone and opt out of the social contract. These monsters are not products of their environment they choose their fate...Didn't you realize that once we started this we'd never be able to turn to anyone for help again? Dall asks Cummins. She knows.Cummins is amazing in this role. I don't even think she qualifies as a femme fatale really... That term usually applies to a moneygrubbing jerk who tantalizes the male protagonist into compromising his integrity. In some ways she does have this effect on Dall but it's a lot more complicated than that... This isn't Phyllis Dietrichson  Walter Neff. Barbara Stanwyck is my favourite actress bar none but Double Indemnity? That's gotta be one of the worst things she ever did. It's not her fault. It's Billy Wilder's. He liked his women venal or pixiesh... Either waythey're just there to affect the men. I hate Billy Wilder. I really do. If you're looking for a Stanwyck character to compare Cummins to try her eponymous turn in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers on for size. There are a lot of similarities. Both women are extraordinarily competent and that's what makes them appealing. They aren't moral black holes sucking the men to their doomthey're Nietzschean supernovae of desire. Cummins isn't trying to fool Dall into getting stuff for her. She wants a partner in crime. Someone to keep her company while she does what she does  loves best. Shoot people. Dall is a lot more squeamish than that but he can't keep away from her. I let you do my killing for me he says.It's true.They aren't two people anymore. They're one. And it turns out that romantic fusion isn't all it's cracked up to be. In fact it's crazy.".

He was sent away at an early age to reform school and when he goes back home for the first time in years he surprises everyone with how he had grown up. He and his childhood friends go to the carnival in town when he sees his dream ideal woman Annie  the best female shooter from canada. He impresses her with his abilities in a test that she proposed and asks if he'd like to join her act on the road he complies and soon enough a loving bond forms and pretty soon a marriage at that. Unhappy with their financial problems she proposes that they rob some banks for easy and quick cash at first he disputes the idea but her threat of leaving him scares him enough and he complies. They go on a spree of robberies across states and after one last MAJOR robbery he realizes that this isn't the lifestyle he wants to live for the rest of his life.This was a really great film it had a couple of unknown actors at the time and they did the film justice. The woman who played Annie's character was really annoying but the man who played Bart was very good. The filming in this movie IMO is not that great but it was a lower budget film and they worked with what they had such as the scene where they are driving through the city and the camera is stationed in the backseat of the car they were in. A good film difinitley worth watching over again.".

The editing and directing was good but I found the cinematography to be OK. There were some good scenes that were shot like the bank robbery with the cop out front but I thought some of the scenes were repetitive. For example a lot of the car scenes were the same. The shot was always taken from the back seat. They were good shots but there just wasn't a good selection of shots from different angles. The story was believable for me and I was easily sucked into the story. There were parts where I thought they would be found like when they entered the park and the cops were getting closer to them. Towards the end I thought they were going to get away when Bart said he might know a way to escape. The best scene was the end when they were in the swamp. With the sounds and the fog it gave the scene some mystery. I didn't know what was going to happen but I kept saying to myself run you idiots! The movie however ended like any film noir with the main characters having the law catch up with them. The movie was overall a great movie.".

With any luck the most awesome of all Seagal's movies  'Under Siege'  will be on sometime soon but for now 'Hard to Kill' was rather awesome.Seagal plays Mason Storm a cop investigating links between some mobsters crooked cops and crooked politician and suddenly everything turns into a 'Kill Bill' prototype The bad guys kill Storm's family and leave him for dead. After waking up from a sevenyear coma Storm sets out for vengeance.'Hard to Kill' is an entertaining action movie. The amount of limbsnapping may be lower than usual for a Seagal movie but the fight scenes are good. An added bonus is the fact that 'Hard to Kill' features some of Seagal's best lines and moments I'm gonna take you to the bank Senator Trent. To the blood bank!. The hide and seek scene has got to be the best scene Seagal has ever filmed.'Hard to Kill' rates as one of my favourite Seagal movies and certainly much better than anything he's done lately. Seagal fans should get a kick out of this  710".

	schema:headline " It's mildly entertaining but one of Seagal's best.    out of    ";
	schema:reviewBody "A thought came up to me as I was watching Hard to Kill 1990. After I watched the film I was reminded of the Kill Bill movies and I wondered if Hard to Kill's plot inspired Quentin Tarantino to make the series. It looks so. Both Hard to Kill and the two Kill Bill movies are all revenge pictures but with two very different characters. Both characters are shot dead and put into a coma and both wake up several years later to exact revenge on their enemies. And while I prefer the bloody entertaining Kill Bill movies more I will say that Hard to Kill is a mildly entertaining action flick.The film stars Steven Seagal who plays L.A. cop Mason Storm who videotapes a mobster being contracted by thugs to kill someone. Storm can't get a clear image of the man who has hired the mobster but recognizes the voice. But then Storm is caught and a hit is put on him. More thugs are sent to his home where they kill him and his wife and kid.But there's a catch. Storm isn't quite dead but in a coma and after seven years he wakes up in a hospital where the thugs arrive to finish him off. How they manage to find out that he's alive and well is unknown to me. Storm manages to save himself and a cute nurse Andy Stewart Kelly LeBrock and they decide to take shelter in Andy's cottage where Storm heals himself by inserting fine needles into his skin and practices his Aikido.He soon realizes that a corrupt senator William Sadler put the hit on him and he decides to take him down along with a crooked cop Andrew Bloch who's involved in the scheme.Seagal is effective here as the copturnedcrusader but his character is less convincing than his Nico Toscani in his earlier feature film Above the Law 1988. Perhaps the best fight sequence happens at a liquor store robbery where Seagal takes on four thugs.There are some strong performances from the supporting actors. But Kelly LeBrock who gets second billing needed more in her role as the nurse but it is quite obvious that she was placed into the film because she was Seagal's wife at the time. We don't get to know much about her character and we almost feel like she has a thankless role here.William Sadler is hateful in his role as the corrupt senator and Frederick Coffin is convincing as Seagal's expartner who holds something dear to Seagal. Something I feel I should not reveal.Hard to Kill is not up to par with the earlier Above the Law or Under Siege 1992. Seagal's first two films were good efforts but then he shifted down to less enjoyable roles in movies that considered placing large amounts of graphic violence and martial arts combat into his movies in order for them to become a big hits like his later film Marked for Death 1990.Hard to Kill works as an entertainment the martial arts sequences are convincing in spite of its preposterous plotting hero wakes up in a coma and defeats the bad guys. It's mildly entertaining but compared to some of his worst efforts it's one of Seagal's best.".

CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS! Note that everything that comes out of Steven's mouth is hysterical in any case. For a start his name is Mason Storm. That just about beats Gino Felino and Nico Toscani.Scene  some essais randomly attack a convienience store. The owner jumps out from behind the counter with a baseball bat and says 'I got half a mind to' The lead essai blows him away and replies 'Now you only got half a mind!' Imagine the emphasis starting at the beginning and dwindling neatly away to nothing.Scene  Steven uses his mystic Chinese healing powers to bring him back to full strength after 7 years in a coma. He punches a training post so hard it flies out of the ground. Kelly leBrock says 'Mayson schtorm'. Exactly like that.Scene  Steven throws a grenade he has just mysteriously found in his pocket. There's no line but his face is a picture.Scene  Steven is tracking down the baddies in the governor's mansion. The corrupt cop nervous at Steven's intrusion finds Steven has written 'ANTICIPATION OF DEATH IS WORSE THAN DEATH ITSELF' on the wall in massive letters somehow. The bent copper lifts up the toilet seat in the bathroom to find Steven has written 'YOU'RE NEXT' on the underside of the toilet seat. Oh really has he. Steven then shouts out 'HOWDOESITFEELTOKNOWYOURABOUTTODIE?!' How could he possibly think that was an acceptable way to speak in a movie?The best scene in the movie  Steven is tracking the final villain in his bedroom. He's calling out 'Vernon?' 'Where are you Vernon?' 'Oh you're so god at this Vernon' at random intervals. He then says 'Maybe you're behind this painting'.For a start there is no painting on screen. Secondly how could he possibly be hiding behind a painting? You really have to hear this line to appreciate just how funny it is.And finally of course when Steveo stabs his wife's killer in the neck with a piece of snooker cue it sounds like this Baddie 'Nice moves'. URRRR! AAAGGH! ARRR! Urrrr. Steven That's for my wife F you and die!This movie utterly rules.".

	schema:reviewBody "No matter what your opinion of Steven Seagal's acting abilities or the kinds of material he's ground out you have to admit he has certain advantages over the rest of us that go beyond martial skills. For instance in this story of revenge against a corrupt politician and his dozens of goons Seagal is shot at the beginning and spends seven years in a coma wrapped up in hospital sheets sustained by various tubes and mysterious devices that beep and blink on and off.Yet consider that he suddenly wakes up after seven years in a hospital bed and still sports the rufous bronze of his earlier physical incarnation. And one would think Seagal would be overdrawn at the memory bank but instead he remembers EVERYTHING that put him there. None of this Where am I? crap.I asked myself Self how is it possible for a man to remain brain damaged and comatose and still recover his memory and his motor skills in no time at all? But all I got back was a lot of gibberish about Wallerian degeneration and nodes of Ranvier and extrapyramidal this and that so I gave up trying to make sense of it.Is it really necessary to spell out more of the plot? Seagal wakes up remembering where he's hidden some evidence that will convict a current senator of fraud extortion autosexuality mopery in the first degree and wearing white after Labor Day.The rest of the film takes us through Seagal's attempt to recover the evidence and the senator's thugs trying to prevent him from recovering the evidence. To observe that along the way there is some violence is like saying that a skin flick contains some pornography. Not to worry though. Yes a good friend dies and his wife is shot to pieces but nobody touches Seagal. Seagal unarmed is involved with three knife fights on independent occasions. Well two knife fights really because the last one involves a Chinese chef's knife that looks more like a meat cleaver. Of the dozens of dead and maimed bodies that Seagal's passage through the film generates exactly 34.2 percent are thrown through glass windows. I counted.The villainous senator's campaign slogan is You can take that to the bank. At one point Seagal mutters to himself I'm going to take YOU to the bank senator  the BLOOD BANK. Yet for all the wisecracks amid the mayhem it's a thoughtprovoking story. The thought it provokes is Dear God don't ever let Steven Seagal get mad at me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steven Seagal whether you love him or loathe him he's the martial arts action hero that just won't go away. That's partially the premise of Hard to Kill the 1990 vehicle obviously meant to throw the ponytailed thensixthdegree Aikido black belt into the action foray with Schwarzenegger Stallone and Norris but missed a few steps along the way and it would be another two years after when Seagal would find success in 1992's Under Siege.It's true that Seagal has yet to make a perfect film in his thoroughly uneven and distinguished career but Hard to Kill certainly ranks as one of his best and one of my personal favorite pictures of the actor. Two years after breaking and busting the heads of corrupt CIA agents as Nico Toscani in his electrifying 1988 debut Above the Law Seagal returns not as the ponytailed Toscani but as Mason Storm the most unstoppable cop SOB that ever lived.After getting home movie footage of an aspiring political candidate Bill Sadler conspiring with shadowy underworld types on tape Storm is tracked down by corrupt cops and nameless and faceless goons and they shotgun the unstoppable SOB into a sevenyear coma while also wiping out his wife and young son. O'Malley Frederick Coffin Storm's dedicated Internal Affairs friend whisks him away into a comacare unit under the assumed name of John Doe.Seven years later Storm awakens and with the help of gorgeous nurse Andy Stewart Seagal's then reallife lovestruck wife Kelly Le Brock who manages to catch peaks at our hero's anatomy he trains intensely to regain his strength using the Oriental healing arts renews his Aikido skills and sharpens his eyes with that good ol' policeissue. All this culminating in some very nasty neckbreaking armtwisting action.As somewhat misdirected by Bruce Malmuth and written by Steven McKay Hard to Kill is undoubtedly one of the actor's most competently skilled performances because he's able to rise above the average material and make it his own. The problem may be with Seagal though. He snaps a few wrists and what's this?  he throws out oneliners  most of which are quite corny and fall flat on their face and simply put aren't Seagal's strong points. His strengths are in the armsnapping and fingerbreaking.But still Seagal's fists of fury are at their best because that's what he does best because this time around he's mad and it's wise to not get characters played by Steven Seagal mad. Pretty soon after Storm has regained his skills and strength the corrupt cops and goons that put him into his coma come back to finish the job. And this time he's ready.The action begins to pick up about halfway through and from there on in it's nonstop which is true Seagal fashion if you get my drift. But with Hard to Kill it's the sevenyear Storm and there's no letting up.610".

But with Hard to Kill it's the sevenyear Storm and there's no letting up.610";

That is not saying that this is a masterpiece but it works pretty well due to some really evil bad guys led by William Sadler and the fact that Seagal's character is legitimately out for revenge. Seagal is a cop who has just learned that Sadler an ambitious lawyer with political aspirations is involved with shady cops and highclass crime syndicates. This information will lead to an attempt on Seagal's life which will kill his wife cause their young son to just barely escape death and cause Seagal to go into a coma himself. Of course he awakes some eight years later and his only motivation is to bring all those involved to justice. Works well due to Seagal's performance more than anything else. 3.5 out of 5 stars.".

I was surprised at how violent he was in his older movies. He chokes some guy to death in front of his kid I was like Way to go Seagal. This movie also had a great story line. I'm pretty sure the Kill Bill story line was borrowed from this movie. Lots of gun shooting and bone snapping martial arts. I could watch this movie over and over again. Seagal is hard to kill.

I offer the review and give you the final tally as you'll see on the bottom. Movie Hard To Kill Star Steven Seagal Year 1990 Director Bruce MalmuthAh Seagal. Where would we be without our favorite ponytailed akidoskilled woodenactor? In sissymovie hell that's where. He's brought it to the mantable more than once always bringing the same dish and always threatening to break our neck if we don't eat it. And eat it we do. And love it we do too.Here we have one of Seagal's finer pieces it's first set in 1983. Seagal plays Mason Storm a rogue cop who 'plays by his own rules' which is a theme that one or two of Seagal's characters had. He starts out on the docks surveying some bad dudes. Man remember the docks? ALL the bad guys use to hang there but no more. What better setting than a seedy dock? With ships that carry drugs guns and hookers. And plenty of water to throw the body of the righthandman who's fked up once too many times. But anyways. Mason is doing his thing and catches some politician up to no good with some nogoodknicks. Well he splits and all of a sudden they here him. So after they go however they don't catch.As always he can't trust anyone because he's a rogue cop. Well the badguys find out anyways and come to finish Mason good. Well wouldn't you know it Mason just got done getting busy with his women so he's in his refractory period. Otherwise he could have heard these bad guys coming 10 years ago. So that's why he was unaware until that is as always....it's too quiet. That's how you KNOW some st is going down when ...it's too quiet. TADOW! They bust open the door and lay down some hot lead killing his wife and they assume Mason. His kid who looks exactly like Ben Savage jumps out of a 10 story window like SpiderMan and lives. shrugs He's Seagal's kid alright. Anyways thankfully before all this Mason hid his videocamera in the wall of his kitchen because remember a rogue cop trusts no one so the evidence is safe.Flash forward 7 years later.Mason is laid up in an LA hospital he's got a rad beard and a nurse Andy who's got the hots for him Kelly LeBrock. Who Seagal married. He gets instant man points because the nurse wants him to snap out of it simply because he has a large penis. No truth to the fact that Seagal insisted they put that in. Mason comes out of the coma because he's sick of not killing people and knows that soon they'll be coming for him which they do. So Andy helps him out of there and they crash at her pad. He quickly gets back into akicking mode because atrophy is for sissys.So as it were the crooked politician is now a Senator. This doesn't sit well with Storm as most things don't. So he hooks up with an old friend who had been taking care of his SpiderMan kid and they get some revenge. It's sweet carnage and Storm is never touched. It's as it should be kids.This movie comes with the highest recommendation. As it ranks high in the ManMovie Encyclopedia hitting almost EVERY criteria which has yet to be done. It's mindless good times. It's Seagal baby.Official ManMovie Encyclopedia Count 1Liners 4  Guys BeatUp 18  Guys Killed 18 Swears 21 Boobs 2 Explode 1 SlowMotion Scenes 2 CarChase 1 FootChase 2 Broken Bones 6 Fight at Motel?

All three feature kick butt fighting that usually has Segal kicking some butt with little doubt who the victor is going to be. Which that makes for some pleasing watching the villain get beat up but it kind of takes anyway any tension you might feel watching the film. However this one features some gun play in it that adds to the film as would Marked for Death. This one has Segal as a cop who records a deal that could really do damage to a guy. Well the guy sends some guys to gun down him and his family. However while they are seemingly successful at killing the wife and child Segal's character ends up in a coma and when he wakes up they are promptly back on his heels. Well he uses some nifty healing tricks and soon is on the bad guys heels. Kelly LeBrock of Weird Science fame is in it and plays a nurse and this is like the only other movie that I have seen her in.

From the time Storm and his his wife Felicia and young son Sonny Bonnie Burroughs  Zachary Rosencrantz were gunned down by a gang of corrupt cops at the start of the movie until these same crooked cops attack Storm and his girlfriend nurse Andy Stewart Kelly LeBlock home more then half way into the movie Seagal or Storm was just working out reading Oriental philosophy as well as improving both his body and soul without as much as a bad or violent thought in his mind or heart but the last fifteen or so minutes in the movie like the first ten would more then make up for that very acute deficiency like Officer Mason Storm accurately remarked later in the movie You can take that to the Blood Bank.Gunned down and pronounced dead after him and his family were rubbed out by a gang of dirty cops Mason Storm had some kind of neardeath experience by suddenly coming back to life in the operating room. Alive but in a coma Storm's good friend and fellow cop Let.

	onyx:emotionText "There are Spoilers What surprised me in the movie more then anything else is that Steven Seagal playing coma cop Mason Storm didn't as much as hit much less shoot anyone for almost 50 minutes which has to be a record for him. From the time Storm and his his wife Felicia and young son Sonny Bonnie Burroughs  Zachary Rosencrantz were gunned down by a gang of corrupt cops at the start of the movie until these same crooked cops attack Storm and his girlfriend nurse Andy Stewart Kelly LeBlock home more then half way into the movie Seagal or Storm was just working out reading Oriental philosophy as well as improving both his body and soul without as much as a bad or violent thought in his mind or heart but the last fifteen or so minutes in the movie like the first ten would more then make up for that very acute deficiency like Officer Mason Storm accurately remarked later in the movie You can take that to the Blood Bank.Gunned down and pronounced dead after him and his family were rubbed out by a gang of dirty cops Mason Storm had some kind of neardeath experience by suddenly coming back to life in the operating room.

	schema:reviewBody "For MY money... this is the best Seagal's film. I remember vividly it was perhaps 1991 or 1992 when I saw this film me a little kid just got the film from video store it was some pirate dark crappy copy I almost tought that Seagal was black! Kidding OK... Also this was the first Seagal film I ever saw even before Above The Law Nico was next afterwards. Well as a kid you like a lot of things... and you just wait for the action scenes and a good fight.Years later I saw this film again and I bought a DVD than I sat down and watched it... I enjoyed every minute of it. I give this film 8 stars out of 10 because Steven Seagal in his own element a tall dark with quiet husky voice angry eyes classic pony tail NO ACTING at all! That is superb! I think that Seagal has created heh read this created  one of the most badass characters ever! Black clothes white shirts of his damn! That was really something in those days. But this character stayed pinned for Seagal for the rest of his career. A tough guy one man army that seeks revenge for the murder of his wife kids girlfriend friend parents dog a pet parrot neighbor his father's brother's cousin's nephew's former room mate and so on... But here that was quite original and great for Seagal. I'm telling you Seagal is the legend of martial artsseeking revenge films no other martial art actor could have such fine hahaahahahha face expressions to show his painful and sad emotions like Seagal ahaahahaha!!! OK OK... Other actors a good addition to this film Kelly LeBrock wow what a hottie there was something funny about her she tried to have some kind of British accent but it didn't work for her at all she was raised in London she was there just to look sexy for her that time husband  Seagal himself what a couple! William Sadler a calmed villain with very intense face he was quite OK a fine bad guy nothing too special or charismatic he was solid. Frederick Coffin as Seagal's partner in the film perhaps the only normal and brave good guy in the entire film OK and from all others Branscombe Richmond as Axel a supporting bad guy who had a good fight with Seagal in the film.Story is classic solid and relaxing a classic revenge action film. Nothing to report here. Script was also OK a fine solid script with no exceptions.Also I loved the music. Michael David Frank composed really low budget score but it was really awesome and badass. Combining some kind of slow rock music and Japanese music instruments he created really good score. Especially score Meditation and Training that was a real martial art training song awesome! And a Just passing by that presents SeagalLeBrock sex scene that was hot man! The main theme is also great.I don't know what to say more... this is a real action film! Watch it!".

Segal takes the only option available to him he plays it straight.I think he succeeds in advancing the genre but these films are boring just another brick. Unless. Unless you have been following Kelly LeBrock from her Women in Red' days. I think the ability to look good on the screen is a matter of acting. It is amazing to me how few women do look terrific on film and are also bad actresses in other important respects. Kelly achieves this.

He then goes home to his beautiful wife and perfect children whom he prays with before making love to his beautiful wife. Now we have a group of killers who break in and achieve their goal in regard to the beautiful wife send Seagal into a 7year coma but are completely given the slip by a sixyear old child.The official version is that he is now dead as that is safer for him !. The patient is renamed John Doe so as not to draw attention. Seven years later John Doe suddenly comes out of his coma as you do. The first thing he sees is beautiful nurse Andy Stewart Kelly Le Brock. He has grown a fake beard but has not lost any muscle tone. Impressive.LeBrock has a strange accent. I guess that is what comes from being the daughter of a FrenchCanadian father and an Irish mother born in New York and raised in London. She is slightly better at acting than Seagal but that isn't saying much.Now the bad men have long memories and return to kill people in the hospital. Well everyone except Seagal and LeBrock because even fresh out of a sevenyear coma this pair are too smart for an armed professional killer.So now Seagal sets about his recovery in a beautiful house not acquired on a nurse's salary  she is housesitting. Acupuncture new age mumbo jumbo set to an irritating soundtrack. I fast forwarded at this point even through the inevitable SeagalLeBrock love scene. Purlease By the time the action starts over an hour in but it felt longer we are all too fed up to care. I'm sorry but I think your contractor's doing a lousy job. He isn't the only one love.There is no humour in this film no understanding of how ridiculous it is. Unless you count the unintentional humour of I'm gonna take you to the bank  the blood bank! I expected the film to be average and a bit of a product of its time. But it is far worse than that. It is a real turkey. I wondered if it had ever been nominated for anything.

	schema:reviewBody "Not since Commando has a more laugh inducing action film come along. Don't get me wrong you can sit through this thing without looking at your watch but not always in a good way.  The flick is not as outlandish as Commando but it gets up there.  It all begins when Seagal captures a future senator on camera being naughty.  Crooked cops overhear him talking to a cop buddy gun that guy down then head to Seagals.  As he's feasting on his wife's chest the bad dudes burst in and blow everyone away.  Seagal isn't quite dead and comatizes for seven years.  When he awakens word spreads and several incompetent henchman start after him only to meet with demises.  LeBrock resurfaces in films for the first time in awhile and admiring the size of Seagal's wang goes on the run with him.  Luckily she's housesitting a huge estate where they can hide out and he can retrain himself.  The death of his wife must've hit him hard as only a day later he's plugging LeBrock on a workout mat.  Thus let the huge grins begin at this point in the film.  Seagal with his I'm gonna take you to the bank...the blood bank! to a bad guy on a tv screen after the estate is turned into Swiss cheese LeBrock quipping Ahh I 'foegot' to 'loke' the 'doe'! Seagal destroying a wall in his old home for a video camera and telling the owner she needs a better contractor or even at the beginning of the film unneccessarily twisting a baddie's foot till it breaks.  Can you say police brutality?  It all ends with a showdown at Mr. Evil's mansion with lots of Friday the 13th style killings I don't remember one guy being shot.  Pool cues in the throat necks broken guns shoved in mouths. Everything's tied up nice and neat with a cop assuring him We've seen the tape.  We know you were setup when in fact it's never shown how the audio and videoon seperate tapes no lessgets to the much mentioned late LA newsman Jerry Dunphy.

	onyx:emotionText "Not since Commando has a more laugh inducing action film come along. Don't get me wrong you can sit through this thing without looking at your watch but not always in a good way.  The flick is not as outlandish as Commando but it gets up there.  It all begins when Seagal captures a future senator on camera being naughty.  Crooked cops overhear him talking to a cop buddy gun that guy down then head to Seagals.  As he's feasting on his wife's chest the bad dudes burst in and blow everyone away.  Seagal isn't quite dead and comatizes for seven years.  When he awakens word spreads and several incompetent henchman start after him only to meet with demises.  LeBrock resurfaces in films for the first time in awhile and admiring the size of Seagal's wang goes on the run with him.  Luckily she's housesitting a huge estate where they can hide out and he can retrain himself.  The death of his wife must've hit him hard as only a day later he's plugging LeBrock on a workout mat.  Thus let the huge grins begin at this point in the film.  Seagal with his I'm gonna take you to the bank...the blood bank! to a bad guy on a tv screen after the estate is turned into Swiss cheese LeBrock quipping Ahh I 'foegot' to 'loke' the 'doe'! Seagal destroying a wall in his old home for a video camera and telling the owner she needs a better contractor or even at the beginning of the film unneccessarily twisting a baddie's foot till it breaks.  Can you say police brutality?  It all ends with a showdown at Mr. Evil's mansion with lots of Friday the 13th style killings I don't remember one guy being shot.  Pool cues in the throat necks broken guns shoved in mouths. Everything's tied up nice and neat with a cop assuring him We've seen the tape.  We know you were setup when in fact it's never shown how the audio and videoon seperate tapes no lessgets to the much mentioned late LA newsman Jerry Dunphy.  This thing is also a huge exercise in narcissism with Seagal's endless training scenes replete with burning sticks shoved in his back while he meditates the already mentioned length of his wang and his narroweyed whispering acting style.

And as ever a couple of rebels try to break free from these chains....Robert Duval THX1138 goes through withdrawal symptoms as he stops the pillpopping gets his libido back and makes love to his mate LUH Maggie McOmie. In a CCT governed environment these felonies don't go unnoticed and THX1138 is charged with sexual deviancy and drug abstinence. It soon comes clear that his sentence will be death and his body used for organ transplantation.Naturally Duval and other inmates of the 'detention unit' decide to escape through the labyrinth of tunnels and with about the only action in the entire film in futuristic cars all the while the soulless robot policemen in pursuit use pleasant prerecorded warnings.I'd not seen or heard of THX1138 until looking up George Lucas on the IMDb. Then I wondered if a snippet of memory from decades ago of a nude couple in a huge white void being approached by robots was one of the very same. And yes so it was and is. I don't know when or where I'd seen it before but the pertinent thing was that it had imprinted something indelible into my psyche.Which is a mark of a good film. Not the chases at the end which to many seem to be the only bits worthy of mention. To me it is the minimalist arthouse sets that are both the most disturbing and memorable of rows and rows of technicians and lab assistants. The story now has been used a lot by now so that it's hardly original but back 41 years ago yes! almost as old as I am it must have painted a very chilling picture indeed.It's also quite a dour solemn picture contrast that to say 'Logan's Run' that at least some semblance of freedom on the outside that the couple had sampled and wanted to bring back to their City. I won't spoil those who've not seen THX how code no. 1138 fares and whether he finds freedom or not.Overall a sobering intelligent and superbly designed film rather than a great epic farreaching odyssey that Lucas was to move onto of course. There are big hints at Lucas' genius at work here this being his debut release such as the robotic policemen and the ideas that he was to take into Star Wars.One then for the George Lucas fan club and for scifi enthusiasts. Mainstream audiences may well be a bit bored and baffled. The script is often confusing with either nothing said and visuals only to tell us what's going on or as with the rantings of Donald Pleasance in the Detention Unit distracting and unnecessary to the story. These faults aside this is a good scifi film one to jostle the mind and a good grounding from which Lucas made such an epic career.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has been seen by most film buffs many many years ago on late night TV. If you are like me it was an interesting film purely as a reference point for a young George Lucas. If you remembered it at all it was for the use of white space and the long periods during which almost nothing discernible happens.Well it is almost 35 years later 35 YEARS! and for reasons best known to film and DVD marketers George Lucas has pulled it out of the vaults. Instead of just transferring the original print to new film stock Lucas has recut several critical scenes added a tasteful bit of CGI zipped up the sound track and film score and best of all turned it into the best reason yet for digital projection. Whether this is the original version he had in his head as a 26yearold or one that he has fleshed out over the years is sort of beside the point. What is on the screen now is definitely worth your 10.Yes it is still a bit tedious at times in a '2001 A Space Odyssey' kind of way and yes the plot holes and infamous continuity issues are still there.But Wow! The plot is a weird stew in which an allegorical Adam and Eve story is crossed with 'Brave New World.' The Catholic act of confession will never be the same after you see it reimagined here. The crystal clear cinematography is a revelation. The characters' multiple layers are wonderful. Donald Pleasence's performance as the wouldbe leaderrebel is downright creepy. The way the camera lingers on a scene rather than quick cutting for effect is a welcome relief. This is adult subject matter and it is not what you expect out of Lucas. You have to ask why he didn't pursue themes like this in later films. Who knows maybe the upcoming Darth Vader fest will return us to the dark side. Be forewarned this is not a casual film that you can sit back and munch popcorn while it plays out in front of you. This is definitely arthouse fare by a young director finding his chops.Many of the message boards and most of the reviews of this film point out how many elements carry over to later Lucas films. C3PO the climactic chase scene drones in service to masters etc. For me the touchstone is not for Lucas but for the Executive Producer Francis Ford Coppola. Many of the themes explored in THX show up in Coppola's 'The Conversation' three years later. Gene Hackman's Harry Caul character is a clone of Robert Duvall's loner forced to confront a faceless progenitor. See if you don't agree.Though they are releasing the film to theaters ahead of the DVD release the place to see it is in a theater with digital projection. Similar to 'Lawrence of Arabia' much of the action takes place in the far corners of the scene and I can't imagine seeing this on anything less than a very large HDTV screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first big screen commercial film of George Lucas 'THX 1138' is now back in a remade production. I did not yet form a clear opinion about directors revisiting their films decades after the original production. It's certainly their right to do it but I cannot refrain from suspecting that this shows some sort of dilution of their creative force. In other words I would rather prefer George Lucas doing something completely new rather then redoing old films of his. However 'THX 1138' is a visionary movie almost a masterpiece. I liked it. It is one of the first Orwellian films in describing a world of the future controlled by an omnipresent mindcontrol machine. These theme means a lot of me and for many people who have spent part of their lives in a system that tried to create 'a new man' by using a system of control and repression that was targeting towards suppression of individual freedom and personality. What is however very strong in 'THX 1138' is the visual quality of the world created by Lucas. This is what cinema is for this is what real art is about  creating a new world from existing materials transporting the viewers in an alternate world of the future using the cinema art means. Although realized about 20 years before computer graphics in films the vision is fresh and impressing. An ageless Robert Duvall does here one of the best roles of his career. Donald Pleasance is a very good counterpart. I liked very much Maggie McOmie how does it come that this film did not launch her in a star career? It actually looks like this is the only film she did according to IMDb.The extra features on the DVD are interesting and bring a lot of new information for fans of science fiction of the 70s films and of Lucas. The film itself gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.".

What is however very strong in 'THX 1138' is the visual quality of the world created by Lucas. This is what cinema is for this is what real art is about  creating a new world from existing materials transporting the viewers in an alternate world of the future using the cinema art means. Although realized about 20 years before computer graphics in films the vision is fresh and impressing. An ageless Robert Duvall does here one of the best roles of his career. Donald Pleasance is a very good counterpart. I liked very much Maggie McOmie how does it come that this film did not launch her in a star career? It actually looks like this is the only film she did according to IMDb.The extra features on the DVD are interesting and bring a lot of new information for fans of science fiction of the 70s films and of Lucas. The film itself gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.";

	schema:reviewBody "George Lucas has a fairly small body of work as a director and most of it is fairly simplistic except this film. Lucas' first feature is steeped in the French New Wave mode of philosophical musings and strange visuals. Unfortunately that doesn't necessarily make for an exciting film. However there are enough intriguing ideas to sustain some interest although you do have to fight off the boredom factor.Lucas is and has always been a visual filmmaker. He is not great with actors and his films aren't noted for their performances except American Graffiti. That was a more personal film and Lucas probably had a clearer idea of the characters thoughts and emotions. Here emotions are stifled by drugs and the wooden performances reinforce this.According to Lucas the film is the story of escape told in three different forms an escape from the drugs that keep people in check an escape from a prison with no visible barriers and an escape from the city itself. The final sequence contains most of the action but is marred by the budget constraints.Robert Duvall commands attention when he is on screen but you never really feel like you get to know THX. Donald Pleasance as SEN provides a nice turn as the antagonist of sorts. The rest of the cast is fairly forgettable with only minor moments. The philosophical underpinnings of the film are often lost in pretension the same flaw which hit the Matrix in its sequels. Lucas could have delivered his message in a far simpler fashion probably with greater result. Still the film does have its interesting moments and memorable ideas and images. The robot police are quite chilling although they are used sparingly. The white prison is quite unsettling as well. The final escape is the most riveting sequence of the film.The new DVD has Lucas' trademark tinkering. Only this time the alterations help to add scope to the film. The city scenes are expanded to add complexity to the environment that was missing in the original. There are no fundamental story changes as in the Star Wars Special Edition Greedo shoots first. The commentary and featurettes help the viewer to understand the intent of the story and help to establish the context in which it was made. Lucas makes a statement that he would like to return to this kind of film. Given the disappointing nature of the Star Wars prequels I wouldn't mind seeing Lucas take another crack at a more cerebral scifi story. My only request is that he works with a great scriptwriter.".

If you can find a copy of the original undoctored THX1138 that's the one to watch.Aw man. This film had so much promise. It starts out abstract minimalist challenging and poetic. It gets deeper more bizarre and artistic. But then it suddenly degenerates into a cheap action flick with hitech car chases and it ends with the most simplistic meaningless resolution. Total letdown.It's as if Hamlet's famous soliloquy wentTo be or not to be that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows... and CARS! and MOTORCYCLES! and fast whizzy things BAM!! The End!!!!I suspect that Lucas began this film with a fantastic premise  with artistic intent but then he suddenly realized hey wait I don't know what I'm doing. How do I end this damn thing? True it's an interesting dystopian drama. George must've been reading a lot of Kurt Vonnegut when he filmed this. Yes it's very much in the style of 2001 A Space Odyssey. George must've been watching a lot of Kubrick. But that's where it ends. George fails to present anything original. And as it unravels into a simplistic action flick in the last 20 minutes you realize that George has been fooling you for the last hour and a half. Literally it ended and I said out loud Uh... is this where Lucas got bored and stopped filming? Still I have to give him an A for effort. Like most of the other reviewers I was blown away by the fact that George Lucas was capable of this type of abstract poetry. With the exception of those cheezy action scenes which I'm sure Lucas added ex post facto like he did with Star Wars  CGI it is reminiscent of the old Michael Crichton films Andromeda Strain Westworld with maybe a dash of Rollerball.The early 70s was a wonderful time for scifi because all the directors were scrambling to emulate Kubrick's masterpiece. But like this film the effort ran out of gas and eventually slumped into plotdriven cheese. What is so frustrating is that Lucas could have made something truly great if he had just followed up on Donald Pleasence's cryptic ramblings midway. Unfortunately he chose to go in the other direction and the film ends with no dialogue for the last 20 minutes. Instead we get a lot of ex post facto CGI special effects and chase scenes. What a shame. We literally see before our eyes the unfortunate turning point of Lucas' career.In space sometimes a nebulafor all its swirling promisenever quite consolidates itself into a star.

	schema:reviewBody "THX 1138 as we all probably know was the first official film of George Lucas. It was made largely while he was still a film student and it was actually produced by Francis Ford Coppola. For a first film it is a rather impressive effort but it's hardly 2001 A Space Odyssey.The film centers around the life of THX 1138 who is played by Robert Duvall. He is a man living in a futuristic society where everyone is drugged up nobody is allowed to have sex and big brother always seems to be watching. Citizens are expected to just take their meds and conform. Order is kept by a bunch of chromeplated robots dressed as police officers. They speak softly but carry big sticks to keep people in line. People are constantly being reminded over loud speakers to increase productivity and remain costefficient. There is some semblance of religion but it's hardly compelling as a source of strength to these future citizens. The world which we are shown seems to be entirely underground and synthetic. Emotion is not encouraged and the meds help with that aim.We see THX go through his usual routines. He appears to work at an assembly plant where the police robots are constructed. It's dangerous work and we see a meltdown occur in a nearby facility in one of the best early scenes of the film. The work is apparently too stressful for a person to do it unless they're highly sedated. THX 1138 is experiencing some personal problems the society cannot tolerate. He and his female roommate have been going off their meds and having sexual relations. They are about as in love as two people can be in this strange world and the powers that be quickly try to reprogram THX 1138 and take him away from his woman. All of this happens within the first half hour. What follows is mostly ponderous and the story drags somewhat.THX 1138 is placed in a virtual prison with others who cannot seem to conform. One of these persons is played by Donald Pleasance. He has designs to lead the others out of their prison but we find that he can only talk the talk. When the possibility of escape is presented to him he panics and tries to get back inside the only world he knows. Our hero THX 1138 simply keeps his wits about him and climbs out of the city to a freedom we can only speculate about.The film has its strengths. Considering the limited budget it had the film is an absolute treat in terms of its appearance. The color white is certainly dominant in the sterile society these people live in. Lucas even at this early stage of his career showed his ability to dazzle the audience with sound. The film has a unique kinetic energy in some scenes but then goes flat as a pancake in others. The CGI that Lucas added for the director's cut is unnecessary but pleasant to look at.The story needed some buffering. Even at 88 minutes you may be tempted to hit the FF button. There are a few scenes that really don't amount to much and many questions are left unanswered. Lucas obviously had 2001 in mind when you consider some of the ambiguity we are presented with. The conclusion of THX 1138 is in some ways a rebuttal to the ascension of man's intellect we saw in 2001. In THX 1138 the objective seems to be for the hero to break away from the futuristic society and retreat back to a more primitive existence.I guess I'd give it 7 of 10 stars. What we needed was more plot added not more CGI images! The Hound.".

	schema:headline " Dull and disappointing science fiction flick";
	schema:reviewBody "George Lucas will of course always be remembered for his masterpiece the Star Wars series and for good reason as he hasn't done much else. While American Graffiti was a nice nonStar Wars film for the man this one THX1138 certainly isn't. For a man who made such a big impact on the SciFiFantasy genres with Star Wars you would expect his first foray into those territories to be at least an acceptable film but this isn't. Plodding along with an astute dullness it's hard to be left anything but cold by this film. It's obvious that Lucas wanted to throw in as much SciFi as possible into the film and this has resulted in the movie resembling a mishmash of science fiction orientated sequences which comes very much at the expense of the story. The thin plot follows two people living in the distant future where sex and love in general have been banned who have found themselves in jail for breaking the laws of the place they live in. They then decide to breakout with the help of some guy they meet in there.Lucas has seen fit to give the film a style similar to that of SciFi masterpiece 2001 A Space Odyssey and this stylestealing is somewhat ironic considering that this is the same man that would go on to revitalise the genre six years later with his masterpiece. The people in the film all sport white uniforms and shaved heads and while this enables Lucas to present a regimented vision of the future that compliments the plot and style of the movie it also means that none of the actors stand out and since all of them even the great Robert Duvall and the normally solid Donald Pleasance find themselves with not a lot to do it can't be said that this is an actor's movie. The way that the plot meanders and never really allows the audience the plug into it is the film's major downfall. Unlike Star Wars which relied on storytelling to be a success this movie relies more on atmosphere and visuals and while Lucas can do these things he's far too set on doing them and this kills the movie. The same thing happened with the first two Star Wars prequels. Overall  a major disappointment!".

	onyx:emotionText "George Lucas will of course always be remembered for his masterpiece the Star Wars series and for good reason as he hasn't done much else. While American Graffiti was a nice nonStar Wars film for the man this one THX1138 certainly isn't. For a man who made such a big impact on the SciFiFantasy genres with Star Wars you would expect his first foray into those territories to be at least an acceptable film but this isn't. Plodding along with an astute dullness it's hard to be left anything but cold by this film. It's obvious that Lucas wanted to throw in as much SciFi as possible into the film and this has resulted in the movie resembling a mishmash of science fiction orientated sequences which comes very much at the expense of the story. The thin plot follows two people living in the distant future where sex and love in general have been banned who have found themselves in jail for breaking the laws of the place they live in.

	schema:headline " The original film is intriguing but George should have kept his hands off of it.";
	schema:reviewBody "For his feature directorial debut Lucas elaborated on one of his celebrated student films THX 1138EB to present a cautionary scifi thriller about the dangers of complacency mindless consumerism and deadened emotions. In a stark world perhaps Earth's future Duvall plays a worker in an assembly line in which android police are manufactured. He has a platonic female roommate takes copious drugs which are mandated by the powers that be watches limited holographic programming and buys worthless items which are disposed of faster than it takes to buy them. The entire society operates at this level with occasional troublemakers placed in prison or destroyed altogether. One day Duvall's roomie McOmie decides to cease taking drugs and starts to deprive him of his own resulting in feelings between them which are not only revolutionary and new but also against the law! A fellow citizen Pleasence takes an interest in Duvall and wishes to join him in his enlightened state but eventually the three of them are apprehended and duly punished for their transgressions. Duvall however may not be so easy to defeat. This is an unusual role for Duvall and for this stage in his career a rare opportunity to enjoy a leading role. He is solid throughout and becomes a person worth rooting for against the everoppressive society in which he is trapped. Pleasence is also good though his role is more of a supporting one. This was the only film McOmie made for decades and she has a striking unusual quality. It's a part that required more than a little bravery on her part and she acquits herself well. The fact that she is so unknown only adds to the aura of her work here. Colley appears late as an ally to Duvall. His towering presence and goodnatured persona help give a bit of a lift to the proceedings. Haig has a small role as a degenerate prisoner being held in the same area as Duvall and others. There's a striking visual design to the film and an even more impressive aural design. The world that the characters reside in is elaborately depicted within the constrained budget yet not very fully explained making the viewer pay close attention to things and fill in the blanks frequently. It's a challenging piece to take in for the uninitiated but it has thought provoking themes. In truth totalitarian types of government full of control and aesthetic denial are not new to science fiction and weren't in 1971 but there is enough individuality to this to capture the attention. The audacious decision to make everyone shave his or her! head and to use white very heavily make this a very stylized viewing experience. There is also a bit of a flaw in that many freshly shaved heads have evidence of tan lines something that would not be present in this situation. What's interesting is that Lucas felt the need to warn of a society in which people become overly reliant on video entertainment cybersex pharmaceuticals needless buying and impersonality and yet we are far closer to that in 2009 than when the film was released! The bad news is that Lucas with endless money and resources at his disposal is insistent upon going back over his previous films and tweaking them enhancing them and improving them while making the originals at least in this case uneasy to find. In 2004 he added CGI effects to this motion picture and reedited it considerably. He replaced some feral animals with wholly computerized versions which stick out like a sore thumb no matter what money was spent to do it. It's not only annoying and unnecessary but insulting offensive and retroactively anachronistic since most moviegoers with a brain know that such technology was not available at the time. It's jarring distracting and reprehensible whether or not it is his to do with what he wants. Can audiences not be trusted to accept the film as it was originally presented taking the effects in context? In attempting to change history he is guilty of the type of manipulation that the film was trying to speak out against in the first place! So while his original work was arresting and fascinating if maybe a tad crude along the edges at times the redux is appalling.".

Personally I think that George Lucas should've went into this direction instead of the direction he chose with his Star Wars films which many legions of geeks would argue is his best work. But THX1138 is significantly a different kind of film experience altogether.It's not overblown or over budget and it doesn't feature any cloyingly cute or overtly annoying characters to make millions of dollars to merchandise. I can't imagine a Robert Duvall THX1138 action figure but if this film was made after Star Wars instead trust me Lucas would have probably sold it.Lucas has made a fortune from a franchise of scifi films that are silly and repetitive of themselves but with THX1138 his first film he managed to create something that he has never come close to doing again. If it wasn't for the style design and fx of this film THERE WOULD BE NO STAR WARS FILMS PERIOD.It's a shame this film even after the release of the director's cut some thirty odd years later is still underrated and overlooked. Maybe now that it's on DVD it will find a new larger audience of appreciative fans.I still prefer the original version over the director's cut but I still love this film.BE HAPPY...BUY MORE...this film is a must see!!!".

Mankind lives under the surface of Earth where lifelike androids carry out survey and control of slaved people with drugs used to limit their will and they confess at confessional booths . The story centers around a man and a woman who rebel against their rigidly controlled society under command of robotlike where sex is prohibited and love is the ultimate crime . There in a totalitarian future society in which everything looks the same  a man whose daily work is a mechanical routine attempts to rebel by falling in love . As a valiant who handles radioactive materials in a factory begins to have thoughts of rebellion and love for a fellow member . Who controls the present controls the past . Dystopian as well as imaginative story which a futuristic  staterun society controlled by a superior robotized intelligence and it packs a polemic denounce to totalitarianism . THX 1138 is a workmanlike rendition based on an interesting screenplay from George Lucas and Walter Murch that captures the desolation and misery within a terrible future world . This thoughtprovoking as well as visually breathtaking film boasts vicious robots  intelligent but submitted humans who attempt to flee and a trick ending that is intriguing and unique . George Lucas has worked the title of this film  or parts of it in some of his other film  in American Graffiti 1973 the license plate of one car is THX 138. In Star Wars 1977 a reference is made to prison cell 1138  the cinema sound certification his company developed is called THX. Impressive as well as evocatively atmospheric production design has been rendered with meticulous attention to period detail  the underground chase near the end was shot in a notyetcompleted segment of the subway system in San Francisco  in addition  numerous scenes were inspired by Japanese theater design and graphics . Very good acting by Robert Duvall as a human slave who finds himself stuck in a rebellion of the Earth of the future  he is a tragic figure who dares to fall in love within a totalitarian society where emotions are outlawed . Supported by Donald Pleasence who is perfect  as usual . Furthermore  brief appearances from Sid Haig  Ian Wolfe  Don Pedro Colley  Johnny Wissmuller Jr and David Ogden Stiers's film debut . The picture is rated  PG Parents Guide  for violence  nudism and some strong scenes .George Lucas's original plan was to shoot the film in Japan  but Francis Ford Coppola did not give Lucas enough money in the film's budget to take the entire production to Japan  the feature was shot in San Francisco and Los Angeles . Adequate as well as strange musical score by Lalo Schifrin  usual composer of the seventies  and the music playing during the end credits is the first movement from Johann Sebastian Bach's St. Matthew Passion BWV 244 . And many of the electronic sound effects heard throughout the film are derived from telephone dial tones pitchshifted and electronically modified . The motion picture was well produced by Francis Ford Coppola  his first film for American Zoetrope  and compellingly directed by George Lucas  preStar Wars  and he considers to be one of the greatest achievements of his career . This film was made as a result of George Lucas's student film short project at USC being an expanded of a prizewinning featurette . George Lucas  subsequently  would go on with big successes such as American Graffiti and many others . This is a superior sciencefiction movie that will appeal to cinema buffs and interested in to watch an example of the kind of work filmmaker Lucas was doing at the beginning .".

	schema:headline " One of the best of its subgenre and probably the best movie George Lucas has yet read ever directed";
	schema:reviewBody "Sure Star Wars is a lot of fun. It's a great way to waste some time or to keep people entertained at a party or something. However it's unbelievable how crazy people have become about it. In fact people are so insanely in love with it that they actually convinced themselves that The Phantom Menace was a good movie. Now that's the power of persuasion! Let's travel back in time three entire decades. In 1970 George Lucas made his first feature after graduating from film school. Francis Ford Coppola two years away from capturing one of the greatest films ever made helped young Lucas produce it. It is THX 1138 which is the name given to the film's hero played by Robert Duvall who was not yet extraordinarily famous perhaps people would recognize him from Robert Altman's MASH in which he had costarred earlier that year. The setting is a postapocalyptic underground complex.I have to throw out a caveat right here I'm a sucker for postapocalyptic movies and generally like all of them. And in my opinion this is one scifi subgenre where the cheaper a production is the better it is. My favorite ever is L.Q. Jones' 1975 cult classic A Boy and His Dog. Heck I even liked Robert Altman's Quintet quite a bit. What I like about these three films what they have in common is that they don't spend a lot of time explaining their backstories. A Boy and His Dog gives a brief account of the major event in its history but does not explain what came afterwards. THX 1138 is surely much more widely known than either A Boy and His Dog and Quintet simply because of its creator. Lucas' film gives us hardly anything to establish its setting in time. Of course as conventions would determine we all assume that it was some nuclear holocaust or unbearable pollution. But Lucas really gives us little information about what is going on. When subgenres get so specific like this where one film is so close to its predecessors whether those predecessors are films or even novels no one could mistake the 1984ish tones of the film the screenwriter and director really don't have to tell us much.So if these films are so close why should anyone like them? Well because you're not supposed to rely wholly on the plot for the films' worth. This is cinema not literature. What we have to pay attention to is well one the narrative structure that is how the story develops not what the story is that's a part of literature too but it's a good variable in this genre. Two these stories do differ in their settings which is a major part of the authors' creativity. Three cinematic techniques. Well THX 1138 can be credited with having a very good structure. It does progress linearly but as I said above it gives just the tiniest hints of what's actually happening in the film and what the characters are thinking. There is very little dialogue and a lot of it is difficult to decipher. The setting George Lucas has great success here. He has all the sets as white as possible and these sets mostly consist of hallways. Very cheap and very effective. This comes in a lot if you're going to discuss the cinematography. Lucas also makes his characters wear white scientific outfits often covering everything but the characters' heads or faces. In possibly the best sequence in the film Duvall is put in a prison that has no visible walls or corners or doors or anything. It's just pure white and it's simply deafening. And since the prisoners are wearing white too it looks like they're all lost in some sort of hideous limbo. Lucas also creates the best visual compositions in his entire career. Star Wars is rather bland visually. Nice colors I suppose but there's hardly any attention paid to composition. I was lucky enough to see THX 1138 in widescreen and Lucas very carefully composed the shots. He's especially good here at posing his actors in an artistic way while not making it obvious that he had deep artistic intentions when directing them.To tell you the truth I couldn't relate what actually happens in this story at all. I have to blame part of that on my sleepiness tonight. However even when I didn't fully understand it I recognize it as a great movie a masterpiece perhaps. 1010.".

Well because you're not supposed to rely wholly on the plot for the films' worth. This is cinema not literature. What we have to pay attention to is well one the narrative structure that is how the story develops not what the story is that's a part of literature too but it's a good variable in this genre. Two these stories do differ in their settings which is a major part of the authors' creativity. Three cinematic techniques. Well THX 1138 can be credited with having a very good structure. It does progress linearly but as I said above it gives just the tiniest hints of what's actually happening in the film and what the characters are thinking. There is very little dialogue and a lot of it is difficult to decipher. The setting George Lucas has great success here. He has all the sets as white as possible and these sets mostly consist of hallways. Very cheap and very effective. This comes in a lot if you're going to discuss the cinematography. Lucas also makes his characters wear white scientific outfits often covering everything but the characters' heads or faces. In possibly the best sequence in the film Duvall is put in a prison that has no visible walls or corners or doors or anything. It's just pure white and it's simply deafening. And since the prisoners are wearing white too it looks like they're all lost in some sort of hideous limbo. Lucas also creates the best visual compositions in his entire career. Star Wars is rather bland visually. Nice colors I suppose but there's hardly any attention paid to composition. I was lucky enough to see THX 1138 in widescreen and Lucas very carefully composed the shots. He's especially good here at posing his actors in an artistic way while not making it obvious that he had deep artistic intentions when directing them.To tell you the truth I couldn't relate what actually happens in this story at all. I have to blame part of that on my sleepiness tonight. However even when I didn't fully understand it I recognize it as a great movie a masterpiece perhaps. 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "White Dog is often mentioned on lists of alltime most controversial films and there's a good reason for that. Samuel Fuller's film is controversial because it confronts the theme of racism head on and succeeds where modern films such as 'Crash' fail in that it actually makes you think. Rather than actually being 'about' racism White Dog tells a story and lets the themes flow thus meaning that the audience is allowed to see the themes shining through rather than being beaten over the head with them. The film is really clever and is based on a premise that isn't immediately obvious. In fact if it wasn't for a series of little niggles this film would be an absolute masterpiece. The problems with the film are largely down to the execution as Samuel Fuller uses too many closeup shots and the scenes where the title animal attacks in particular suffer from poor editing which means that it's sometimes difficult to tell exactly what's going on and most of the time gave me a headache. Furthermore the plot doesn't move particularly well and the film can seem like it isn't going anywhere at times.It's a good job then that Fuller utilises his themes so well. Racism isn't a subject that interests me generally mostly because of tacky sentimental dross like Crash but the plot here is used in such a way that it's impossible not to be taken in by it. We follow a young aspiring actress that accidentally runs a dog over. After becoming attached to it she decides to take it in but pretty soon the dog attacks someone and she finds out that aside from being a white dog it's also a 'White Dog' a dog used by white people to kill blacks. The main reason why this film is so good is down to the title animal. Here we have an entity that is entirely innocent of its crimes the guilty party being the racist that trained him. By letting us see what the dog is capable of but making sure we know that the dog is only doing what it has been programmed to do ensures that the true horror of racism is allowed to shine through as well as the futility of hatred down to skin colour. Films like White Dog are few and far between here we have a movie that dares to tell a story despite its implications and a movie that forces its audience to think about their own prejudices. It's just sad that we live in a world where films like Crash win Oscars while films like White Dog are banished into obscurity. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "As someone who was raised to abhor racism  any discrimination for that matter maybe there is some truth to the idea that a person's beliefs whether questionable or not all begin with how they are raised. This could very well transfer to the animal kingdom if WHITE DOG is any indication.Just from reading the synopsis of the film I was prepared for a movie that would not be making its points subtly but rather pulling no punches whatsoever. Director Samuel Fuller was always known for telling it like it is as well as maintaining his independence from the Hollywood mainstream. At first Paramount had intended to distribute this movie after owning the rights to Romain Gary's story for years. However I can guess that the powers that be were still very afraid of the adverse reaction WHITE DOG was likely going to generate mainly by people who either had not seen the movie or had misunderstood it. That was why Paramount pulled out before the film's American release and to this day it has not been seen in our theaters.It is thus easily understood why Fuller never made another American film to which I say good for him! because even as liberal as we Americans often claim to be sometimes a certain subject such as that portrayed in WHITE DOG hits a little too close to home. Fuller dared to talk about racism a problem still alive  well even decades after the advent of civil rights without any sugarcoating whatsoever and it was this takenoprisoners approach that meant curtains for the film even before it had a chance. No surprise European audiences  critics loved WHITE DOG and understood the movie for what it was a statement against racism not condoning it. Furthermore Fuller dared to put forth the theory that racism can be taught to another person or in this case animal by careful teaching. Whether or not deprogramming in the opposite direction can happen is unclear. WHITE DOG succeeds by not giving any clearcut answers and that is another reason why Americans probably would not have taken to it well for every message picture we get we expect to see some solutions for the problem. WHITE DOG does not do that.To say WHITE DOG is a film ahead of its time would be an understatement because I do not think even today a movie like this could be greenlighted by a major studio. Coalitions  interest groups would likely protest loudly enough to force WHITE DOG off the screen. Some would say the violence is to blame and yes it IS graphic. But the film does have a PG rating so it is not gore of the highest order. Even when the film did make it on to American cable cuts were made so that the dog merely bit its victims rather than killed them. Others would say the mere plot of the movie itself is hateful enough but sometimes an unvarnished approach to a brutal subject is necessary to get the point across. All I can say is be prepared to have the film's message beat you over the head for I highly doubt Fuller would have done it any other way. It will also cause heated debate  discussion yet another result that Fuller R.I.P. would also have appreciated totally.".

	onyx:emotionText "As someone who was raised to abhor racism  any discrimination for that matter maybe there is some truth to the idea that a person's beliefs whether questionable or not all begin with how they are raised. This could very well transfer to the animal kingdom if WHITE DOG is any indication.Just from reading the synopsis of the film I was prepared for a movie that would not be making its points subtly but rather pulling no punches whatsoever. Director Samuel Fuller was always known for telling it like it is as well as maintaining his independence from the Hollywood mainstream. At first Paramount had intended to distribute this movie after owning the rights to Romain Gary's story for years. However I can guess that the powers that be were still very afraid of the adverse reaction WHITE DOG was likely going to generate mainly by people who either had not seen the movie or had misunderstood it. That was why Paramount pulled out before the film's American release and to this day it has not been seen in our theaters.It is thus easily understood why Fuller never made another American film to which I say good for him! because even as liberal as we Americans often claim to be sometimes a certain subject such as that portrayed in WHITE DOG hits a little too close to home. Fuller dared to talk about racism a problem still alive  well even decades after the advent of civil rights without any sugarcoating whatsoever and it was this takenoprisoners approach that meant curtains for the film even before it had a chance. No surprise European audiences  critics loved WHITE DOG and understood the movie for what it was a statement against racism not condoning it. Furthermore Fuller dared to put forth the theory that racism can be taught to another person or in this case animal by careful teaching. Whether or not deprogramming in the opposite direction can happen is unclear. WHITE DOG succeeds by not giving any clearcut answers and that is another reason why Americans probably would not have taken to it well for every message picture we get we expect to see some solutions for the problem. WHITE DOG does not do that.To say WHITE DOG is a film ahead of its time would be an understatement because I do not think even today a movie like this could be greenlighted by a major studio. Coalitions  interest groups would likely protest loudly enough to force WHITE DOG off the screen. Some would say the violence is to blame and yes it IS graphic. But the film does have a PG rating so it is not gore of the highest order. Even when the film did make it on to American cable cuts were made so that the dog merely bit its victims rather than killed them. Others would say the mere plot of the movie itself is hateful enough but sometimes an unvarnished approach to a brutal subject is necessary to get the point across. All I can say is be prepared to have the film's message beat you over the head for I highly doubt Fuller would have done it any other way. It will also cause heated debate  discussion yet another result that Fuller R.I.P. would also have appreciated totally.";

	schema:reviewBody "Adapted by Fuller and Curtis Hanson from the Romain Gary novel to whom the picture is dedicated WHITE DOG was the iconoclastic director's last Hollywood effort  and one of his most remarkable in my opinion. However due to accusations of racism the film was never released to theaters in the U.S. undaunted Fuller took it to Europe instead!Having watched it twice myself first on Italian TV and now on DivX both viewings compromised by the fullscreen format  since it was originally filmed in Panavision  and the latter even more so by the VHS quality of the source! I have to say that I really don't see it as a racist picture at all. On the contrary the film deals extremely tactfully with its delicate subject matter and nowhere does it condone such views! One perhaps tends to forget that hand in hand with the racial angle the film also tackles another very sensitive issue animal cruelty. This is handled just as effectively particularly in the scene towards the end where the dog's previous redneck owner appears out of the blue to reclaim it.Despite the violence it commits the dog is never portrayed as a 'monster' that should be destroyed like the ones we encounter in conventional horror films. However it does carry undeniable connotations with the genre  notably Robert Louis Stevenson's perennial Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde. Like the leading character of that story the dog seems to register two diverse and entirely opposing personalities  docile protective and even playful with its mistress Kristy McNichol then turning suddenly into an unstoppable beast out for blood whenever a colored person crosses its path! The 'reconditioning' scenes with Paul Winfield are exceptional and really give one an idea of what trained animals have to go through before they finally learn to 'perform'. The rather bleak final scene so typical of Fuller is especially powerful  and poignant. The film is accompanied by a simple yet tremendously effective score by the great Ennio Morricone. From the cast both McNichol and Winfield are superb Burl Ives is admirably cast against type Jameson Parker from the SIMON  SIMON TV series appears as McNichol's boyfriend and there are nice cameos by the likes of veterans Marshall Thompson and Dick Miller director Paul Bartel and even Fuller himself as McNichol's agent.Twentyfive years after the fact it seems that Paramount has had enough time to reconsider its position and accommodate this important motion picture with an official release at long last  which is rumored to be coming via a Criterion DVD no less! I truly hope that we will soon see this fascinating and thoughtprovoking film receive the exposure it so well deserves if anything it ought to be made available for its valid sociological aspects  which it doesn't exploit for sensationalistic value but rather aims for maximum eloquence with a direct realistic style that really shouldn't offend anybody...".

	schema:reviewBody "Deemed too controversial by Paramount in 1982 Samuel Fuller's bare knuckled study of the psychology of racism went virtually unseen for over two decades playing sporadically at film festivals and private screenings until Criterion remastered and rereleased it on DVD in 2008. Fuller was understandably devastated and perplexed by the decision as it was incredibly well received in the countries that actually saw a limited released but it was made in a time when serious and unblinking social commentary was favoured less than greasedup manmountains wielding dual machine guns.From the very start Fuller's movie is an exercise in resourceful simplicity as young actress Julie Sawyer Kristy McNichol hits a white German Shepherd with her car and takes the injured and seemingly innocent animal to the vets for a checkup. The dog's ferocity rears its head early on as it takes down a rapist that breaks in Julie's house and restrains him until the police arrive. Its eagerness to attack is interpreted as protection of its owner but when the hound starts savagely attacking black people it soon becomes clear that this is no ordinary dog. Despite her boyfriend's pleas to put it down before it kills somebody Julie believes that it can be cured of the affliction it was taught from a young age.The first third of the movie plays out like exploitation with the subtlest of satire running through the story almost like the type of movie Larry Cohen used to make only without a flying serpent or mutant baby. The attacks are brutal and wellmade despite its low budget and the movie proceeds almost like a slasher gnasher? as the beast bares its teeth with its coat festooned with blood. The animal is truly terrifying and makes for a chilling movie 'monster'. Yet you see a glimmer of redemption in those sad eyes and Julie does too taking it to animal trainer Carruthers Burl Ives who like everybody else warns her to kill the beast before it kills somebody. One of his workers dog trainer Keys Paul Winfield recognises it as a 'white dog'  one conditioned from a pup to hate black people.It is a this point that White Dog becomes an enthralling and intelligent expose of racism posing far more questions that it quite wisely fails to answer. The pure hatred bred into the animal rings true with humans the kind of ignorant confused and misdirected fury so prevalent in America. The film also asks whether or not this kind of conditioning is curable. Keys certainly tries exposing more and more of his black skin to the dog as they gradually form a bond but the German Shepherd remains unpredictable managing one night to escape its confines and commit an act of pure savagery in the holiest of locations. The film highly suggests that you may remove the racism but the hatred will remain and it's a sobering thought. This is blunt unflinching Bmovie filmmaking that will have you on the edge of your seat as you watch and reflect heavily on its themes afterwards.".

The movie is not about ohh look how cute is that dog. it's about a dog that has been mislead and taught to do the wrong thing. The white dog has been taught to attack black people. As a puppy the dog learned that because he had a bad experience with black person every other black person was the same. However he was just poisoned by the very owner that had a hate for black people. Julie Sawyer one of the main actresses confronts the dog's ex owner and speaks out her mind about how he had done such a hard to the dog.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first watched White Dog I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. I understood that it was a film about racism and that it questions whether or not racism is a treatable or incurable condition. At the time I felt like I needed to just let it soak in to just absorb it all and wrap my thoughts around it.It starts like this a young actress Julie is driving along a dark road and accidentally hits a white German Shepherd dog. After she gets the dog treated at a vet she takes him home whilst trying to find the owners. The dog protects her one night and she decides to adopt it not knowing that the dog was trained to attack African Americans. After realizing that there's something not quite right with the dog she brings him to a dog trainer Carruthers whom at first tells to kill the dog. But another trainer Keys who is African American undergoes the task of retraining the dog.So can the dog be retrained or not? To be completely honest I couldn't completely buy into the story. Yes I find it believable that a dog can be trained in such a way but at the same time the reactions from the characters just threw me off. Take Julie for instance she's rather defensive of a dog that just attacked her coworker. I get that she has an emotional attachment to the dog especially since he protects her from a rapist. But I don't really understand why it doesn't seem to strike her as odd when the dog comes back one night covered in dirt and blood. Don't you think if your dog came home looking like that wouldn't alarm bells start going off in your head? Truthfully I found the film interesting. I wouldn't put it up there with my favorites but at the same time I wouldn't knock it down either. I just wish the characters were a little more developed. But other than that I would suggest it just for the question of whether or not learned hatred can be cured.".

Roman Gary's story is powerful and in the hands of a truly talented director the result could have been explosive.

	schema:reviewBody "I was expecting to see an edgy filmafter all WHITE DOG was pulled from circulation because of its racist message. However I was totally shocked that the film despite a lot of positive reviews turned out to be really really stupid and nothing like the earlier brilliant films of director Sam Fuller. The film is neither edgy nor interestingit's just a silly plot that is rather poorly written and totally unconvincing. Even if it had been a made for TV movie it wouldn't have been especially good or compelling.The film begins with a very young looking Kristy McNichol hitting a white German Shepherd while driving late at night. She takes it to a vet and it survives so she takes it home until she can locate the owner. However the owner never shows and so she keeps the dog. Soon Kristy loves the dog as it's affectionate and saves her from a mad rapist who breaks in her home. So far so goodthe film interested me mildly.However a bit later when the dog turns out to be an insane killer when he sees Black people the film gets a bit silly. It's not that anyone could train a dog to do this that seemed sillybut that after tearing people to pieces Kristy STILL wants to keep the dog and retrain it. Silly but possibleafter all some pet people are nuts I have dogs and cats am a bit touched myself.When she finds an animal trainer Paul Winfield he agrees to help though he says it would be tough. Fine. But later after the dog escapes and tears another Black person to pieces killing him Winfield STILL wants to work with the dog!!! Now no municipality in the world would allow such a dangerous dog to live and the place where Winfield works owned by Burl Ives would be closed down due to lawsuitsbut STILL he takes the dog back to the compound to retrain him. This is dumb but there's also a BIG plot hole herewhat about the dead man?!? You never hear about this poor guy again and you hear about no news stories about the mangling of a Black man in a church!!! This just magically disappears from the plot! To make things worse Fuller uses awful and very very sloppy imagery during this sceneshowing good St. Francis of Assisi the patron saint of animals on the church wall in stained glass above the body of the Black victim is just stupid and way way too obvious. And to top it off about the same time the dog wanders past a pet store where there is a huge ad in the window featuring a white German Shepherd!!! Sledgehammer symbolism all the way and not the sign of a great film maker! Finally in a surprise ending the dog has bonded with the Black trainer and now inexplicably hates White folks!! Why? Well because it's a plot device and the dog is eventually shot while turning poor old Burl Ives into Dog Chow! This proved once and for all that the dog was an avowed racist!The bottom line is that this is a bad and overrated filmespecially when you assume that given the director the film will be excellent. I love the films of Sam Fuller and think that his films from the early 1950s are amazing classics and shining examples of brilliant writing and direction combined with low budgets. This film instead is poorly written poorly directed and falls flat. In his prime Fuller probably would have rewritten the poor script but in this one it shows none of his astuteness. Plus as I mentioned above his direction was heavyhanded all the way. While it's not a horrible movie it's not good and isn't even a good timepasser. My advice is see THE BIG RED ONE or an early Fuller classic such as STEEL HELMET instead. This one's for the dogs.By the way is the cage the same one they used in PLANET OF THE APES? You know the cage you see in the final shotit sure looked like it.".

The answer in the movie isn't exactly no and it isn't exactly yes either it's more like maybe but if so we'll just be screwed up in some other way. As with any Fuller film White Dog asks interesting questions but unlike other Fuller films the execution in this one undermines its power. For starters Kristy McNichol is not up to the acting task given her in fact she's quite terrible and not a single line she delivers or emotion she conveys feels authentic. The film also suffers from weak editing pacing and writing. The screenplay is lazy asking us to accept story developments that serve the plot but don't make logical sense.Overall White Dog feels like a movie that was made by someone who still has compelling stories in his head but has lost the energy to tell them.Grade B".

	schema:headline " A tremendously blunt commentary on racism";
	schema:reviewBody "White Dog is a polarizing criminally underrated commentary on racism as a curable way of thinking. The most dehumanizing thing you could do to a race is view them as stereotypical caricatures and writerdirector Samuel Fuller recognized this when he made this film. Therefore to tell his unconventional story he utilizes characters as metaphors and events as psychiatric tests beautifully articulating the theory that a racist can be rebirthed so to speak as someone who holds no judgments.One of the many reasons to appreciate this film is  unlike so many pictures today  this one possesses the courage and gumption to take an idea and gleefully run with it. Samuel Fuller holds up a magnifying glass to his audience questioning their prejudices and tests their understanding and belief in racist behavior  can it be cured or is it there to stay after initial implementation? Fuller uses a beautiful healthy white German Sheppard as the main character  or device  to try and give substance and justification to these questions. The dog is of an older age and is struck by Julie Sawyer Kristy McNichol a young starving actress in search of work. She takes the dog to a vet where it is seen suffering minor injuries. Not long after Julie takes it home with her  as all other options seem to be unfulfilling  she learns her nameless dog is an attack dog specifically trained to viciously maul black people. Frustrated and low on options she takes the dog to a black man named Keys Paul Winfield who specializes in training animals particularly dogs. He knows all about white dogs and informs Julie that at the age of a puppy this dog may have been beaten and mistreated by a black man as directed by a white owner in order to make the dog attack black before black can attack hit. Julie is disgusted and angry. Her boyfriend believes the dog should be put down while Julie who represents the optimistic side of the learned racism debate believes that it isn't the dog's fault that it was trained to hate. Another elderly white trainer named Carruthers Burl Ives also believes the dog is untrainable and on that notion should be put down.Julie decides to let Keys do his best to try and make the dog relearn. What follows is terrific and lengthy sequences of Keys trying to retrain the dog and overwrite its memory. All the while we the viewer are put in a position where numerous questions have already been quietly communicated to us and we have to come up with answers in our head. White Dog challenges the viewer in a mystifying way that is equal parts subtle manipulative and brilliant. The film plays with your emotions but never shamelessly milks the material as sentimental bait.The only thing that will likely serve as a distraction to viewers are the film's production values which are obviously cheap and of an independent film budget. However when a film is this crowded with blunt social commentary and heavy themes questioning a person's true beliefs and ethics production values have little importance whatsoever. Few will complain because the film provides such a smooth conversation on racism that the way it is presented doesn't need to be very polished. I'd rather have a lowbudget piece of valuable commentary than a glossy goodlooking film with no brain in its head whatsoever.Racism is a tough subject to tackle in film and with directors like Paul Haggis unintentionally cheapening the material for easyconsumption and others like Spike Lee clearly passionate about making it believable a film like White Dog is a true miracle. Fuller's approach to racism and the blunt question it asks a person shouldn't be ignored. We're told in the film that dogs can only see in two colors what happens when one of them is viewed as an evil color? Starring Kristy McNichol Paul Winfield Burl Ives and Jameson Parker. Directed by Samuel Fuller.".

	schema:reviewBody "Samuel Fuller's White Dog is interesting to say the least. This is a movie about animal abuse how racist people can turn a good animal into a killer and the repercussions of such actions. The message here is a sad one made even more so by the fact that incidents like the one portrayed in this movie were at one time a reality in American society. The struggle for African Americans in this country has been a tough one this movie reminds us of the type of hatred that once existed and still does to an extent for those members of society who look different than the acceptable norm. I did not find the characters' responses to 'White Dog' to be believable. The animal trainer was of particular interest. It is interesting that as a black man he knew what type of dog he was dealing with knew what its triggers were. Yet when 'White Dog' kills a black man he is sympathetic with the dog almost merciful. His character did a complete 180 degree turn without a setup or warning. His sudden change in attitude came of as underdeveloped and out of place. The same can be said for the dog's owner. Initially she is against killing the dog yet when it kills a man she wants the dog dead. Her sudden change of heart is not setup nor is it believable. Overall this movie had an interesting concept but lacked the depth that one would expect a movie about racism and its unexpected victims to carry.".

	schema:reviewBody "White Dog was a very interesting movie. The ending does definitely leave the viewer depressed and feeling somewhat betrayed. However in my opinion its tediousness and poor acting by Kristy McNichol took away from Paul Winfield's Keys determination to cure this dog of its disease. He felt so strongly about doing the right thing and reforming a beast it made the audience feel that there was still a chance for the dog. It is obvious this is a complete 1980s movie. It's overpowering music and inyourface type of cinema was a typical trait of the 80s. But absolutely I do not see this as a racist movie. It is exposing the fact that there ARE racists out there and that there are some sick people who take advantage of a dog's ability to be trained to create monsters out of these unsuspecting creatures. This movie is not saying that all black people are bad. It's shedding light on the fact that some people see it this way and pry into the minds of dogs and program them to think the same way. Since dogs supposedly see in black and white this is the easiest race between which to differentiate. In a dog's eyes an Indian or very darkskinned Hispanic could appear to be as dark as an African American. This movie overall was enjoyable to watch yet somewhat predictable. The audience wants so badly for the dog to reform and sees hope in the dog after he makes progress although there is always underlying tension which classifies it as a thrillersuspense. The audience never knows if he will snap or turn on his owners. Sadly he loses his battle against becoming pure from an instinctual betrayal.".

Amy Sakasitz as Margaret Wade is rather annoying and the usually excellent Christopher Lloyd is sadly overthetop and distracting as Switchblade Sam complete with a subplot that was a little too violent and doesn't fit with the overall tone of the movie. However Dennis the Menace despite what its reputation and rating suggests is actually very entertaining and does a pretty good job with the transition from comic to movie. It has been criticised for taking too much ideas from the Home Alone movies and I suppose that's true with the sight gags but I personally think the sight gags are funny. The cinematography is good the soundtrack is fun the story while predictable is well structured and interesting the pacing is brisk and the direction is efficient. And the acting with exception of Lloyd is not bad at all. Mason Gamble thankfully isn't the annoying brat I was expecting prior to seeing this film instead he is cute and funny as the mischievous yet wellmeaning Dennis while Walter Matthau from the facial expressions to the delivery of the dialogue is brilliant as Mr Wilson. Joan Plowright is also very touching and Lea Thompson and Robert Stanton also do well as Dennis's parents. In conclusion it is a decent and entertaining film. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "For whatever reason this film has been somewhat underrated since its release in the early nineties. I suspect that much of the apathy stems from the fact that audiences at that time had reached the saturation point with Little kid outsmarting the bad guy slapstick Home Alone 1 and 2 The Three Ninjas series etc. Still this version of Dennis Mitchell's escapades is well worth a look and is certainly holds its own against other John Hughes films with a similar ok identical premise.The highlights of the film include winning performances by Mason Gamble and Walter Mathau as Dennis and Mr. Wilson respectively. Mason Gamble was one of the more talented child actors to grace the screen at the time if you're able to see more than a 'cute kid' and listen to his inflection he's actually pretty funny. Mathau of course is Mathau and brilliant. It's somewhat annoying that the film decided to go 'PC' in portraying Alice Mitchell as a career woman but other than that the casting of the parents and Martha Wilson was perfect. The musical score was also excellent whimsical nostalgic without coming across as cloying.There were only two problems with the film but they were big ones. First the director did not adequately develop Wilson's friendship with Dennis which makes the end scenes seem forced and trite. The only recollection I have of Wilson even speaking civilly to Dennis before he 'ran away' was when he briefly explained why he kept his coins in a safe. Other than that their relationship was nothing but snarls grumbling and apologies. Secondly the introduction of Switchblad Sam was a typical and oh so tired Hughes device although it was surprisingly violent compared to his other films watching a cute little five year old force feed and then accidentally set a villain on fire was slightly disturbing to say the least. Christopher Lloyd's performance was overthetop and distracting taking away from what could have become a semiclassic children's film.".

With a cast that included Walter Matthau Christopher Lloyd Joan Plowright and Lea Thompson I was sure this would provide laughs for me now as an adult as well. Wrong.This was NOT funny just one stupid gag after another. There was no real story line and most of the characters were annoying not humorous. No wonder this was another disappointing bomb at the box office.Not everything is bad. Matthau is Mr. Wilson true to form. He looks and acts like you figure he would out of the comic strip. Dennis' parents pretty much do the same and some of the stuff is fairly funny.But there are some bigtime disquieting aspects of this movie. Dennis is not the innocent butmischievous kid of the comics but a meanspirited sadistic kid in here. Did I really hear Matthau utter GD three times without making it sound like it was blasphemous? Oh how clever these Hollywood folks are in their clueless idea of family fare. Speaking of that what was the purpose of the sleazy character Switchblade Sam? In this age of child molestation and worse this kind of character is funny? A guy hanging around schoolyards making threats is funny? No not really.Once again  clueless Hollywood. What Dennis does to him is not funny either  it's overtheline. You would be appalled if your kid acted like this. This is far cry from the intention of comic book writer. It is typical of the sick screen writers of today.If you think I'm overreacting check Roger Ebert's review of this movie. I don't agree with him on many films but he was extremely offended by that character too and thought it had no legitimate reason for being in this movie. Good for him. This should be a G rated movie. It's Dennis The Menace for cryin' out loud so why the PG attitude?".

Another familiar actor is Christopher Lloyd from the Back to the Future trilogy and The Pagemaster who plays the robber. I remember when I rented this at my local grocery store I saw the scene where the robber kidnaps Dennis and ties him up.  Then Dennis tells him the only right way to tie him up so that he won't be able to get away.  The robber has handcuffs and the key falls into the beans he's cooking.  Dennis is forced to feed the robber beans in order to find the key.  After this the robber farts in the fire.  This scene was cut when shown on TNT.

	schema:reviewBody "Dennis the Menace is a good film. I love how they show the film being set in the 50's. However you can see that not everything fits in to the decade setting such as the automobiles used in the film.Mr. Wilson the curmudgeonly next door neighbor of the Miller's can't seem too tolerate their young child named Dennis. Wilson sees Dennis as a pest always trying to cause trouble. At some point the Miller's have to both go on business trips forcing them to try and find a babysitter for Dennis. Unfortunately they can't find anybody willing to watch him because of his troublesome manner. Well who's left on the list other than the Wilson's.Understandably Mr. Wilson isn't thrilled at the prospect of looking after him but his lovely wife Martha does not mind at all and is delighted to look after Dennis. Mr. Wilson puts up with Dennis and his antics for awhile but after Mr. Wilson's house is robbed by Switchblade Sam and his debut of his plant that is about to bloom gets ruined when Dennis tells Mr. Wilson his house has been robbed and Mr. Wilson doesn't believe him at first and tells him that he never wants to see him again. Dennis rides away on his bike and gets captured by Sam but he of course saves the day later on and comes back home.The characters in Dennis the Menace are thought out well. However I would have to disagree that Switchblade Sam would look like a total creep and be a thief. This is of course silly as any normal looking person can do bad things. Of course it is a movie and I suppose that he does look very intimidating in the town of clean looking folks.Dennis the Menace may not be for everybody but I think that it stays true to the comic and it is an enjoyable laugh out loud film. This is a good movie and isn't over the top with slapstick and should have most people with a funny bone laughing out of their seat.".

Mr. Wilson puts up with Dennis and his antics for awhile but after Mr. Wilson's house is robbed by Switchblade Sam and his debut of his plant that is about to bloom gets ruined when Dennis tells Mr. Wilson his house has been robbed and Mr. Wilson doesn't believe him at first and tells him that he never wants to see him again. Dennis rides away on his bike and gets captured by Sam but he of course saves the day later on and comes back home.The characters in Dennis the Menace are thought out well. However I would have to disagree that Switchblade Sam would look like a total creep and be a thief. This is of course silly as any normal looking person can do bad things. Of course it is a movie and I suppose that he does look very intimidating in the town of clean looking folks.Dennis the Menace may not be for everybody but I think that it stays true to the comic and it is an enjoyable laugh out loud film. This is a good movie and isn't over the top with slapstick and should have most people with a funny bone laughing out of their seat.";

Matthau really is on top form as strong as he was with Jack Lemmon in the 'Grumpy Old Men' films. Gamble is fantastic as the adorable but mischievous 5 year old and shows an acting ability way beyond his years with superb comic timing and wonderful catch lines.Full of laughs crazy antics hilarious childhood expression and the odd touching moment too this is an entertaining film that keeps on giving scene after scene.

Her chemistry with Coley is poor as indeed he is as well although Kilian has a bit of a stiff sway about him.

The effects are good for the time but thanks to the heavy Technicolor still retains a sort of retro cool for modern audiences.

Sure it has outmoded special effects but those special effects were once highly praised for their uniqueness and creativity.  Those special effects were a springboard to other achievements in that technical area.  Let's give credit where credit is due and praise this film not for having outmoded effects BUT for having special effects which revolutionized film effects.  Enough sermonizing...I know how little good it does.  This film tells the story of a mad a very mad scientist that has discovered the ability to miniaturize things animals and even people.  Albert Dekker plays easily his finest role as the demented Dr. Cyclops with a real bad sight problem.  Dekker's performance is not like your typical raving madmanaka a Lugosi or even early Karloff performance but more of a subdued evil and obsessive nature.  The other actors are adequate and the special effects are wonderful.  The film has a good story and I loved the obvious allusion to the mythological Polyphemus a giant with all the advantages taken down by a small yet brilliant man. This is a thoughtful interesting and fun film.  Definitely keep more than one eye open when viewing this film!".

The plot is a typical B movie plot but the special effects and the color photography are what really sets this film apart. The story involves Mad Scientist Dr. Thorkel Albert Dekker who summons three scientists Thomas Coley Janice Logan Charles Halton to his remote South American laboratory to seek their advice on his secret project. Along the way they are forced to bring muleskinner Victor Kilian along. It turns out that the evil doctor has discovered the secret of miniaturization. To prevent them from cashing in on his discovery Thorkel shrinks the three scientists the muleskinner and nosey local Pedro Frank Yaconelli to miniscule size. The rest of the film chronicles their efforts to escape. The real star of the film are its special effects. Accomplished through a combination of splitscreen rear projection miniatures and over sized props the effects are quite convincing for the time. One shot I thought was quite well done was a scene where the evil doctor picks up one of his victims in his hand. Because most of the budget was spent on color and effects the quality of the acting suffers. Dekker does OK as the title character a name given him by his victims because of his failing eyesight. The others are just barely adequate. Veteran Paul Fix who could have raised the acting up a level appeared briefly in the opening reel as Thorkel's sceptical assistant.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a peculiar film to have come out of any studio in 1940 much less the stylish Paramount. Since the same year saw the equally bizarre Hal Roach production One Million B.C. it might not be unreasonable to assume that there was either something in the water that made them do it or else the studio chiefs were smoking weed that year. Produced and directed by the King Kong team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack Dr. Cyclops is a far cry from their earlier vastly superior work yet it's still worth seeing. The jungle probably a backlot job is marvelously rendered and the Technicolor photography is as beautiful as any I've seen. There's a vividness to the color that makes it jump out at you that's almost psychedelic.This is basically a mad scientist tale with a gimmick which is the eponymous doctor's ability to shrink people to the size of elves. Much of the action revolves around the little people's attempts to elude the mad doctor and escape from his jungle laboratory. The movie feels more like a product of the fifties than the early forties as this theme would be returned to again in later science fiction. It's also a tough movie to categorize as it's not quite horror or pure scifi. Like Kong Kong it's an action movie and technical tour de force that takes quite a few liberties with nature.As an oddball experiment the movie works up to a point though it could have used more humor and irony and the pace is less than thrilling. It's hard to pull this sort off of story on a good day as the improbable material needs all the help it can get. Alas aside from the stunning color and imaginative sets it doesn't get much here. Most of the actors in the film are unknowns and would remain unknown though prissy character actor Charles Halton has a decent role as one of the shrunken which he plays well. The most impressive performer is also the lead player Albert Dekker whose life and movie career were almost as strange as this film. He is both believable and intimidating as the mad doctor and gives the movie a touch of class.".

Can they escape the clutches of Thorkel  find a way to reverse the shrinking process? Watch it  find out...Directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack I thought Dr. Cyclops is a bit of a hidden gem I found it to be a throughly entertaining  likable scifi adventure film. The script by Tom Kilpatrick moves along like a rocket  at only 75 odd minutes in length you don't have time to get bored. The whole set up is very good the character's are well fleshed out especially misguided scientist Dr. Thorkel who definitely has a touch of humanity  a vulnerable side the situations pitfalls  perils the miniature people find themselves in are fun including being attacked by a huge Crocodile. It's a delightful little film that I personally wasn't expecting much from but I have to admit it's become a bit of a favourite good solid entertaining fun for all the family. My only reservation is the copout  simplistic conclusion where the team simply 'grow' back to normal size.Director Schoedsack does a wonderful job here the special effects remain impressive even when viewed today sure they can't hope to compete with CGI laden likes of Harry Potter but they hold a certain charm  personality that beats any soulless computer graphic. The use of splitscreen back projection oversized sets  giant props is superbly implemented  it's only a couple of times when the effects don't quite work. I think this is a film that needs to be seen to be appreciated. While a bad special effect is a bad special effect whether it's 60 or 6 years old I'm struggling to think of any really bad effects in Dr. Cyclops.I would have thought the budget for Dr. Cyclops was fairly decent as the effects were probably as good as anything around back then it was shot in colour when many scifi films back then were black and white it's well made with good production values although some of the indoor Amazon sets look fake almost cartoonish. The acting varies Dekker is great as Thorkel although the rest of the cast are pretty lifeless  flat.Dr. Cyclops is a great film unfortunately judging by the lack of user comments here I'd guess it's not a particularly well known one. If you like scifi then this has to be an absolute must see for you  I'm sure many other's would find much to enjoy  entertain here. Definitely recommended  a bit of a pleasant surprise.".

	schema:reviewBody "After killing his assistant Dr. Mendoza Paul Fix the insane Dr. Thorkel Albert Dekker summons the biologists Dr. Bulfinch Charles Halton and Dr. Mary Robinson Janice Logan to meet him in a remote area in the jungle of Peru. They travel with the mineralogist Bill Stockton Thomas Coley in mules owned by Steve Baker Victor Kilian that insists to go with them. After the long journey Dr. Thorkel asks them to help him to identify a sample in a microscope and after receiving the answer he thanks the support of his colleagues and say farewell to them. They decide to stay and find that there is a uranium mine in the spot. Further they break in Thorkels laboratory to snoop into his research. Thorkel lures the group and locks them and his servant Pedro Frank Yaconelli in a room with an apparatus developed by him. He activates the device and shrinks the group that flees from him. Now Dr. Thorkel hunts them down. Dr. Cyclops is a 1940 horror film with impressive special effects and sets. The story of a mad scientist that shrinks people when he feels threatened by them is funny.

	onyx:emotionText "After killing his assistant Dr. Mendoza Paul Fix the insane Dr. Thorkel Albert Dekker summons the biologists Dr. Bulfinch Charles Halton and Dr. Mary Robinson Janice Logan to meet him in a remote area in the jungle of Peru. They travel with the mineralogist Bill Stockton Thomas Coley in mules owned by Steve Baker Victor Kilian that insists to go with them. After the long journey Dr. Thorkel asks them to help him to identify a sample in a microscope and after receiving the answer he thanks the support of his colleagues and say farewell to them. They decide to stay and find that there is a uranium mine in the spot. Further they break in Thorkels laboratory to snoop into his research. Thorkel lures the group and locks them and his servant Pedro Frank Yaconelli in a room with an apparatus developed by him. He activates the device and shrinks the group that flees from him. Now Dr. Thorkel hunts them down. Dr. Cyclops is a 1940 horror film with impressive special effects and sets. The story of a mad scientist that shrinks people when he feels threatened by them is funny. However the screenplay and edition have many flaws such as the color of the miniature people clothes that change from white to different colors. The famous Dr. Bulfinch and Pedro are murdered by Dr. Thorkel but everybody seems to have forgotten in the end. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Delrio de um Sbio The Delirium of a Wise";

The film was yet another infrequent genre entry from Paramount  after 1931's DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE and the trio from 1933 ISLAND OF LOST SOULS MURDERS IN THE ZOO and SUPERNATURAL interestingly it was a Technicolor production  the first to be shot in this process after Warners' two earlier experiments DOCTOR X 1932 and MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM 1933. Plotwise DR. CYCLOPS was a variation on the shrinking theme explored in MGM's THE DEVILDOLL 1936  which proved quite popular over the years as can be attested by the likes of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN 1957 ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE 1958 CURSE OF THE DOLL PEOPLE 1961 etc. The titular character  for which underrated character actor Albert Dekker is probably bestremembered and his most notable genre contribution alongside the dual role in AMONG THE LIVING 1941  would of course fit in with the era's virtually interminable parade of mad scientists though typically he means well by his experiments his approach to science and his fellow man is utterly ruthless. Working in seclusion but deterred by his failing sight he invites three eminent colleagues to confirm his findings without actually divulging the nature of his experiments when they begin to get curious and decide to stick around he does not shrink sic at the prospect of using them for guinea pigs! Soon enough they are fighting for their lives  and not just from the wily doctor as everyday objects become inaccessible a doorknob or otherwise take menacing proportions a cat! on the other hand they take advantage both of their current dimension hiding in places where Dekker cannot get at them and the doctor's own physical drawback breaking the spare sets of lenses kept handy in a drawer while he is sleeping. Interestingly the shrinking process eventually halts and the subjects start reverting to normal size  which is how the heroes having gotten rid of Cyclops in the very well where he stores his allimportant raygun are able to return to civilization after several months of 'convalescence'. The handsomelooking film an entertaining and efficient 76 minutes makes for a worthy addition to director Schoedsack's genre resume' which includes seminal titles like THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME 1932 and KING KONG 1933 notable ones like SHE 1935 and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG 1949 not to mention the lesser but endearing SON OF KONG 1933.".

An excellent clear print.A group of explorers are assigned to go on an expedition into the Amazon Jungle to search for a Doctor who has now gained the nickname Dr Cyclops due to him being partially sighted. He has been in the Jungle for a couple of years busy doing experiments. They manage to find him and get a hostile reception as he don't want any visitors. He has come up with a way of making living things tiny and we see a horse. The explorers are then miniaturised and face plenty of dangers through this including a cat dog roosters and an alligator. There is also a thunderstorm. After the Doctor kills two of them the other three try their best to avoid him and the Doctor falls to his death down a mine shaft while looking for the explorers at the end.This also has excellent Oscar nominated special effects and a good music score too. Dr Cyclops was directed by King Kong's Ernest B Schoedsack.The excellent cast includes Albert Dekker in the title role Janice Logan Thomas Coley Frank Reicher King Kong and Paul Fix.Dr Cyclops is essential viewing for all old scifi fans. Excellent. Rating 4 stars out of 5.".

As a matter of fact later movies which include shrinking people from the 50s actually seemed less technological and do not appear as realistic. Dr. Cyclops seems to have the best special effects for a movie where people get shrunk till at least the 70s if there were any made after 1970.

Technically this film is way ahead of its time looking more like a product of the mid 1950s than the early 40s and for this reason alone it should be a priority for all fans of fantastic cinema.Utilising a combination of careful camera placement low shots to make Thorkel appear huge high shots to make his victims appear small detailed oversized sets and props rear projection split screen and mattes Schoedsack and his effects team create scene after scene of memorable movie magic. Take into account that this movie is now over 70 years old and it cannot fail to impress.On the downside the score is extremely heavy handed and some of the performances are less than stellar Dekker is excellent but the exaggerated mannerisms adopted by the pintsized profs are embarrassingly trite. Thankfully these are minor quibbles when measured against the film's massive technical accomplishments and the film remains a consistently entertaining experience nonetheless.7.5 out 10 rounded up to 8 for the sight of yummy egghead Dr. Mary Robinson Janice Logan in her sexy makeshift toga she might be reduced to a foot in height but she's certainly no shrinking violet.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of two movies the other being The Valley of Gwangi I'm reviewing this month that has some connection with King Kong. In this case it's the fact that the codirector of that one Ernest B. Schoedsack helmed this one solo. Also actor Frank Reicher who plays Professor Kendall here was Captain Englehorn in the original 1933 blockbuster. Anyway this was a pretty entertaining for its time yarn about a mad scientist Albert Dekker as Dr. Alexander Thorkel who invites three of his colleagues to look at his work before quickly dismissing them after only a few minutes of their time since he only needed them because of his gradually failing eyesight. Also along for the ride is a mule owner and a servant with a dog. When they discover what Thorkel's done he tricks them into a room and shrinks them in order to control them...Okay anyone expecting some logic as to why certain things happen the way they do should probably stay away from this movie as you'll probably get a headache doing so. Just marvel at some of the interesting visual effects like how Dr. Throkel holds one of the shrunken in his hand some cool sound effects like the loud roar of that black cat and the campy performance of Dekker as when he actually tells the fate of what happens when the three survivors stay alive while still shrunken for a long time. Despite not much action at least not until the last 25 minutes or very compelling acting though Charles Halton does have his moments as Dr. Rupert Bulfinch when confronting Thorkel especially when he calls him the title name this was still a reasonably entertaining movie that won't waste the 77 minutes you spend watching this. So on that note I recommend Dr. Cyclops. P.S. I'd like to recognize uncredited screenwriter Malcolm Stuart Boylan and player Janice Logan as both native born Chicagoans like I am. And that Halton played Mr. Carter the bank examiner in my favorite movie It's a Wonderful Life.".

The scenes with the tiny people fending off giant animals and fighting back against Thorkel are extremely tense and exciting. The nifty special effects hold up quite well.

	schema:headline " Great Technicolor Great Effects Weak Acting";
	schema:reviewBody "How many science fiction films were made in color before 1940? Unless we include 'color tinted' films from the silent era the answer is ONE  the recently released twostrip version of 'Dr. X' 1932. 'Dr. Cyclops' is an 'A' list SF film it's in gorgeous Technicolor and has state of the art special effects. It is highly recommended for those three reasons.Dr. Thorkel Albert Dekker has been using radium extracted from a rich underground vein to miniaturize animals. We see the shrinking room and machine the 'condenser' the deep welled vein and a strange looking extracting device and the green glow of them in operation all nicely done. He invites three scientists to confirm some mysterious part of his work and then after their having done so dismisses them the same day. Outraged they stick around until finally Dr. Thorkel locks them in the shrinking room and miniaturizes them. They spend the rest of the film escaping and then trying to kill him.I first saw this in black and white on TV over 40 years ago when few programs were shown in color. I didn't know it was filmed in color! While the movie had a great premise and effects I was a little underwhelmed by the acting and it didn't seem particularly exciting. Watching it today it still has those weaknesses. Though Albert Dekker does a fine villainous job as do Charles Halton Rupert Bulfinch veteran of 186 bit parts in movies and TV and Victor Kilian Steve with 139 to his credit the rest of the small cast is flat colorless and uninteresting. Paul Fix does get one great scene at the beginning.The pacing is fine and the shrunken heroes are placed in a number of perilous situations. My 8 and 10 year old grandchildren were transfixed during those parts. You do enjoy watching the entire film you just wish that Janice Logan Thomas Colley and Frank Yaconelli could have had a wider range of facial expressions and acting skills as well as better and richer dialog.Charles Halton had a long career playing professors judges lawyers and other 'stiff' types Victor Kilian can be seen as the uncredited professor leading a crew inside the Earth in 'Unknown World' 1951 and as a featured player in the great TV 'soap' 'Mary Hartman Mary Hartman' 19761977.The film has great Technicolor photography matte shots with mostly sharp rear projection that makes it seem as if the 13 inch shrunken humans are actually in the same room with Dr. Thorkel. We get the heroes filmed in giant sets something done in other films such as the fantastic 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' 1957 with Grant William's great tortured face.We have to be grateful for large favors. The amazing Technicolor and effects place this one up high. Some less than scary music for example flighty flutes and staccato violins during running sequences and 'B' list actors in an 'A' level production reduce my score down to a 6 and a half. This presumably is a little joke reference to 'Bulfinch's Mythology' the standard work of the time on ancient mythology that included the story of Ulysses and Cyclops.".

'Dr. Cyclops' is an 'A' list SF film it's in gorgeous Technicolor and has state of the art special effects. It is highly recommended for those three reasons.Dr. Thorkel Albert Dekker has been using radium extracted from a rich underground vein to miniaturize animals. We see the shrinking room and machine the 'condenser' the deep welled vein and a strange looking extracting device and the green glow of them in operation all nicely done. He invites three scientists to confirm some mysterious part of his work and then after their having done so dismisses them the same day. Outraged they stick around until finally Dr. Thorkel locks them in the shrinking room and miniaturizes them. They spend the rest of the film escaping and then trying to kill him.I first saw this in black and white on TV over 40 years ago when few programs were shown in color. I didn't know it was filmed in color! While the movie had a great premise and effects I was a little underwhelmed by the acting and it didn't seem particularly exciting. Watching it today it still has those weaknesses. Though Albert Dekker does a fine villainous job as do Charles Halton Rupert Bulfinch veteran of 186 bit parts in movies and TV and Victor Kilian Steve with 139 to his credit the rest of the small cast is flat colorless and uninteresting. Paul Fix does get one great scene at the beginning.The pacing is fine and the shrunken heroes are placed in a number of perilous situations. My 8 and 10 year old grandchildren were transfixed during those parts. You do enjoy watching the entire film you just wish that Janice Logan Thomas Colley and Frank Yaconelli could have had a wider range of facial expressions and acting skills as well as better and richer dialog.Charles Halton had a long career playing professors judges lawyers and other 'stiff' types Victor Kilian can be seen as the uncredited professor leading a crew inside the Earth in 'Unknown World' 1951 and as a featured player in the great TV 'soap' 'Mary Hartman Mary Hartman' 19761977.The film has great Technicolor photography matte shots with mostly sharp rear projection that makes it seem as if the 13 inch shrunken humans are actually in the same room with Dr. Thorkel. We get the heroes filmed in giant sets something done in other films such as the fantastic 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' 1957 with Grant William's great tortured face.We have to be grateful for large favors. The amazing Technicolor and effects place this one up high. Some less than scary music for example flighty flutes and staccato violins during running sequences and 'B' list actors in an 'A' level production reduce my score down to a 6 and a half. This presumably is a little joke reference to 'Bulfinch's Mythology' the standard work of the time on ancient mythology that included the story of Ulysses and Cyclops.";

Youthful horror and SciFi fans exclusively swearing by the use of computeranimated techniques can't possibly imagine how much time effort and sincere devotion it must have cost here to scale down the sets or to endlessly edit all the matte works together. The effects in Dr. Cyclops are so terrific and so ahead of times they actually form a worthy equivalent for the visual art in The Incredible Shrinking Man which got released more than 15 years later and had a larger budget to work with. Doctor Thorkel is a brilliant albeit slightly eccentric scientist investigating the possibilities of freshly exploited radium in the middle of the Amazonian jungle. He develops a way to miniaturize living tissue but he requires the help of three fellow scientists because his declining eyesight causes miscalculations. The scientists naturally refuse to leave without knowing the essence of Thorkel's research and paranoid over the idea they'll steal his lifework he shrinks them to a mere twelve inches. With Thorkel going increasingly berserk the group has the choice between either facing their mad opponent or flee into the immense and dangerous jungle. The script features a couple of slower parts but generally speaking Dr. Cyclops is a vastly compelling and intellectually challenging film. The references towards the Greek mythology in the title and more elaborated in the script are fantastic and Albert Dekker's performance is a stellar tourdeforce.

In their current and miniaturized state Dr. Thorkel becomes the least of their worries as they attempt to make their escape through the jungle.As I sat and watched Dr. Cyclops for the first time the thought kept going through my head Wow these are some great effects for the 50s. It would be an understatement to say that I was shocked after the movie ended and I discovered Dr. Cyclops was made in 1940. The special effects are amazing. Sure modern audiences who prefer soulless CGI may find the effects poor or even comical but they represent a real craft and workmanship that you don't see much anymore. There's an art to the kind of rear projection splitscreen and oversized props found in Dr. Cyclops. So when you combine these ahead of their time special effects with the bright vibrant beautiful Technicolor used in the filming of the movie I think it's understandable to see why I was surprised to discover Dr. Cyclops was made some 67 years ago.Beyond the effects Dr. Cyclops moves at a good pace. Although some aspects of the minihumans against nature plot seem clich today it held my attention throughout. And though obviously stagebound the sets are more than adequate. On the negative side the acting is hit or miss at best. While Albert Dekker is more than adequate at playing the subtly sinister title character and Charles Hatton is good as his most capable adversary Dr. Bullfinch most of the rest of cast doesn't come across quite so good. I also thought that some of the key plot points were terribly predictable. As an example from the moment Dr. Thorkel's poor eyesight is made known is there any doubt this will come into play at some point in the movie? And I can't end this without mentioning the music  it's downright annoying. It's that loopy kind of music I associate with a bad kiddie movie.".

Now so far the film is pretty interesting and could have degenerated into a lousy Bmovie like in ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE. However decent writing really saved the film. Instead of the little people just running away or trying to save themselves which they initially do they decide to stay and fight! This really helped the film and made the shrunken people more 3dimensional and people you could care about and root for in the film. And all this is done using what were for the time exceptional special effects. About the only problem and boy is it minor is that at one point an American Aligator attacks the little folks. Sure they aren't native to South America but this is such a tiny quibble who cares?? An entertaining film for kids and adults like me who just haven't chosen to grow up!!".

	schema:reviewBody "There is no method to the madness of reclusive scientist Albert Dekker a man so determined to fight against the laws of God that he drive himself mad in the process giving truth to the old saying that whom God intends to destroy he drives mad first. While Decker does not play an actual character named Cyclops he will ultimately be exactly like the legendary creature of Greek myth. This colorful Paramount science fictionhorror movie is one of the gems of the silver screen that has simply not gotten its due except from a cult following rather than becoming an alltime classic on the lines of the Universal horror movies of the 1930s. However Dekker is up there with Karloff and Lugosi in the characterization of evil he plays here and unlike Lugosi's Dracula he is very much alive and unlike the undead Karloff in Frankenstein there is no sympathy at all for the creature that he becomes. The reclusive Dekker wants to continue his evil experiments in private killing one rival and turning a group of people trying to stop him by simply shrinking them to doll size versions of themselves placing them in a world of terror that we as full grown men and women do not understand. However in the world of the film of Dr. Cyclops the audience is put into their shoes seeing what would happen if all of a sudden we were 110 of our size or as it often seems 150 of Cyclops' size. With Dekker sleeping nearby the little people escape his clutches manage to avoid a ferocious cat and end up outside where the most vicious thunderstorm hits all at once showing the audience the fear of full grown animals who even in their own element are petrified. Shots of two spider monkeys consoling each other in a tree lions bears various birds and other wildlife critters is intertwined with the footage of the miniature victims of Dekker's evil plans to find shelter. The doctor himself takes great glee in teasing these men and women over their predicament informing one of the victims that they are about to be attacked by a giant rooster. The special effects are outstanding and the cleverness of these little people is as equal as in the evil of Dekker's mad scientist. The tension arises in how these creatures will deal with their plight and how they will ultimately stop Dekker from continuing his mad reign of terror. Filmed in beautiful color Dr. Cyclops is one of the gems of its era and is a must for all fans of science fiction and horror.There's also the presence of an adorable loyal dog who looks at his master in bewilderment as he sees him as a tiny version of himself too confused to acknowledge him but still trained in loyalty to see him as anything else but who the dog knows him to be. The fate of this one particular character is quite tragic and the impact of what. Of what the Cyclops does will immediately affect you.Unlike the earlier The Devil Doll which had little creatures being used by Lionel Barrymore to cause paralysis to their victims and the later Incredible Shrinking Man. Dr Cyclops uses a great deal of imagination in addition to intelligence to create a story that while fantastic and beyond belief is a reminder that human beings should there not head down this path of knowledge and find out secrets which God intends we do not find out. I am glad that this is never been remade because no film creator could ever hope to reproduce the impact that this film has had and it remains a true sleeper of the science fiction and horror genre.".

Tell you anything?It's a typically cheapozoid Roger Corman flick about the disappearing rainforest. The film is only 78 minutes long and about half of it is a digression that takes place in an Indian village.Here's the general idea. A famous indigenous environmentalist is killed. Although it is obvious that the money interests wanted him out of the way the murder was performed with an arrow to feign an Indian attack so the local police somehow decide to arrest a taciturn Indian who hangs himself in his cell after signing a full confession. There's a new plot twist eh?When the Indian's fellow tribesmen come for his body a local North American environmentalist Sandra Bullock and a magazine reporter Craig Sheffer try to talk to them. They are unresponsive so on the spur of the moment the Americans follow the Indians up the river to their reservation.Pause. Let's think about that. Sheffer and Bullock see the Indians paddling upstream so they commandeer a canoe and follow. They don't know the terrain they don't know how far it is to the destination they have no supplies they don't even have insect repellent and they're in a stolen canoe paddling through the unfamiliar jungle surrounded by crocs snakes bad guys corrupt legal authorities and stone age tribesmen.Sheffer is shot from the underbrush their canoe overturns and they just decide to saunter through the rainforest in a random direction even though night is approaching they are soaking wet and Sheffer has a gunshot wound. Well as luck would have it they are captured by indigenous people  the very ones they were seeking  and after some negotiations the tribe finally agrees to advance the plot somewhat1. They possess secret herbs that cure the wound2. They perform a scientific autopsy on the guy who hanged himself thus proving he was dead before the hanging. 3. They possess more secret herbs that make Sandra Bullock want to make nicenice for hours with the reporter whom she had previously detested.Well now that the ice is broken the lovebirds are constantly stealing a kiss on the corner of dirt roads or in sleazy taverns filled with environmental terrorists and wouldbe competitors in the Anthony Quinn lookalike contest and all of this romance is pursued with the same nonchalance you'd have with your best girly on the streets of London.This movie might take the award for the most abrupt ending ever. Bullock and Sheffer are pursued by about a zillion heavily armed bad guys including all possible legal authorities. They are trapped on a dock machine guns to the front of them water to the rear with only about a minute left in the film.A minute to resolve such a predicament?? Well I'm not going to tell you how it ended.The production values are execrable. The photographic quality is about equal to your dad's home movies and the sound track is both inappropriate and cheesy. In other words the director defied the odds and managed to make a bad script into an even worse movie.I guess you know by now that Sandra did a dimly lit nude scene and this is a rarity in her career but she has said that she had her essentials taped down for this scene so I don't know exactly what we are looking at. Maybe some Pebbles and BamBam bandaids. Incidentally it seems there are still several minutes missing from the DVD cut. According to other comments the original unrated cut was 85 minutes but the unrated DVD release is 78. I suspect however that the clamor to restore the director's vision will be somewhat quieter than the one concerning A Touch of Evil.".

This 1993 direct to video film harkens back to the beginning of Sandra Bullock's film career when she was probably thrilled to get a B movie script.  Actually to call this a B movie would be the kindest of prevarications.  It was nowhere near that good.  A mediocre plot was marred by dreadful directing wretched cinematography and awful acting.The film starts out like a recruiting film for the protest arm of the Sierra Club with people locked in human chains to keep loggers from cutting down the rainforest.  The leader is assassinated and then our heroine Sandra Bullock teams up with a whacked out photo journalist Craig Sheffer to find the killer and expose corruption.  At this point it tries to convert to an action adventure thriller in the jungles of the Amazon. It fails.There are so many things to criticize in this film I hardly know where to begin.  Let's try cinematography.  The color quality was awful scenes were constantly out of focus and the lighting was poor.  We had overexposures and underexposures with no regard to effect.  How about audio? The sound was muddy the music was poor.  And acting?  The acting was amateurish bumbling and shrill.Directing?  Luis Llosa must have been on a tight budget.  It seems like he did the whole film in one take.  Actors were flubbing lines all over the place but the cameras kept rolling.Okay but what about Sandra?  She was a raw talent at this point in more ways than one.  This film provides us with her one and only nude scene which may be its only claim to fame.  But don't rush to the movie store to rent it because of this.  Though it is clear she is fully unclad you really see nothing which is probably a blessing.  I love Sandra Bullock but let's face it she has a body only Popeye could love and adds nothing to a film by appearing in the buff.  Actually her acting here showed promise especially in one scene where she is trying to revive a child just rescued from a fire.  But there is a clear difference in her skills and confidence compared with present day.This film is a must NOT see for anyone especially Sandra Bullock fans.  Why mar your good opinion of her.  I rated this film a 210.  It is an appalling waste of time.  Why they revived it I can only wonder.".

Uh....one of the worst love scenes I've ever seen. Neither of them opens theirs eyes once...probably for good reason...it's not sexy it's creepy. It's called Jungle Fever in the scene selection menu..go figure. After watching that mess I jumped to the end because well I hate watching a movie and not knowing the end.

R.J. redeems himself a touch by charging in to a burning hut to save a young boy who is resuscitated by Alyssa and having a burning ember on his shirt gives R.J. an excuse to turf it and show some muscle to Alyssa who promptly cries on his shoulder. Feeling the answer lies with the hanged Indian's tribe they paddle up river into the jungle unaware that the real murderer is stalking them until R.J. gets shot but they escape to Indian territory where they are stalked again and R.J. yells loudly while trying to lose them. The Indians turn out friendly and pass around some feel good potion by the fire which drives R.J. and Alyssa to get naked and quench their desire. Continuing to enjoy mixing pleasure with business R.J. returns to his hotel with Alyssa but before they can continue their newfound romance in the hotel room the police ambush R.J. in his room beating him up and leaving him tied to a chair with a time bomb at his feet. Alyssa arrives at his door against instructions from her boss just in time to untie him and they escape once again but when they run to Alyssa's boss for help they find that she too is on the take and it seems that the happy duo are now left to bring the story to its conclusion by themselves.".

I saw this when it first came out right as I was about to graduate high school in 1970 and I loved it. I had not read John Barth's novel so I had no prejudice about the approach. I have watched the film a couple of times since on video though it is virtually impossible to find and must testify it more than holds up. Stacey Keach really gives a great subtly nuanced performance perhaps the best of his career when he was still getting 'serious' roles as the guy plagued by occasional catatonia and James Earl Jones is also fantastic as a brilliant maverick innovator of psychiatry think Wilhelm Reich by way of Malcolm X who at the end may be a bit too godlike for his own good. I personally think Terry Southern is a wonderful writer and I love all of the films from his work from the more favorably acknowledged like DR. STRANGELOVE and MAGIC Christian to the less so CANDY which is probably my favorite. There are some crazy juxtapositions here as well as absurd humor that would do the 1920s30s surrealists proud but the humor is not stupid by any means. Director Aram Avakian and Terry Southern were a good pairing. It's too bad that they never did another film together. I can only guess that this dark dark comedy that is about America in the sixties and about human vulnerability hubris and arrogance touched many raw nerves with not only some of the IMDb commentators but the few people who saw it on its initial release. A totally uncompromising picture with the courage of it's twisted convictions. The intention of director screenwriter and cast was to rattle complacent uptight people's cages and judging from the invective here I'd say they succeeded in spades. I will echo whomever owns the rights to END OF THE ROAD put it out on DVD  NOW!".

	schema:reviewBody "THE PLOT Bizarre adaption of John Barth's already bizarre novel detailing the story of a man Keach who goes into a catatonic state at a train station. He is sent to a strange mental hospital run by a weird man named Dr D Jones. After he is considered to be 'cured' he takes a job as a college Professor and proceeds to have an affair with the wife of one of his colleagues.THE NEGATIVE It has been noted that author Barth disliked this film version of his novel and it is easy to see why. It gives only a basic outline of the story while leaving out all of the deeper meanings. It also tried to tie the story to all the chaos and rebellion of the 60's even though the book was written in 1955. The final result is a very confusing and off putting mess with nothing coming together at all. The characters all act very odd and with no understanding of their motivations it becomes impossible for the viewer to relate to them or anything else that goes on. Most viewers especially those that are not familiar with the John Barth book will easily become confused and turned off by this film after the first five or ten minutes if not sooner.THE POSITIVE The filmmaking style is refreshingly audacious in a way that is rarely seen anymore. Everything is just thrown out there no matter how outrageous with little or no regard to mainstream acceptance. The kinetic imagery and music has a certain hypnotic effect that keeps you connected to it even if you don't understand what is going on. The film culminates with a very intense grizzly and tasteless abortion scene that will not be soon forgotten by anyone who sees it. Jones gives one of the most bizarre and overthetop performances that you will ever see anywhere. Anyone who is a fan of his or has an interest in acting MUST see him in this film.THE LOWDOWN The film is a misfired experiment that manages to be enough of a period artifact to make it an interesting curio. It definitely has the ability to stay with you for awhile after it is over.THE RATING 6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's shocking to think that a film this good languishes at 256 votes on IMDB and 6.6 rating. This film will be too weird too clever and in some parts too unpleasant for the overwhelming majority of viewers. This is why it is so little publicised or discussed. The script is extremely laden with irony and clever subtle references. It is not just a shock value film. But given some of the details I guess some people might not be able to believe in its cleveness and just think it exists as cheap exploitation. I really want to say at this point if you want to laugh like you haven't laughed in a long time stop reading this spoilerreview right now and go order the movie.You don't have to be on drugs to enjoy it. This film is like being on the craziest drugs just by itself. If you understand and appreciate the fever that was American life in the 1960s you will get this. And you need at least a pseudointellectual's understanding of Freud to keep up with some of the 'psychobabble'. Or as the film says you have to keep an open mind.The opening scene is an astounding sequence in which Stacy Keach's character Jacob Horner an emotionally frazzled graduate simply gives up and ends up standing on a rural railway station platform where he stares into space for what seems like days. As trainspeople pass and small crowds of amused children gather around him a mysterious unorthodox psychiatrist known only as Doctor D James Earl Jones moves in and diagnoses a case of catatonia. At first it seems more like he is laughing at and taunting Horner. This film is just weird like that. You never know quite what to think of some of the characters. Although the doctor seems like he might be just as nutty as his patients the key point to my mind is that he is always in control  of both himself and his patients.Anyway soon he is whisked off to Dr. Dr's asylum for highly strange and mindbending treatment. The treatment just makes him outwardly weird and unstable but at least he has been waken from his coma.For about the 40 minutes or so of this film you should laugh your pants off. Especially the scenes at The Farm the doctor's insane asylum out in the sticks of New England somewhere. Then it goes quite dark but still often hilarious in a different way as Horner takes up a job as an English lecturer and starts fooling around with the wife of one of his fellow teachers. The teacher in question Joe Morgan played by that annoying guy who always pops up somewhere Harris Yulin is one of the most loathsomely nihilistic characters ever seen on screen and yet his deranged antics those of a very jaded middleaged man also manage to make the viewer laugh at times.This film sets out to achieve extremes. So don't say you weren't warned about the last 15 or so minutes of the film which is very harrowing. Seriously.The combination of the writer Terry Southern of Easy Rider fame and the hipster director Aram Avakian has produced one of the most weird but mindblowing films you'll ever see. But nobody ever talks about this film so I don't know how you got here.".

This film will be too weird too clever and in some parts too unpleasant for the overwhelming majority of viewers. This is why it is so little publicised or discussed. The script is extremely laden with irony and clever subtle references. It is not just a shock value film. But given some of the details I guess some people might not be able to believe in its cleveness and just think it exists as cheap exploitation. I really want to say at this point if you want to laugh like you haven't laughed in a long time stop reading this spoilerreview right now and go order the movie.You don't have to be on drugs to enjoy it.

All you have to do is sit through five minutes of The Magic Christian if you can and you'll see how Terry Southern applied his panacea of Just add stupid to Barth's beyond brilliant novel.  I am only 30 minutes into the film and I don't think I can take anymore.  The pathetic need to shock impress and generally make people think he's so smart is evident if one picks up the book and reads along seeing where Southern has stuck in obvious imagery where he's put naked people which masculine female nurse has been turned into a cross dressing psychotic gun wielding patientnurse where he's put people having sex with chickens and where he's put the American flag a lot of places.  It's even more embarrassing because he's raping the work of a fellow novelist probably out of jealousy. Southern's idea of brilliance is to take a part that was serious in the book James Earl Jones' Doctor and have him dance around singing Caledonia Catatonia.  In other words moronic nonsense.  The more the better.  The scene where Southern has added masturbation to Jacob and Rennie's first telephone conversation is reminiscent of Gus Van Sant restoring it to Norman Bates in that celebrated Psycho remake.  The scenes in the hospital are among the worst in cinema history and take up so much of the running time of the movie that Joe's character is cut out nearly entirely and what actually happens as a result of these brief encounters with lovers of chickens gets short shrift.  Aside from this it is annoying to see that one of Harris Yulin's only whatcouldhavebeensupportingleadinsteadofcharacter roles has been pared down and that he's so miscast.  Keach is somewhat miscast as well he might have been better suited to playing Yulin's part the way it is written in the book and he looks like a prototype for Jedi Mark Hamill with the scar.  Strangely enough this was Yulin's first movie and he did several more with Keach.  The girl playing Rennie is actually somewhat appealing but we never see much of her she apparently writes schlock now so I guess this was good practice.  James Earl Jones seems to be here because of this Southern connection Strangelove Southern has written most of his terrible dialogue and Jones really should have cleaned his toenails instead.  But never mind that never mind what is written in the book because Terry Southern is a writer too and he knows best.  Now I haveto decide if I'm up to seeing how they lay waste to the rest of it.  I did stick it out and thank the lord the scenes outside the clinic are less stupendously mindblowingly awful.  The critic and erstwhile jerk John Simon said the novel concludes with a harrowing abortion whereas the film is an abortion from start to finish.  Not quite as bad as Jan De Bont's The Haunting as lit adaptations go but close.  GO READ THE BOOK!".

Some of those movies' personnel  who were also involved in two lesser Scary Movie sequels  show up here. Those include writerdirector Craig Mazin who happily has come a long way from 1997's abysmal Rocketman.The movie's title says it all. It's a comedy that takes a wellknown hit in this case SpiderMan turns it inside out and uses it as a clothesline for gags. In this parody version nerdy Rick Riker amiable Drake Bell of cableTV's Drake and Josh gets bitten by a mutant dragonfly turning him into...well take a guess. Meanwhile a wellmeaning scientist Chris McDonald turns nasty when his experiment backfires and he finds he must sap others' lifeblood in order to keep himself alive.As is typical of such parodies the movie's approach is as subtle as a spitball gun. Some of the gags are terrific and some are groaners. But they're all fired at such a rapid pace that after a while you have no choice but to give in to the silliness. The characters are like shootinggallery ducks waiting to have parody lobbied at them. Best of the bunch are Rick's wellmeaning but dotty uncle and aunt delightfully played by Leslie Nielsen and Happy Days' Marion Ross. The most pitiable is a takeoff on disabled genius Stephen Hawking who seems to push Mazin's badtaste button over and over ad nauseum.This leads me to the movie's most required caveat. While the flick is mostly silly fun it pushes its PG13 rating right up to the edge of the R cliff. The movie is larded with sexual gags and profanity abound and what might possibly be cinema's longestever flatulence gag.But if you can bear up under the cringe factor Superhero Movie is mostly highpowered fun. Nifty comedy here runs neckandneck with bad taste. It's a close race but the comedy wins.Superhero Movie is rated PG13 for countless sex and drug references crude humor and adult language.".

Some of the jokes do work such as the nail gun scene but other parts simply fall flat. The Xmen spoof for example or the whole farting sequence. Blazing Saddles this isn't! One of the key things about the best spoof movies like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even funnier. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts to hang the gags on.The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies THEN try and spoof them. As a result the socalled plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes it's hard to get worked up about it.As recent spoof movies go it's not as bad as Epic Movie Date Movie or the awful Meet The Spartans but considering that some people involved here have made good funny movies in the past it's nowhere near good enough.".

The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts to hang the gags on.The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies THEN try and spoof them. As a result the socalled plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes it's hard to get worked up about it.As recent spoof movies go it's not as bad as Epic Movie Date Movie or the awful Meet The Spartans but considering that some people involved here have made good funny movies in the past it's nowhere near good enough.";

The actors is what brings this material together and it's certainly not the lead actor Drake Bell. His brand of bad Nickelodeon acting can only take him so far and he is not good in this However he's more professional than any actor from Meet the Spartans. The backup actors like Leslie Nielson and Kevin Hart keep this one barely afloat along with a few amusing jokes.Rick Riker Drake Bell is a high school nerd who's got his eye on popular girl Jill Johnson Sara Paxton. When on a school trip Rick is bitten by a mutated dragonfly which gives him superpowers quite similar to those of Spiderman. He must save the girl when the bad guy takes her and get into wacky adventures that don't make the audience laugh meanwhile.This really shouldn't have been called Superhero Movie. A more appropriate title would be Spiderman The Spoof. Unlike the Scary Movies this one focused almost entirely on being a spoof of Spiderman with a tiny bit of XMen thrown in just to show of the comedic abilities of Tracey Morgan and Regina Hall from all 4 Scary Movie's. Unlike a few other recent spoof films which were so bad they will remain nameless this had pretty good timing on it's jokes and it didn't try to smash together too many movies. The slapstick was done pretty well but it's all been done before and it's been done much better. Very few of the jokes are lingered on too long which is a big positive. Some lines were taken right out of other parody films such as a joke with Leslie Nielson straight out of The Naked Gun part 2 12. There were too many jokes relating to internet sites such as 2girls1cup youtube and Myspace. Way too often Superhero Movie goes for the easy joke so it had the potential to be better...it just wasn't.My rating  12 out of . 75 mins. PG13 for language sexualcrude humor drug references.".

There were some funny moments but they were very rare.I'm also an enormous fan of Drake Bell and his TV show that's targeted toward teens. I am completely and utterly disappointed in Drake Bell for his poor performance and complete inappropriateness during most of this movie.This movie was a great idea and the Dragonfly character was a good concept. The special effects were done well. Unfortunately this movie just simply wasn't funny at all.";

It mainly spoof spiderman and other superheroes like Fantastic 4 Xmen and many more as the background spoof. Since it mainly spoof on Spiderman you will know what the story is. I find it quite disappointing I expected some fight scenes which it does not really feature. The trailers look promising but it does not really live up to my expectations.Overall It is not a bad spoof movie but it can do much better of developing the story. It is currently one of the best spoof movies recently. Those who like spoof movies including Meet the spartan they should catch this. Those finding a comedy probably this would perk you up and do not expect much. Those who totally hate spoof movies they should probably rent it on DVD if they feel bored. Try not to expect too much just leave your brain at the door and relax watching it.".

It's like a guilty pleasure for me like Scary Movie or Meet the Spartans it's so stupid that it's funny so naturally I thought Superhero Movie would have been the same. Now there's one thing that could make me absolutely hate a stupid comedy the overdoing of fart jokes the gross jokes. I don't mind a quick one sometimes it's bad taste but I can deal with 2 seconds and just let it go. But Superhero Movie has a lot of dumb jokes seriously within the first 20 minutes of the movie you have a vomit joke a poop joke and a fart joke. Not my taste and not what I would consider funny there are a few things in here that made me laugh but it's a big disappointment for those who are expecting Scary Movie humor that's actually funny.Rick Riker is a nerd who goes on a field trip with his class he's in love with this girl Jill but isn't noticed by anyone. But on this trip he is stung by a dragonfly and is given super powers. He learns from his uncle and a strange man Professor Xavier how he can save the world with these powers. He'll need them to fight against the Hour Glass Man who wants to kill thousands of innocent people.Would I recommend Superhero Movie? Not really it's more of a rental I'm sad to say that I spent 7 dollars on it. Was it a total waste of time no I wouldn't say so but I just hate gross jokes. There are a few moments where you do laugh like when Rick walks in and catches a flying nail his uncle is stunned and Rick says that it's easier than it looks and then his uncle shoots a nail at Rick's friend and stabs him with it and says No it's not. You might like me get a couple laughs but I think you'll probably be disappointed like me unless you're a junior high kid who still likes the fart jokes.210".

Then he has to fight off 2 villains Lou Landers and someone else i forgot that created an experiment that can suck a superhero's powers away. If i remember this movie lasted 1 hour and 1015 minutes Most of the actors were from the scary movie series which were the best cast to make a parody as funny as possible The plot is very ordinary and is exactly just like the regular superhero movies being new to the superhero world and stopping villains etc It contains jokes all around including bad humor such as sex jokes and language but every movie has their moments so can't blame it Tell you the truth i was laughing too much to understand what is going on so i definitely recommend this movie to all comedyparody lovers.

However that may be The Story of Temple Drake works well on its own terms as a story about a flirtatious Southern belle Miriam Hopkins in one of her best performances whose behavioral excesses get her into a mighty mess with a band of bootleggers including a character named Trigger Jack LaRue in a role George Raft refused and an embittered harridan interestingly played by Florence Eldridge real life wife of Fredric March. Both actors benefit from Karl Struss's evocative photography. Director Stephen Roberts and screenwriter Oliver H.P. Garrett do their early 30's best to cinematize a complicated novel by William Faulkner by crunching long passages of text into visually suggestive nuggets. The trouble with the gang of ne'erdowells is that none of them have even a twinge of a southern twang except James Eagles as the dimwitted Tommy. Besides him the only key actor with even a slight southern accent in the whole film is Hopkins. William Gargan contrasts perfectly with the criminals as the cleancut lawyer who loves and defends Hopkins despite her dark side. The drama builds to a breathless memorable conclusion concisely shot and directed for maximum effect.".

There are degrees of good among the bootleggers just as there are men among her society friends who wouldn't be much better than the bootleggers if given half a chance. Also the implied comparison between Temple and Ruby is striking  Ruby is both the woman Temple may become in social position and a woman who is utterly dedicated to one man which Temple is not and by society's standards should be.Another joltingly energized facet of the production was the appearance of stage actress and wife of Fredric March Florence Eldridge who was given the best line when Temple is in the mansion's kitchen she sees a baby in the wood box by the stove.

By blending what they could show with what the audience was left to imagine it becomes a near horror film. Joseph Breen would say it was the vilest books but that the film was tame in comparison to the novel.This steamy melodrama triggered church boycotts and stricter enforcement of the Hays production code.

This long soughtafter title came up and fortunately the MoMA holds the original elements and in excellent condition! This print of Temple Drake that we are screening is only a single generation away from the original camera negative making this a true rediscovery that is not to be missed!The pivotal role of Temple Drake was entrusted to Miriam Hopkins best known for Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise  Design for Living. But Hopkins seizes the opportunity to extend herself as a performer arguably her finest performance. The role itself is much more complex than many of the parts offered to women in studio films today. George Raft was suspended by Paramount for his refusal to appear as Trigger in this film. Paramount head Adolph Zukor's reasoning that Raft turned down the part not because he objected to the material but because he wanted more money.I first read about it in books on films of the 1930s later I heard about it in documentaries on PreCode Hollywood. When I finally saw this forbidden film it was no gem. Like many of you I first saw Temple on VHS made from a worn 16mm collectors print years ago. It ranked as one of the worst transfers I had ever seen almost unwatchable. But there was something there to the story and the characters that drew me into the fuzzy darkness on the screen. The raising of ideas situations and life mysteries that I found fascinating. Kind of like Dr. Jekyll wanting to know more about Hyde another great PreCode Miriam Hopkins film. But this screening is of the MoMA To Save and Project film preservation program and is a recently printed 35mm print made from the original negative that played to rave reviews at last years TCM Film Festival.One of the most daring PreCode films ever produced this audacious film has been credited with being a catalyst for the creation of the Roman Catholic Church's National Legion of Decency. It was banned in Pennsylvania and Ohio and Joe Breen ordered the film to never be rereleased again once the Production Code came into effect in June of 1934. For many classic film fans 1933's The Story of Temple Drake has long been something of a holy grail. Based on William Faulkner's novel Sanctuary the story of a young Southern dbutante with a wild side created a huge scandal upon its original release. The film was quickly pulled from release and went largely unseen for decades. Until now.

	schema:headline " Most believable portrayal of PTSD";
	schema:reviewBody "The background of the story is that Temple DrakeMiriam Hopkins is the wild somewhat spoiled granddaughter of a wellrespected Judge in a rural community. She rather enjoys staying out late bringing her dates to the brink sexually and then leaving them cold. Temple has an earnest proposal of marriage from local defense attorney Stephen Benbow William Gargan. However Temple turns him down because she likes him too much and loves him too little. At a party one night wanting to get away from Stephen and his earnest intentions she grabs one of her less serious beaus and they go off in search of a drink. They find the backwoods joint they seek but it is hardly a society haunt. Their car crashes just before they get there and this particular night the place is full of bootleggers getting ready to make a shipment and one real bad character in particular the aptly named Trigger Jack LaRue.The art direction cinematography underscoring rare for a film of this era and atmosphere in general allow the tension to build and let you know that violence is ahead for this young woman. The question is when and by whom. The answer is in the barn the next morning by Trigger. When a simpleminded boy that has been left outside the barn to keep watch over her makes a comment that Trigger should leave her alone Trigger shoots him dead. Afterwards Trigger hauls Temple back to the city with him like she is some kind of wild kitten he has found and claimed for himself.

Another shock months after the rape finally brings Temple back into the real world and causes her to deobjectify herself.The cast is just perfect in this one. Miriam Hopkins was always wonderful at morally ambiguous roles and here she runs the gamut from tease to terrified to catatonic in a performance that is electrifying. Irving Prechel once again plays a type of deviant. No wonder he switched to directing after all of the weird roles he was given by Paramount. As for Jack La Rue he is perfect as the completely immoral predator who thinks everyone and everything exists in this world just to give him a laugh. It's a wonder he didn't get better and bigger roles with performances such as this.I've talked to people who have no compassion for Temple after watching this film. They can't figure out why she stays with Trigger after he rapes her when she has probably had plenty of chances to get away. It's obvious she's suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and Stockholm Syndrome. The realistic portrayal of a person in such circumstances puts this film decades ahead of its time psychologically. Compare the way Temple acts after being raped by Trigger in this film and then go watch Lee Remmick's portrayal of a rape victim in 1959 in the excellent Anatomy of a Murder. She talks to defense attorney James Stewart about the crime as calmly and coolly as one might describe how their car ran off the road and hit a traffic sign.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys precode film. There are good quality copies of this old film out there.".

	onyx:emotionText "The background of the story is that Temple DrakeMiriam Hopkins is the wild somewhat spoiled granddaughter of a wellrespected Judge in a rural community. She rather enjoys staying out late bringing her dates to the brink sexually and then leaving them cold. Temple has an earnest proposal of marriage from local defense attorney Stephen Benbow William Gargan. However Temple turns him down because she likes him too much and loves him too little. At a party one night wanting to get away from Stephen and his earnest intentions she grabs one of her less serious beaus and they go off in search of a drink. They find the backwoods joint they seek but it is hardly a society haunt. Their car crashes just before they get there and this particular night the place is full of bootleggers getting ready to make a shipment and one real bad character in particular the aptly named Trigger Jack LaRue.The art direction cinematography underscoring rare for a film of this era and atmosphere in general allow the tension to build and let you know that violence is ahead for this young woman. The question is when and by whom. The answer is in the barn the next morning by Trigger. When a simpleminded boy that has been left outside the barn to keep watch over her makes a comment that Trigger should leave her alone Trigger shoots him dead. Afterwards Trigger hauls Temple back to the city with him like she is some kind of wild kitten he has found and claimed for himself. She stays there with him in a shabby little room scantily dressed and at his disposal as his personal plaything. Another shock months after the rape finally brings Temple back into the real world and causes her to deobjectify herself.The cast is just perfect in this one.

Eventually Temple is able to break free of this monster...and walks into the middle of a court case being defended by Benbow...and if she talks about her trials she could help get Benbow's client acquitted. But this also means talking about her ordeal in front of folks....during an era where no one would dare talk about this.Fortunately while the content is rather racy the rape was NEVER shown and was handled tastefully. And surprisingly the topic of rape was treated rather fairly considering this was an era when women were often blamed for the assault.

This is one of the films that brought on the Hayes decision to censor moviesand you can see why. It's packed full of the things that make Precode great sex booze violence and suggestive dialogue. Miriam Hopkins is perfectly cast as the Southern socialite of the title who parties all night with all sorts of men as her wise black maid says her doting oblivious rich grandfather really SHOULD look at her underwear! but is really a pricktease. At least she only does what she wants. Hopkins is convincing with her brittle Southern accent and her mannerisms. So when Temple gets kidnapped by a gangster after witnessing a murder she's shocked. Jack LaRue is fantastic as the sinister yet somehow attractive Trigger. His performance is so good that it really belongs up there with Muni Cagney Robinson etc in those famous Warners gangster films. He rapes Hopkins yet we wonder if she isn't staying with him by her own choice. Eventually an old lawyer flame of Temple's finds her cohabiting with LaRue which sets off a string of events that lead to Temple being put on trial. I felt perhaps the last 20 minutes or so took some of the heat off the film I don't really like courtroom drama and the guy playing the exboyfriend is boring as heck but Hopkins is very very good on the stand. The sleazy seedy atmosphere of this film is maintained well throughout it fairly reeks of sex. Definitely worth seeing.".

He said he then forgot about it but that didn't stop it becoming a sensation. It would be nice to think that Faulkner could have realised a nice profit but with his usual luck the publisher that he had given the book to Harrison Smith went bankrupt six months after Sanctuary was published and so he received almost no royalties. The only money he made from it was to come from Hollywood. By the time Sanctuary was ready to be filmed in 1933 the novel had been denounced as obscene and degrading. The Hays office became involved by informing Paramount that neither the film nor the credits were allowed to mention the title so Paramount compromised by calling it The Story of Temple Drake hoping the heroine's name would cause the public to remember the book's scandal.George Raft who had been scheduled to star pulled out. He had no intention of hurting his newly won box office allure by playing a sadistic gangster who had no sympathetic qualities. He had already played a pretty despicable gangster with both Miriam Hopkins and Mae Clarke so there was method in his rejection. Probably the only role rejection that actually helped his career. Jack La Rue was given the assignment and it certainly didn't catapult him to stardom. He played Trigger in the book it was Popeye a city punk living in the Mississippi hill country.Temple Drake Hopkins Southern belle and grand daughter of prominent judge has rejected Stephen Benbow's marriage proposal as she finds him too serious and unromantic. She craves excitement and unfortunately finds it. Exiting a stuffy party with inebriated Toddy William Collier Jnr. she is plunged into a nightmare world when their car overturns and they seek shelter at an abandoned mansion with a group of misfits. There's a baby in a wood box so the rats don't get it a cretinous teenager Tommy a worn down woman Florence Eldridge Frederic March's wife and a couple of men who wouldn't be out of place in Deliverance. The rape scene between Temple and Trigger a sadistic city gangster is very powerful. The film drips with sexuality and decadence and the artfully lit soft focus photography of Karl Struss went far to diffuse the story's more shocking implications.Trigger kills Tommy who has appointed himself Temple's guardian and is determined to see no harm comes to her. Trigger takes a shell shocked Temple into the city to establish her in a brothel. Goodwin the wonderful character actor Irving Pichel one of the men from the house goes to the police to report Tommy's murder and suddenly finds himself charged. Of course Benbow is assigned to the case and it is up to him to find Temple and convince her to testify and with it destroy her character!!!! Temple Drake was a challenging role and Miriam Hopkins in one of her best screen performances gives it everything she has. Her scene in the old house where she suddenly realises this is real and there is no escape she starts to really cry and makes you believe in her. Jack La Rue is simply chilling as Trigger a thug with no redeeming qualities. It is a pity it didn't lead to bigger and better parts but he could always be proud of his performance in The Story of Temple Drake.".

	schema:headline " Hopkins Steals the Show in Dirty Little PreCode";
	schema:reviewBody "Story of Temple Drake The 1933  out of 4 Notorious precode tells the story of Temple Drake Miriam Hopkins a Southern Belle who uses her beauty to turn men on only to quickly throw water on them. To Temple turning men on is just a joke but when a date takes her to a dangerous bar she's quickly held hostage by a bootlegger named Trigger Jack LaRue who will stop at nothing to feed his lust. THE STORY OF TEMPLE DRAKE was highly controversial when it was first released and in large part it was one of the main reasons that the Hayes Office would have to finally stand up and keep on eye out for the products being released by Hollywood. Seen today the film is certainly less shocking but there's no doubt that the subject matter is still rather touchy and especially the wannabe bad girl who finally gets broken down when sexually physically and mentally abused by an evil man. I think the best thing going for the film is the performance by Hopkins who was clearly born to play this role. Even though the film runs a very short 70minutes and a lot of the material from the William Faulkner novel has been left out the character of Temple Drake still goes through quite a bit of developments. Hopkins nails all of them and I really loved the early scenes where she was just playing the men to get them worked up so that she could just dump them and then move onto the next. These scenes with the actress are perfectly done but she also handles the later moments when she's terrified of what's going to happen to her and then of course at the end when she's broken down. I was also impressed with LaRue who gets to shine even if the screenplay doesn't do too much justice to him. William Gargan plays the lawyer who also just happens to be in love with Drake and he too is pretty good. Flrence Eldridge really stands out in her role and those with a quick eye can spot John Carradine in the courtroom. The precode elements are somewhat strong with a rape and several sexual moments with Hopkins either stripping down or showing off her legs. The most notorious scene happens when she strips down to her bra and panties only to have one of the thugs rip off a coat that she's wearing and the viewer gets even more of a glimpse of her. At 70minutes the film moves extremely fast and there's no question that film buffs will want to search this one out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Miriam Hopkins portrays the conflicted Temple Drake in this tale of rape and murder that must have set film goers on their ear when it was initially released. Not only are there allusions to prostitution and illicit sex but treatments of subjects that would be considered controversial even today in terms of political correctness. I refer to attorney Stephen Benbow William Gargan calling out 'Boy' to a black waiter at a party and another scene that reverses the stereotype when a black man responds to Toddy Gowan William Collier Jr. coming out of his drunken stupor at the railroad station  You askin' me white man? This is why films of an earlier era genuinely fascinate me. Not to mention how thin a plot could often be in order to advance the story. Wouldn't anyone have noticed that when Benbow issued the subpoena he stated to Trigger Jack La Rue and Temple Drake that he was presenting it to both of them. How would that subpoena have involved Temple since Benbow had no idea she would even be there which was certainly more than evident when he expressed his shock and surprise to see her with him. Sometimes I wonder how a director or the principals in a scene would let something like that go by.It wouldn't be unusual in the Thirties to see a story like this in one of those exploitation flicks dealing with the same type of subject matter. A few titles that come to mind would be Gambling With Souls 1936 Slaves in Bondage 1937 and Mad Youth 1940 all having to do in one way or another with the theme of prostitution. To see it here in a more or less mainstream film must have been quite a shock for it's time perhaps even making it difficult for some movie goers to even concentrate on the story.The finale does allow the title character a redemptive moment by having her summon the courage to testify against her evil captor but at the same time the picture leaves a lot more questions for the viewer than it answers. How is it for example that no one ever made mention of the car crash that resulted in Toddy and Temple heading for the Godwin house in the first place? It's not like the aftermath of the accident would have disappeared once the story turned into a murder investigation.".

Both novels have greater complexity and moral ambiguity than the screenplay for The Story of Temple Drake could possibly capture in 70 minutes of film. The movie lacks Faulkner's depiction of how rich and poor don't have equal access to justice but does portray how those who enjoy an elevated social standing aren't always more virtuous than those they look down upon. The elaborate film sets illustrate this when Temple crosses the divide between the elegant party scene and the bootleggers' foreboding farmhouse. In the novel the lawyer Benbow whose first name is Horace is less enamored of Temple and much more concerned with defending his client Lee Goodwin and Goodwin's companion Ruby Lemarr from prejudices both legal and social. In the film Ruby briefly alludes to prostituting herself in order to get Lee out of prison.SPOILER The sudden ending of the film is the opposite of what happens in the book. Suffice it to say that in Sanctuary Temple is untroubled by conscience and unswayed by Benbow. The bad guy gets away and the good guy doesn't. It's my favorite of Faulkner's early novels.Miriam Hopkins does well portraying the two sides of Temple Drake with a stronger Southern accent than anyone else in the film. Florence Eldridge convincingly conveys her contempt for Temple. Jack La Rue shoots daggers with his depthless eyes but the screenplay can't possibly capture the complexity of Trigger's character known as Popeye in Faulkner's underrated novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "This precode film an adaptation of William Faulkner's scandalous book 'Sanctuary' is notorious from the era. Temple Drake Miriam Hopkins is a wild child who likes to see a lot of men and stay out late. She turns down a prominent lawyer's proposal for marriage because she says I ain't no good. One night after a car crash she gets stranded at an old farmhouse with a group of depraved men and one ends up raping her after murdering another who is trying to watch over her.Hopkins is fantastic in what is one of her best performances and Jack La Rue may be even better. The atmosphere director Stephen Roberts creates is very dark and he uses excellent camera angles and shadows. What starts off as lightness and gaiety at a party turns to darkness tension and ultimately horror. The film zips along at 70 minutes and the story is well told.The problem conservatives in the 1930's had with the film  and this was the one that supposedly led to the formation of the Catholic League of Decency ultimately spurring on the Hays Code  are laughable today. The violence is not out of the ordinary even for the period and the 'sex' is not sex it's rape though I don't think that is what they were appalled by. Faulkner's book has more salacious details e.g. a corncob and the character 'Red' but these are omitted in the film and there are more sordid precode films.On the other hand there are several possible problematic areas that went through my mind while I watched this film 85 years later. There are lots of judgmental comments from the townsfolk about the morals of Temple Drake and clearly there is an unspoken double standard against women who want to stay out late and see a lot of men. Another woman criticizes her for burning their gas eating their food spending their money and not giving them anything. After she's gone through a horrific ordeal she seems to feel guilty about it having dishonored herself and her family as if she were at fault and not the victim of horrible crimes. Simply talking about it seems disgraceful and reflects an ugly societal stigma of shame that is so very wrong.Despite those troubles I see her as a liberated strong character one that we empathize with and one who is a hero. She's in control of her sexuality telling a man 'that's enough' while kissing him in the car even though it frustrates him. At the farmhouse with all of those lecherous men around her she finds herself in a situation like that in 'Deliverance' and multiple times she seeks ways of getting out of there but a thunderstorm makes it impossible. We really feel for her and feel her terror. After getting raped the look on her face while being driven away by her rapist and now captor reflects horror and PTSD. In a series of fantastic closeups Hopkins looks overwhelmed and trapped in the place La Rue takes her and later when she does try to leave he knocks her around. What absolute evil we see when he tells her I got your number and smirks and how fantastic is it that she eventually shoots this guy and escapes. And even more so how fantastic is it that unlike the book she tells the truth about the whole thing saving someone from being wrongfully convicted? I see her as a survivor and a positive figure. Maybe this is what a factor in the uproar over the film for how she can fit into one of the two female types  good or bad?".

Temple appears to be playing all the men in her life with no idea who was the one she wanted. While this is not as dark as Faulkner's book it is based on it has plenty of darkness with the car accident and the moon shiners wrecked house. The version on TCM was short at 69 minutes but it has a lot of action and is a credit to director Stephen Roberts who does not let the action bog down much. The court room scenes are good too. Roberts would die at age 40 which is a shame since he had a lot of experience directing films.As the code folks and the Catholics banned this film for film content even when it was toned down for release it would be very interesting if an uncut version did exist.

She is also a little wild and enjoys teasing the young men and then leaving them emptyhanded and wanting more. Unfortunately as luck would have it she decides to go riding in a car one night with a young man named Toddy Gowan William Collier Jr. who just happens to be quite intoxicated. Naturally because he is so impaired he crashes the car in the process. Fortunately neither he nor Temple are badly hurt and it's at this point that some bootleggers find them and take them back to their house. Things then go from bad to worse when the young man proceeds to get even more intoxicated while a couple of the bootleggers try to make time with Templedespite the fact that Temple wants nothing to do with any of them. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it I will just say that even though this film was made over 70 years ago it still manages to impress audiences even today. Based on the rather explicit book Sanctuary by William Faulkner this movie gained some notoriety for what was implied rather than actually shown on the screen. Likewise I should also mention that this film was produced a year before the Hays Code was introduced which greatly limited content of a controversial nature. In any case I thought Miriam Hopkins was sensational in the lead role and I definitely recommend this film to those who might enjoy a movie from this particular era. I have rated it accordingly.".

She is also a little wild and enjoys teasing the young men and then leaving them emptyhanded and wanting more. Unfortunately as luck would have it she decides to go riding in a car one night with a young man named Toddy Gowan William Collier Jr. who just happens to be quite intoxicated. Naturally because he is so impaired he crashes the car in the process.

But this is a different Harold Ramis. What he has fashioned is film noir all the way.John Cusack works perfectly with the material not so much in a Humphrey Bogart kind of way as in a Fred MacMurray sort of way. He's the average guy protagonist. He just happens to be a Witchita attorney for a Kansas City political boss.The film begins when Charlie Arglist Cusack with over two million in stolen cash jumps into the car with partnerincrime Vic Cavanaugh Billy Bob Thornton. Throughout the evening Charlie encounters strip club owner Renata Connie Nielsen and drunken colleague Pete Van Heuten Oliver Platt his fist scenestealer in a number of years.The character of Pete offers some great comic relief to the story. He's Charlie's best friend drunk on Christmas Eve. He's also married to Charlie's exwife and hating it. This leads to an awkward encounter with Charlie's kids and former inlaws.Thornton is still finding new ways of being corrupt and amoral. Connie Nielsen is a classic femme fatal in the 1940s style. Mike Starr is good as usual playing a menacing mob enforcer. Randy Quaid does his usual best as Kansas City mobster Bill Guerarrd. And bit player Ned Bellamy cast as a strip club bouncer with Mom issues adds some fine scenes.This is about the most straightforward noir I've seen since Lawrence Kasdan's Body Heat but as directed by Ramis it feels slightly like a Coen brothers movie with the occasional comic twists to the genre and the casting choices of Thornton The Man Who Wasn't There and Starr Miller's Crossing.It's not the best movie of the year. But it's good for people who aren't so anxious for a white Christmas.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something about a dark violent and offensive Christmas movie that sends me through the roof. I loved 'Bad Santa' and 'Die Hard' is my second favorite Christmas film if you can call it that I can of all time. 'The Ice Harvest' looked very entertaining from it's previews and starred a talented group of actors including John Cusack Grosse Point Blank Billy Bob Thorton Bad Santa Connie Nielsen Gladiator the hilarious Randy Quaid National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and the even more hilarious Oliver Platt Showtime's 'Huff'. 'The Ice Harvest' was even directed by the great Harold Ramis Caddyshack Groundhog's Day. Yes 'The Ice Harvest' had all ingredients to be a very decent black Christmas movie. In the first fifteen minutes of 'The Ice Harvest' I was sorely disappointed in it's quality but by twentyfive minutes in I enjoyed every dark minute. It is by far the most twisted Holiday movie I've seen dark sht real dark sht but I was enthralled through the lot of it. 'The Ice Harvest' is based on the notsowellknown novel. It follows bigtime deadbeat dad mob lawyer Charlie Aglist John Cusack. Charlie decides he wants to make it big so with the help of a local Witchita goon Vic Cavanaugh Billy Bob Thorton he rips off his violent mob boss client Bill Guerrard Randy Quaid. This all happens on Christmas Eve day and he and Vic leave Witicha that night. All they have to do is act normal for 24 hours  that turns to DISASTER! The two somehow get pursued by the mob deal with a perky but wise badass business lady Renita Connie Nielsen get the cops involved and somehow manage to get Charlie's exwife's new drunken dipsht husband Pete Oliver Platt involved. It's going to be one hell of a night!Like I said before 'The Ice Harvest' is very slow during the start but really speeds up twenty  thirty minutes into it. The writing is solid for the most part some of it is unbelievable but the reason I liked it so much was because it was unpredictable. In the theater I honestly had no clue what was going to happen next and that is damn hard to find in a film now days. Harold Ramis does another great job directing this and the cast is fabulous. Cusack and Thorton shine in their roles Quaid is surprisingly perfect as a cutthroat mobster Connie Nielsen handles her role okay for the most part but the real standout is Oliver Platt. Platt is absolutely hysterical every second he is on the screen including a hilarious scene with him showing up drunk at his uptight parentsinlaw's house for Christmas Eve dinner. 'The Ice Harvest' is enjoyable but it is nothing brilliant. It has it's flaws and displays them but 'The Ice Harvest' wasn't meant to be groundbreaking just entertaining which it wildly succeeds in.I was surprised to hear this was doing terrible in the box office. I think a lot of people would get a kick out of it at least those who had the stomach for it. 'The Ice Harvest' is very violent dark and sick and some of the more conservative and weakhearted movie goers will find it's material offensive and pure rubbish. I personally loved it because it was sick and unpredictable. It was no Oscar contender but it kept me on the edge of my seat. I haven't been on the edge of my seat in a movie theater in a long time. Thank you for another fun and quirky black comedy Harold Ramis. Grade B screened at AMC Deer Valley 30 Phoenix Arizona 120205".

	schema:reviewBody "The Ice Harvest is attractive to two audiences those being the film noir andor crime fans and the people who think a movie with Cusack and Thornton directed by exGhostbuster Ramis is going to be a mishapriddled caper comedy. Unfortunately this film's heart lies outside of the compatibility of either. It's technically not a crime film because the story begins immediately as the crime ends a 2 million embezzlement scheme that is never explained. Also the film is certainly not a comedy within the ballpark of any other work by Harold Ramis. What Ramis has made is a film that is more of a dramatic exercise in cinematic mood and lowkey atmosphere. The good news is that he pulls it off very well.The Ice Harvest happens to be one of the movies I watch at Christmastime because the film is actually so welldirected and so wellshot that it captures that constantly soughtafter perfect cozy winter atmosphere on film. The events of the story occur over the course of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day all in the small and quiet town of Wichita KA. No matter how much time it spends during the outlandish drunken bouts of Oliver Platt or the destructive tantrums of Ned Bellamy's overaggressive bartender The Ice Harvest never breaks its meticulous feeling and image for one moment.Even though it's not what is expected by the vast majority of those who have seen it or those who mean to it does have impressionistic characteristics of those expectations that deliver sensationally such as Thornton's tremendously entertaining time on screen and the thicket of distrust that ushers in over the course of the holidays succeeding his and Cusack's socalled perfect crime. However these are purely part of the style rather than the substance. The plot is conjecture of film noir rather than the real deal as most of the twists are nearly meant to be somewhat obvious or expected. Really the essence of the story lies in Cusack's descent into complete detachment from any virtue in life feeling as if he's only an observer when encountering darkly humorous yet brooding things over his Christmas.The Ice Harvest is not really a comedy and not really a film noir. Actually it bears no genre per se. Simply it's a wonderful installment in the phantom subgenre of cinematic moodiness.".

It's a subtle but crucial difference and a successful change in tone for director Harold Ramis. The suspenseful yet surreally funny Kansasset story of nervous Mob lawyer John Cusack teaming up with laidback yet ruthless Billy Bob Thornton to steal over 2 million from Cusack's boss Randy Quaid only to find themselves stuck in Wichita by an ice storm and all manner of goofups and goofballs with a hit man on their tail toboot TIH tells its twisted tale as if my fave thriller author Jim Thompson THE GRIFTERS THE GETAWAY POP. 1280 among others wrote it in a jovial mood  though I suspect that in a jovial mood Thompson would have been more likely to smirk than bellylaugh. Set on Christmas Eve TIH starts with the best unexpected holidaythemed credits since 1947's LADY IN THE LAKE and only gets more gleefully malevolent from there. You know our antiheroes are literally in for a blue Christmas thanks to Alar Kivilo's sleek azuretinged photography. Cusack and Thornton make such a good team that I'm now eager to rent their previous collaboration PUSHING TIN even though I've heard mixed reviews of that too. Oliver Platt has been touted as TIH's scenestealer in the role of Cusack's friend who stole his wife and having lived to regret it spends the whole film getting drunk and hilariously obnoxious. Platt's a hoot all right but Thornton has the slyest lines his explanation of how his wife ends up killed by the hit man is evilly funny all the more so for Thornton's matteroffact delivery. Connie Nielsen also deserves kudos for stealing her own scenes more subtly and sensuously as the sexy owner of The Sweet Cage one of many strip joints in town that Cusack frequents I came away from the movie thinking strip joints must be a cottage industry in Wichita. Nielsen looks like a Petty Girl or Varga Girl come to life fresh from the pages of a vintage Esquire issue. If you want a wicked little tongueincheek noir as an antidote to the season's holiday cheer TIH may well be your cup of hemlock. When TIH comes out on DVD rent it along with BAD SANTA FARGO andor GROSSE POINTE BLANK and have yourself a merry little day of eccentric movie mayhem!".

Connie Nielsen also deserves kudos for stealing her own scenes more subtly and sensuously as the sexy owner of The Sweet Cage one of many strip joints in town that Cusack frequents I came away from the movie thinking strip joints must be a cottage industry in Wichita. Nielsen looks like a Petty Girl or Varga Girl come to life fresh from the pages of a vintage Esquire issue. If you want a wicked little tongueincheek noir as an antidote to the season's holiday cheer TIH may well be your cup of hemlock. When TIH comes out on DVD rent it along with BAD SANTA FARGO andor GROSSE POINTE BLANK and have yourself a merry little day of eccentric movie mayhem!";

	schema:reviewBody "Take the sardonic wit of Prizzi's Honor or Body Heat. Combine with nottoo bright characters working a shady deal for quick riches in a caper that could have been written by Elmore Leonard. That's what you have in The Ice Harvest a highly entertaining dark comedy.It's Christmas Eve during a terrible ice storm in Kansas City. Charlie John Cusack and Vic Billy Bob Thornton have stolen a bundle from the mob. This could create an awkward situation for Charlie if they don't get out of town fast. He's the lawyer for the local mob boss Bill Randy Quaid who has a terrible temper.So as not to arouse suspicion Vic and Charlie go their separate ways early in the evening. Both have family duties and Charlie has other things to take care of. There's the beautiful Renata Connie Nielson for one. And Pete Oliver Platt who shares part of Charlie's past. Life becomes more complicated as the night goes on and Charlie meets up again with Vic. More twists and surprises follow.I almost didn't go to this movie because the teaser for the Austin Film Festival made it look like a CusackThornton buddy movie and I'm tired of the character Thornton keeps playing. Happily Thornton is not on screen much. This is John Cusack's movie and he has created an interesting unhappy man looking for a way out. Oliver Platt who steals every scene he's in provides comic relief and story exposition.Director Harold Ramis introduced the film and did a QA afterwards. He talked about how the snowstorm in the book became an ice storm because that's the weather they had to work with. He talked about the many ideas Cusack and Platt brought to their characters. New to me was Connie Nielson originally from Denmark. Ramis said she told him she was channeling Jessica Rabbit in the part of the femme fatale. I think she succeeded. Kudos also to Pulitzerprize winning author Richard Russo and Robert Benton for a snappy script.".

It's been a while since I've seen such a successful mixture of black comedy and filmnoirthriller.Charlie John Cusack a Kansas attorney on the verge of a burnout and his associate Vic Billy Bob Thornton have just stolen 2 million  from their boss on Christmas Eve. They're planning on leaving that same night to enjoy their money elsewhere. Charlie also is in love with the beautiful stripclubowner Renata and hopes that his newly earned dollars will make a fine argument to persuade her to go with him. But an upcoming ice storm makes it very difficult to leave the town immediately. On top of that a mysterious figure has arrived in Wichita informing all over the place about Charlie. It will turn out to be a night full of surprises where everyone seems to be playing dark and deceiving games.This movie relies on the statement Money is the root of all evil. It's slightly disturbing to see how far one will go when a considerable amount of money is involved. Maybe not all of the twists and turns in the plot are unpredictable but there are enough of them to keep it interesting all this at a fairly high pace. They provide enough enjoyable moments with the trunkscene as one of the highlights. This particular scene leads to a funny discussion between Charlie and Vic about a Mercedes and a Lincoln. All this in order to say that the script and dialogues are more than decent.Cusack and Thornton deliver the goods never overacting it. Besides them there's also a striking performance by Connie Nielsen as femmefatale Renata and I never thought that a completely drunk Oliver Platt as Charlie's drinking buddy could be so hilarious. And it was nice to see Mike Starr and Randy Quaid in some smaller roles. So the complete cast pulls it off quite good.Maybe THE ICE HARVEST with the appropriate tagline Thick Thieves. Thin Ice. by the way isn't a movie for a wide audience because of the grim  black humor and the occasional pretty violent outbursts. But it sure is a welcome alternative for mainstream movies and highly recommended for filmnoirfans.".

I can't think of as inaccurately marketed a movie in recent years. The trailers and posters made it looked like a caper comedy and the quotes made it sound like this year's Bad Santa. It's neither. As others here have said it's a straight noir. Sure there are some hilarious moments but the film is not a comedy. It's dark slow and character driven with John Cusack exhibiting his very best wry understatement. It's his core of sweetness  never overtly revealed but always present  set against the oppressive bleakness of a rainy Christmas eve in and around Wichita strip clubs and the sordid characters who meander in and out of them that keeps the film in balance. Connie Nielsen Billy Bob Thornton Randy Quaid and Oliver Platt all turn in perfectly tuned performances but Cusack with his lowkey mesmerizing timing is the center.Anyway if you're looking for a fastmoving comedy look elsewhere.

Oliver Platt provides most of the comic relief and it is great to see Randy Quaid in a new movie. The film is a perfect stab at the film noir genre. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes any of the actors or just want a nice late night movie. More than likely you will walk away satisfied.".

Its plot about the complications that set in after a seemingly perfectlyexecuted heist doesn't sound particularly original and of course it isn't but a group of totally untrustworthy characters a series of neat twists and plenty of dark humour combine together to make this a movie that's hugely enjoyable from start to finish.On Christmas Eve in Wichita Kansas mob lawyer Charlie Arglist John Cusack and his partnerincrime Vic Cavanaugh Billy Bob Thornton successfully relieve their employer of more than 2 million. Unfortunately their employer is Kansas City crime boss Bill Guerrard Randy Quaid who very quickly recognises who was responsible for the theft and dispatches one of his henchmen Roy Gelles Mike Starr to hunt them down. Charlie and Vic's plan to get out of Kansas immediately after the heist has to be put on hold when an ice storm suddenly envelops Wichita and the two men decide to split up until the road conditions improve.Charlie goes to a strip club called The Sweet Cage where he meets up with its sexy proprietor Renata Crest Connie Neilsen. He's infatuated by her and so when she tells him she wants to recover a photograph of a local councilman pictured in circumstances that could potentially cause him tremendous embarrassment Charlie agrees to help out. He gets anxious when he twice sees a large man making enquiries about him and so after recovering the photograph for Renata goes to a restaurant to warn Vic who seems completely unconcerned. As he starts to leave the restaurant a member of staff asks Charlie to take his friend Pete Oliver Platt home because he's extremely drunk.Pete is married to Charlie's exwife and so taking him home leads to an uncomfortable meeting with her his children and her parents. Later he takes the photograph to Renata at her club but then has to go on to help Vic when he finally recognises what danger he's in. A whole series of violent developments then follow.Charlie Arglist is an interesting character because his experiences in life have left him worldweary disillusioned and cynical but despite this his essential decency leads him into helping others even when doing so is obviously not in his own best interest. John Cusack's expressions demeanour and skill in delivering his witty dialogue are very effective in conveying his character's complexities in a way that's both understated and highly entertaining. Billy Bob Thornton and Connie Neilsen are both wellcast in their roles and Oliver Platt is outrageously funny as Charlie's friend who enjoys intoxication because it distracts him from the lack of respect and enjoyment that he derives from the rest of his life.The Ice Harvest is wellpaced sleazy and often violent but its strongest elements are its interesting characters and its wonderful humour.".

John Cusack fails to give a performance that would generate any great interest or sympathy and Oliver Platt gives a performance that is awful studied and unfunny pretty much ruining any chance of the film being particularly good. The writing is enough to betray Lara Phillips and Billy Bob Thornton who seems to do every caper film these days good or bad without any help from the actors because their characters are completely predictable.I have little else to say here about it. I would have rated it even lower but I really enjoyed the brief scene with Randy Quaid as a menacing mobster who feels like a loser. He had more character in that 5 minute scene than anybody else in the movie did with much more time. This movie really offers no surprises and would probably only please someone who had very little experience with caper films. It's like the sickly cousin of Fargo.

	schema:headline " A movie in search of a mood";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe that Richard Russo and Robert Benton penned this screenplay. Maybe their script was much better than the final product. Because Harold Ramis completely botches this film not knowing whether he wants to make a comedy black comedy straight noir or comedic noir. He tries them all and fails miserably.I'm not averse to antiholiday films. I rather enjoy them if they're done well. But to compare The Ice Harvest to say Bad Santa is akin to comparing my stickfigure doodles to a Van Gogh.The film never is able to strike the right mood. The plot actually had potential and I always enjoy watching Connie Nielsen. Though if you want to see what a tremendous actress she really is avoid this piece of crap and rent the Danish film Brothers 2004. Trust me you won't be disappointed.Ramis tries very hard to find a happy medium between straight noir and dark comedy. Trouble is even dark comedy needs to be funny. And with the exception of a broadlyplayed performance by Oliver Platt  he does have one very funny line delivered perfectly  none of the characters is able to find the humor beneath all this.Cusack seems woefully out of place probably desperately wishing he were in something as funny as Grosse Pointe Blank 1997 or as sinister as The Grifters 1990.

	onyx:emotionText "I can't believe that Richard Russo and Robert Benton penned this screenplay. Maybe their script was much better than the final product. Because Harold Ramis completely botches this film not knowing whether he wants to make a comedy black comedy straight noir or comedic noir. He tries them all and fails miserably.I'm not averse to antiholiday films. I rather enjoy them if they're done well. But to compare The Ice Harvest to say Bad Santa is akin to comparing my stickfigure doodles to a Van Gogh.The film never is able to strike the right mood. The plot actually had potential and I always enjoy watching Connie Nielsen. Though if you want to see what a tremendous actress she really is avoid this piece of crap and rent the Danish film Brothers 2004. Trust me you won't be disappointed.Ramis tries very hard to find a happy medium between straight noir and dark comedy. Trouble is even dark comedy needs to be funny. And with the exception of a broadlyplayed performance by Oliver Platt  he does have one very funny line delivered perfectly  none of the characters is able to find the humor beneath all this.Cusack seems woefully out of place probably desperately wishing he were in something as funny as Grosse Pointe Blank 1997 or as sinister as The Grifters 1990. His shtick gets tiresome after a few minutes and even Nielsen's sultry femme fatale she does look awfully good I must admit can't rescue this film.Ramis really does seem out of his league here.

	schema:headline " The Ice Harvest Left This Viewer Cold";
	schema:reviewBody "I read some early reviews of The Ice Harvest which suggested it was an indietype film that probably wouldn't do well commercially but which deserved better. One of those reviews even called The Ice Harvest a dark comedy reminiscent of Bad Santa. Since I'm fond of dark comedy and because I think Bad Santa is hysterical. I couldn't wait to buy a ticket to The Ice Harvest. While all movie reviews are subjective to one degree or another seeing as how each relies on the opinion of the reviewer I nevertheless was sorely disappointed and a little surprised at just how awful The Ice Harvest is.The Ice Harvest takes place on Christmas Eve in Wichita Kansas. Lawyer Charlie Arglist John Cusack has stolen upwards of two million dollars from mob boss Bill Guerrard Randy Quaid. All he and his partner Vic Billy Bob Thornton want for Christmas is to get out of town before their crime is discovered. Charlie and Vic simply need to act normal for a few hours and then escape the confines of Wichita with their riches.So Charlie continues to make his usual rounds of the strip clubs owned by the boss. At The Sweet Cage Charlie enjoys a quick drink with beautiful manager Renata Connie Nielsen a woman it's readily apparent he has some feelings for. It being Christmas Eve even bartender Sidney Ned Bellamy is a little chatty. But when Charlie takes a bathroom break he returns only to discover that one of the mob's henchmen is looking for him. That can't be a good sign! Charlie immediately gets on the phone to Vic who doesn't want to hear any of Charlie's concerns. He thinks Charlie is too paranoid and cautions him once again to act normal. Charlie eventually calms down enough to head for the next strip club on his route. But when he discovers that there's somebody looking for him there too he heads straight for Vic who is having a leisurely dinner at a good restaurant.Once again Vic gets Charlie calmed down. When the two separate again to go about their last minute business Charlie discovers his best friend Pete Oliver Platt has also spent the evening at the restaurant and is now utterly incapable of driving himself home. Pete who happens to have married Charlie's ex wife laments his life and begs Charlie to take him away. Charlie's unsympathetic however and brings Pete directly to his wife's parents home where the family is celebrating Christmas Eve.Facing the resentment of his former family and dealing with the very drunk Pete Charlie manages to disentangle himself and get back on track with the rest of his plans for the evening. But a citywide ice storm is slowing everything and everyone down and Charlie is getting more and more paranoid as the night wears on. He eventually begins to wonder who he can trust worries about who he can't trust and despairs of getting out of Wichita alive let alone with the cash.The Ice Harvest story line seemed to have a good premise with decent potential. The varying scenes however are neither funny nor particularly suspenseful unless you think drunks puking in cars is amusing or shootings you can see coming a mile away at all nerve wracking. There's nothing at all wrong with the acting. John Cusack who was brilliant in 2003's Identity is also quite good here. And Billy Bob Thornton is I think incapable of turning in a bad performance. But the best actors on the planet can't take an unfunny script and make it humorous nor can they take an ordinary screenplay and make it scary or suspenseful.Director Harold Ramis has an impressive comedy rsum including classics like Caddyshack Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day Ramis also wrote or cowrote some very funny films. I have no earthly idea what he thought when he signed on to direct The Ice Harvest. If he was looking for drama this particular script never builds to the point where it provides any. And if he was looking for comedy he should have turned around 180 degrees and gone in the opposite direction.The Ice Harvest is a short movie  less than an hour and a half  and it dragged. I couldn't wait for it to be over. The Ice Harvest may have had good intentions somewhere along the road to its creation and execution but the end result left me feeling completely cold.POLITICAL NOTES There's a brief subplot in the film involving a fervently religious local official who is caught on film engaged in a compromising act. His hypocrisy is obvious to everyone but him and that's something I see all too frequently in the real world where some politicians are concerned. While I certainly don't approve of or appreciate those politicians who demand everyone live to their stated and stringent moral standards it's even worse when the politician himself doesn't toe his own line.FAMILY SUITABILITY The Ice Harvest is rated R for violence language and sexuality and nudity. This isn't a movie for young children. They'll be utterly confused by a plot conveyed in mysterious bits and pieces even if they can handle the graphic violence and the matteroffact nudity found in seedy strip clubs. I frankly don't really recommend The Ice Harvest for anyone of any age but if you must see for yourself I'd keep those under the age of 16 at home or in a more appropriate venue.".

He thinks Charlie is too paranoid and cautions him once again to act normal. Charlie eventually calms down enough to head for the next strip club on his route. But when he discovers that there's somebody looking for him there too he heads straight for Vic who is having a leisurely dinner at a good restaurant.Once again Vic gets Charlie calmed down. When the two separate again to go about their last minute business Charlie discovers his best friend Pete Oliver Platt has also spent the evening at the restaurant and is now utterly incapable of driving himself home. Pete who happens to have married Charlie's ex wife laments his life and begs Charlie to take him away. Charlie's unsympathetic however and brings Pete directly to his wife's parents home where the family is celebrating Christmas Eve.Facing the resentment of his former family and dealing with the very drunk Pete Charlie manages to disentangle himself and get back on track with the rest of his plans for the evening. But a citywide ice storm is slowing everything and everyone down and Charlie is getting more and more paranoid as the night wears on. He eventually begins to wonder who he can trust worries about who he can't trust and despairs of getting out of Wichita alive let alone with the cash.The Ice Harvest story line seemed to have a good premise with decent potential. The varying scenes however are neither funny nor particularly suspenseful unless you think drunks puking in cars is amusing or shootings you can see coming a mile away at all nerve wracking. There's nothing at all wrong with the acting. John Cusack who was brilliant in 2003's Identity is also quite good here. And Billy Bob Thornton is I think incapable of turning in a bad performance. But the best actors on the planet can't take an unfunny script and make it humorous nor can they take an ordinary screenplay and make it scary or suspenseful.Director Harold Ramis has an impressive comedy rsum including classics like Caddyshack Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day Ramis also wrote or cowrote some very funny films. I have no earthly idea what he thought when he signed on to direct The Ice Harvest. If he was looking for drama this particular script never builds to the point where it provides any. And if he was looking for comedy he should have turned around 180 degrees and gone in the opposite direction.The Ice Harvest is a short movie  less than an hour and a half  and it dragged. I couldn't wait for it to be over. The Ice Harvest may have had good intentions somewhere along the road to its creation and execution but the end result left me feeling completely cold.POLITICAL NOTES There's a brief subplot in the film involving a fervently religious local official who is caught on film engaged in a compromising act. His hypocrisy is obvious to everyone but him and that's something I see all too frequently in the real world where some politicians are concerned. While I certainly don't approve of or appreciate those politicians who demand everyone live to their stated and stringent moral standards it's even worse when the politician himself doesn't toe his own line.FAMILY SUITABILITY The Ice Harvest is rated R for violence language and sexuality and nudity. This isn't a movie for young children. They'll be utterly confused by a plot conveyed in mysterious bits and pieces even if they can handle the graphic violence and the matteroffact nudity found in seedy strip clubs. I frankly don't really recommend The Ice Harvest for anyone of any age but if you must see for yourself I'd keep those under the age of 16 at home or in a more appropriate venue.";

The main character played by John Cusack is typical Cusack and maybe you'll like him the actor but his character is a bore and you don't really care that he's about to get whacked or almost whacked in scene after scene.

	schema:headline " A very good film with one of the greatest performances of the American theatre";
	schema:reviewBody "Jose Ferrer first performed Cyrano de Bergerac on Broadway in 1946 where it achieved a very successful run for a revival. Ferrer was highly acclaimed in the role and won a Tony for his performance. His success in the role enabled him to be the first actor to bring Cyrano to the big screen in English. This was in 1950 in a Stanley Kramerproduced film for which Ferrer won the Best Actor Oscar beating out such actors as James Stewart in Harvey William Holden in Sunset Blvd. and Spencer Tracy in the original Father of the Bride.Until the 1990 Gerard Depardieu Technicolor spectacular in French Ferrer's version of Cyrano was considered the one to see. But now Depardieu's film has unfairly thrown this 1950 version into neglect. Part of the reason perhaps is the budget involved in this film. Cowardly studio executives who were afraid that a film in blank verse would fail at the box office refused to give this film the kind of budget that Laurence Olivier had enjoyed in his 1940's Shakespeare films or the kind of budget that was used in films like the 1936 MGM version of Romeo and Juliet and the 1935 A Midsummer Night's Dream.And so this Cyrano looks more like a cheap Bmovie than a worthy film version of a classic play. There are no huge sets or spectacular camera shotsjust the play performed with only a couple of added scenes in ordinary prose rather than the English translation's blank verse on obvious Hollywood sound stages. But this film boasts what is certainly one of the greatest performances in the history of filmand especially American film. Jos Ferrer an often maligned actor accused of hamminess and overemphasis gives the performance of his life as Cyrano. His portrayal is in every way the equal of Depardieu's and as far as I am concerned even better. Depardieu relies on sincerity and subtle facial expressions. Ferrer also has these but he has in addition one of the most beautiful rich voices ever to come out of the theatreand magnificent enunciation as well. Unlike Depardieu who speaks the beautiful French verse as rapidly as if he were firing a machine gun as do the others in the French film Ferrer allows us to appreciate the rich poetry in Brian Hooker's translation long considered the greatest verse translation of a play into English. His portrayal is more flamboyant than Depardieu and he shows a heartbreaking sense of tragedy as he realizes that the beautiful Roxane will probably never be his. The big moment in the final scene is shattering in Ferrer's hands.As for the rest of the cast this is where the Depardieu and Ferrer versions differ. Depardieu's supporting cast was excellent but here Mala Powers is disappointingly ordinary and onenote though beautiful as Roxane and William Prince is quite good as Christian but Ralph Clanton as De Guiche is rather cartoonish an ordinary hissable villain until the last halfhour or so. The usually reliable Morris Carnovsky though is an excellent LeBret. The role of Ligniere the drunk has been eliminatedand his lines given to Rageauneau the pastry cook competently played by Lloyd Corrigan.There are a few cuts in this version as compared to Depardieu's but Brian Hooker's English translation is given its due prominence. Michael Gordon's direction is excellent and the duel at the theatre while not allowed to roam all over the location as in Depardieu's version is well done and more faithful in staging to author Edmond Rostand's intentions.This Cyrano however definitely should not be allowed to fade away in obscurity relegated to latenight TV where it is now often mutilated for commercial breaks. It should be restored and brought back to cable to be fully appreciated.".

He is comedic brave adventurous romantic selfsacrificing elegant pitiful nimblewitted gallant prideful humble he fully recognizes his shortcomings and most of all he is true to his code of honor.  This is the best job of acting that I have ever witnessed in the thousands of movies I have seen.I must confess that although I give the supporting cast a B  I would have chosen different actors for most of the roles including Roxanne.  However William Prince as Christian rates an A.  Perhaps at the time the producers didn't know what a classic they were creating and therefore didn't give as much thought to the casting as they might have otherwise.It is a shame that Ferrer never again approached the level of excellence he displayed in Cyrano.  But this does not detract from the honor I pay this actor who gave a 15 yearold boy an example to follow a REAL man.The best scene in the film is when Cyrano is dying in the courtyard at the nunnery and the best line in the film is when Cyrano challenges Death with his final words which sum up his life  and that is  my  white  plume.'".

It belongs to the preWorld War One era its central character however appears to me to be a latenineteenth century mind. He is a fabulous swordsman the bravest and most intelligent of soldiers and a man whose verylarge nose has destroyed all other aspects of his life. Believing he has been cheated by nature he takes out his vengeance upon the pretentious he appoints himself an avenging angel against all forms of fraud. Eventually this includes the flower of French nobility who dare to insult him. He is in love with his cousin Roxane the most beautiful woman at the French court but he consents to write love letters to her for his handsome courageous but ungifted friend perhaps to prove to himself that his creative talents might have won the love of the world's fairest ornament so long as she did not know he were the unattractive source of such beautiful utterance.When the beautiful young man is killed in the wars during which Cyrano becomes a popular hero he continues the deception. He brings Roxane in her abbey retreat court news and comforts her in her widowhood all the while opposing the tyrannical and overbearing new faction at court. Finally they attack him managing to keep his appointment with Roxane against medical advice although grievously wounded he makes a slip She finds out he was the author of the original love letters and Cyrano dies delirious inveighing against his ancient enemiesthe sins of the overbearing nobilitytotalitariansand claiming that he had kept his white plumehis honorunstained always despite all fears and temptations. He dies a symbol of a lost society and a betrayed Ageand she weeps for him at the end. This estimable film was produced by Stanley Kramer and directed by Michael Gordon. It presents a good deal of dialogue but the pace if deliberate it is also serviceable at almost all points. Carl Foreman wrote the screenplay from Brian Hooker's translation of the play and it still looks like a play at a few points. But the verydifficult dueling and war sections appeared to me to work very well as cinema. Franz Planer did the unusually dense BW cinematography original music was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin. The production was designed by Rudolph Sternad with set decorations by Edward G. Boyle. Dorothy Jeakins did the lovely gowns for Roxane. In this production Ferrer is arrogant and frequently superb. He roars he insinuates he flashes his intellect as poet the way other men do their rapiers and with a sword he shows himself to be seemingly beyond equal. His dispatching of an arrogant nobleman who tries to stop him from chasing a bad actor off the stage is the film's showpiece he finally kills him but not before delivering his ripostes and thrust in rhyme and offering the fellow a way out. Accepting dainties from a servant girl he takes only a sip of water and half a macaroonhis way of acknowledging the worth of her admiration and his freedom from weakness. He finally betrays himself at the end to Roxane as the author of her letters by quoting one to her in a light so dim he could not be reading it. Mala Powers is good as Roxane but not great. As her lover William Prince is very good and properly stiff. The presence of talents such as Lloyd Corrigan Morris Carnovsky Edgar Barrier as Cardinal Richelieu Virginia Christine and other fine actors helps the production's success. This is a difficult part to bring to life it requires a nasal bite in speech perfect diction charisma a suggestion of depth of soul high intelligence and even hubris as well as regard for others. Ferrer did the part about as well as it has ever been done on film one has only to compare his interpretation to those of others to appreciate the level of his triumph. It is an awardlevel achievement and the film while a bit stagey at several points is also beautiful memorable and very different in the attainments of its dialogue its poetry and its ideas.".

Jose Ferrer puts everyone else in the cast to shame with his performance of Cyrano.To be sure Cyrano de Bergerac is a one man play. All the other characters Rostand gave absolutely no depth to. Roxanne is a sweet young girl looking for romance Christian is a handsome dunce Comte de Guiche is a Snidely Whiplash villain. But Cyrano you have to be a real actor to play that one.Cyrano is a soldier writer swordsman even a gourmet of sorts. But that proboscis fills him with doubt when the opposite sex is concerned. He's a tortured soul and Ferrer gives THE interpretation of Cyrano. It will be so a hundred years from now. He's a swashbuckler to be sure but you certainly couldn't cast any of the normal movie swashbucklers in that part.I don't know if the MTV generation will feel like my classmate of years ago but if they turn away from music videos and watch this they will be treated to a once in a lifetime acting performance.".

Mr. Ferrer's contribution to the stage and screen can be best sampled as we watch him become Cyrano a man in love with his cousin Roxanne whose great fear is the possible rejection of the beautiful young woman in favor of the handsome and younger Christian.This beloved theater play by Edmond Rostand had been translated by Brian Hooker in what became the most familiar way American audiences met the illustrious French author. The screen play by Carl Foreman clarifies the text in ways that the movie going public of that era could relate to this man whose wit and charm outweighed his appearance which was dominated by a big nose that rendered him an unattractive man. The poetry of the play is preserved even though it is not done in verse like the original manuscript. Dimitri Tiomkin's score lent itself to the action.Mala Powers was a disappointment though. Yes she was a beauty but her Roxanne doesn't quite come across she is at a disadvantage playing opposite an icon of the theater like Mr. Ferrer who certainly had more experience. William Prince does a fair job as Christian. Morris Carnovsky another great stage actor appears as Le Bret and Ralph Clanton makes his contribution with his take of Guiche.Cyrano de Bergerac is recommended to movie fans of all ages to watch the magnificent Jose Ferrer at his best.".

It IS it has to be said a onerole play and although both Mala Powers Roxanne and William Prince Christian went on to enjoy long careers they never appeared in anything half as memorable as this a similar fate seems it's still too soon to tell to have befallen Depardieu's Roxanne Ann Brochet and Christian Vincent Perez. The director had something of a checkered career embracing everything from Boston Blackie to Pillow Talk and Carl Foreman who takes a screenplay credit enjoyed arguably the highest profile of all the behindthecamera personnel. Ferrer's Best Actor Oscar was well deserved and it's too easy to say that the role is actorproof witness the resounding flops on the English stage in the last decade.

Dmitri Tiomkin's music score is suitably rousing the sword play is clever and never clumsy and the script is witty and poetic while the story never fails to thrill or move me in the way it should do. It is well directed by Michael Gordon also. Of the acting faring weakest was Mala Powers she is beautiful but not much is done for me to make her beyond that. William Prince is more than adequate and Ralph Clanton sneers effectively as De Guiche. But the film same goes with the story itself too really belongs to Jose Ferrer. As much as I loved his performance in Moulin Rouge it is in Cyrano De Bergerac where he is at his finest really resonating with me by how dignified and moving he was.

	schema:headline " The Last Touch of French Dramatic Romanticism";
	schema:reviewBody "It is curious that in the period that England Scandanavia and Russia pushed for more reality in their drama France went into a different direction. She produced two still living dramatists Georges Feydeau the great constructor of farces and Edmond Rostand the last really impressive dramatic romanticist. Rostand was to write two plays that became international favorites. One was L'ANGLON The Eaglet a play about as Napoleon II only legitimate son of Emperor Napoleon I of France. That play follows his attempt to escape the clutches of the Chancellor of Austria Metternich to reclaim his throne. That play was the last great role and greatest trouser part of Sarah Bernhart. Because the Divine Sarah made it her favorite role L'ANGLON is rarely shown. However a sequence from that play has appeared in one of the Judy GarlandMickey Rooney films when the youngsters are in a deserted old theater and pretend to be stars of the past. Garland as Bernhard recites the speech of Napoleon II in French! at the battlefield of Waterloo where he repeats the great victories of his father.Interestingly enough Rooney in the same film portrayed Richard Mansfield in his performance as Cyrano de Bergerac. He does a snippet of one of the play's highpoints  the duel where Cyrano is constructing a poem that ends each verse with the words thrust home! until he ends the duel and the poem with the physical action against his foe matching the words.Rostand's CYRANO DE BERGERAC is constantly revived as a tragic comedy about a great poet and swordsmansoldier who was independent of the patronage game of the aristocracy of his time. Cyrano is fully honest and fully prepared to criticize the hypocrisies of his days and can protect himself due to his swordsmanship. However he also suffers from a physical problem. He has a magnificently big nose. His swordsmanship makes it fully possible for him to confront anyone making fun of his nose that was behind the opening duel regarding thrust home. However he is aware he is ugly and it prevents him from being brave enough to offer his heart to his beloved cousin Roxane. As the play continues he learns that a new Gascon recruit in his regiment Christian de Neuvilette is the secret love of Roxane and she asks Cyrano's assistance in getting Christian's attention about this. As it turns out Christian is equally in love with her. Christian is a brave and good looking young fellow but he is tongue tied. The result is that Cyrano ghost writes a series of letters to Roxane supposedly by Christian that cements her affection for him. Cyrano's assistance eventually leads to another memorable highpoint in the play where he takes over in a moonlit garden for the nervous Christian and serenades Roxane's ears she is on her terrace with his poetry supposedly recited and created by Christian. Reading a description of the play of any play hardly prepares the viewer for it's stage effect. Let us just say if you have never seen this play catch this film version or the French one with Gerald Depardieu made in 1990. It is bittersweet for we realize that with the growing success of Cyrano's ghosting for Christian he is torn further and further away from ever getting Roxane from noticing him. Only at the tale end of the play when it is too late does the truth dawn on Roxane.In 1947 Jose Ferrer was appearing on Broadway in Cyrano de Bergerac. Ferrer was the first major star on Broadway of Puerto Rican ancestry and proved adept at acting he was Iago to Paul Robeson's OTHELLO comic parts he did a great job in a revival of CHARLEY'S AUNT and directing. In fact the character of Geoffrey De Cordova Jack Buchanan in the musical film THE BAND WAGON is based in part on Ferrer also in part on Orson Welles. He dominated his production of CYRANO and was signed to appear in the movie version in 1950. Thus we are lucky enough to see him on film recreating his stage performance. Ferrer did not overact  he seemed to instinctively know how to control that tendency by stage performers on camera. As a result he fit the cinema screen perfectly. His moments of bravura acting as when he confronts and befuddles a rival in a dark garden by pretending he has just fallen from the moon are neatly balanced when he realizes what he just can't get from Roxane.The others performers are not unknown types. Christian was played by William Prince later Young Dr. Malone on television. Cyrano's more worldly wise friend Le Bret is Morris Carnovsky who had a distinguished career on stage and on screen. Lloyd Corrigan played the cowardly Ragueneau the pastry cookpoet who feeds Cyrano and his friends and witnesses the sequence where Cyrano beats back a set of armed thugs sent to attack the pastry cook. Mala Powers was Roxane. Even in the brief part of Cardinal Richelieu Edgar Barrier played that role secretly admiring the swordsman who keeps sneering at him. But it is the central role that makes this play and film and in the capable hands of Ferrer it was done well. It should have been a color film which is why I have only given it a 9 instead of a 10 but that doesn't weaken the film at all. Two years before Laurence Olivier won an Oscar as best actor for his HAMLET  really the first time a classic play role got the honor from the Academy. In 1950 the Academy gave the best actor Oscar to Ferrer for the second classic play role on film as well as the first Puerto Rican actor so honored.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is curious that in the period that England Scandanavia and Russia pushed for more reality in their drama France went into a different direction. She produced two still living dramatists Georges Feydeau the great constructor of farces and Edmond Rostand the last really impressive dramatic romanticist. Rostand was to write two plays that became international favorites. One was L'ANGLON The Eaglet a play about as Napoleon II only legitimate son of Emperor Napoleon I of France. That play follows his attempt to escape the clutches of the Chancellor of Austria Metternich to reclaim his throne. That play was the last great role and greatest trouser part of Sarah Bernhart. Because the Divine Sarah made it her favorite role L'ANGLON is rarely shown. However a sequence from that play has appeared in one of the Judy GarlandMickey Rooney films when the youngsters are in a deserted old theater and pretend to be stars of the past. Garland as Bernhard recites the speech of Napoleon II in French! at the battlefield of Waterloo where he repeats the great victories of his father.Interestingly enough Rooney in the same film portrayed Richard Mansfield in his performance as Cyrano de Bergerac. He does a snippet of one of the play's highpoints  the duel where Cyrano is constructing a poem that ends each verse with the words thrust home! until he ends the duel and the poem with the physical action against his foe matching the words.Rostand's CYRANO DE BERGERAC is constantly revived as a tragic comedy about a great poet and swordsmansoldier who was independent of the patronage game of the aristocracy of his time. Cyrano is fully honest and fully prepared to criticize the hypocrisies of his days and can protect himself due to his swordsmanship. However he also suffers from a physical problem. He has a magnificently big nose. His swordsmanship makes it fully possible for him to confront anyone making fun of his nose that was behind the opening duel regarding thrust home. However he is aware he is ugly and it prevents him from being brave enough to offer his heart to his beloved cousin Roxane. As the play continues he learns that a new Gascon recruit in his regiment Christian de Neuvilette is the secret love of Roxane and she asks Cyrano's assistance in getting Christian's attention about this. As it turns out Christian is equally in love with her. Christian is a brave and good looking young fellow but he is tongue tied. The result is that Cyrano ghost writes a series of letters to Roxane supposedly by Christian that cements her affection for him. Cyrano's assistance eventually leads to another memorable highpoint in the play where he takes over in a moonlit garden for the nervous Christian and serenades Roxane's ears she is on her terrace with his poetry supposedly recited and created by Christian. Reading a description of the play of any play hardly prepares the viewer for it's stage effect. Let us just say if you have never seen this play catch this film version or the French one with Gerald Depardieu made in 1990. It is bittersweet for we realize that with the growing success of Cyrano's ghosting for Christian he is torn further and further away from ever getting Roxane from noticing him. Only at the tale end of the play when it is too late does the truth dawn on Roxane.In 1947 Jose Ferrer was appearing on Broadway in Cyrano de Bergerac. Ferrer was the first major star on Broadway of Puerto Rican ancestry and proved adept at acting he was Iago to Paul Robeson's OTHELLO comic parts he did a great job in a revival of CHARLEY'S AUNT and directing. In fact the character of Geoffrey De Cordova Jack Buchanan in the musical film THE BAND WAGON is based in part on Ferrer also in part on Orson Welles. He dominated his production of CYRANO and was signed to appear in the movie version in 1950. Thus we are lucky enough to see him on film recreating his stage performance. Ferrer did not overact  he seemed to instinctively know how to control that tendency by stage performers on camera. As a result he fit the cinema screen perfectly. His moments of bravura acting as when he confronts and befuddles a rival in a dark garden by pretending he has just fallen from the moon are neatly balanced when he realizes what he just can't get from Roxane.The others performers are not unknown types. Christian was played by William Prince later Young Dr. Malone on television. Cyrano's more worldly wise friend Le Bret is Morris Carnovsky who had a distinguished career on stage and on screen. Lloyd Corrigan played the cowardly Ragueneau the pastry cookpoet who feeds Cyrano and his friends and witnesses the sequence where Cyrano beats back a set of armed thugs sent to attack the pastry cook. Mala Powers was Roxane. Even in the brief part of Cardinal Richelieu Edgar Barrier played that role secretly admiring the swordsman who keeps sneering at him. But it is the central role that makes this play and film and in the capable hands of Ferrer it was done well. It should have been a color film which is why I have only given it a 9 instead of a 10 but that doesn't weaken the film at all. Two years before Laurence Olivier won an Oscar as best actor for his HAMLET  really the first time a classic play role got the honor from the Academy.

	schema:reviewBody "A pendant piece to VIVA MARIA. Louis Malle certainly unlike some other fifties hipsters but also along with some other fifties hipsters knew that something was happening in the sixties but didn't quite know what it was. It was of course sex drugs and rock 'n roll  thousands of people in the street the whole antiestablishment thing. Malle knew this and he didn't know this. He knew this instinctively but not specifically. In LE VOLEUR he presents a story of a young man who upon completing his education and military service is cheated out of his inheritance and thwarted in love by the greed of the older generation disguising its self interest in pious social formalities. He almost accidentally discovers his talent for burglary and decides that it is his life's calling. This is a trope familiar to French existentialism especially in the films of Bresson and Melville. Belmondo as the young man Georges Randal decides that he is going to attack the smug bourgeoisie one villa at a time. His sex life was what could be described as extremely contemporary. He lives on the boarders of respectable society. A life on the edge if you will. He shares his values with all sorts of nefarious characters in a sort of underground movement. While some have plans to turn the movement into something like a concrete political organization Belmondo prefers to keep it on a personal and individual level. The chief mover behind the politicizing of the movement is shot down after a political speech made by a reactionary politician. Even after achieving an enviable financial security Belmondo continues with his chosen profession dedicated to the implication that it continues his never ending war against a hypocritical and selfish bourgeois society. A very sixties concept except that LE VOLEUR is a period picture set in La Belle Epoch the decades before the turn of the last century.VIVA MARIA is also a period picture but more overtly about revolution. Malle certainly had a feeling for the zeitgeist but was as something of a bourgeois himself distancing himself from identifying too fully with revolutionary politics as say someone like Regis Debray a man of Malle's class who fought with Che Guevara in Bolivia. Certainly as all of the aspects of the cultural revolution of the late sixties came into sharper focus Malle like the Belmondo character avoided direct participation or indeed comment upon either the situation or any organized dissidence preferring to make his statement by going within. His subsequent films included documentaries on India and fiction films dealing with incest in Vichy LE Souffl AU COEUR and a collaborationist youth during the war LACOMBE LUCIAN. He was to abandon France ten years after LE VOLEUR and made films in America before returning once again ten years after to France and a film about the ethics and morality of wartime collaboration AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS and more pointedly May '68 MILOU EN MAI. But from VIVA MARIA and LE VOULEUR it was a long time in between laughs.LE VOLEUR is commendable above all else for it's single minded purpose reflected in the dedication to his vocation by Belmondo. No crappy cinematic tricks. Guys who want to retire do so even after one last job men who walk into the frame do not turn out to be undercover anythings coincidences and ironies do not abound at the touch of a screenwriters whim or sloth. The sequence with Charles Denner who is superb is a highlight of the film. Genevive Bujold has never looked more beautiful than in this film. If LE VOLEUR has one fault it is that there are too many beautiful women in the film a fault more revealing about the way times and standards have changed than about Mr. Malle.LE VOLEUR along with VIVA MARIA are perfect examples of what the Nouvelle Vague matured into sort of its middle age a strong combination of spirit skill and generous budgets. A rare film to catch but entertaining exciting sexy fun and intellectually stimulating. Highly recommended.".

Hoosiers is a timeless film that will look good after years of its release because it speaks to us about how someone can inspire a group of people to do their best as they become confident in what they are trying to accomplish. The film was lovingly written for the screen by Angelo Pizzo.Coach Norman Dale gets a reprieve in life when he is hired to coach the Hickory basket ball team in rural Indiana. Basketball is the game where most people in that state take an unusual interest. Their passion for the sport is evident. The new coach is looked with suspicion because he is an outsider and he believes in teamwork. He wants everyone to participate equally which doesn't make for excitement in the court. The coach doesn't want anyone overshadowing another that's why he insists in total involvement. Needless to say his method clashes with the parents and towns people from the start.The coach's past comes to haunt him when Myra Fleener one of the teachers discovers an article that reveals an incident Mr. Dale would like to forget. At the same time Myra realizes the goodness in the coach's heart by involving the drunken Shooter into helping him with the team.Gene Hackman has one of the best opportunities of his distinguished career with his portrayal of Coach Dale. He is splendid in the film and he wins us with his decency and by sticking to his principles which he passes on to the team members. Barbara Hershey is also good as Myra the young woman who falls in love with Dale. Dennis Hopper plays Shooter the father of one of the kids in the team who has a drinking problem.Hoosiers is an inspiring film that ought to be seen by young people because of its message about team spirit and how to interact with one another in peace and harmony.".

Add a truelife David beat Goliath story and you have an appealing film.It doesn't hurt that Gene Hackman is the star either. He may not have that celebrity appeal or the looks of Clark Gable or Bratt Pitt but this man can flatout act! He makes a very believable high school basketball coach who is toughbutfair on the outside and softandcompassionate on the inside.The story of an extremely tiny school defying the odds and becoming a state champion in dramatic form was so inspiring that this film has played thousands of times for 20 years now by high school coaches to their kids for motivation.But the key to the story is the coach getting a second chance in life to do what he loves and does best and he in turn giving others a second chance such as the alcoholic here played by Dennis Hopper. There are great lessons on teamwork patience tolerance and a whole bunch of other qualities. In one of the DVD documentaries both Hackman and Hoppper comment on how many times people have approached them and THIS is the movie they mention that meant so much them. That says a lot since both men have made many famous movies.An unsung hero of this movie is the cinematography. Man this is beautifully filmed and the rural Midwest has never looked so pretty and appealing. It paints a beautiful picture of this part of the United States. It also paints a fond remembrance of the early 1950s. You get an honesttogoodness feel of what it's like to be part of a basketball in this area during that time Basketball meant an awful lot  and still does  to these folks. If you are sports fan in particularly this movie will bring a tear or two to your eyes. However this story is for everyone who believes people deserve chances to overcome previous mistakes. Few films whatever the topic have the heart this movie demonstrates.".

	schema:headline " A great portrait of Indiana high school basketball's glory days!";
	schema:reviewBody "When I heard that a movie was being made about Milan Indiana High School's improbable 1954 boys' basketball state championship54 I was excited. Not only because I like most Hoosiers love basketball but also because of my family connection to The Milan Miracle as it's widely known. One of my uncles Bob Wichmann was a member of that team. MHS was by far the smallest school to win the championship in Indiana's 87 years of single class basketball. I was really looking forward to see who they were going to choose to play Uncle Bob!When I learned around the time of the movie's release that it wasn't going to be be an actual biography but merely inspired by the Milan 1954 team I was disappointed. Shortly afterward on my 16th birthday my maternal grandparents  Uncle Bob's parents  took me to see the movie at a theater. I didn't dislike it but I had a hard time being objective about it because it was something other than what hoped it would be.But I recently gave Hoosiers another shot. I bought its two DVD collector's edition  largely for the bonus features  and saw the movie for only the second time ever and the first time in 18 years a little over half of my life. The second time I managed to view it simply as it is as opposed to my original expectations and I enjoyed it much more.Hoosiers in a fictional story about the 195152 Hickory High School team. The Huskers are coming off a solid 1510 season but are now in disarray following the death of their coach and the subsequent departure of their best player the painfully quiet Jimmy Chitwood played by Maris Valainis.Their new coach Norman Dale Gene Hackman arrives after practice for the new season has already begun. Dale is a former college coach who has spent the last 10 years in the Navy and his tenure with the Huskers gets off to a bad start. Two of the team's seven remaining players quit during his first practice  though both end up returning  and he alienates much of the town with his dogmatic philosophy and sometimes abrasive style.Among those not pleased with Dale is fellow teacher Myra Fleener Barbara Hershey who thinks that basketball is over emphasized and academics are under emphasized. She and Dale clash a few times early on which means of course that they end up falling in love.The season starts off badly for the Huskers and a town meeting is soon scheduled to decide whether to fire Dale of keep him. Fleener has discovered that he was fired from his college coaching job for hitting one of his players but doesn't reveal that information and speaks on his behalf. Still the audience seems largely unmoved.It looks like Dale is about to be fired but Chitwood enters like the calvary and speaking for one of the few times in the movie says that he is ready to return to playing but will do so only if the coach stays. Dale's job is saved and from there the team improves greatly and becomes a state championship contender.You can probably figure out what happens in the end but the movie works the underdog formula to perfection without being overly clich.The performances in Hoosiers are great particularly Dennis Hopper's best supporting actor Oscar nominated role as Shooter the father of one of the players. Hopper does a phenomenal job of acting like a basketball crazed drunk though I thought it was a bit much for Dale to make him an assistant coach. That is one of a few cases of over Hollywoodization in this movie.And where I think the movie succeeds the most is in portraying Indiana's unique love for high school basketball. Many nonHoosiers who see the movie probably think that the residents criticizing the coach on the street the caravan of cars traveling to away games the emotional town meeting on the coach's fate and the general hysteria are an exaggeration. That is not the case.High school basketball in Indiana was an obsession for several decades and still is though to a lesser extent. Many small towns passionately embraced the local high school team which was often a point of unity identity and pride.One other strong point about the movie the late great Jerry Goldsmith's adrenaline pumping music heightens the emotion of the game scenes down the stretch.The collector's edition DVD set also contains three bonus features that I think are worthy of mention hereA 29 minute documentary about the making of the movie the Milan '54 story and Indiana's love for basketball.The 1954 state championship game between Milan and Muncie Central. I'm almost 100 sure that the commentary is done by Tom Carnegie who was been the voice of the Indianapolis 500 since 1946. Tom was the commentator on the ESPN broadcast of the game last year.The game footage is far from great but it's not bad and it's good to have any at all. The audio quality is shaky. But it's great to finally have this monumentally historic game easily available.Several deleted scenes introduced by director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo. In my opinion a few of the scenes were unnecessary but many should have been included. One of those scenes gives insight in Buddy Walker's Brad Long return to the team and several others give deeper insight into the romantic relationship that developed between Dale and Fleener. Pizzo and Anspaugh said they wanted to include some of those scenes but were told by the movie company to make the movie under two hours.In conclusion I now greatly enjoy Hoosiers as fiction and its new collector's edition DVD set is a great buy for any sports movie fan! 810".

But it's great to finally have this monumentally historic game easily available.Several deleted scenes introduced by director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo. In my opinion a few of the scenes were unnecessary but many should have been included. One of those scenes gives insight in Buddy Walker's Brad Long return to the team and several others give deeper insight into the romantic relationship that developed between Dale and Fleener. Pizzo and Anspaugh said they wanted to include some of those scenes but were told by the movie company to make the movie under two hours.In conclusion I now greatly enjoy Hoosiers as fiction and its new collector's edition DVD set is a great buy for any sports movie fan! 810";

	schema:reviewBody "I have been reading and summing up comments about this movie. I can't believe how misunderstood this movie is. First and foremost this is not a movie about the Milan team's championship and Bobby Plump's winning shot. The Milan game is the most famous and storied game in Indiana and is only used as the quientessential example.The movie is a collection of typical things that happen in Indiana High School basketball which is known as Hoosier Hysteria. The locker room scenes are typical found each year at tournament time. The small town involvement is typical. Players deciding if they want to succumb to the social pressures of the sport or dreaming of winning is typical. Teacher nudging is typical. The appearance of religious faith is also typical in small town Indiana. It's right in the bible belt.Smaller less talented underdog teams are the lifeblood of passion about playing and winning. Winning systems coaching tactics fundamentals and characterbuilding are staples of the Hoosier H.S. game. Read John Wooden's books and you'll see them clearly. John WoodenMartinsville IN Purdue and UCLA.The character played by Dennis Hopper is underscored not by his drunken state and redemption but by his basketball knowledge. In Indiana everyone from every walk of life knows more about the history of the game and how to win the game than the coach. There are walking talking Hoosier basketball historians in every small town.Another Hoosier staple is the sequence of the tournament. Every march since the 1920's the Indiana H.S. tournament starts with a sectional regional sweetsixteen and final four state championship. Hence all games and scores that were shown in the movie. Although Hickory H.S. is fictictious the opposing team names were real Indiana schools in the western part of the state Jasper Linton Logootee etc.The movie actually tried but fell short in my opinion of the excitement at tournament time. The noise level and absolute excitement of the H.S. tournaments is something you have to experience. Just walking into the gyms gives you chill bumps. Being the local game night hero is paramount but it creates it's own special problems. I firmly feel having experienced it myself that the movie makers were trying to capture a unique phenomenon in sports using typical events. They displayed the key aspects of Indiana H.S. basketball in film to communicate the experience to the rest of the world.I was pleased and excited to see how many reviewers were inspired by the film. Many who lived these events over the years are similarly motivated.P.S. Coaches do not kiss teachers except in Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm no armchair sportsman and I've never played basketball but to enjoy Hoosiers you don't need to meet those requirements. Hoosiers is simply great superbly acted drama. The story is standard underdog material but with a terrific cast including Gene Hackman Dennis Hopper and Barbara Hershey it soars. It is refreshing to see a sports movie in which the players are not a bunch of arrogant obnoxious beerswilling yahoos whose only ambition off the court is to get laid. No these high school boys from a very small town are a sorry lot whose spirits are revived by a coach Hackman on the last legs of his checkered career. Dennis Hopper who plays the embarrassing alcoholic father of one of the players is a revelation here as a man given yet another chance to prove that he isn't a terminal loser. The film is comprised of many games and in the hands of a hack it might have become tiresome. But director David Anspaugh works hard to inject great dramatic tension into every game and is ably assisted by Fred Murphy's beautiful photography and Jerry Goldsmith's extraordinary score a mix of electronic and strong orchestral elements. The film has an extremely emotional build and powers along like a steam train. Hackman a long way from fine work such as Prime Cut and The Hunting Party is simply ultrasolid and commanding. A marvellous film about being given chances. I suggest you give it one too.".

	schema:reviewBody "What's the best sports film of all time you ask? Well it's debatable but I'd rank HOOSIERS high up there. Coming out in 1986 the dated decade! HOOSIERS still holds up remarkably well thanks to really great cinematography and set design. It really looks and feels like 1950s Indiana even today. Without overdoing the period piece aspect and focusing on small town life and hometown values HOOSIERS is a topnotch movie. In particular the film is incredibly fastpaced.All credit goes to the great Gene Hackman who plays dejected displaced and disgraced Coach Norman Dale from a bigtime college program who must take a downgraded high school coaching position as head coach at Hickory High School the Huskers. Hackman exudes credibility as a nononsense firm yet sensitive man at the crossroads of his coaching career and his life. This actor could do it all by just being himself! Coach Dale arrives in the small town of Hickory Indiana circa 1951 and immediately faces disdain and uncertainty upon his arrival. The small towners see him as a bigcity guy who looks down on them and won't fit in. The locals question his coaching tactics and even challenge his authority directly at times. But Dale sticks to his guns and instills discipline and toughness into the promising basketball team. In particular Dale shows particular interest in Jimmy Chitwood a pure shooting guard who at first is not on the team but then decides to rejoin them on the condition that Coach Dale stays.Dale also has an initially rocky relationship with local Myra Fleener well played by Barbara Hershey who isn't very crazy about basketball and thinks education is more important. Best Supporting Actor nominee Dennis Hopper plays town drunk Shooter whose son is on the team. Hopper almost steals the show but I still think this film belongs completely to Hackman especially with 20 years of hindsight.Special mention should also go to the young men who played the Hickory Huskers. Really a band of unknowns who I don't think any have become famous since this film the fact that real teens and basketball players played these characters helps make HOOSIERS all the more authentic.Of course you have the obligatory happy ending but it all fits into this gem of a sports film. Really it doesn't get much better than HOOSIERS!".

The relationships are economically revealed conservatively developed and satisfyingly hokey without very often becoming unlikely. There are only two things really wrong. One is the Airwolf synthesizer score that crashes in the 50s heartland like a flying saucer on crack. Two is the equally dated easyout of a series of montages instead of a third act. Come on. That's using condiments as food. Because of this hurry several scenes in the second hour are more scaffolding than story.But when it's good it's very good which is most of the time more often I think than David Anspaugh's other Sports Underdog Who Achieves Momentary Greatness movie.

Sure the cars and buildings have changed since the story of Hoosiers took place but the values and the sense of community have not. Perhaps that is the greatest lesson in this movie  that community is something to be proud of and participate in. Having moved to a large city I miss the Friday nights where the entire town shuts down to go to the high school ball games I miss the Saturday mornings spent discussing the games and the rest of the week preparing for the next game. I miss the anticipation of meeting up with friends young and old over a good game on the hardwood while cheering on the hometown team. But I also can tell you that the way Norman Dale was treated as an outsider is absolutely true. If you are not from a smalltown or born and raised there prepare to spend a considerable amount of time proving yourself. While the sense of community is bold breaking into that community isn't as easy. It takes someone of bold character thick skin and determination to break into that community  but like Norman Dale once you do you too can become the hometown hero!".

But I also can tell you that the way Norman Dale was treated as an outsider is absolutely true. If you are not from a smalltown or born and raised there prepare to spend a considerable amount of time proving yourself. While the sense of community is bold breaking into that community isn't as easy. It takes someone of bold character thick skin and determination to break into that community  but like Norman Dale once you do you too can become the hometown hero!";

Hackman on the other hand always hand in a good and often varied performance see Unforgiven Crimson Tide Hoosiers that has me belive that he is the character he is playing and not just Gene Hackman.  Anyway this movie was pretty good even the simple basketball games have you cheering for the small town Indiana team.  Dennis Hopper turns in a great performance as a drunk I'm not so sure it was a performance though that wants to redeem himself in the eyes of his son and isn't sure he can handle it.  Good flick to watch if you can't decide on anything else at the video store.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is entertaining wellwritten and definitely one that will get you cheering for the team! The downside is that it's at times melodramatic and overlytearjerking and uses almost every sentimental cliche ever written at least once. While there are some great lines 'God wants you on the floor son' there are also some horribly cliched lines as well 'I've wanted to kiss you since the moment we first met!'Gene Hackman is fabulous in this as the former college coach turned Navyman who comes to small town Hickory IA to coach basketball. And being from Bloomington I can vouch for the frenzied obsession we of Indiana have for basketball so it was no surprise to see how unwelcome he was in town with unorthodox methods and bing an outsider as well always a good kicker for a plot. Add the loss of then best player in town who decides not to play ball that year and the challenge is on!But the plot slips away too much at times. The Dennis Hopper as an alcoholic former basketball star who is given a chance to be an assistant if he cleans up plotline could have been interesting but his 'agonized' moments on the floor dragged on too much and the plot turned sour when he relapsed and was eventually discarded and never resolved properly save for a sloppy and cheezy heartstrings moment where his son declares that they'll move in together when it's all over snifsnifsnif. As well the shameless and worthless attempt to inject romance into the film stuttered and failed...Barbara Hershey playing a colleague who the coach gets off on the wrong foot with and then falls for is too typical and rated barely a glimpse or two in the overall story. Why bother?? It was a subplot that had absolutely nothing to do with the story hardly had any screen time and was never properly dealt with. It was just wasted screen time.Still the film as a whole is worth the cheeziness of some parts. The ending is predictable but in a heartswelling way. Sure some of the scenes are a bit too long and jerking but in the end it doesn't matter because it just feels right. It's handled as well as possible considering it has to be Hollywood even in little Hickory. A solid film could have been better but not by too much. 710.".

Hackman finds the town unfriendly. They liked their last coach and resent him. He brings new ideas to the game  no more zone defense but rather manonman. But he's determined to see these boys whipped into shape and win Big Time.I ask you the discerning viewer does he succeed? Barbara Hershey is a teacher hostile to Hackman. Does he win her over? Dennis Hopper is a disgusting drunk but he knows everything about the local teams and how they play basketball. Does Hackman hire him as Assistant Coach? Does Hopper overcome his demons? Is Hackman fired by the town but saved at the last minute by a revelation of some sort? Does he improve the team's spirit. Does he make them want to fight like dogs? Does this get them to the Big Tournament at the state capitol? Does the music on the sound track swell with triumphant fanfares? Are you kidding? I couldn't predict all of the obstacles that would crop up in the screenplay but once presented with them pretty much knew exactly how they'd be solved.Maybe part of the reason I found it so tiresome is that I'm not a fan of basketball. But I don't follow baseball either and always enjoy The Natural. And I'm a lousy pool shooter but think The Hustler is a near masterpiece.On the plus side the cinematography by Fred Murphy is very good indeed and so is the location shooting. When the distracted Hackman first arrives in Hickory Indiana it LOOKS like the beginning of school in September. It's misty people's breath steams the ground is littered with tannic leaves. And as the season progresses the branches become bare and patches of snow appear in the shadows. If you were driven to find a small farming community dominated by an oversized white church and an elderly brick high school you'd want to come here.But how is it possible to take any of this seriously as the writer and director seem to expect us to? It's a heartwarming writebythenumbers story of dispiritedness turning to success. It seems to be aimed at the kind of audience represented by the gangly pituitary cases we watch on the court.

	schema:reviewBody "The only resemblance between this film and the Broadway musical and silent film of Lady Be Good from 1928 is purely coincidental. All that MGM took for this film was the title and two songs from the original Broadway score.That being said this version of Lady Be Good about a pair of husband and wife songwriters is good entertainment. Robert Young and Ann Sothern are the married pair and it's the same old story of two who can't live and can't live without each other. In fact the story is told in flashback by Sothern on the witness stand to Judge Lionel Barrymore in her divorce hearing.The rest of the score is written by those MGM contract writers Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. None of it is particularly memorable. However an additional song which brought this film its only Oscar caused some considerable controversy. The year before Oscar Hammerstein II saw newsreels of the Nazis marching into Paris and the sad faces of the French people who now had to endure the unendurable. He spent some considerable time in Paris and loved the city. So moved was he that he dashed off a song lyric and immediately called Jerome Kern to put some music to it. The result was the incredibly popular The Last Time I Saw Paris.So popular was it that MGM I'm sure paid a pretty penny for the rights and to interpolate into Lady Be Good. Tony Martin and Lanny Ross and Kate Smith and the great concert singer John Charles Thomas had made some good selling records of The Last Time I Saw Paris. Ann Sothern sang it beautifully in the film the last chorus with her voice over newsreels of the occupation.The popularity of the song and the entrance of the USA into World War II no doubt influenced the vote of the Academy. Plus the fact that interpolated songs like this were not specifically banned. It was sheer coincidence that the six of the first seven winners were original songs written specifically for the film they were in. The Academy rules were tightened up and now songs had to be written specifically for the film. So Sweet Leilani and The Last Time I Saw Paris remain the only two songs not written for the films they were in. By the way Jerome Kern fought for the rule change himself saying he voted for Harold ArlenJohnny Mercer's Blues in the Night as the best song for 1941.The other musical highlight is Eleanor Powell dancing to Fascinating Rhythm. On stage it was Fred and sister Adele Astaire who did it originally but there ain't nothing wrong about the way Eleanor Powell cuts that carpet. Busby Berkeley directed the sequence and it's filled with his original touches.One day maybe I'll see a theatrical production of GeorgeIra Gershwin's Lady Be Good. Till then this will do nicely.".

In this movie Eleanor Powell demonstrates she was one of the few women who genuinely deserved the solo spot in tap dancing. Musicals like this are sorely missed in today's entertainment.

This number should be rated along with Fred Astaire's dance on the ceiling in Royal Wedding and Donald O'Connor's Make 'Em Laugh as one of the best of all time.

This picture centers around a continuously arguing couple played by Robert Young and Ann Sothern. They marry divorce remarry etc... this is not musical comedy but musical drama.On the whole though I liked it. The picture has so much to recommend it that I could overlook the infighting scenes because the music was great. Not a lot of it remains from the Broadway musical just Fascinatin' Rhythm and the title song. But the song that put the movie over for me was The Last Time I Saw Paris sung to perfection by Ann Sothern. It won a welldeserved AA for Best Song. Then there was Eleanor Powell with a couple of terrific dance numbers The acrobatic Berry Brothers Red Skelton and Lionel Barrymore who increases the stature of any movie he is in.I thought Young and Sothern played off each other well and were true troupers doing the best they could with peculiar material. The picture was about 1520 minutes too long dwelling too much on marital strife but this was an MGM musical and in black and white no less  made me think no one did musicals like Fox.".

Sothern gets to sing The Last Time I Saw Paris but her role is a sappy one. The scenes where she and Young are shown composing a song is laughable but for all the wrong reasons. Trouble is the script lacks the wit and sophistication badly needed here.Eleanor Powell has little to do until the finale when she struts her stuff with a Busby Berkeley tap dance routine to Fascinating Rhythm that steals the show. Except for the pleasant cast there are trying moments to sit through until the few good bits. Best watched on your VCR so you can fast forward when the action gets dullwhich it does with alarming regularity!Summing up good cast wasted on empty trifle.".

Ann Sothern who even in 1941 had shown a gift for sophisticated comedy is cast in a sappy romantic role. Robert Young an actor who always could convey warmth is cast as rather unpleasant and arrogant so that it's difficult to see how Sothern could continue to love him through two divorce actions. Eleanor Powell was one of the shining stars of MGM musicals and her final dance number is deservedly famous. In this case the writers did us a favor by limiting her scenes where she was obliged to speak lines her delivery is as wooden as ever but that is not as important here as in some of her starring vehicles where she was called upon to convey emotion. She and Nelson Eddy made quite a pair in Rosalie. The title song is played so often that I hope I won't hear it again for a long time to come. All the leads are even obliged to sing it at the finale! Note I have never understood how Virginia O'Brien appeared in film after MGM film. Did she know someone in the front office?".

Eleanor Powell who in spite of top billing has a very small part has a wonderful number with a dog for a dance partner and an overdone by Busby Berkeley but still excellent big number near the end. There's some nice cane work by the Berry Brothers and Virginia O'Brien as an eternally hungry girl does one of her amusing deadpan numbers. Red Skelton is also amusing when he shows up.Unfortunately everything in the above paragraph makes up maybe 15 of the total movie which is mainly focused on Ann Southern and Robert Young as a songwriting husband and wife team.The script is awful. The characters actions make no sense ever. Every contrivance every argument every reconciliation seems to come out of nowhere. Neither Ann nor Robert ever actually tells the other what they're unhappy about and nothing you see explains the degree of difficulty in the relationship.The dialogue is very poor listless and repetitive. The direction is flaccid. Even Lionel Barrymore struggles in vain to bring his small badly written part to life.Also while this is based on a Gershwin musical for some reason it only has two Gershwin songs. It also has a couple of other mediocre songs written by someone else and The Last Time I Saw Paris which won an Oscar in spite of Sothern's dreary performance she can sing but she can't make it interesting. Since there are so few songs most are used several times performed in different styles by different people. This is find when that song is Lady Be Good but with the more mediocre numbers it's hugely annoying.I've seen both Powell with a dog and the Berry Brothers on youtube so my recommendation would be to find the youtube clips from this movie and skip the movie itself. As a full movie it's awful but as 15 minutes of youtube clips it's excellent.".

This is because the filmmakers weren't sure if the film should be a romance a musicaldancing extravaganza or a chance to show off a few dozen bostly Blist MGM actors. I really wish the film had a narrower focus and concentrated more on the romanceespecially since the leads were clearly NOT in their elements in a musical.Dixie Ann Sothern and Eddie Young team up early in the film to write songs. INSTANTLY they are famous and what seemed like only about 30 seconds later they are married and then divorcedall because Eddie is a bit of a fathead and Dixie doesn't talk to him about how unhappy she is!! Things happened so fast it made my head spinand really seemed superrushed. The rest of the film concerns the couple working together and determining IF they need each other romantically. You KNOW they doand the ending is absolutely no surprise. In between you have lots of songs tap dancing and other distractions. So is the film worth seeing? If you aren't a fan of musicals probably not. However ANY film where Eleanor Powell dances is STILL worth seeing as she was an AMAZING dancer. However the film was a disappointment to meas with all the money glitz and talent it sure should have been better. Plus the romance seemed really really forced and unconvincing.".

But no this is another film altogether using the same title as the other one. As directed by Tamra Davis with the screen treatment by Matthew Bright this is a film that tries to deliver but in the end it's predictable as we know the mistakes of the couple at the center of the story would work against them.Anita Minteer seems to be a loner. We watch her in school where she is not a popular girl in any shape or form. Some of the pot heads from her school take her for a ride in which two end up having sex with her. Anita has been left to fend for herself by her absent mother who has gone to Fresno to make some money and ultimately have Anita come live with her. Anita is being sexually abused by her mother's good for nothing boyfriend. The girl loves to learn how to use guns and Rooney who wants to keeps her complies. A sad mistake! Her love for guns will ultimately be her downfall and that of the only person that really loved her.At school Anita and her class have been asked to find a pen pal as part of a project. She finds one but unfortunately Howard who writes to her is in jail. Anita finds a kind garage owner who is also the head of a weird congregation to vouch for Howard who is paroled and comes to work in the town. Howard is a man who has had no luck either with women or in anything else. It's sort of inevitable Anita and Howard fall in love and are married by the minister. Fate is against this duo in a series of events Howard will go back to his old ways when forced to do so. We realize there's no way out for this doomed man or for Anita. The film doesn't disappoint thanks to the charismatic Drew Barrymore playing Anita. This is a girl too wise for her own good. James Legros is as always an interesting actor to watch. His take on Howard is right. In supporting roles Joe Dallesandro plays Anita mother's boyfriend a creep that takes advantage of the situation. Michael Ironside is also seen as Howard's parole officer and Ione Skye plays his daughter Anita's rebellious friend.Tamra Davis directs with an eye for detail. This film will not disappoint to crime film fans.".

Seeking some sort of solace she befriends  via letters  a convict named Howard Legros. When Howard is paroled the pair hook up and quickly find a loving bond. A bond that also involves a passion for guns...In spite of reports in some quarters this is not a remake of Joseph H. Lewis' superb film noir of the same name though the words gun and crazy are separated there from 1950. Whilst it's also worth mentioning that it's not a knockoff of Bonnie and Clyde outstanding and trailblazing pic for sure because for that to be the case we would have to ignore the fact that Lewis' film and the likes of They Live by Night Nicolas Ray  1948  were not key influences and big movers in the lovers on the lam splinter of noir. It is of course an amalgamation of said influences and despite a relatively average rating on the big internet movie sites this is a neonoir well worth seeking out for those so inclined.Students of classic era film noir can't but help to be pulled in by the many deviance's at work themes involving sexual abuse promiscuity impotence alienation prostitution and foolish love the latter pitching a classic noir character into a vortex from which they in all probability know they can't return from. It's not that Anita is a femme fatale because she's so young and isn't written as a viper type it's that her youthful ignorance her teenage hormones tortured by a torrid upbringing is enough for Howard to grasp onto as a semblance of normality. They are both fools but honest with it it's the classic romanticised dream going sour. Again a classic film noir trait.Visually there is much to recommend here. The use of slatted shadows and balustrade is cunning and nods appreciatively to influences past the inference obviously that Howard may be out of prison but he's still behind bars. Davis throws in a number of striking scenes a camera shot looking out as a grave is dug our lovers close and personal sexy as they shoot guns and the finale has a sad grace that again noir lovers can appreciate. Matthew Bright's screenplay also has black comedy elements the script devious with Freudian smarts while the cast turn in performances worthy of the form.OK! So this formula has been done better before and yes we want more of Ironside and Drago wonderful characters and this may have underwhelmed those after a gun crazy action thriller  while Barrymore fans back in the day may have been bemused  but it's a very smart and neatly constructed neonoir. 7.510".

LeGros recently converted to Christianity while in prison on a murder charge becomes pen pals to teenage Drew Barrymore..it was a high school assignment to find a pen pal whose mom ran out on her and who is currently living with a loathsome lout once linked to mama.I think the brilliance of Bright's script is how he builds to the ultimate crescendo of violence which erupts at the end showing through a series of circumstances which tragically befall them..two high school cretins who will not listen to LeGros who demands for them to leave the premises and how they're unwilling to listen due to their desire to proposition Barrymore Barrymore's murder of her mother's lover after he rapes her the resistance against parole officer Michael Ironside's demand for LeGros to return to jail until he can be moved elsewhere resulting in the murder of a cop failed burglary at a bar the inability to find Barrymore's mother in Fresno that they were doomed to suffer an inevitable fate.They're very much victims of circumstance a dominoeffectspiral culminating bit by bit until faced with a laundry list of criminal activities which follow one mistake upon another. What I admired about this particular film was the casting for the couple on the lam. Barrymore is adorable as a conflicted teenager with a reputation for spreading her legs for many of the local boys considered little more than trailer trash. She's without parental guidance or love and LeGros fulfills these longings she has never known he himself on the mend and hoping to find his place. Unlike the usual role of a recently released excon attempting to go straight LeGros is handsome modest relatively pleasant and easygoing not demanding anything of Barrymore but her love. He's not a monster really and quite vulnerable. He's also a virgin and impotent..which kind of adds a dynamic to his relationship to Barrymore for she's always been used for little more than sexual purposes. Joe Dallesandro has a very unflattering role as Barrymore's scumbucket father figure a drunk pedophile who takes advantage of her..and probably has perhaps contributed to why Barrymore is rather skewed in regards to her overview of men  boysthis has probably been occurring since Barrymore was a child providing her with guidance in how to fire a gun properly.Guncrazy can probably be viewed as a precursor to Bright's wicked acidtongued Freeway known as his masterpiece. As is evident in this film Bright seems drawn to derelicts to society the undesirables who seem to eventually fall through the cracks and into a life of crime. The amusing aspect to me in this film is just how poor LeGros and Barrymore are as criminals..the bar scene a particular highlight in how the victims are able to guilt the duo into returning their cash! Good use of California locations and the cinematography is at times inventive while also capturing  casting certain areas in a rather unsavory light due to the characters focused on..impoverished rural places outside cities and certain areas of urban squalorsuch as Billy Drago..another in his many customary weirdo rolesas a mechanic  preacher who gives LeGros a job room and board. Ironside has the role of a slightly contemptible parole officer a bigot..towards white trash characters Bright seems to embracewho doesn't like the idea of his daughterIone Skyehanging around with Barrymore and doesn't trust LeGros. I really was drawn to the offbeat nature of the film and how it cares for it's leads..I mean despite their faults they tried to carve out a decent life for themselves allowing their impulses to ruin any chance of coexisting in a harsh world.".

	schema:headline " Love made them a little crazy";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Guncrazy a mere few days ago not when it was originally aired on television. My first impression just by looking at the cover of the DVD was of your basic comingofagemovie with the nice romantic story and twist of the lovers being gunobsessed. I actually got more than I expected. Drew Barrymore breathed incredible life into the character of a teenager sexually abused by her guardian and hated and bullied by her classmates. The disillusioned teen is under the impression that men are after one thing and one thing only and couldn't possibly want her for anything else aptly shown by a sequence of her handing herself over on a plate to two guys. For a project in her geography class Barrymore's character Anita comes into contact with a convict by the name of Howard Hickock and the two of them become intimate pen pals. On Howard being released from prison on parole Anita gets him a job working with a local slightly crazy preacher and he seems to be getting his life back on track. Anita and Howard fall more and more in love and decide to marry. Obviously this all goes horribly wrong the moment Anita confesses her big secret to Howard  she has killed her abusive guardian and is hiding the body behind her trailer. This starts off a chain reaction of murders by Howard and Anita leading them on the run across the country in search of Anita's everabsent mother. The final sequence was the most heartbreaking and beautiful in the whole movie. Anita and Howard break into the home of a woman they came across on their travels who they know will be away for safe shelter during the night. Inside they watch family slide shows wear expensive jewellery and clothes and live like royalty  or as Howard said like Nice people. The night seems perfect and the couple seem at their happiest. It all turns horrible with police catching up with the outlaws at the last minute. A slowmotion shootout between the cops and the lovers ends in tragedy and will have tears welling up in your eyes. What made this movie great? The director doesn't start much action until about halfway into the movie but the first half is just as enjoyable as you watch the lover's relationship unfold and blossom. The second half sees their relationship mature and it also sees Anita grow from naive teenager to young woman and Howard grow more comfortable in their relationship. A comingofage movie indeed and yet very very different from what you will expect. An emotional journey that spans lives and loves and will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.".

The disillusioned teen is under the impression that men are after one thing and one thing only and couldn't possibly want her for anything else aptly shown by a sequence of her handing herself over on a plate to two guys. For a project in her geography class Barrymore's character Anita comes into contact with a convict by the name of Howard Hickock and the two of them become intimate pen pals. On Howard being released from prison on parole Anita gets him a job working with a local slightly crazy preacher and he seems to be getting his life back on track. Anita and Howard fall more and more in love and decide to marry. Obviously this all goes horribly wrong the moment Anita confesses her big secret to Howard  she has killed her abusive guardian and is hiding the body behind her trailer. This starts off a chain reaction of murders by Howard and Anita leading them on the run across the country in search of Anita's everabsent mother. The final sequence was the most heartbreaking and beautiful in the whole movie. Anita and Howard break into the home of a woman they came across on their travels who they know will be away for safe shelter during the night. Inside they watch family slide shows wear expensive jewellery and clothes and live like royalty  or as Howard said like Nice people. The night seems perfect and the couple seem at their happiest. It all turns horrible with police catching up with the outlaws at the last minute. A slowmotion shootout between the cops and the lovers ends in tragedy and will have tears welling up in your eyes. What made this movie great? The director doesn't start much action until about halfway into the movie but the first half is just as enjoyable as you watch the lover's relationship unfold and blossom. The second half sees their relationship mature and it also sees Anita grow from naive teenager to young woman and Howard grow more comfortable in their relationship. A comingofage movie indeed and yet very very different from what you will expect. An emotional journey that spans lives and loves and will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.";

Soshe had several leading rolesand sometimes only supporting partsin a series of very humble movies from the beginnings of the '90s. Some of these movies I enjoyed very much. They were made in a period that coincided with the rather brief revival of the American B movies in the early '90srevival and flourishing that benefited from the screen abilities of persons like Drew Tweed E. Roberts etc.. For a brief period the B cinema in America seemed to set itself up for something. Needless to say that Drew looked very wella fleshy girl with big jugs and more to show. Extremely sexy and arousing in a unpretentious way. On the other hand it was easily immediately noticeable that Drew was as a young actress very competent. She was always more than a body on display. The films she made offered her charms fully used her judiciously and this was a fine thing.Some of her early films well early is relative if we speak about Drew being given her extremely precocious screen debut established her as a sex starlet. Those are in fact the Drew movies I have liked the most. On the other hand these were roles of bad girls. But in other movies she was required to make nicer roles more goodnatured if one can use such a term.Drew brought a note of simplicity charm sincerity and naturalness that is delightful. I mean of course that roles that needed such a thing. Her part in Guncrazy 1992 needed these nice qualities.I guess it was not a single trace of style or of art in those early Drew films from the '90sbut this is not the point. They were but patchwork yet . It was plenty of Drewand this is something I could fully appreciate. Her screen presence was one of the most enjoyable. She also had some kind of natural ability to display in those roles of nippy nimble bad girls and nymphs. In Guncrazy 1992 we find some nodding acquaintances from the early '90s B cinema people like Ironside here as a noisome cop. Guncrazy 1992 is interesting because it seems made by its very protagonists.Drew's adolescent body and physical allure offered a spicy contrast between her homely plenteous shapes and some kind of paprika eroticism she was so good at displaying. This gave the piddling movies a certain pleasant picturesqueness.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am always excited to see the darkness of cinema's past but continually happy with its progress and evolution over the years. If the genre displayed in Guncrazy would have remained throughout the cinematic years I think I would have had to choose a different hobby other than film. Here we have a very gritty very disturbing film which just never seems to leave the hangar. I continually felt that Guncrazy was this grounded plane never geared for takeoff which was disappointing because several times it seemed as if it was ready for liftoff. Director Tamra Davis has her work cut out for her on this picture. It surprised me that the woman who brought us Billy Madison HalfBaked and Crossroads would dare dabble in a project like this  yet she did and I don't think that she succeeded. Matthew Bright the guy who brought us Freeway has a very crafted story but I believe that it is Davis' direction coupled with disappointing acting that ultimately destroys this film.Think about this for a minute. When you are directing a film of this caliber you as a director need to realize that it is more than just a story about sexual teens and violence but instead a haunting image of our world culture and society. As I watched this film I couldn't help but see and sometimes hear Bright's angstridden voice about our society trying to come through but it felt that Davis was pushing that aside in hopes to give Drew more screen time. We kept scratching on the surface of guns and violence but never quite dug deep enough. There was so much that should have happened with this story that Bright's words were completely ignored and left for Davis to butcher. I believe that if Bright would have manned this project we may have seen stronger characters deeper emotions and themes all the while exposing truths about our society. These were elements that were lacking considerably in this film. While it is said that Davis tried to avoid making a remake of Crazy is the Female I believe that the older film spoke more about society than this film did. Davis covered up truths and intelligence with overly clichd shock moments coupled with silly incoherent violence.With Davis practically missing the mark behind the camera this left nothing for the actors. Barrymore decently tries to fill the shoes of this innocent 17year old that only wanted love and would do anything for it but the lacking chemistry between her and LeGros overshadows her performance. I felt as if Davis could only afford a portion of LeGros for this film and most of the time he was replaced with a cardboard cutout of himself. He gave no emotion to his character. I realize that he was to show how corrupt the world had been to him but does that mean he cannot smile frown show fear excitement hatred distrust love or any range of emotions that come with being an actor. LeGros hurt this film. Typically I like his performances but I don't think he was ready nor did it seem that he really wanted this role. This hurt the foundation of the film. Here we have Barrymore giving a decent performance but LeGros doesn't hold up his end of the bargain which ultimately hurts any support that we have for our heroines.While I sternly believe that Davis destroyed the overall tone of the film and LeGros' cardboard image impeded any connection with Barrymore there were some scenes that I thought Bright exceptionally wrote into this film. My favorite scene in the entire film was when Anita and Howard were together at the house living a life that could never be theirs. It was so interesting to see these two victims of poverty living breathing and experiencing a physically imaginative world. Then a pivotal changing moment in the film occurs and it really places this film into a different perspective. I wasn't expecting this type of change in the film and it really showcased what Bright was trying to accomplish. Another scene that I enjoyed occurred right before this monumental scene when Hank is just about to be arrested by his parole officer. He screams down the hall of the hospital and all Anita responds with is What's he yellin' about now? This shocked me because it completely tore down any barriers that I thought I already knew about Anita and Hank's relationship. Was there a level of comfortability settling in with the relationship? Interesting turn which captured my attention. Sadly the remaining scenes were just a flagrant disrespect to Bright's darkening talent.Overall I wasn't impressed with this film. I strongly suggest it to those who are big Matthew Bright fans but we forewarned this is not as exceptional or as shocking as Freeway was. This was a film completely chastised by Tamra Davis and James LeGros. Barrymore decently carries herself a la Reese Witherspoon in Freeway but it just doesn't come together smoothly. The overall tone and elements are completely missing as Davis implements increasing scenes of shock value instead of stronger elements of society. It is difficult to watch not because of what occurs in the film but because of the lack of direction acting and overall momentum. The final result seems more like a cheaply tailored small tuxedo on a very large man. It covers the wrong spots. Skip it. You will live life happier.Grade  out of ".

However if you want to see a 17year old Drew in yet again sexual situations none of which are good then this is the movie for you.It combines the I married an excon I like guns and I'm a sexually troubled girl plots into yet another movie.Directed by Tamra Davis who made at least one pretty good movie Skipped Parts so she is not totally without talent. The movie was written by Matthew Bright who wrote Freeway a few years earlier so he has talent as well. Included are Drew Barrymore Ione Skye and a couple other notable names however they display no real talents here.I guess the dialog is the weakest link here. Some of it just sounds bad or out of place.There are no extra features but the DVD is available for about 7.99. You could do worse but not by much.".

Though Sudden Fear is not a comedy it has moments that are truly hysterical in a did they really just say that? kind of way. Watch for the moments when Joan responds to overheard conversations personal scheming or the voices in her headwith nothing but wideeyed reaction shots. Joan is also a tremendously sympathetic character more so than in almost any other Crawford film I've ever seen and I've seen almost all of them. I caught this film on TV one night and was utterly surprised at how entertaining it was. Not that I had low expectations but Sudden Fear wasn't a film I'd ever heard of. It was proof that there are lots of dark diamonds hidden out there. We all know about the top 100 lists and the legendary films on them but there are gems worth watching that never got the attention they should have. I watched from beginning to end not knowing what to expect. Truly thrilling in places and just plain classic Crawford. Watch for the moment when Joan embraces her love interest Palance and asks I was just wondering what I'd done to deserve you.".

Some of the shots are as inspired as anything ever seen in Hollywood such as one in Joan Crawford's library where upon hearing an inadvertent recording made on her dictaphone she gradually shrinks back in horror against the far wall until she becomes nearly a dot in the distance. That shot is a real triumph of cinematic inspiration. Much is accomplished with a clock and its pendulum with the starshaped pendulum at one point shown in shadow swinging across her chest as she gets more and more anxious. None of this is overdone but is all subtle and effective. Joan Crawford has us all spellbound with her magnificent performance. She throws vanity to the winds and is not afraid to show her character as someone in the round complete with cowardice foolishness and even extreme stupidity combined with cunning intelligence charm and inspiration. Rarely has a woman been shown so soaked in sweat with sheer terror and she must have stepped straight out of the shower for each of those shots. When we aren't staring at her incredulous we notice that Jack Palance is highly effective and then we have the delectable treat of Gloria Grahame turning up. Which true cineaste does not adore Gloria Grahame? She herself probably never knew what all the fuss was about regarding herself no doubt as an ordinary girl. But Gloria Grahame was far from ordinary. She had that indefinable something plus a lot of other somethings which for reasons which are deeply mysterious and impossible to explain leave many people like myself in a state of entranced wonder. What was it about her? No matter how many times we watch her we will never know all we can say is there will never be another one. This film is a real humdinger.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that the first impressions are really the most lasting. No matter how seriously we take that into account a slightly similar conclusion could arise at the encounter of a playwright Myra Hudson Joan Crawford with an actor she auditions. Lester Blaine Jack Palance does not appear to be HER idea of a romantic leading man he just looks romantic but does not sound so. What is more his notion about an oil painting of Casanova leaves confusing riddle within her mind and yet...she will soon stand before the dilemma to make up her mind and stick to it no matter what price she is going to pay. Like Joan Crawford did not initially prefer Jack Palance as her leading man in the motion picture Myra Hudson did not fancy Lester. Changing her mind however occurs inevitable. Myra soon utters romantically Without you I have nothing! And yet is the truth about him disguised behind a romantic smile? Will sudden fear occur to disillusion Myra and rescue her from sudden murder?When I have recently viewed this wonderful film noir I felt it was the right time because I had already got to know the greatest films of the genre not superior ones but similar ones. What I mean by that are the films directed by the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock. When seeing SUDDEN FEAR you had better be acquainted with some of Hitchcock's best films because then you may realize that SUDDEN FEAR has so much in common with the gem of noir. It's Hitchcock's fertile theme and Miller's stylish bravura. From the characters objects undertones certain details doomfilled atmosphere to the unique charm of San Francisco and the utterance that seems to be the core of Hitchcock's suspense This place is so perfect for an accident. Let me broaden some aspects of David Miller's picture which make us see it as one of the greatest representatives of its genre in the purest form.The TORMENTED LEADING CHARACTER Myra Hudson played brilliantly by Joan Crawford highlights something truly ahead of its time. As an executive producer of SUDDEN FEAR Ms Crawford allows viewers to get into her inner psyche and provokes a progressive approach we psychoanalyze her as a character! Nothing like a linear storytelling forget it! Yet something that talks about a psychological world. We psychoanalyze her 'professional eye' in the theater scene her coldness melted on a train at the match game that becomes as mysterious as the manipulative flirts her 'blind confidence' in wedding Lester the seeds of doubt that are being slowly planted from the moment he does not answer her phone. As a matter of fact this is a purely genius scene when viewersobservers unlike Myra herself are granted a signal something is wrong about him. As a result we differ from Myra we feel suspicion earlier than her and consequently wait for her disillusion. When the unbelievable shock comes in her library and she confronts the reality her behavior is utterly unpredictable she does not resort to a state of blending fantasy with reality but remains cold and disguised both to us and to the people around her. In that respect isn't she a typical Hitchcock's leading lady? Apart from one difference  she is not a blonde. Nominated for Oscar Joan Crawford offers us a pure masterwork of acting.JACK PALANCE who replaces Ms Crawford's initial wish of casting Marlon Brando or Clark Gable is truly surprising as a leading man. The fact we are not used to him in such a highlighted performance that combines a doeeyed romanticist with a secret fox makes the effect even more memorable. An important fact here to state is that Lester is equally appealing in the psychoanalyzing approach as Myra. His pretense at the beginning his patronizing behavior on the train his look at hands and his gradual 'promotion' in Myra's eyes beautifully depict an ambitious type. Later his vitality and efforts are somehow focused on two women Myra and Irene. When Myra begins to be his object of wealth's desire Irene becomes his object of lust's desire. She is a 'blonde of lust.' Their scheme is a realization of their sexuality  something very Hitchcocklike where crime goes with sex. Kiss me hard... Note the love scene at the fireplace in the summerhouse and the way it is shot. Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actor Jack Palance appears to give a performance beyond our expectations.Another great aspect that makes the genre so engrossing and absorbing is the use of objects that manipulate our perceptions and the cinematography that builds the atmosphere. Staircase scenes that purely recall STRANGERS ON A TRAIN and many great noir genres. And the objects including the clock that reveals heartbeat the phone that disturbs the chain of emotions and rises fear and above all the DICTATING MACHINE that becomes in a way another character of the story. The nightmarish fantasy seems to recall SPELLBOUND. The atmosphere is immensely powerful as the secret is partly revealed by the dictating machine I know a way and Myra's reaction being one of the most natural and daring we can encounter. Mind you the realism she vomits and we deduce it. Charles Lang's cinematography reaches the climax in the shots of interiors where everything seems to be overwhelmed by torments images are combined with various sounds from the clock ticking to screaming and morose silence.For a number of reasons SUDDEN FEAR is a surprisingly modern entertainment its age makes it a unique achievement on its own and the one that will never be duplicated thanks to top rate performances haunting cinematography plenty of daring ideas. A really ambitious and insightful production. One and only in its riveting entertainment!".

And the objects including the clock that reveals heartbeat the phone that disturbs the chain of emotions and rises fear and above all the DICTATING MACHINE that becomes in a way another character of the story. The nightmarish fantasy seems to recall SPELLBOUND. The atmosphere is immensely powerful as the secret is partly revealed by the dictating machine I know a way and Myra's reaction being one of the most natural and daring we can encounter. Mind you the realism she vomits and we deduce it. Charles Lang's cinematography reaches the climax in the shots of interiors where everything seems to be overwhelmed by torments images are combined with various sounds from the clock ticking to screaming and morose silence.For a number of reasons SUDDEN FEAR is a surprisingly modern entertainment its age makes it a unique achievement on its own and the one that will never be duplicated thanks to top rate performances haunting cinematography plenty of daring ideas. A really ambitious and insightful production. One and only in its riveting entertainment!";

Jack Palance gives a strong and convincing performance as a conman who marries Ms. Crawford. He is suave urbane and sinister. Yet this movie is a Joan Crawford showcase. She is the center of the story and she succeeds in making this movie a most effective work of cinematic art. The cinematography is outstanding it captures and conveys the sense of terror as the audience is taken on an emotional roller coaster ride toward a final exciting conclusion.".

Little has been written about it and it's the kind of film one used to learn about through word of mouth and coincidence though sites like this make that easier now. But what really turns my crank about this film is its brilliant combination of cinematography and sound. In many ways this is a silent film and Crawford coming of age during the silent era reprises her silent self masterfully during the final third of the film. Silent films were never fully 'silent'they were accompanied by music. In this film the musical score complements the visual action but sound effects increasingly become front and center as the film progresses completely overtaking dialog toward the end. The sound of the windup dog as it walks across the carpet a walk shot so tightly that we see the weave of the rug the dog walks on and the thread in the rug that catches its paw just in time. The sound of the Dictaphone machine a new technology at the time and the way the recording of Irene Neves' Gloria Grahame's disembodied mechanical voice repeats I know a place over and over several minutes actually are crucial to the suspense of this film. The final third of the film is virtually dialogfreeinstead through an inspired use of flash forwards we enter a truly cinematic space of the fantastic the paranoid and finally the sublime. Joan walks alone into the morning light. The silent section of the film the ticking clock and its Poelike pendulum telegraph her moral ambiguity. See this filmit's a unique an early 1950s reprise on the silent cinema and how to communicate to an audience through visuals and sound effects. It's widely available on DVD and the transfer is excellent.".

Her plan to save her life and get rid of them is also great. However her clumsy and moralist attitudes are terrible and reduces what could have been a little masterpiece to a good filmnoir only.

Who should kind of turn up on this train but Palance? He and Crawford play poker and she falls in love with him. OK it seems He wasn't right for a Broadway Don Juan. But for an unmarried lady of a certain age like her he has just what it takes.The fact that Crawford and Palance the actors have no chemistry isn't a problem. In a way it works in the movie's favor. We know he hasn't forgotten the humiliation she put him through. We know she thought him not so hot to begin with.Gloria Graham is used well as his girlfriend. They're kind of rough with each other too. He speaks of breaking all her bones rather casually and almost endearingly.Once Crawford and Palance have married the suspense heats up. It's a highly suspenseful film  well written and well directed. Palance is nimble in his role and Crawford is at her very best too. My problem with it is that I've seen it a few times and the print has never been good which is a problem in the dark scenes toward the end.But compare this with other movies Crawford was making at around the same time.

Speaking of feet Sudden Fear seems for whatever reason to have more than a usual number of closeups of its stars stockinged feet and her shoes. No one has ever seen anyone so beautiful as Crawford in these movies. Maybe this made sense at the time but it doesn't now. She was near 50. Inthose days this was like being near 65 for a woman.In Sudden Fear she is an old maid. No one comments on her appearance one way or another. She is rich and successful but it doesn't seem that we're meant to view her as a great beauty. What we have instead is a beautiful movie  quite possibly her best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sudden Fear 1952Such a dark and dramatic noirstyled surprise for me. Joan Crawford as the rich daughter and talented playwright is terrific avoiding the camp of later years and really playing a complex emotional role perfectly. I didn't even notice that Gloria Grahame was in it and when she shows up I knew there was going to be a thrillshe balances Crawford and gives the third main actor Jack Palance a way to bounce back and forth. And Palance as a seeming actorlover is twosided and then some and really gives the part depth. He's so believably likably it's chilling.Add to this some of the darkest and most shadowy night photography you've seen and a hard hitting orchestral score and fast editing up and down the streets of San Francisco and you've got a gem. It's an amazing overthetop movie but it makes sense and the last shot of Joan Crawford at night I'll say no more is astonishing for its emotional shifts. Yes there is Mildred Pierce and countless other great Crawford films but for her performance alone you have to see this one.

	onyx:emotionText "Sudden Fear 1952Such a dark and dramatic noirstyled surprise for me. Joan Crawford as the rich daughter and talented playwright is terrific avoiding the camp of later years and really playing a complex emotional role perfectly. I didn't even notice that Gloria Grahame was in it and when she shows up I knew there was going to be a thrillshe balances Crawford and gives the third main actor Jack Palance a way to bounce back and forth. And Palance as a seeming actorlover is twosided and then some and really gives the part depth. He's so believably likably it's chilling.Add to this some of the darkest and most shadowy night photography you've seen and a hard hitting orchestral score and fast editing up and down the streets of San Francisco and you've got a gem. It's an amazing overthetop movie but it makes sense and the last shot of Joan Crawford at night I'll say no more is astonishing for its emotional shifts. Yes there is Mildred Pierce and countless other great Crawford films but for her performance alone you have to see this one. Director David Miller I've never heard of and may never hear of again judging by his film history but he pulls off a stylish intense masterpiece. It's filled with common types and common twists but a lot of them and well done well done.";

Of course if I saw Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame together I'd know something was up. The first choices for the Lester role were Gable and Marlon Brando. Palance is excellent as a masculine romantic man hiding a violent and psychopathic personality.

The opening scenes are intriguing but what follows quickly becomes very gripping and full of suspense and remains that way right up until the movie's violent conclusion.This story about treachery greed and revenge is well written well acted and presented in a way which is visually impressive and full of atmosphere. The use of interesting camera angles close ups and dramatic shadow patterns also contribute strongly to the ominous mood and the emotional intensity of the piece.At the rehearsals for her latest Broadway play Myra Hudson Joan Crawford is unimpressed by the inexperienced actor who'd been cast as the leading man and arranges for him to be axed without delay. Some weeks after the successful opening of her play she catches a train to return home to San Francisco and notices that the actor she'd fired is also on board. Lester Blaine Jack Palance accepts Myra's invitation to join her for a drink and they get to know each other better. Their relationship soon develops into a romance and the couple marry and settle in San Francisco.One evening Lester and Myra attend a party together and meet Junior Kearney Touch Connors who is one of Myra's lawyers and he introduces them to his new girlfriend Irene Neves Gloria Grahame who also happens to be one of Lester's old flames.Myra is an heiress and Lester discovers that she is in the process of changing her will to leave most of her estate to a heart disease foundation. In her study Myra has a voice activated dictating machine which she uses to write her plays. On her birthday she starts to use the machine to record her will but breaks off from that task when the guests start to arrive for her party.During the party Lester and Irene slip into the study together and next morning when Myra uses the Dictaphone again she discovers that she'd inadvertently left it switched on overnight and is then shocked to hear Lester and Irene's conversation in which they discuss their plan to kill Myra before she can arrange for her original will to be changed. In her state of fear and panic Myra accidentally drops the recording which could have provided evidence of the couple's treachery.Eventually when she starts to come to terms with what's happened Myra responds to the situation by devising a clever scheme to murder Lester and frame Irene. Before she's able to carry out her plan she recognises that her conscience will not allow her to go through with it and her life then remains under threat until the story's shocking climax is reached.The performances by Crawford Palance and Grahame are all top class and the supporting cast are also very good. Joan Crawford is at her very best as she portrays convincingly the ruthless side of her character at the beginning of the story the wonderful happiness that she enjoys when her relationship with Lester seems to be perfect and then the devastation heartbreak and sheer terror that she experiences on learning about the plot to kill her.Jack Palance is extremely effective as the controlled but also very devious and threatening Lester who conceals his powerful bitterness and hatred for Myra so well. Gloria Grahame also makes a great impact as the greedy and totally unprincipled Irene.It's ironic that an actor who was considered so unsuitable for the romantic lead in a play should be so successful in making Myra fall deeply in love with him and the fact that he was able to conceal so well how much he detested her was also proof of his considerable acting ability.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sudden Fear proves a doubly unexpected pleasure As one of the more inventive and effective suspense thrillers of the 1950s and as a Joan Crawford picture from her last decade of real stardom in which she pulls from the full fetch of her longseasoned acting skills.Crawford plays San Francisco heiressturnedplaywright Myra Hudson in New York for rehearsals of her latest hit play HalfWay to Heaven.  Producer and director find their new leading man Jack Palance an ideal mouthpiece for dribbling out her syrupy dialogue.  But Crawford repelled by the alarmingly Cubist planes of his face has him fired the offscreen Palance had been burned badly in the war and underwent reconstructive surgery.But on board a train back to California she notsoserendipitously meets up with him again. They have a drink play gin rummy and soon are sharing their histories under the night sky of the observation car.  Now an item they enter Crawford's upscale social whirl until the crafty Palance plays his hardtoget card. Crawford falls for the ploy and makes him her husband.Enter Gloria Grahame some nasty unfinished business of Palance's from back east Kiss me  Kiss me hard'. These two schemers plan to wrest a hefty divorce settlement from Crawford but when it seems that her will specifies otherwise they move to Plan B.  Thanks however to the elaborately clunky recording equipment the author has installed in her study Crawford learns not only that her bridegroom loathes her but that he plans to murder her for her money. In this audacious and prolonged scene Crawford remains wordless as the taped voices hiss and sputter out I know a way...I know a way...I know a way' letting her extraordinary eyes do the acting and reminding us that her career started in the silent era.  But once her hysteria subsides Crawford puts her writer's wiles to work and starts some intricate plotting of her own....Crawford starts out at her customary bigstar wattage that fanmagazine glamour which at this stage of her career had to be all but welded on.  But as her illusory happiness crumbles so does her armored facade.  Pitiless closeups of her contorted sweaty face show us the aging woman beneath the camouflage and give a foreshock of her coming roles in fright films particularly that other Hudson Blanche in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?.  It was a courageous move for this notoriously vain and controlling actress perhaps she recognized in Lenore Coffee's script the last role with the possible exception of Blanche that would ever test her mettle. Her instincts were right.  Sudden Fear is testament that no Crawford was more than the talentless drunken witch her idle detractors would have us believe.  Once again she did what was expected of her as a star and what she did for vehicles far less promising than Sudden Fear She carried the picture on her broad shoulders unassisted by shoulder pads.Trivia note This movie marks the film debut of Mike here Touch' Connors TV's Mannix.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sudden Fear proves a doubly unexpected pleasure As one of the more inventive and effective suspense thrillers of the 1950s and as a Joan Crawford picture from her last decade of real stardom in which she pulls from the full fetch of her longseasoned acting skills.Crawford plays San Francisco heiressturnedplaywright Myra Hudson in New York for rehearsals of her latest hit play HalfWay to Heaven.  Producer and director find their new leading man Jack Palance an ideal mouthpiece for dribbling out her syrupy dialogue.  But Crawford repelled by the alarmingly Cubist planes of his face has him fired the offscreen Palance had been burned badly in the war and underwent reconstructive surgery.But on board a train back to California she notsoserendipitously meets up with him again. They have a drink play gin rummy and soon are sharing their histories under the night sky of the observation car.  Now an item they enter Crawford's upscale social whirl until the crafty Palance plays his hardtoget card. Crawford falls for the ploy and makes him her husband.Enter Gloria Grahame some nasty unfinished business of Palance's from back east Kiss me  Kiss me hard'. These two schemers plan to wrest a hefty divorce settlement from Crawford but when it seems that her will specifies otherwise they move to Plan B.  Thanks however to the elaborately clunky recording equipment the author has installed in her study Crawford learns not only that her bridegroom loathes her but that he plans to murder her for her money. In this audacious and prolonged scene Crawford remains wordless as the taped voices hiss and sputter out I know a way...I know a way...I know a way' letting her extraordinary eyes do the acting and reminding us that her career started in the silent era.  But once her hysteria subsides Crawford puts her writer's wiles to work and starts some intricate plotting of her own....Crawford starts out at her customary bigstar wattage that fanmagazine glamour which at this stage of her career had to be all but welded on.  But as her illusory happiness crumbles so does her armored facade.  Pitiless closeups of her contorted sweaty face show us the aging woman beneath the camouflage and give a foreshock of her coming roles in fright films particularly that other Hudson Blanche in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?.  It was a courageous move for this notoriously vain and controlling actress perhaps she recognized in Lenore Coffee's script the last role with the possible exception of Blanche that would ever test her mettle. Her instincts were right.  Sudden Fear is testament that no Crawford was more than the talentless drunken witch her idle detractors would have us believe.  Once again she did what was expected of her as a star and what she did for vehicles far less promising than Sudden Fear She carried the picture on her broad shoulders unassisted by shoulder pads.Trivia note This movie marks the film debut of Mike here Touch' Connors TV's Mannix.";

It does get off to a slow start with some uneventful storytelling and parts that could easily have been trimmed but when it gets going it is just an excellent film as a filmnoir thriller and a film in general with a riveting and very suspenseful second half in particular.The costumes and sets are sumptuous and the lighting gives the right amount of chills in the appropriate places. Visually most impressive was the cinematographynominated for an Oscar for a good reason the film is just exquisitely shot and one of the bestlooking filmnoirs of the early 50s. The dream sequence and the whole second half reminiscent of the ending of The Third Man stood out in this regard. Elmer Bernstein's score is hauntingly dynamic and sends chills up the spine sometimes while the film also has a literate script that doesn't hesitate in making the characters interesting and expertly direction.Joan Crawford is superb in the lead role classic Crawford really and wholly deserving of the Oscar nomination while Gloria Grahame lights up the screen in a deliciously sultry performance and Jack Palance also nominated shows very well early in his career how good he could be in sinister roleshe was also Oscarnominated for Shane a year later which I did admittedly did find a much better performance. All in all starts slow but ends rivetingly an excellent film noir with the cinematography being especially good. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "As one of the other reviewers here has noted Sudden Fear is a fascinating cross between a woman's film and film noir. Perhaps because of its older female protagonist it has been unfairly neglected. Joan Crawford acting less histrionically than usual plays Myra Hudson an heiress and successful playwright. The fact that she's rich and talented makes her an obvious target. She falls for and marries sleazy actor Lester Blaine terrifically played by Jack Palance. Blaine and his mistress the younger and more attractive Irene Gloria Grahame plot to kill her for her fortune. Crawford looks middleaged and frumpy in this film she seems to be wearing less makeup and is photographed from less flattering angles. It almost transforms her into a different actress. Its as if we're seeing her true face. For financial reasons Lester and Irene only have a small window of time to murder her in order to get the money. The latter part of the film is punctuated by ticking clocks. Myra has minutes to pull herself together and save her own life. The ticking clocks also have to do with Myra's aging dwindling attractiveness and mortality. There are many closeups of her aging hands and feet that have the effect of magnifying her physical vulnerability. In the film's dramatic denouement Myra dresses like Irene and the two women's identities merge as they become the object of Blaine's murderous rage. Crawford's training as a silent film actress make the last part of the film extraordinary. A truly great film!".

The film has a fantastic dream sequence and an effective fantasy one in which Joan foresees how her counterplot will ideally play out. It is juxtaposed later with the reality of carrying things off and it's brilliant.I consider David Miller to be generally a mediocre director. But herein he is unusually cinematic. Contrast this with his later femaleindistress picture Midnight Lace with Doris Day for all its atmosphere or his later film with Crawford The Story of Esther Costello which seems leaden in comparison.Wellscripted directed and acted Sudden Fear is a funfilled thrill ride with much to savor along the way to its beautifully contrived climax.p.s.

	schema:reviewBody "There are some very good features to this thriller that make up for its occasional flaws.  Joan Crawford is very good in a role that gives her a chance to do a lot of different things and the story builds up suspense effectively to the point where you share in the anxiety and fear of her character.  Those strengths make up for the implausible and occasionally unsatisfying plot turns.Crawford's role gives her a chance to start off as a supremely confident comfortable playwright whose dream world is then transformed into a nightmare.  She does quite a convincing job of taking her character through the joys fears and other turns that she experiences.  It is largely thanks to her performance that the suspense buildup works especially well.  By the time that the lengthy catandmouse game in the last half of the movie begins you are really thinking and feeling along with her.  The crisis is built up skillfully though again at the cost of some credibility.This works very well the first time you see it.  Watching it over again it is easier to see through the less credible plot devices and other small flaws.  But none of the flaws detract from Crawford's fine leading performance.  Overall it's a pretty good thriller and certainly well worth seeing once.".

With that cast I just remembered that Elisa Cook Jr. has a memorable role as a blind man here with Anatole Litvak as director and Dimitri Tiomkin conducting his score as well as some Beethoven pieces spread among it I expected an excellent suspenseful movie and I got it! Well maybe nearly so since the speech Ms. Bel Geddes says to Fonda at the end is obviously contrived to address the audience as well as the leading character about the faith of people. Otherwise the dialogue was mostly spoton especially the heated exchanges between Fonda and Price who as usual is absolutely charming even in his creepiness. And Ms. Dvorak marks a nice contrast with her cynicism as compared with Ms. Bel Geddes' optimism. Fonda himself goes the full range of emotions whether during the flashbacks or his present condition of being holed up in his apartment while the police are waiting outside. So for all that I highly recommend The Long Night.".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry Fonda goes through The Long Night after committing murder in this 1947 film noir directed by Anatole Litvak and also starring Vincent Price Ann Dvorak and Barbara Bel Geddes. Fonda plays Joe a returning veteran now a blue collar worker who falls in love with young pretty fellow orphan Jo Ann Bel Geddes only to come up against Price. Price plays Maximilian a creepy magician with a show that features dogs and Charlene Ann Dvorak. At first Maximilian asks Joe to stay away from Charlene because she's his longlost daughter and he wants better for her. From Charlene Joe learns the truth  Maximilian is not her father and she's attracted to his worldliness  though she claims to love Joe. Depressed he turns to the sexy Charlene his heart still with Jo Ann. During a fight in his apartment he shoots Maximilian and spends the entire movie under siege in his apartment as he relives in flashback and flashback within flashback what led him to this moment.Litvak a talented director stages this film in an interesting manner  it begins with a blind man Elisha Cook Jr. stumbling across the body of Maximilian in the hallway of the apartment building where he lives. Joe will not leave his room and the police work throughout the film to get him out. The photography and direction capture the darkness and drabness of Joe's surroundings the cheapness of the nightclub where Maximilian performs and focuses a harsh light on Charlene's room and Charlene herself.Despite all of this great style the film has a cheesy quality the characters aren't really likable except for poor Joe and the motivations of the characters aren't fully fleshed out so the story ultimately doesn't make it. The acting is very good  Fonda shows us some still waters that run pretty deep in an excellently crafted performance. He's sexy as all getout too when he lays down on Charlene's bed and smiles. Dvorak does a great job as a brittle Charlene and Price is a complete sleazebag as the cruel Maximilian. Bel Geddes is incredibly young  this is her first film and though she was 24 or 25 she looks and acts about 18 which is appropriate for this smalltown inexperienced girl.The Long Night has some interesting elements but because of a spotty script we're not invested enough in the film for it to be really intriguing or exciting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry Fonda Vincent Price and the film noir genre are reasons enough to see any film and The Long Night did show a lot of promise. I didn't find that the The Long Night quite delivered enough but it certainly has a lot of good things. It's very well made for starters one of the most beautifully shot and visually atmospheric film noirs of the 1940s in my opinion. Dmitri Tiomkin's music is far from his best work with a lot of it sounding like rearranged Beethovenyou decide whether you consider that a compliment but it is very haunting and fits the film very well. But the high point of The Long Night was the acting. Henry Fonda gives an intelligently sensitive lead performance and Barbara Bel Geddes managing to look younger than she was in her film debut is very touching as the love interest. Ann Dvorak is deliciously cynical and Vincent Price is effortlessly ominous and smarmy as an utter sleazebag of a characterpeople will argue that he was at odds at the rest of the film but I rest the blame on the writing not Price. The Long Night does have faults though the characters are not fleshed out enough to make me care for themI would have cared more for Joe if the when he's in jeopardy scenario had been made less emotionally hollow and senseless while the script is of rather rambling quality with Bel Geddes' final speech particularly contrivedsounding. The Long Night also lacks momentum pacewise well the final twenty minutes picks up a bit but comes too late and the constant switching back from past to present and vice versa is enough to cause confusion. There are even some ideas like with Joe and Charlene's involvement with one another that are shoehorned in but not explained satisfactorily. So in conclusion interesting for the cast and how it was made but with stronger script and story execution it would've been less underwhelming than it turned out to be. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I wouldn't say The Long Night is a great film and if anything it only peaks my interest more to see how much more classic the film it's based on is Marcel Carne's La Jour se Leve. But for the time it ran I was mostly glued to the screen and got wrapped up in the plight of Henry Fonda's character Joe and his predicament of his downfall from normalcy. It probably isn't very original taking aside its connection with the French source it's about a factory worker very nice guy who falls in love with a woman whom he finds out was an orphan just like him. But one night he follows her to a bar sees her cavorting sort of with a sleazy magician Vincent Price and his perfect image of her is shattered and grows only darker after he meets him he first tells Joe he's her father which is a truly great scene between two huge stars of classic film and when she tells him about her history with him.While I could never take my eyes off the screen it should be said that for all of the strong craftsmanship with the picture it's one of the finest photographed 'noirs' of the late 40s especially for those stark scenes of Joe alone in his room with the whole town on the street calling for him and for all of the tremendous talent in front of the camera besides Fonda and Price who the former it's a splendid and rewarding if not bestever performance and for the latter a triumph of playing sneaky and villainous the girl playing Jo Ann Barbara Bel Geddes is very good it only works up to a point. I was engrossed the most in the last twenty minutes or so as the film revved up its pace and tempo to the will Joe or won't Joe beat. Before that it's many scenes that mostly rely on the presence of the actors to uplift the material past the breezy and conventional air of the dialog. There's nothing especially wrong with the material but it doesn't go anywhere aside from hitting its main points.The Long Night is something of a minor lost marvel only recently did it come out on DVD in an OK print and for Fonda and Price fans its a can'tmiss kind of picture. Just don't go expecting anything that will change your perception of what filmnoirs can go that don't go for the easy routes.".

It has everything going for it  solid cast giving good believable performances good direction even a good speech that Fonda's character delivers from this broken out window as he is under siege by the police that gives us some insight into what it's like for an average guy who has returned home from years of killing and seeing killing in the war expected to pick up where he left off. But ultimately I never see anything that Fonda's character factory laborer Joe Adams has been put through as far as shock or emotional torment or even disillusionment that would justifiably cause him to kill a man. Is Vincent Price's character Maximillian eloquently taunting and creepy? Yes and in a way that Price excelled at over the years starting in noirs and proceeding on into his horror films. However at no time does he do anything that would drive anybody to do more than shoo him away or stuff earplugs in their ears or possibly call the ASPCA You'll have to watch the film to understand this last remark. I'm giving this film a five just for the fact that I believe the production code is the reason any hard edges that seem to be just under the surface never appear. I'm almost positive the script would have gone further if the censors would have allowed it to be so.The real point of interest to me was the action of the police who behave a lot like the fascists that Joe Adams spent years fighting in WWII. Sure they have a murderer holed up in his rented room but he's holding no hostages they've emptied the building and still they spray him twice with automatic gunfire unannounced  once from the outside into his window then from the stairwell into the door. When he pushes a sturdy dresser against the door and they realize they can't force their way in THEN they try talking to Joe starting with the line We're not fooling?? No kidding! After Fonda's speech to the crowd once the crowd starts voicing their support for Joe and promising financial help with a lawyer the police form a line and practically trample the crowd forcing them out of the street. I don't know if the heavy handedness of the police was something that Litvak wanted the audience to notice but it was something I noticed.I'd recommend this one just for the good performances and atmosphere and some imagery you don't see that much in films immediately after WWII but don't expect something shocking or even interesting to happen just because of all of the talent assembled here.".

	schema:headline " Coded Remake Of Le Jour Se Leve";
	schema:reviewBody "Maybe one of these fine days I might get to see the French film Le Jour Se Leve that The Long Night is based on that starred Jean Gabin and Arletty. Just reading the user comments from that board kind of tells me where The Long Night went wrong.Henry Fonda for one thing is horribly miscast in this film. This was a part better played by someone like John Garfield or Montgomery Clift. Either of those two might have better showed the angst that Fonda was feeling as Vincent Price ruins the woman of his dreams.The title The Long Night refers to Fonda holed up in a fourth top floor apartment after he shoots Vincent Price. The film opens with Price staggering out of Fonda's room at the boarding house and falling dead at the top of the stairs. The police investigate and Fonda shoots at them. They settle in for a long siege overnight. The reasons that led up to the homicide unfold in flashbacks.Price plays a Snidely Whiplash type villain. He's a nightclub entertainer with a magic act. Ann Dvorak is his many times around the track assistant not a few of those times with Price and Barbara Bel Geddes is the young girl who Fonda falls for but Price seduces.

	onyx:emotionText "Maybe one of these fine days I might get to see the French film Le Jour Se Leve that The Long Night is based on that starred Jean Gabin and Arletty. Just reading the user comments from that board kind of tells me where The Long Night went wrong.Henry Fonda for one thing is horribly miscast in this film. This was a part better played by someone like John Garfield or Montgomery Clift. Either of those two might have better showed the angst that Fonda was feeling as Vincent Price ruins the woman of his dreams.The title The Long Night refers to Fonda holed up in a fourth top floor apartment after he shoots Vincent Price. The film opens with Price staggering out of Fonda's room at the boarding house and falling dead at the top of the stairs. The police investigate and Fonda shoots at them. They settle in for a long siege overnight. The reasons that led up to the homicide unfold in flashbacks.Price plays a Snidely Whiplash type villain. He's a nightclub entertainer with a magic act. Ann Dvorak is his many times around the track assistant not a few of those times with Price and Barbara Bel Geddes is the young girl who Fonda falls for but Price seduces. Price overacts outrageously to cover the script defects.The problem with adapting Le Jour Se Leve to the American cinema seems to be the Production Code still firmly in place. What they could show in France they could not show here.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen bad movies. This is not a poorly made movie. But it's bad nonetheless.Why? I asked myself as I sat through it never bored for one minute. The black and white cinematography is often quite good. The acting at least Henry Fonda's and Vincent Price's is good given what they had to work with.The script certainly is terrible. Far too many things don't make sense. At the end when all those men down below are calling up to Fonda saying that they're his friend and that they will help him you remember that in all that preceded the end he had been shown as a loner with no friends. Where did all those very devoted friends come from all of a sudden? And how could Barbara Bel Geddes' character be so nave as to go on trips with a man who had forced his affections on her? There is a limit to innocence after all.I kept having the feeling that there was a LOT of script that had for some reason never been shot that we were missing out on a lot of details that would have made sense of some of what remained.I honestly can't think of any reason to recommend this movie to anyone. I very much like Anatole Litvak's better movies  that's why I rented this one  but even so I found this very disappointing. Maybe if you're a fanatic about bw cinematography you could ignore the plot and just watch the picture. Best to turn off the sound if you do.I can't imagine why anyone would have made this movie nor how anyone could have imagined it stood any chance of making any money.Postscript Having now seen the French original on which this movie was very closely based Le jour se lve I understand the reason the script of the American one so often makes no sense puritanism. In the French movie the young woman Franoise has evidently had an onagain offagain affair with the animal trainer Vincent. Jean Gabin's character the one played by Henry Fonda finds out about it. In fact he shoots the animal trainer Vincent Price's character when this latter threatens to tell him about their sex life together.The French movie is very beautiful a real masterpiece. Everything makes sense. Including the end which is the one thing they completely changed for the American version. I won't spoil the French movie by telling you what it is but I will say that it is both very powerful and astoundingly beautifully filmed.Don't waste your time on The Long Night. Yes there are some good touches in it but by the time they have taken all the sex out what remains makes no sense. See Le jour se lve. It's a powerful masterpiece.And if you have seen The Long Night make SURE you see Le jour se lve. The very different end will overwhelm you as it just did me.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Long Night 1947This Anatole Litvak movie is about four things Henry Fonda Sol Polito and Le Jour se Leve.1 Fonda is a nice surprise here. He's got those sad brooding innocent expressions that make you hang in there for him alongside the young Barbara Bel Geddes who is both demure and a screaming desperado in her support role. Fonda also has time of downright cheerfulness and when you see him being lively and chipper you realize how often he is cast as a solid sober dignified type from The Grapes of Wrath to 12 Angry Men on and on.2 Polito is the cinematographer and a great one see any of his films for proof. He moves the camera up and down that stairwell around the darkened room through the crowded streets on and on really making the experience visceral and lyrical. It's no small feat. Watch.3 Le Jour se Leve is the 1939 French movie that is the basis for The Long Night. The writing for this Litvak version is really sharp and a couple times hilarious in the best way and they make the most of the original idea of a man thinking over his crime and the causes for it. Which bring up number four the essence of film noir. We often think of film noir as a style and this one has lots of night shooting and deep shadows. It's also sometimes a period which is mostly post World War II so late 1940s into the 1950s. One of the key elements to classic noir is the idea of a man alone out of step with the world often vulnerable to a woman or two who may or may not have such good intentions. And this man represents the returning soldier who in reality was out of step with the new booming America.4 So here we have a textbook example a soldier who was forced to do his murderous job during the war and now faces an America that he can't quite fit into. The struggle is all on the surface here even the crowds make clear they are ready to support him through his adjustment and even though there are no classic noir lines from some detective hardboiler and even though Fonda is no Mitchum or Bogart this is a perfect noir in other ways and more about inner human struggles than external drama. Is it good? Yes for all these reasons. It's not flawless Vincent Price is an odd presence but if you like Price you'll enjoy him too but it has its flawless aspects and is guaranteed to move you. For many men in a 1947 audience it had to have been gutwrenching and inspiring. And it still is.".

It's about as noir as it gets in my book taking the great definition from one of the guys over at RaraAvis that hardboiled  tough while noir  screwed. Henry Fonda is quite astonishing in a role that takes him from average Joe to suicidal killer. I think it's one of his very best performances and I'm a GREAT admirer of his other performances. Barbara Bel Geddes is mousy but real as the nave young woman Fonda falls for. The only problem I had with the movie was Vincent Price's performance of an overwritten role. On one hand it's exactly the kind of role Price normally excels in but it's far too florid and phony for this kind of film. Watching his scenes with Fonda it's like watching two movies at the same timewhen the camera's on Price it's Forever Amber. When the camera's on Fonda it's Out of the Past. For the perfect version of this kind of pseudobersophisticate in a noir setting one need only look to Clifton Webb in Laura. Webb made that character live and breath. Price orates. With his fey ways and foppish hairdo he grated on my nerves. The character should very well do so in this film but to me it was Price and the scripting of his character that were grating. But that's a mere cavil. This is a splendid film digging as sort of an ancestor to Blue Velvet into the rot beneath the seemingly every daythe difference being that most of the people who populate the edges of this movie seem to be very decent and honorable. Anatole Litvak's direction and Sol Polito's brilliant photography surprised me in scene after scene with their classic yet innovative dark style.

But I'd argue that this is not noir. There's nothing edgy about it. Maybe it's chick noir. But there's no new postwar morality to be found in it. It's as dark as a Hallmark card. By the end its becomes some very weird trippy longwinded mix of Meet John Doe and As the World Turns.";

	schema:reviewBody "Putting aside the fact that this film is a remake of a French classic by Marcel Carne and trying to judge it independently it is a superb noir production. It most notable element is a spectacular film debut by Barbara Bel Geddes as the innocent victim of a sleazy seducer Vincent Price at his oiliest who starts out frozen from her traumatic origins in an orphanage and ends up screaming her heart out with all the passion of first love. Geddes holds back in the first half of the story refusing to accept or engage with Henry Fonda who has declared his love for her so readily. Not only does she find it difficult to trust him but she is in thrall to a dream created by the master illusionist Price. Fonda does very well in this film being less droll than usual and actually manages to convince us that he is emotionally engaged rather than a bemused spectator. The fantastic amount of firepower trained on him as he is holed up in his room in a boarding house and the readiness of the police to shoot first and think later is horrifying. I found it bizarre in the extreme that the music credit on the film stated 'Music composed and conducted by Dimitri Tiomkin' when most of it was a dumbeddown rescoring by Tiomkin of the second movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. That is really an outrageous 'steal'. Anna Dvorak is very good indeed in this film as Charlene who has seen it all and then some falls for Fonda but takes it on the chin when she sees he doesn't see her. But the film must have been seriously cut because at one point we see Fonda throwing himself onto Charlene's bed with a very familiar air obviously being her lover but the dialogue makes no overt reference to there even being a meaningful relationship. Clearly a gutted script! If you look too hard you will see a lot of holes in the story and the action. But this film is pulled off satisfactorily anyway is gripping and because of Geddes is also moving.".

	schema:reviewBody "A delightful BHorror film filled with odd characters shadowed corridors and a decent plot...Castle of the Living Dead when viewed late at night will keep the viewer more amused than scared. I first saw this film as a boy and forever thereafter tried to remember the title so I could see it again. Where else can you find a movie other than Lord of the Rings with a heroic dwarf wish he was born later in life so that he could have played Frodoand his side kick deafmute giant perhaps the inspiration for Miller's MasterBlaster Donald Sutherland as a witch and a bungling policesoldier keeping his trademark smirk in tact and a beautiful female victim that is saved from poisoning by a thirsty cat. Also two other performances must be given honorable mention...the sullen Cristopher Lee playing Count Drago who bears the resemblance of a Gothic Heroin addict..and his henchman Sandro whose bulging eyes and psychodrenched laugh make for added cinema enjoyment. This is a foreign film and carries some of the Sociopathic drama an early 1960's horror film might entail. No graphic slashing here but the dart in the eye of the lowly deafmute delivers a taste for future gore films. The dubbing is close enough to understand and keeps in pace with the film's B status. The plot line is basic but interesting...taking place just after the Napoleanic Wars a mad Count who is interested in science discovers a way of prolonging life...only his results are stereotypically creepy. When a traveling troupe of circus performers are bid to come and entertain at his castle the plot enfolds into a allout who is going to live and who is going to die story. Sutherland's witch character prophesizes this much so the tension mounts towards who the final survivors will be. I loved the set of this movie which must have been filmed on location. The Castle's giant faced back entrance is a must see and the huge stone animal objects in the entangled gardens make this Black and White film eerie and strange. Wind shadows moonlit night large castle chambers and outdoor gardens...all the makings of a chilling tale. I highly recommend this film but suggest to view it only late late late night...with a pot of popcorn and maybe with one friend. Also this could be a perfect slumber party film as well...but would be so with differing results. For when you add these odd Castle of the Living Dead characters with a mixture of humorous comments and tired people...the outcome is sure to create a cult film status for a new generation of viewers.cuzdogg".

Where else can you find a movie other than Lord of the Rings with a heroic dwarf wish he was born later in life so that he could have played Frodoand his side kick deafmute giant perhaps the inspiration for Miller's MasterBlaster Donald Sutherland as a witch and a bungling policesoldier keeping his trademark smirk in tact and a beautiful female victim that is saved from poisoning by a thirsty cat. Also two other performances must be given honorable mention...the sullen Cristopher Lee playing Count Drago who bears the resemblance of a Gothic Heroin addict..and his henchman Sandro whose bulging eyes and psychodrenched laugh make for added cinema enjoyment. This is a foreign film and carries some of the Sociopathic drama an early 1960's horror film might entail. No graphic slashing here but the dart in the eye of the lowly deafmute delivers a taste for future gore films. The dubbing is close enough to understand and keeps in pace with the film's B status. The plot line is basic but interesting...taking place just after the Napoleanic Wars a mad Count who is interested in science discovers a way of prolonging life...only his results are stereotypically creepy. When a traveling troupe of circus performers are bid to come and entertain at his castle the plot enfolds into a allout who is going to live and who is going to die story. Sutherland's witch character prophesizes this much so the tension mounts towards who the final survivors will be. I loved the set of this movie which must have been filmed on location. The Castle's giant faced back entrance is a must see and the huge stone animal objects in the entangled gardens make this Black and White film eerie and strange. Wind shadows moonlit night large castle chambers and outdoor gardens...all the makings of a chilling tale. I highly recommend this film but suggest to view it only late late late night...with a pot of popcorn and maybe with one friend. Also this could be a perfect slumber party film as well...but would be so with differing results. For when you add these odd Castle of the Living Dead characters with a mixture of humorous comments and tired people...the outcome is sure to create a cult film status for a new generation of viewers.cuzdogg";

The film is quite atmospheric with some very good chase scenes through dark corridors and a graveyard as well.  The cast is pretty decent with a pintsized dwarf besting all.  The film is of some note as it is one of the earliest performances of Donald Sutherland who has a field day playing an incompetent policeman and a witchold hag.

	schema:reviewBody "Ambiance is what it's all about and this film has plenty of it. The setting is Europe during the Napoleonic era. A traveling circus troop has been invited to perform at a mysterious castle for a Count and his sleazy looking sidekick. This appears to be Donald Sutherland's first film and he does a terrific job in a dual role. His presentation of an old haglike witch is unforgettable. After seeing the movie I found myself repeating some of the macabre rhymes such as Some will live and some will die before the morning sun is high. The acting is solid throughout. Don't expect a lot of action or violence. There's plenty of suspense throughout however. The female minstrel is most exotic looking and one watches in anticipation that she might eventually hike her skirt. The tension generated is occasionally broken by comic relief some of it unintentional no doubt. There is a bit of sword play at the end which appeared very awkward but the awkwardness seemed to enhance the realism in a most peculiar way. It had been years since I had seen this film and I fondly recalled it. I was successful in locating a reasonably crisp copy on DVD. I plan on watching it again soon. I easily rate it a 7 out of 10 based on entertainment value. After all how many films can offer up their own midget toss?".

This story is about a Count Drago Christopher Lee Charlie  the Chocolate Factory who preserves many animals and keeps them in their natural appearance. You would probably say it was taxidermy but this is another form of transformation that works and in an entirely different way. The Count invites a carnival group to entertain him at his mysterious castle where the carnival act shows a man being hanged and brought back to life. Gaia Germani Laura gives a great supporting role as the attractive female who is adored by Count Drago and some other weird and sick looking people. This is a rather early film for Christopher Lee and Donald Sutherland and you can see from their performance they were going to be great stars on the Silver Screen. Great Classic Horror Film.".

The plot isn't much of a mystery but it's fun to watch the cast run through the paces. Often confused with Blood CastleTorture chamber of Doctor Sadism in reference works it's easy to see that many never saw it since it isn't all that similar except for the star. The two reasons that kept me looking are writer1st assistant director Michael Reeves and the debut role for Donald Sutherland. Reeves did his first direction on this and some things will seem rather familiar to fans of She beast and Witchfinder General his later works. Sutherland plays 2 roles an unintelligent soldier and an old hag who speaks prophecy in rhyme. The hag is voiced by another but Sutherland did his own dubbing for the soldier. Luciano Pigozzi turns up to add his own charm to the proceedings. Despite comments by others about there not being a huge need for restoration I have to thank TCM for a lovely job though the letterbox seems a little tight on top. it's old fashioned and somewhat obvious but definitely worthy of preservation.".

We also have the great Christopher Lee slumming here and giving a typically solid Lee performance though not his best. There's also a dwarf among the circus performers.

	schema:reviewBody "Back in the '50s and '60s these EvilCountDoingSomethingBad movies were a dime a dozen.  Nowadays you're lucky if you get one every five years. Which is not necessarily a bad thing if all the entries turned out like this one.The movie involves a traveling band of minstrels traveling to the castle of Count Drago Christopher Lee sporting an odd makeup job to perform. Once there they find that the Count has an interesting taxidermy hobby.  As you will have figured out in the first 15 minutes the Count has more in store for the minstrels than they expected.This movie isn't so much about Lee's plans to turn everthing into a statue his creations aren't stuffed carcasses they're permanently frozen while living it's about the stupidity of the minstrels.  Look at these examples of how they completely miss the fact that they are in danger they don't suspect anything being invited to a remote castle for a private appearance for three gold pieces !! or when they're warned by an old hag Donald Sutherland for Christ's sake!! that they will die if they go to the castle when Lee tells the lead minstrel that he has started using humans but substitutes the word animal for human the minstrel doesn't catch on the strongmanfirebreather doesn't notice the evil henchman standing 10 feet away preparing to shoot him in the eye with a crossbow the female minstrel doesn't realize that a man she knew is dead even though he is completely immobile and attached to a stand nor does she catch on when the Count talks of giving her eternal beauty as codewords for killing her.This film does have other problems.  The print I saw looked like it had been through the washing machine I really don't see a big preservation movement for this one.  The acting is pretty wooden the terrible dubbing doesn't help either.  Sutherland who plays a soldier as well the hag plays the soldier role with all the seriousness he played the surgeon Hawkeye Pierce. There are a few redeeming moments though  when the henchman throws the midget minstrel off the top of the castle he lives but it's nice to believe that he won't and the great expression Lee has to hold at the end of the movie he sure is shaking a lot for a statue.  Other than that there no reason to recommend this movie.  Diehard Lee fans may not even enjoy it.".

As you will have figured out in the first 15 minutes the Count has more in store for the minstrels than they expected.This movie isn't so much about Lee's plans to turn everthing into a statue his creations aren't stuffed carcasses they're permanently frozen while living it's about the stupidity of the minstrels.  Look at these examples of how they completely miss the fact that they are in danger they don't suspect anything being invited to a remote castle for a private appearance for three gold pieces !! or when they're warned by an old hag Donald Sutherland for Christ's sake!! that they will die if they go to the castle when Lee tells the lead minstrel that he has started using humans but substitutes the word animal for human the minstrel doesn't catch on the strongmanfirebreather doesn't notice the evil henchman standing 10 feet away preparing to shoot him in the eye with a crossbow the female minstrel doesn't realize that a man she knew is dead even though he is completely immobile and attached to a stand nor does she catch on when the Count talks of giving her eternal beauty as codewords for killing her.This film does have other problems.  The print I saw looked like it had been through the washing machine I really don't see a big preservation movement for this one.  The acting is pretty wooden the terrible dubbing doesn't help either.  Sutherland who plays a soldier as well the hag plays the soldier role with all the seriousness he played the surgeon Hawkeye Pierce. There are a few redeeming moments though  when the henchman throws the midget minstrel off the top of the castle he lives but it's nice to believe that he won't and the great expression Lee has to hold at the end of the movie he sure is shaking a lot for a statue.  Other than that there no reason to recommend this movie.  Diehard Lee fans may not even enjoy it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Castle of the Living Dead sounds like quite a generic title that could be given to just about any movie but in this case it actually is relevant to the plot of the film. The plot is actually not bad and is something of a crossover between the mad scientist and Gothic horror genres as we follow the owner of an old castle as he lures people to him and proceeds to mummify them to 'preserve their beauty'. The plot actually isn't bad but unfortunately the execution is lacklustre in the extreme and what we end up with is a frankly boring horror film. Apparently it took three people to direct this film  I have no idea how  but interestingly one of the names on the directors list is Michael Reeves the unfortunate director behind the masterpiece 'Witchfinder General' in 1968. The film feels very cheap and the black and white cinematography only adds to that rather than adding atmosphere as is often the case with Gothic horror from this period. The most notable thing about this film is obviously the presence of the great Christopher Lee though in fitting with the rest of the movie he's not at his best and his performance feels rather flat. There's also a triple role for fellow legend Donald Sutherland. The movie drones on for about ninety minutes with barely a scare in sight and we finish on an unsurprising note. Overall this is not a good film and I don't recommend it.".

Learning that their troupe has been offered a stay at a local castle owned by recluse Count Drago Christopher Lee and against several objections take up the offer. Staying on they try to get the better of the situation and try to support their decision to stay. When they suddenly realize that their numbers are missing they learn that the Count has a dark passion for stuffing and embalming animals and people using the help of a special drug that he has discovered which preserves life in a deathlike state. Using this they try to flee the castle before it's too late.The Good News This one here wasn't that bad at times. The castle's interior here are what really makes this film worthwhile as it looks positively creepy. It's a regular Gothic masterpiece as the normal components that this one uses is right up with the greats of the genre. The general appearance of the rooms with ornate furniture decaying traps and a flow that allows for some of the feeling of isolation and dread that the best out there capture the best that the film provides. The many different sculptures on display are quite fun and make for an even creepier feeling from the location. From the different entries into the room all the way to the feeling that there's something that the outward appearance is hiding is brought the forefront. When the discovery of the taxidermy hobby is found there's some really freaky scenes that come out. The main embalming one is the greatest one and the few encounters outdoors are also worthy of praise. There's also the tour through the embalming room as the gigantic pieces of equipment used to perform the embalming and once the talk turns to the special drug it gets a little tense as the backstory given to it is a little unnerving and makes it feel really creepy. It's one of the best scenes in the film and gets a lot right from it. The film does have a rather nice amount of action in it. The big fight atop the castle is a brilliant one as well as the extended brawl occurring in the display room. There's also a pretty nice fistfight thrown in at the beginning to put some extra action parts into it and is enjoyable for the type and style done at the time. These here are what really keep the film going.The Bad News This one here has a few problems with it. One of the things that ruins this is that there's a large amount of scenes in here that don't have a whole lot of purpose. The fight in the bar at the beginning is one which isn't really necessary for it's plot and is essentially there only for the fact that it puts an action scene into the film. There's also the fact that the film literally stops to a halt when the troupe does their performance at the castle. It's a necessary scene but it's incredibly dull and manages to slow the film down to include a scene that is really painful to sit through and makes it a really terrible choice to keep it through the length it is and is a really big contributing factor. There's also the main factor in this one which is the fact that there's a large amount of time where absolutely nothing happens and manages to provoke a sense of boredom frequently and easily. There's a large section through the ending of the film where nothing but talking happens and the talking doesn't help the film. Most of it is about the disappearances and how they're going to get away rather than actually putting a plan into action to get away. It's a little infuriating to see them actually catch on and not do anything about it and yet because nothing is happening it's boring to sit through. These here comprise all of the film's shortcomings.The Final Verdict A really flawed Gothic entry this one manages to get a few really good points in with all the other problems.

This lot head off to the castle on the promise of a lot of cash despite the warning of an old witch Donald Sutherland! who speaks only in rhyme.The first strange occurrence happens shortly afterwards when Philipe finds what looks like a stuffed crow stuck to a tree branch. Puzzled he casts it aside and heads for the castle anyway all the time hitting on Laura while Bruno grunts about the money they'll all make. Of course Christopher Lee plays Count Drago who lives in the castle with his hulking man servant. Drago appears to be quite the rabid taxidermist as his castle is stuffed with all sorts of animals. You'd have to be some sort of actor in a cheap horror film to not guess where things are heading next...especially when Drago mentions that the new creature he's working with is 'the most dangerous of all'.Some people hate this film for some reason but I found the set up different from the usual gothic horror clichs. Apart from Donald Sutherland's performance as the witch and the bumbling soldier it's good that the main hero of the piece ends up being the dwarf rather than Philipe Leroy. I did have a good laugh at the dwarf dummy that is thrown off the side of the castle mind. The sight of Donald Sutherland as an old crone speaking in rhyme and making a dwarf touch hisher hump for luck is something to behold also.I think this is also the earliest film I know that uses the Gardens of Bomarzo aka The Sacred Grove or Park of the Monsters as a location. Created in the 16th Century this place is full of bizarre sculptures and buildings used by some fella to cope with the grief of his wife's passing. The Orcus is the most famous of the sculptures having been used in the film The Relic the naked Sherilyn Fenn film Phantoms and of course Luigi Cozzi's utterly demented and classic film The Adventures of Hercules which is one of the most entertaining films ever made.".

It's American release was botched and it ended up playing mostly drivein theaters and then fell into obscurity. The best quality print I have found has the ends cropped to make its aspect ratio 43. Lee is head and shoulders better than the rest of the cast. Donald Sutherland is also notable in multiple roles in this his first feature film appearance that was not a TV movie. The other actors are no better than adequate. The cinematography and score are both functional at best. In the last 40 minutes film stops and numbers are projected on screen for 1530 seconds a couple of times.If you are willing to overlook the films' faults score cinematography abrupt changes in tone and an ending that Reeves must have argued against there are some good scares in this one.It is worth sitting through if it ever comes your way.

Christopher Lee plays Count Drago who invites the small group to his castle where he tries to embalm them due to an insane idea that it will keep them from aging. Never mind the fact that in order to do this he has to kill them first. At any rate as I said before it wasn't his best performance by a long shot. But while Christopher Lee didn't necessarily achieve his usual standard it was still far better than the performance of Donald Sutherland who played both Sgt. Paul and the witch. Both of those efforts were ghastly in my opinion. That said about the only bright spot in this film was the presence of the beautiful Gaia Germani as Laura. But even so she wasn't able to lift this film up all by herself. All things considered then while it wasn't terribly bad I would only recommend it for diehard Christopher Lee fans or for those who enjoy horror films from this period. Otherwise it's probably best to look for something a bit more recent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Castle of the Living Dead The 1964  out of 4 A group of entertainers are invited by Count Drago Christopher Lee to perform at his castle but soon they start to fall dead. An old evil witch Donald Sutherland would have you believe that the castle has a certain evil inside. This Italian made horror film is also known as Castello dei morti vivi Il but under either title this film is a dud. As with many Italian horrors of this period you have the dark castle creepy locations and weird storyline but none of them come off very well here. The story moves at a snails pace which is another thing that haunts many of the horror films from this era. The music score was actually the best thing about the movie so listening to the soundtrack would be better than watching the film. Lee gives a decent performance but for the most part it seems like he's just cashing a paycheck. I did like the fact that they had him looking like Lugosi's character from White Zombie. Donald Sutherland steals the show as he plays three different characters including an old man and the old witch that the troop stumble across on their way to the castle. Sutherland is excellent as the old woman and you really have to look hard to notice that it's him.".

They will receive quite a nice wage for their performances as they attempt to supposedly entertain Drago a scientist who enjoys the art of embalming animals of all kinds as a way of capturing their eternal beauty. This unhealthy obsession yields a terrifying secret..Drago wishes to add the troupe to his collection! Drago has perfected a unique formula which after injection causes the victim to freeze instantaneously forever as they were without the threat of old age removing their beauty and form. Like mannequins Drago has a whole room enshrined with the bodies of victims he has froze! Will our troupe be able to escape? Drago has a sadistic henchmanmanservant SandroMirko Valentinhe uses to capture and kill victims. Donald Sutherland is a treat in dual roles..one as an idiotic officer who bumbles through a sure crime practically right in front of him..it's unclear just how many times Drago has duped himand a vengeful witch who seeks retribution towards Drago who once tried out his experiments on her. Gaia Germani portrays the lovely Laura who Drago obsesses over due to her beauty. Phillippe Leroy is Laura's loveinterest Eric a former soldier traveling the roads until he met the troupe as two of their group were into an altercation over wages from a street performance. Sutherland's witch forewarned the troupe against going to the castle but they do not heed her warnings. She informs the troupe's dwarf that he would remain unharmed thanks to an amulet she gives to him.Okay little lowbudget horror outing. To be honest I found it unspectacular with a pace that drags a bit..the film felt much longer than it actually was. But the castle setting is quite well utilized I thought the premise was ghoulish enough. Lee was alright but I thought Mirko as his cruel lieutenant stole this feature.".
