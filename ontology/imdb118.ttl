It also takes on voyeurism in a quite original way even questions photography and beauty...There is a perpetual and nameless menace surrounding the young girl we follow. She feels alone misunderstood. But she's got strength and will and talent...Her obsession with death will ultimately be an opportunity for her to face herself although she really seems to loose it as the story unfolds.I really find this movie appealing and quite outstanding and I want to recommend it... ...but there is that finale!!! I can't talk about the ending without destroying what is certainly an intended impression... but I feel this movie should warn audiences about its extreme violence.That said there are a lot of reasons to watch this if you have the opportunity.".

	schema:headline " Twisted cinema not a masterpiece but certainly not something you're likely forget";
	schema:reviewBody "As the previous reviews might suggest Abnormal Beauty 2004 is something of a difficult film to pin down both in terms of its abstract visual style and the actual presentation of the plot. In terms of appearance the film is a visual labyrinth of warped neon colours moody lighting and the occasional splash of cold stark monochrome all added to further reflect the inner world of the central character in this instance a young misfit photographer becoming obsessed with the notions of sex and death. Further complications are created by the interesting use of narrative with the film starting out as a kind of sinister art drama with a serious psychological subtext before eventually changing gears in the second half and becoming an altogether more unusual experience. In this respect I would draw a natural comparison to two very recent Japanese films Takashi Miike's Audition 1999 and Takashi Shimizu's Marebito 2004 two films that use the conventions and to some extent more recognisable iconography of the horror genre without ever really becoming horror films in the traditional sense. Also like those two particular examples Abnormal Beauty tends to surprise  and perhaps even infuriate?  its viewers with the bold switches in narrative texture and the occasional disregard of logic.The first half of the film is slow subdued beautifully shot with sporadic moments of surreal violence presented in a distant dreamlike manner that stresses the characters' disconnection from society. The scenes in which she sets up and photographs various monstrous decaying objects is masterful creating a warped sense of beauty that seems as far removed from the horror genre as you could possibly get. As the character continues to stockpile these images of death and decay  including that first fleeting moment wherein she snaps the aftermath of a car accident or a tense and thrilling scene in which she documents the suicide of a man from the top of a tall building one devastating frame at a time  we get hints of something else beginning to take shape that won't truly become apparent until right at the very end. Until then we must wonder where the film is going with the first half of the story seeming at times to be more like a biographical drama about a tortured artist losing their grip on reality and the world around them and as a result creating their own world in which murder and sex become dangerously intertwined and beauty can be found within the piles of decapitated chickens and the damp soaked carcass of a rotting dead bird.Describing in more detail the switch in tone and texture that occurs somewhere towards the end of the film might be considered too much of a spoiler especially given the ideas mood and atmosphere so skilfully established during these first forty minutes. That said I don't think the eventual unravelling of the narrative is quite as random as many of the other reviewers seem to suggest with a number of scenes particularly those between Jiney and her sortof boyfriend Anson foreshadowing many of the elements of power humiliation sex and violence that will reoccur during the eventual twist in the tale. It's fascinating stuff but again as with Audition and Marebito could prove to be somewhat disappointing to anyone expecting a conventional horror film with the lingering mood of ambient dread and voyeuristic terror conveyed in the more psychological first half recalling some of the more tense moments of Oxide Pang's earlier codirected hit The Eye 2002  and similar Asian horror films that arrived in the wake of Ju On The Grudge 2000 and Ringu 19998  being completely replaced with something much darker grittier physical and explicit tapping into the territory of Eli Roth perhaps although it's worth noting that this particular film was released a good year before Roth's near iconic Hostel 2005.Whether or not the ending really works is a question for the individual though I suppose it would be easy to view it as an extended fantasy sequence in keeping with the character's dark descent into the depths of her own tortured imagination. Regardless this for me is still a great film one that creates a mood and an atmosphere perfectly pitched between elements of fantasy and reality and riddled with images that are bold striking and completely unforgettable. It is the style of the film and the strange wavering atmosphere in which every character seems to be a potential victim or victor that really pulls us in enticing us with a story of fear regret terror and paranoia leading us down numerous narrative blind alleyways convincing us that all is well and that we've emerged from the psychological wilderness and then BAM!  they hit us with the hard stuff. Understandably it won't appeal to everyone it begins slowly and takes time to pick up the pace and never make a conscious effort to appease conventions of genre or narrative expectations. However anyone with a fondness for interesting challenging and edgy world cinema should enjoy the fantastic atmosphere and lingering traces of horror presented to us by this fine piece of work.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen  Richie American Beauty The Asian films are so different from American films. They put a different thought process behind it. They make you think about things while many American films are just sit in the theater for 2 hours watching nothing.The heart of this film is everything is beautiful. It can be a purple skyscraper. An overpass. Someone dead in the middle of the street from a car accident. This movie shows the beauty of the latter which is good until the character becomes obsessive about these pictures. Then it becomes a nice little thriller. Not jumpy but it is wince worthy.At times I almost felt bad for liking this movie so much but it is now one of my favorite.".

It's easy.But there are no words in the critical lexicon to convey the sheer utter awfulness of this film. It's laughable. It's terrible. It's incredible that it got made.Firstly you have the frankly quite masturbatory concept  clearly thoughtup by a creepily lascivious film producer  of having the film's two leads as hot teenage lesbians. Immature voyeuristic fantasy anyone? I'm guessing censorship issues denied Mr Producer the chance to get the sapphic activities of these two lovely ladies on film if you're watching this film to get your kicks you'll be disappointed.Hot lesbian 1 becomes obsessed with taking photos of dead animals. This plot strand takes up about an hour of the film before it sinks into a dull ripoff of 8mm Lost Highway and Ringu. Hot lesbian 2 has little to do except stand around looking hot and getting into sexy arguments. The shocks aren't shocking and the gore isn't gory. If you're scared watching this then you should steer well clear of Scooby Doo. Odd filters and silly jump editing do not a horror film make.The ending is ridiculous and you will certainly feel cheated if and when you suffer the misfortune of watching this film. I don't know what 'Oxide Pang' was thinking. Perhaps he was thinking 'i can't think of a proper ending... i'll just make it up as i go along'. Not that it matters much because it's so badly edited and lit you can hardly see what happens anyway.Englishspeaking viewers will be hampered by the ludicrously bad subtitles. At one point a character asking presumably'why the long face' has her words translated as 'why are you so lengthy of countenance?'. Some lines aren't translated at all.If this hyperactive underlit overwrought and incomprehensible film is the new face of bold Asian horror cinema then I'm Jackie Chan. You will regret watching this. It is almost an hour and half of your life that you could do far better things with. Visit your grandmother. Cook your wife a meal. Just don't for God's sake watch Abnormal Beauty.".

As her morbid fascination grows we find out her psychological profile i.e. why she is as screwed up as she is. The director sets up the stage for a female serialkiller.However there are almost two movies in this. The first half ends with her coming to terms with a traumatic episode from her childhood hence she leaves her perverse hobby behind her and all seems to end happily. Obviously noone would fall for that one 45 minutes being still left. Suddenly the movie's serialkiller makes an entrance. Is it the guy who's in love with her? Is it maybe even her? The chickenbutcher that was my guess? Her mother even? No. The killer is the guy who sold her the books on death in the store. Was this convincing? Not really but at least it was a surprise for whatever it's worth. The scene in which she faces her tormentor in the torture chamber isn't very credible either. On one hand the killer has shown to be very capable and sly and yet in the dungeon he behaves as if he were a Leatherfacelike retard straight out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Still in spite of its flaws the film isn't as superficial as many other horror films the first half being more in the psychological horror vein although the last third does fall into the mainstream sadisticsicko genre. It's never boring and the lead female is interesting  and beautiful. How is it JapaneseChinese films nearly always have a greatlooking woman in the lead while American films are perpetually stuck with ugliesmediocrities like Julia Roberts Julia Stiles Drew Barrymore La Lopez or Jennifer Aniston?".

	schema:reviewBody "It starts like a horror film. Photography student one day witnesses a death takes a picture of it and her morbid fascination is unleashed. She starts taking picture of dead things and being generally creepy. There is really nothing more to say as far as plot goes.To her credit it's not as if she was already a perfectly adjusted art student assuming there is such a thing. Apparently she was gang raped while she was about eight years old from her tenyearold cousin ! and his friends. No I'm not kidding. The film really shows a preteenie gang rape. But let's buy it for plot's sake.So now our morbid art student hates guys has hooked up with another sexually confused girlie like herself vows that she will never like guys and is generally angry and well disturbed.Enter Spineless Geek character. Some emasculated effeminate film student is there any other kind? nyuck nyuck is  against all rationality and reason  infatuated with her. Being that he never leaves her alone she eventually finds herself forced to battle her attraction toward him.And that's really the film. No horror here. Just an overly stylized chicmusicladen film about a psychologically disturbed and sexually aberrated girl trying to figure it all out. And that's the true meaning of the abnormal in the title.Stay away from this movie unless you want to witness plenty of drawn out scenes of our protagonist doing weird things like dangling off a balcony or drenching herself in red paint  oh and screaming into nothingness while she's at it. You know... screaming as in woah this scene is emotionally deep and stuff. All because mum did not believe her when she said her cousin gangbanged her. Enter even more disgustingly schmaltzy piano music here. POTENTIAL SPOILERS BEGIN Alright now. To be fair. After a torturous hour of nothingness the protagonist spills the beans to mum and all turns bright and cheery again  until the very next scene. She receives a videotape showing the torture and murder of an unidentified girl. Confused Duo now turns to Detective Duo and the protagonist and her girlfriend go confront Spineless Geek for having made it. Of course he knows nothing of it. Soon a second tape arrives  uhoh. It's the main squeeze. Not a big loss really. She was a manhater and not particularly attractive to begin with. Amusingly enough while the girlfirend is being beat to death her only concern is Don't hurt Jin! Ridiculous. It's very hard to watch though. Unless you enjoy seeing violence against mentally ill women who need psychological help and certainly not murder! But anyway. Who is doing all this? POTENTIAL SPOILERS END The film actually does turn to a bona fide horror film but only after having us wait an entire hour! Even then... the final scene  the last 20 minutes which are supposedly the nerveracking part according to some reviewers  is nothing more than another ridiculously drawn out pseudoemotional part that attempts to make you care. The killer's identity is eventually revealed and um oooh surprise. Whatever. By the way one of the funniest parts of the film is where the protagonist is taking pictures of a guy killing chickens and the guy exclaims referring to the chicken What a beautiful cock! This is incidentally precisely what the protagonist needs. Then this entire miserable film would have never been made.I suggest you watch the first twenty minutes then skip to the last twenty. However if you don't have the patience for it you're not missing much. There are plenty of films that have done this better.The lesson of the day is kiddies Hong Kong cannot make horror. Even the infamous Ebola Syndrome fell prey in large part to the typical Hong Kong horror film weakness of being more wishywashy pseudoemotional social commentary than true horror film though it is admittedly in a class of its own. And this is what this film is as well. Nothing more than a schmaltzy wannabe heartstring tugger disguised as horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a big fan of the Pang Brothers I was really looking forward to this solo offering from one of the brothers Oxide Pang. I can't lie. I loved this film. It rocks. That's it. This film's got style it's got flair it's got talent solid actingterror and best of all a great script. Man just when you think where this film is going then BAM! The film totally switches on you. This film has balls it holds no bars and is a beauty work of art. This film deals with the disturbing the taboo and the twisted. But not only that but it deals with in a whole different way then what's ever been seen on film.This film gives you two different types of stories all in one film.But the thing about the two stories is that they both work perfectly with each other. This film rocks.Script wise it's perfect. It has a solid fist hour about character obsessionpain and guilt. But stronger then that it's about 2 girls.One who just is helpless as her friend and lover is torn apart by her own insides.The set up is perfect... you know the characters and even get insides their heads. You watch everything fall apart and you watch it unfold. But nothing feels forced everything follows naturally. As certain horrific event start happening they never feel like they came out of nowhere or that they're just there to shock.Those scenes are there to get us to feel and see how the character is working internally. But man this film works perfectly in it's first hour. It feels full and feels like a drama but that's okay. I liked it. I liked this story of two people are are in love who are just helping each other through. I never felt bored or anything. I loved it. I love story in my horror and this film delivers. But then there's the last act. Wow. It's stunning and comes out of nowhere but yet it makes sense.Perfect sense. God this film amps up from zero to 60 in no time. God that last act is just unnerving and shocking. GodI couldn't believe it. Tal about freaking balls.Wow... then there's the last scene. Shocking. Wow.Acting. Here two pop stars from Hong Kong Race and Roseanne Wong in their first serious roles. Now talk about great acting. Man Race who plays our heroine is amazing. Man she looked like she's falling apart for real on screen. There was never any sense of oh she's acting Nope. I believed her. Roseanne Wong Race's real life sister also played our heroine's lover. Wow. Balls I tells ya. Balls. But the best thing about that wasn't the fact that we had 2 hot lesbians but the best thing is that it feels real and natural. There's no kissing or anything but we don't need it. Their performances are enough to show us that both their characters really care about each other and love each other. I really bought them as real people and as a love story.Directing... I love the Pang brothers. But here Oxide shows the even together or split up... they rock as directors. These guys are true masters of storytelling. But best of all... they have they're own style and flair but they never let that get in the way of telling the story. Here Oxide knows how to keep the film looking like a Pang Brothers film but at the same time it isn't one if you know what I mean.I could see their stamp on the film but it felt all Oxide baby. Hell yeah. I love everything about the directing of this film. I love his shots and love his style. I'm not kidding... he has style all of his own and isn't one of these directors that just rips off style from other films. Nope here Oxide uses so many cool shots that I was in awe. But best of all they were all original. Man I loved his camera movements... I loved how it just screamed A Pang brothers film Bravo. I love these guys and they are my heroes. I want to develop my own style just like them. Not only that but they can also freaking write great stuff. Bravo.In the first hour of this film is mostly character development but Oxide never bored me. He kept me interested and with his slick but driven directing I never felt like I was watching a drama. I was watching a story unfold. But what really makes me respect Oxide more is the last act of the film. He takes something that could have been just a rip off of another popular horror movie and did it all his own baby. It never feels like I'm watching something I've seen before. Sure it's the same situation but you've never seen Oxide do it. Man he shoots it in an original and shocking way. Man it never let up. I was in shock about what I was watching. But best of all it all felt like I was still watching the same movie. It made perfect sense if you were watching the film then you know it makes perfect sense. It's everything the movie is about... and what could have happened if it wasn't for the love that our two main girls had for each other had. This film rocks.But I shown quickly that I was getting a great and original film. The best thing about the film is that I never saw the last act coming even from the trailerwhich always almost gives away the entire movie I had no freaking clue. Thank you Oxide.".

Abnormal Beauty is then a film of interest to me and though it has little new or especially intelligent to say it speaks with elegance and it speaks from the heart. Its central artist is the troubled Jin Race Wong who comes across a car crash and feels compelled to photograph it in doing so reopening cracks of childhood trauma widening them to deathly obsession morbid sensuality and danger. Much of the film is dark psychological drama rather than horror the whole visual scheme mirroring Jin's descent. Shots are still sparsely composed and sometimes richly tinted an imagery of bleak yearning of the cameras power to make beauty from from death to bring something from nothing and yet in the freezing of image eternally condemn forever sequester from reality. All this perhaps the highlight of the film its thoughts internalised speaking with so much more eloquence than the occasional fragments of exposition. Its powerfully acted stuff too Race Wong subtly moving quietly pained she does well in suggesting character shadows. Her real life sister Rosanne plays in a slightly perverse bit of casting her girlfriend Jas though the lesbian currents are pretty restrained. Another fine turn possessive and emotionally fraught the extrovert half of the two. Anson Leung is good too as a classmate of Jin innocently drawn to her. All cylinders fire pretty well it must be said things reaching an emotional climax around two thirds of the way through as Jin heads towards her precipice. Then the film switches gears to head for real horror in its climax a move that works thematically but not so much dramatically. Quite simply it's a lop sided film what should be a thought out second half becomes a climax instead and ends up feeling more of an undernourished epilogue than the savage gut punch it aims for. In more general terms the film suffers from being somewhat restrained as well some will no doubt praise its subtlety but the story is a bit too lurid for restraint to really work. There's too little actual threat the menace being predictably largely of the mind and too little pointed exploration for a film too restrained to go mad it doesn't help itself by being intellectually undercooked. In a film so concerned with dark aesthetics and the break from normality there's comically little treatment of the related moral issues and the general psychological fall out follows standard plotting lines rather than great insight. Still this is a pretty fine film despite its ills. Its a film to submit to and swim around in to abandon oneself to the leads and drink in their sights sorrow to their sorrows. Truth be told it was only after viewing that the films flaws started to fall into place its such a well oiled beast and more to the point looks so goddarned pretty that I was almost captivated for most of the run time. As such I recommend it if you like your Asian horror slow and artful some I'm sure may like it more than me. But it certainly isn't the latter day underrated classic some have hailed it as. 710".

	schema:headline " The Most Underrated Underappreciated East Asian Horror Film of the Last Decade";
	schema:reviewBody "Fantastic Cinematography  Great Psychological Concepts  An Unnerving Finale  A Great Film Unfortunately Abnormal Beauty is one of those films that will annoy a lot of people because it does not have enough explicit violence to please the gorehounds yet contains enough to anger everyone else. It seems that almost all of the negative reviews I've seen are either the gorehounds complaining about the first boring hour or the fans of psychological horror complaining about the gratuitousness of the last half hour. I think they both miss the point. Just like the critics of Audition.The violence is not gratuitous here. There is a heaping amount of character development in this film that sets up the finale. This is not empty sensationalistic tripe that Hollywood loves to release e.g. Hostel The Hills Have Eyes etc.. If someone insists that Abnormal Beauty is gratuitous then they are effectively saying that explicit violence cannot be used in a film without being so. This is a closedminded SelfFulfilling Prophecy of the most blatant type.The second most complained about feature of this film following complaints regarding the violence was the introduction of the killer. Critics claim that he is a Deus ex Machina. The critics are wrong. Abnormal Beauty is not a murder mystery. It's a psychological horror film. The filmmakers are not obligated to present a trail of clues for the viewer to make a probable educated guess at the identity of the killer. The purpose of presenting the killer is to introduce the perfected state of Jiney's undeveloped psychological affliction in an attempt to cure her of that affliction.Jiney spends most of the time BEHIND the camera initiating her mental and sexual fulfillment by viewing the death of living things. At the same time however she's becoming more and more detached from reality. This is also manifested by the other subplots which include her tormenting past and her dysfunctional relationship with her mother  events which she is unable to come to terms with.Even after her semirevelation she is still deeply affected by the pictures that she finds in her locker. She's not fully cured of her affliction yet. Remember the camera is an important symbolanalogy in this film. Jiney is so helplessly reliant on detachment that she desperately needs the camera to be turned against her. Enter the killer who places Jiney IN FRONT of the camera thus forcing her to face reality. This is essential for the filmmakers to culminate the underlying psychological concepts of Abnormal Beauty.In addition if I were a sadistic freak working in a library and saw a hot young girl check out a dozen works of literature featuring sadistic pictures how the hell could I not take notice? Another complaint of critics is the final scene which reveals that the lead character killed her cousin. Critics claim that this is an ad hoc afterthefact invocation to cheaply explain the movie. The critics are wrong. The traumatic childhood event at the very end of the film was not the origin of Jiney's psychological condition. That event was already introduced near the beginning of the film Jiney was sexually abused by her cousin and her mother didn't believe her. The fact that she pushed her cousin down the stairs is merely a reflection of the negative effects that that initial event had on her. Did you see her face while she was standing at the top of the stairs? It was blank and emotionless  completely detached. The final scene adds emphasis to her psychological breakthrough and reminds us of what she overcame  she is now living again.And yes this is much more demanding of the viewer's intelligence than all the carboncopy garbage coming out of Hollywood nowadays. So this film may not be for the lazy. If you can appreciate smart psychological horror coupled with effective explicit violence then you can't go wrong here. Unfortunately there are a lot of people who can't appreciate one or the other which explains the negative reaction to this film.It's really too bad that Dario Argento seems to be the only director who gets a free pass on style over substance because Oxide Pang is undoubtedly one of the most stylish filmmakers alive today. The suicide jump in Abnormal Beauty was just as brilliant as the outdoor crane shot in Tenebre which was awesome in its own right. Pang showed almost no violence in that sequence yet the way the scene was put together was no less than total genius because it was composed almost entirely of spectator reactions supplemented with a sweet soundtrack. I could literally watch that scene along with a handful of others a hundred times in a row. It represents everything that moviemaking should be.After reading online reviews and discussing this film with others I am convinced that this is the most underrated underappreciated East Asian horror film of the last decade. I've seen 200 East Asian horror films. Abnormal Beauty is in my Top 5.".

	onyx:emotionText "Fantastic Cinematography  Great Psychological Concepts  An Unnerving Finale  A Great Film Unfortunately Abnormal Beauty is one of those films that will annoy a lot of people because it does not have enough explicit violence to please the gorehounds yet contains enough to anger everyone else. It seems that almost all of the negative reviews I've seen are either the gorehounds complaining about the first boring hour or the fans of psychological horror complaining about the gratuitousness of the last half hour. I think they both miss the point. Just like the critics of Audition.The violence is not gratuitous here. There is a heaping amount of character development in this film that sets up the finale. This is not empty sensationalistic tripe that Hollywood loves to release e.g. Hostel The Hills Have Eyes etc.. If someone insists that Abnormal Beauty is gratuitous then they are effectively saying that explicit violence cannot be used in a film without being so. This is a closedminded SelfFulfilling Prophecy of the most blatant type.The second most complained about feature of this film following complaints regarding the violence was the introduction of the killer. Critics claim that he is a Deus ex Machina. The critics are wrong. Abnormal Beauty is not a murder mystery. It's a psychological horror film. The filmmakers are not obligated to present a trail of clues for the viewer to make a probable educated guess at the identity of the killer. The purpose of presenting the killer is to introduce the perfected state of Jiney's undeveloped psychological affliction in an attempt to cure her of that affliction.Jiney spends most of the time BEHIND the camera initiating her mental and sexual fulfillment by viewing the death of living things. At the same time however she's becoming more and more detached from reality. This is also manifested by the other subplots which include her tormenting past and her dysfunctional relationship with her mother  events which she is unable to come to terms with.Even after her semirevelation she is still deeply affected by the pictures that she finds in her locker. She's not fully cured of her affliction yet. Remember the camera is an important symbolanalogy in this film. Jiney is so helplessly reliant on detachment that she desperately needs the camera to be turned against her. Enter the killer who places Jiney IN FRONT of the camera thus forcing her to face reality. This is essential for the filmmakers to culminate the underlying psychological concepts of Abnormal Beauty.In addition if I were a sadistic freak working in a library and saw a hot young girl check out a dozen works of literature featuring sadistic pictures how the hell could I not take notice? Another complaint of critics is the final scene which reveals that the lead character killed her cousin. Critics claim that this is an ad hoc afterthefact invocation to cheaply explain the movie. The critics are wrong. The traumatic childhood event at the very end of the film was not the origin of Jiney's psychological condition. That event was already introduced near the beginning of the film Jiney was sexually abused by her cousin and her mother didn't believe her. The fact that she pushed her cousin down the stairs is merely a reflection of the negative effects that that initial event had on her. Did you see her face while she was standing at the top of the stairs? It was blank and emotionless  completely detached. The final scene adds emphasis to her psychological breakthrough and reminds us of what she overcame  she is now living again.And yes this is much more demanding of the viewer's intelligence than all the carboncopy garbage coming out of Hollywood nowadays.

Although some people may feel that way even after seeing it I was pleasantly surprised. From the introduction of 'the game' near the beginning of the movie I knew this was going to be more interesting and even more disturbing than the previews.Despite what appears to be rather thin characterization 'Waiting' succeeds at being a good characterdriven movie. I am not sure why this is. Perhaps what seem to be just childish antics add depth to the characters without us realizing it. Some people complain that 'the game' is a 10 second gag stretched out for the entire film and on the surface this is true. However the game is really more of a mechanism for developing characters than anything on its own. The result is a set of very flawed but surprisingly likable characters. Also the ending though a little abrupt is entertaining largely because the movie does a good job of setting up the characters and situation.This movie is not for everyone. If you do not like 'stupid' humor then you will probably not be able to overlook that to enjoy the more subtle aspects. However once you get past that this movie is more than the sum of its parts.".

Also the ending though a little abrupt is entertaining largely because the movie does a good job of setting up the characters and situation.This movie is not for everyone. If you do not like 'stupid' humor then you will probably not be able to overlook that to enjoy the more subtle aspects. However once you get past that this movie is more than the sum of its parts.";

	schema:reviewBody "I hated HATED! being a waitress but this movie is so hilarious and so ballsy that it almost makes me want to go back to the summer of 1999 to work one more shift at TGI Fridays. Waiting is the best most accurate most honest and most riotously funny movie ever made about the service industry. Here's how I see it  the world is divided into two groups of people those who have waited tables and those who haven't. Those who have never worked a day of their lives in a restaurant may find this movie amusing but they'll think it's too absurd to be real and they'll probably never give a second thought to this movie ever again.But those of you who have felt the pain degradation and humiliation of waiting tables will ps your pants laughing at how PERFECT this movie is. Firsttime writerdirector Rob McKittrick has created a deadon depiction of 24 hours in the restaurant biz. The movie opens at a latenight party with lots of underage drinking smoking and sex. Then we see the wait staff hungover at work the next day. The restaurant they all work at is called Shenanigans but it looks an awful lot like the TGI Fridays I worked at.All the characters in Waiting are based on the real people who work in every restaurant. There's the hotsluttyunderage hostess the fat and ugly cook who somehow dates a really hot waitress the stonerpunk bust boy and the manager with the chip on his shoulder. All the customers in this film the cheap red necks who don't know how to tip the by women the drunk and horny men are all customers I've waited on. And no filmmaker has ever so accurately portrayed the complex and irreconcilable tension between the wait staff and kitchen staff.But at the end of the night no matter what drama unfolds no matter what dishes brake and no matter how much money you make in tips or don't make everyone gets wasted and parties together and you all know you're in it together. Waiting simply tells a story about a profession that most people never give a second thought to. But it tells that story flawlessly. Can't wait for the DVD.".

Ryan Reynolds is hysterical in this movie as is Dane Cook and Luis Guzman. There are so many oneliners that you'll hear for a long time especially in the kitchen of any restaurant.

In point of fact it is hilarious. I loved this film but I cannot recommend it to everyone. It is full of very crude humor just the kind I like. If you combined 'Clerks' with 'Van Wilder' you would have 'Waiting'. Ryan Reynolds plays a very similar character to 'Van Wilder' only much more vulgar. Both Luis Guzmn Raddimus and Chi McBride Bishop are terrific in their respected roles.I did notice that the cinematography in this seemed poor making it look like a cheap film. But who cares?

The development of the characters aren't fully developed but you can still understand and sympathies to their problems. The characters are clichd you have seen a lot of them before but they are so well placed and interact perfectly there is a realism to them.The major point of Waiting is the black humor that runs through it. It doesn't work off big set pieces and outlandish situations to make you laugh the humor organically comes out of the characters from their dialog. A lot of the dialog is perverse but it never seems out of place. Waiting does perfectly reflect the relationship between customer and waiter well i did. Rob McKittrick unashamedly shows this interaction the smartass customer who always complains the regulars and what could go behind the walls when the customers push to hard.Ryan Reynolds brings another eccentric performance forward. He had been stuck with that eccentric ego in a lot of movies but he does it perfectly and does another great job again. Anna Faris had finally lost that ditsy persona and shows a broader range of acting bringing a great performance. Justin Long does have a puppy dog face a lot of the time but really comes forward in the more serious moments. All the other actors as the employees all do wonderful performances making the background character more interesting.Waiting is a great black comedy on hospitality that is so painfully funny.".

Pleeeeeaaasseeeee!!!!! How do these scripts get through to be major films?

	schema:headline " I'am still Waiting to laugh";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first read about Waiting a few months ago I kind of wanted to see the film because it sounded pretty interesting plus it starred Justin Long who usually is very good and Anna Faris who although always plays the same character in every movie is still pretty likable. Anyway about a month or so ago I saw the trailer for the film and it completely turned me off. I went on my usual movie site IMDb.com and stated that the trailer looked like crap. This is when the director Rob McKittrick told me to watch the film before I commented on it so I wrote the director back telling him that I promised not to say anything else about the film until I saw it. So today Tuesday October 11 2005 I went to my local multiplex and watched Waiting Waiting is about the workers at a restaurant called Shenanigan's. The film shows life in a restaurant along with the friendships made and the pranks that go on behind the scenes. The restaurants ringleader is Monty Ryan Reynolds who is a cocky sarcastic ahole who is assigned the duty of training the newbie Mitch John Francis Daley. As Mitch's training goes on he learns all the pranks that go on at Shenanigan's including the rules to the notorious game which is played at this restaurant. Laughs are suppose to ensue Walking into the theater earlier today I felt hopeful that the movie will at least make me laugh. About 30 minutes into the movie I didn't laugh once and just started looking around the empty theater. As the movie continued on for its 93 minutes running time I still didn't laugh not even once. I understand comedy is subjective and I totally understand that but even in comedies I don't normally enjoy I still get a chuckle or two out of the film. This movie did not make me laugh or chuckle once I just sat there as the title suggests waiting to laugh. This film's jokes are all done before and are for immature people to laugh at. I mean for anyone who is actually mature will not like the jokes in the film. Even the whole putting things in your food joke was used before in films like Road Trip. The so called jokes in this film are not funny and there isn't a fresh joke in the sight during the entire films running time.I really don't understand how Ryan Reynolds still gets work. I mean I know it has to be because of his looks because he tends to play the same character over and over again in every movie you know the cocky sarcastic womanizing goofball. And every time I see Mr. Reynolds on screen I feel bad for not liking him but honestly he's not the least bit amusing to me. I have never seen such an actor play a onedimensional character all the time. His character in this film is not likable it's just overly cocky and annoying. Justin Long really disappoints me in this film and he is extremely wasted as a character that is confused about what he is going to do with his life. Dane Cook who I heard is suppose to be one funny guy is underused and pretty much wasted as well in this film. Anna Faris plays her normal Anna Faris role but actually seems to have a little more intelligence here. Luis Guzman is also a real waste as the main cook who seems to have obsessions with both showing his penis and getting sex from his girlfriend. His character gets very annoying very quickly.This movie runs on two gags the so called game that the male workers play and the whole lets drop people's food on the floor or do disgusting things to there food gag and honestly neither work. You feel as though the script is very poorly written and almost wonder how the hell someone read this thing and approved it for a feature film. The script contained enough fbombs to compete with the film Scarface and the movie loved to use the word cock and penis like the movie was intended for a bunch of 1013 year olds who giggle whenever someone says one of those words. The movie is rather pointless with no real plot and is extremely poorly written with onedimensional characters.Bottom line this is without a doubt the worst film of the year. I didn't laugh once in this film I didn't like any of the characters there was no point and lastly there were no redeeming qualities at all. This movie was made for immature people who think that fart jokes and crude sex gags are still funny. The movie contains recycled jokes and onedimensional characters. And while the director Rob McKittrick seems like a pretty down to earth guy I really don't understand how he got this film made. And his biggest gag of all though is that he actually tricked me into seeing this flick and giving him my 6.00 and an hour and a half of my time. But in the end the negative reviews for this film are not a lie and the film deserves every one of them. I totally agree with the Variety reviewer Dennis Harvey who states in his review The wait for laughs lasts the entire length of Waiting because this truly is a very unfunny and unoriginal film.MovieManMenzel's final rating for this sad excuse of a movie is a 110. Check to see what other movies are playing and if nothing else is playing well go home and stare at the wall it's just as amusing.".

To my surprise and utter delight Reynolds was actually cast in the role. Perfect.I'm looking forward to this film.

	schema:headline " Spy Games In Rio!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Kiss The Girls  Make Them Die'  to give it its American title  was one of a number of films in the '60's designed to cash in on the success of James Bond. It was made by Dino De Laurentiis a man who like Irwin Allen has attracted more than his fair share of derision over the years despite having produced some pretty entertaining pictures of which this is one.It begins with a curious scene in the Brazilian jungles as eccentric English explorer Lord Aldric  TerryThomas  comes across a village where no children have been born in years and despite the best efforts of the women the men appear completely disinterested in sex  sounds like my home town! . Aldric makes notes in his diary only to be shot. The diary then goes missing  having been taken by one of the bearers  and a gang of villains headed by wealthy industrialist David Ardonian  Raf Vallone  set out to recover it.We then move to Rio De Janeiro. An American is watching a pretty girl and a young man through binoculars. Various thugs close in on him. Taking refuge in a giant statue of Jesus he is stalked by a sinister bald heavy  Oliver McGreevy  who also appeared in 'Modesty Blaise' and the first episode of 'The Prisoner' T.V. series  with a gun. The American whom we will later learn is called Kelly is an agent of the C.I.A. and escapes from the killer with the aid of a helicopter.Kelly is in Rio to investigate the activities of the mysterious Mr.Ardonian believed to be responsible for the disappearances of beautiful girls. Each has lavish gifts bestowed on them on the promise that they will remain faithful to him. If any break this vow  and one or two do  then he has them killed. His top henchman is Omar  Sandro Dori  a babyfaced blond psychopath whose favourite murder methods involve scorpions and boa constrictors.To cut the story short Ardonian plans on cryogenically freezing his girls and thawing them out for breeding purposes when the world's population has died out due to mass sterility  which he intends causing with the aid of a satellite that will blanket the world with radiation. The Chinese have provided him with a rocket believing he will only sterilise the West. Of course he does not intend honouring this promise.Joining forces with glamorous British agent Susan Fleming  Dorothy Provine  and her everso English chauffeur James  TerryThomas again  Kelly sets out to stop the madman.The first thing to be said for the movie is that it looks more expensive than your average '60's spy caper. Most of the 007 wannabees lacked the kind of extravagance the Bonds had in abundance but 'Kiss' was an exception. It boasts fabulous location filming in Rio impressive sets  Ardonian's underground lair is cool  the gadgets are fun the girls hot and the hero stylishly played by future 'Mannix' star Mike Connors. Little is known about his character we do not find out if 'Kelly' is his first name or last all we really know is that he loves bananas. Unusually he does not get to sleep around though he proposes marriage to Susan at the end. Dorothy Provine is very funny even if her English accent is none too convincing but in a movie like this reality is unimportant. As 'Ardonian' Raf Vallone is as menacing as he was in 'The Italian Job' when he played the head of the Mafia. TerryThomas is a hoot as the karate chopping 'James'. As Chinese spy 'Wilma Soong' Seyna Seyn is devastatingly sexy though underused.It is said that the 1979 Bond movie 'Moonraker' is a virtual remake of this picture. I am sure Christopher Wood and Lewis Gilbert would vehemently deny it but even so the resemblance is uncanny.One of the film's writers Jack Pulman went on to pen the classic B.B.C. series 'I Claudius'. He probably only took this job for the money but his script is a lot better than many others of the genre being consistently amusing and inventive. Being English he may have seen an episode of the 'Thunderbirds' T.V. series explaining how 'Susan' and 'James' so closely resemble 'Lady Penelope' and 'Parker'.Henry Levin the director keeps the action moving nicely and it is hard to believe the same man directed two of Dean Martin's 'Matt Helm' pictures  'Murderers' Row' and 'The Ambushers'.The only fault I could find was the music particularly the harmonica solos used during the action which seem to have drifted in from a Western. If ever a film cried out for Jerry Goldsmith it was this one.'Kiss' never got a sequel. Bearing in mind how quickly the Flint and Matt Helm series deteriorated it is probably just as well. It is tremendous entertainment a must for genre fans and deserves a D.V.D. release. Perhaps now that Quentin Tarantino has officially endorsed it it may get one. Not before time either.".

The American whom we will later learn is called Kelly is an agent of the C.I.A. and escapes from the killer with the aid of a helicopter.Kelly is in Rio to investigate the activities of the mysterious Mr.Ardonian believed to be responsible for the disappearances of beautiful girls. Each has lavish gifts bestowed on them on the promise that they will remain faithful to him. If any break this vow  and one or two do  then he has them killed. His top henchman is Omar  Sandro Dori  a babyfaced blond psychopath whose favourite murder methods involve scorpions and boa constrictors.To cut the story short Ardonian plans on cryogenically freezing his girls and thawing them out for breeding purposes when the world's population has died out due to mass sterility  which he intends causing with the aid of a satellite that will blanket the world with radiation. The Chinese have provided him with a rocket believing he will only sterilise the West. Of course he does not intend honouring this promise.Joining forces with glamorous British agent Susan Fleming  Dorothy Provine  and her everso English chauffeur James  TerryThomas again  Kelly sets out to stop the madman.The first thing to be said for the movie is that it looks more expensive than your average '60's spy caper. Most of the 007 wannabees lacked the kind of extravagance the Bonds had in abundance but 'Kiss' was an exception. It boasts fabulous location filming in Rio impressive sets  Ardonian's underground lair is cool  the gadgets are fun the girls hot and the hero stylishly played by future 'Mannix' star Mike Connors. Little is known about his character we do not find out if 'Kelly' is his first name or last all we really know is that he loves bananas. Unusually he does not get to sleep around though he proposes marriage to Susan at the end. Dorothy Provine is very funny even if her English accent is none too convincing but in a movie like this reality is unimportant. As 'Ardonian' Raf Vallone is as menacing as he was in 'The Italian Job' when he played the head of the Mafia. TerryThomas is a hoot as the karate chopping 'James'. As Chinese spy 'Wilma Soong' Seyna Seyn is devastatingly sexy though underused.It is said that the 1979 Bond movie 'Moonraker' is a virtual remake of this picture. I am sure Christopher Wood and Lewis Gilbert would vehemently deny it but even so the resemblance is uncanny.One of the film's writers Jack Pulman went on to pen the classic B.B.C. series 'I Claudius'. He probably only took this job for the money but his script is a lot better than many others of the genre being consistently amusing and inventive. Being English he may have seen an episode of the 'Thunderbirds' T.V. series explaining how 'Susan' and 'James' so closely resemble 'Lady Penelope' and 'Parker'.Henry Levin the director keeps the action moving nicely and it is hard to believe the same man directed two of Dean Martin's 'Matt Helm' pictures  'Murderers' Row' and 'The Ambushers'.The only fault I could find was the music particularly the harmonica solos used during the action which seem to have drifted in from a Western. If ever a film cried out for Jerry Goldsmith it was this one.'Kiss' never got a sequel. Bearing in mind how quickly the Flint and Matt Helm series deteriorated it is probably just as well. It is tremendous entertainment a must for genre fans and deserves a D.V.D. release. Perhaps now that Quentin Tarantino has officially endorsed it it may get one. Not before time either.";

There is one stunt in particular involving a helicopter and a wellknown Brazilian statue that had me on the edge of my seat.This movie is both funny and tense. It's never boring and every scene has something good in it. Mike Connors is great in the lead role and he's backed up by some outstanding performances by Susan Fleming and Raf Vallone. However I particularly enjoyed TerryThomas' pitchperfect performance in the role of an unassuming chauffeur with a few tricks up his sleeve.I saw this film at a revival house in Los Angeles many decades after its release. I was initially intrigued because of the awesomely hilarious title and the strange but funny trailer I'd seen played the previous week at the same theater. Everyone in the theater laughed and had a good time but after it was over I overheard some of the other people in the theater say that it was so bad it was good. I didn't get that feeling. I just felt like it was good. I haven't been able to find it on home video and I get the feeling that it never received a wide home video release if any but if you get a chance to watch it I highly recommend it.".

Mike Connors is recognizable and active but his lines aren't the best. It's not edgy or intense enough to shadow James Bond and not camp enough to be Matt Helm. It's quite a blah in between. ANother problem is there are a LOT ofstylistic and plot 'borrowings' from the specific Bond movie You Only Live Twice and this undermines it being a parody. Then there are moments when the film inexplicably fails to capitalize on both small and big moments and just kind of lets them drift away which is frustrating because at other times you're marvelling at the frame and sets.Most of the female actresses are forgettable particularly the one who develops into the lead. The arch villain is threatening but also not maximized and his henchman is particularly uninteresting and unconvincing as a bad guy. THe film switches up between serious and campy and it's just not written clever enough to pull it off.That said the movie is visually gorgeous with shots of a Rio De Janiero in the late 1960s with one fantastic interior after another a mix of Brazilian culture with midcentury modern. You want to see a Rolls Royce driving a jungle road? You'll see it here. It's too bad the leads weren't more engaging or given more character in the script to work with.".

He devises a method of revenge upon this judge whereupon his release from prison he frames the judge's son on a crime which sends the judge's son to prison. The habitual criminal then commits a crime to be his cell mate and there the fun begins.This is obviously a darkhumored comedy and it had me laughing more than I had anticipated. It was given only a 5 star by IMDb users so I did not expect much but it was quite good. I am surprised it did not get that much notoriety in the theaters. In fact I never heard of this film at all. It's amazing that crappy comedy movies like Wild Hogs and I Think I Love My Wife get all the attention while really funny movie like this get passed by. But what can you do since there really is no star power in this movie. You will recognize actors and actresses since many of them have appeared in many films as supporting characters. It's just that they don't have the name recognition.The only weakness I found in this movies was the crime by with which the judge's son was framed. The writers should have thought of a more plausible reason for his incarceration. However after some thought I figure this is comedy and the whole movie is a stretch of the imagination so I am overlooking this weakness.I am not saying however that this is a great comedy but it was good and it had me laughing pretty much throughout the movie and in my opinion that warrants a 7. If you like Van Wilder Sorority Boys and Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle type of movies then you will like this as well.".

However after some thought I figure this is comedy and the whole movie is a stretch of the imagination so I am overlooking this weakness.I am not saying however that this is a great comedy but it was good and it had me laughing pretty much throughout the movie and in my opinion that warrants a 7. If you like Van Wilder Sorority Boys and Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle type of movies then you will like this as well.";

Basically this film takes every men's prison clich and pushes it ten times further.

Put out during the competitive Thanksgiving season in just over 1000 theaters with virtually no advertising there was no chance of the film surviving longer than two weeks in theaters. Not that's it's the most marketable picture. It's not light enough to be a straight forward comedy though it's not that dark. Darker than most comedies but compared to Very Bad Things it's nothing. Although the tone is never quite perfect the film is nonetheless hilarious throughout most of its insanely brief running time. Dax Shepard Will Arnett Chi McBride Bob Odenkirk and David Koechner are all very funny in their roles and appear to be having a good time with their parts. Odenkirk obviously working with a lowbudget and limited resources directs admirably even when it is obvious even wasn't given complete creative freedom. The ending definitely seems like something that was changed. It seemed much of the movie was changed probably due to studio tampering so it's not nearly as good as it could have been but it's still worth renting on video.

I am extremely picky about films especially comedies but I sincerely loved this. still do and show it to othersI went in with absolutely no expectations of it. My friend owned a video rental place and we grabbed it off the shelf randomly to watch. I had never heard of it nor did I know a thing about it. I was thoroughly surprised at how witty unique humorous and silly it was. The actors are not all that famous at least weren't at the time and I had never seen the star before. Will Arnett was a great addition as well.Everyone in the movie was great. I thought it was a pretty new story and it didn't recycle a bunch of old jokes I'd seenheard a million times. It surprised me quite a bit and it wasn't super predictable. Honestly I think it had almost everything I look for in a comedy really. My advice is to see it but don't expect anything at all. Just watch it and let yourself enjoy the ridiculousness of it. The ending was fantastic. This made it into my long list of favorite comedies for sure.".

Yes it depicts some real rough stuff quite graphically and the whole point of it is that Nelson gets treated badly not just because he's a wuss did I spell that right? but mainly because his cellmate John is bribing other prisoners to beat him up foul his food etc. But the way this movie is put together is unbelievably funny despite the bleak subject matter. In fact I barely noticed how dark it was I was laughing so much. And of course being a comedy at heart it has a happy ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Sascha Cohen's 'Borat' may be the mostpopular comedy of 2006 there is an even funnier one and it's this movie! Astonishingly Universal distributed this little indie but has given it virtually no publicity whatsoever. That must have been the tradeoff because it's a pretty uncompromising story that could be comparedto Richard Linklater's Fast Food Nation. Directed by Bob Odenkirk Mr. Show SNLwriter during the Phil Hartman era Ben Stiller Show Conan O'Brien it's an interestingtake on our corrections system and it's looselybased on a nonfiction book called 'You Are Going to Prison' by a former inmate named Jim Hogshire. Much of his humor is intact in the film but writers Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon have taken it into the realm of fictionnonfiction. The book was literally just a 'howto' guide to survival in prison so you know this isn't going to be a flatteringportrayal of it. Most Americans know fullwell their prison system is corrupt and basically dysfunctional but our culture has a lust for punishment at its core. Don't believe me? Let's go to prison and findout! The movie makes the case by stating we have 2 million Americans inprison now only being surpassed by China and Russia. But this bloodlust is mostobvious during our elections mostly the localones though Reagan and Bush thrived on the 'crimeandpunishment' issue. And manohman is there some punishment in the firstquarter of this movie wow it really was only slightlyfunny until...the story has some very unpredictable and hilarious twists to it! Odenkirk did the Midwest proud by placing the tale in Illinois and they filmed the prisonscenes at the old Joliet Prison. There is a scene with the warden of the facility that is priceless 'Take all of your complaints write them on a piece of paperand stick it upyourasshole.'. In a fewareas it's almost tooclose to reality but this changes as the story progresses.The movie begins with the story of repeatfelon John Lyshitski played tothehilt by Dax Shepard who plays rednecks a lot who is unfairly put on a path to crime by a certain judge at the age of 8. He has what is euphemistically called 'badluck' and gets snared into the system like so many others in America.Judge Biederman just keeps sending him furtherandfurther into the corrections system much like what happened to make John Dillinger a gangster and untoldscores of minoroffenders into murderers. Because we are so harsh in our penalties here we actually have created a situation where felons are manufactured. Let's Go to Prison makes this point manytimes throughout the film but it does it with a lot of laughs at the expense of the story's other protagonist Nelson Biederman IV played by the brilliant and funny Will Arnett from Arrested Development the son of the judge. Lyshitski getsreleased at the beginning of the film and we get a voiceover of his story. The man wants revenge but he realizes that judge Biederman died threedaysbefore his release so he decides to takeitout on his son instead. Like I said the firstquarter of the movie is grim! Lyshitski is constantly giving Biederman the worst advice you could give to someone imprisoned and the plot takes a radicalturn in a confrontation between the judge's son and an Ayran Nations gangleader that must be seen to be believed. The wormturns for Biederman the pathetic yuppiefop who loves the 1990s poptune 'Shake That Body' and Lyshitski is in for quite a ride as his target becomes the 'big man' in the joint. It just gets funnier and telling you any more would just ruin the ride for you but you get a greater understanding of life in prison.This was something I never expected because...well we all think we've seenitall with prison movies but Let's Go to Prison goes further than all of them! From Biederman gettingpunched everyday to his beingsold to a Black inmate called 'Barry' the alwaysgreat Chi McBride for an ounceofpot and a cartonof smokes to their ongoing 'courting' it's hilarious. It also has an ending for the ages that I would personally love to see in reallife! If the movie says anything it's that the criminal justice and corrections system is a joke on all of us and it actually finds some hilarity in this fact. That's a tall order that it fills noproblem. But most Americans are too cool to laugh at themselves. That's OK we'll laugh at you anyway. Flawed but hilarious. Score.".

The ending is a funny twist of events that is good for a chuckle as well as lesson about guy bonding.The film is no great shakes of a movie but made on an obviously low budget it does benefit from the antics of the three excellent leads and the result is a 'different kind of prison movie' that is light silly and entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "Happy Birthday to Me is an often neglected and seldom viewed 80's cinema gem. It is a damn shame that it has not received the cult status it so solidly deserves. The plot involves cliques prep schools and a very weird birthday party but that is not what is important here. What matters is all the stops director J. Lee Thompson pulled out to make this into a near masterpiece of the slasher genre.Let's begin with the topnotch cast. Melissa Sue Anderson of Little House on the Prairie bravely fills a leading role that is decidedly unclear about whether it is that of a protagonist or antagonist. Whichever way you look at it Anderson acts with aplomb! Secondly there is veteran thespian Glenn Ford who despite what some overzealous critics said gives a fine performance as the doctor in addition to adding a sense of dignity to the proceedings. Also of note is the luminary Lenore Zann a multi talented wonder who has sadly never enjoyed the success she deserves. Her enlightened performance is both savvy and sensible and she brings a sense of validity to a character that other actress would have simply let fade away into the background as it seems the misguided script intended. Another unforgettable personality is Sharon Acker. Seen only in flashbacks she takes the role of the overbearing mother to new heights a sheer classic in overacting! For those familiar with Sleepaway Camp another piece of great 80's horror Acker's whacked out mother just might rival Desiree Gould's Aunt Martha. While these are the players who really stand out also of note are Lawrence Dane as the enigmatic father Frances Hyland the headmistress and Lesleh Donaldson who makes the most out of her '1st victim' cameo.But enough about acting on to the gore! And oh what a gory movie Happy Birthday to Me is. The film skillfully manages to be bloody and raw without becoming revolting. In fact the grisliest scene is not a murder at all but rather a realistic medical procedure! That's not to say there are no shocking murders however. There are 6 bizarre murders as the poster promises with the notorious shish kabob scene remaining one that will always live in infamy. The only thing more delightful than these sadistic killings is of course the twist ending! A real twist ending! What a twist! The twist is virtually unpredictable as it comes almost entirely out of left field and scarcely even makes sense! Oh but it's just terrific! And let's not forget about the theme song that one hears shortly after. As an audience member one barely has time to compose themselves after the twist when they're treated to one of the eeriest songs ever composed during the end credits.In short Happy Birthday to Me delivers on all levels and now that it is easily accessible on DVD you'd have to be a fool to let this unparalleled work remain unwatched.".

	schema:headline " Much too clever of a slasher film for it's time.";
	schema:reviewBody "I may take a lot of grief for saying this but I firmly believe that Happy Birthday to Me is one of most intelligent and well acted slasher films of the 80's.  I think the reason that it never made as much of an impact as films like Friday the 13th and Prom Night which were released around the same time is that is was just TOO intelligent for its time.  It was released around the time when gore and body count is what made a slasher succeed.  HBTM relied on plot twists and character development.  This film is comparable to something that would be released and be successful today where plot twists are what make a slasher movie.  Melissa Sue Anderson gives a excellent performance as Virginia a member of the elite Crawford 10 who suffered injuries in a car accident just months before the start of the film.  At the approach of her 16th birthday her fellow classmates begin to get butchered.  Yes a lot of things about this film are very confusing and the ending can be tricky at best to figure out but overall it plays out well and provides just enough gore and suspense to satisfy the slasher fans but also tries to appeal to those who want more than just a bunch of murders on film.  Highly recommended.  Intelligent and very well acted by Melissa Sue Anderson.  Just remember this film was made in 1981.  Way ahead of its time.".

	onyx:emotionText "I may take a lot of grief for saying this but I firmly believe that Happy Birthday to Me is one of most intelligent and well acted slasher films of the 80's.  I think the reason that it never made as much of an impact as films like Friday the 13th and Prom Night which were released around the same time is that is was just TOO intelligent for its time.  It was released around the time when gore and body count is what made a slasher succeed.  HBTM relied on plot twists and character development.  This film is comparable to something that would be released and be successful today where plot twists are what make a slasher movie.

Ya see... one of the other Top 10 girls was also having a party so the rest just naturally followed. Ginny's hard boozing Momma didn't like that too much. Not only did she storm over to the girls house with daughter in tow but she managed to get them both into a nasty little car accident that not only ended her life but severely messed up her daughters life as well.Never fear! After some experimental brain surgeries and a few repressed memories Ginny has emerged years later as a beautiful young woman who managed to get into the Top 10 after all!!! Hooray! There's just one little catch. Ginny's Bday is coming up again but her fellow Top 10 are disappearing one by one. Of course as the viewer we realize right away that they are each getting hacked to bits....but who's killing them all?? Could it be that whacko Rudi? Or how about that creepy Alfred? Or is it Ginny herself? Happy Birthday to Me emerges from the early 80's genre of horror films as one of the better movies out there. It may not be as gory as some of the others but it does at least have some character development and some pretty creative death scenes going for it! And that Melissa Sue Anderson...what a looker!! For the DVD release their has been some drastic change to the original soundtrack. Due to copyright issues some funky disco music has been added mostly in the beginning where there was once only scary music. While many have ranted on and on in previous reviews about how deplorable this is.... for this reviewer it wasn't all that bad. Plus it's really only in the beginning which makes it bearable.In addition others claim how lame the ending of this movie is. While the ending is unbelieveable to say the least when you have your Jasons Michael Myers and Freddy's running around without ever being able to stay put who can really fault this little gem from its ironic twist of an ending. Sure it's phony but it's also fun. And most of you will never see it coming. For fans of early 80's style horror this really is a must see.If an invitation should happen to present itself this reviewer would recommend checking this party out!".

If they had of left the twist as it was rather than adding the ridiculous second twist it would have been a much better film. However there are many good scenes which get points from me such as the flashback of the car falling off the bridge  it's very well done and we get to see the car falling in at different angles. The acting from Virginia's mother is also superb for her brief appearance. There are some unusual death scenes too although I must have seen the cut version because I didn't get to see much of them. Overall this film could have been a lot better without the elements that make it confusing but it's still worth seeking out and is better than a lot of slashers out there.".

So opens a classic slasher film.This is Little House on the Prairie's Melissa Sue Anderson's first starring role in a film and ignoring Skatetown U.S.A. her first film outside of TV.Someone upsets Virginia Anderson and he is dispatched quickly. By whom? Is it the creepy guy Alfred Jack Blum that hangs around the Top Ten? Soon another gets a weight dropped on his balls with disastrous results.Well at least we know who the murderer is with a little pruning a tasty shish kabob and a quick dip as we saw who did two of them  or did we? It is certainly a mystery why there are no bodies.The shower scene was very unsatisfying.";

	schema:reviewBody "Virginia Wainwright is a new student at Crawford Academy and she's part of a wealthy group of close friends that are known as the top 10. There's one secret that these friends don't know about Virginia and that's she survived an accident which her mother died. After trying resume a normal happy life she starts getting flashbacks of her ordeal and also spells of unconsciousness. While this is suddenly happening the number of her friends in the group are getter smaller as they disappear one by one. The authorities are clueless and Virginia starts to suspect herself being involved.Righto what a bluff! Well now this film does leave you with a lot on mind I guarantee you. Maybe it was too clever and overdone for it owns good because I was quite liking up until it came to its dawdling final halfanhour which gets the better of it by catering an climax that's all bit too silly. Abient it's more than surprising and ominous but hardly plausible. The sudden sombre ending was nicely staged though. But that in mind Happy Birthday to Me is an satisfying and well accomplished slasher that has a lot more going for it than most in its rancid field. Director J. Lee Thompson succeeds in giving the film a magnified touch of slickness but also amongst the panache is some depth. Sure it doesn't make sense at times and there are lapses aplenty but they try for a little more detail around the mystery instead of a simple stalk and slash vehicle. Even the pacing isn't that tedious in the first hour with enough going on in the subplots to keep your interest before the next brutal murder. These nasty murders are shockingly enterprising with a real cruel streak that takes effect in the dying stages of the story. They're rather blood soaked deaths with some red paint here and there. But obviously it's been cut down to brief glimpses but still it has its unpleasant moments within the decent body count. It may not cop out on the frequent violence but nudity there isn't ounce of it.The story by John Saxon provides enough twists and turns by throwing the usual red herrings around which are rather effectively done and providing some psychological edge which doesn't always come off. It does play around with idea that the main lead might have more to do with it then she knows with the latter half of the flick filled with meaningful flashbacks and a change in personality that we see but her friends don't. But really underneath that irregular subtext is just another systematic pattern we see in most slashers with obnoxious teens that fit the same old sitting ducks ah I mean stereotypes but here it's handled better. Though the conclusion is totally bananas with a motive that's pure hokum. You'll think you got it figured and BOOM! There you go. The lead girl might be confused to what's going on but also the viewer is in the same boat too. Also surprisingly the script is efficiently stable with pinch of peculiar humour and the performances are more than adequate. Melissa Sue Anderson shines as Virginia and Glenn Ford adds a touch class as her doctor. On show is a nice looking teen cast too.Director Thompson orchestrates some wellrounded tension in certain sections and paints a forbidding atmosphere to proceedings. He knows how to work in some great visual jabs and some extensively staged stunt action but there was some pointless dragging in third act. It became rather laboured where the running time should've been cut down. The feature nearly runs for two hours but here there wasn't enough in the material to hold for that long. The editing was swift but it could've done without certain scenes. If so it could have been an incredibly taut piece throughout rather than in blotches. The compact camerawork has some neat fixes in building on the mood and disorientating nature of it all. Like many of its kind you got the killer cam. Backing it up is a strong soundtrack and a rather haunting theme song. Some recent slashers owe a lot to this flicks format and I reasonably enjoyed this slasher that I would rank it as one of the better ones especially from the flooded 80s.Aboveaverage slasher that doesn't set the world on fire but delivers a ludicrous outing with more depth and style to boot.".

This shouldn't come as a big surprise since the man in the director's chair was J. Lee Thompson acclaimed creator of great horror  thrillers such as Eye of the Devil Cape Fear and a nearly endless amount of Charles Bronson action vehicles. With J. Lee Thompson in charge the tension is built up more atmospherically and the inexperienced young cast members are definitely kept on a short leash. Still Happy Birthday To Me doesn't deserve too much praise as it remains an ordinary bloodbath in which teenagers you don't care about are killed off in the most absurd ways by the most unlikely culprit. Pivot character is the cherubic Virginia who just joined the elite clique of the school after recovering from a nearfatal car accident that killed her mother. Someone clearly isn't happy with Virginia's return since the teenagers go missing one by one. Or maybe Virginia herself is still a little sick in the brain?? The first hour is pretty good with an eerie title song witty dialogs and a couple of very nasty killings oh yes the kebabstabbing!. After that however the story becomes tedious and you start hoping that all the characters die a quick and painful death. The famous twist ending is indeed unpredictable but at the same time very farfetched and dumb. Considering Happy Birthday To Me is a lowbudgeted early 80's slasher film a little bit of naked flesh would have been welcome too.".

	schema:headline " Tries too hard to be clever at the end.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film comes straight from Canada is set in the United States and tries too hard for a clever ending with a twist or two. What we get in the way of the slasher genre is a bit of that red paint in lieu of anything remotely resembling blood no nudity and some of the slowest paced kills ever put to film. It had its moments and had a couple of interesting kills but the film was killed for me by an ending that is completely absurd! Are you going to be surprised by the ending? Probably but I do not believe in a good way. Will the movie leave you thinking? Probably but in a way that makes you question why the heck the killer did any of the stuff they did and chances are you are going to question the use of a mask that seems straight out of the Mission Impossible films and not something a teen in high school would ever be able to whip up especially in the 80's! The film also is overlong as a slasher should not be almost two hours long unless it features good actors like Anthony Hopkins or something.The story has a group of friends that are like the most popular students at this private school. They like to hang out at a bar and they get to drink beer and do stupid things. A group of thoroughly unlikable teens that you won't mind seeing dispatched. Heck one poor girl is taken out before she even makes it to the bar. One of the girls has a past that includes a horrific accident and an experimental brain surgery the rest are pretty typical until they all keep getting killed one by one! Well not all of them are killed but a significant portion are.This film has some interesting kills such as a weight kill that could have easily been avoided. Seriously I had weights come down on me and I did not explode like that. There is the famous one depicted on many of the film's posters and covers with a guy getting a skewer of meat shoved into his mouth. Though it does not look as good in film. In the end though the absurdity and motives of the killer just tank this film in my opinion. Jason's mom and Jason had good motives to kill Michael is a super evil psychopath so a good reason to kill and the Leatherface clan like some good barbecue. All much better motives and reasons than the one they present to us at the end of this film. It made more sense for them to end the film without that twist as that made some sense.So not a really good slasher but not totally devoid of goodness. It was one of those who done it slashers where you wonder who is the killer. When I watched it with my fianc so many years ago she kept saying They have to be the killer and I would say No it is too soon to reveal them. Then they sort of did reveal them and then they added some horrible twist. I guess they were trying to be clever but while a spot of cleverness is good you really do at least need it to make some sort of logical sense.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film comes straight from Canada is set in the United States and tries too hard for a clever ending with a twist or two. What we get in the way of the slasher genre is a bit of that red paint in lieu of anything remotely resembling blood no nudity and some of the slowest paced kills ever put to film. It had its moments and had a couple of interesting kills but the film was killed for me by an ending that is completely absurd! Are you going to be surprised by the ending? Probably but I do not believe in a good way. Will the movie leave you thinking? Probably but in a way that makes you question why the heck the killer did any of the stuff they did and chances are you are going to question the use of a mask that seems straight out of the Mission Impossible films and not something a teen in high school would ever be able to whip up especially in the 80's! The film also is overlong as a slasher should not be almost two hours long unless it features good actors like Anthony Hopkins or something.The story has a group of friends that are like the most popular students at this private school. They like to hang out at a bar and they get to drink beer and do stupid things. A group of thoroughly unlikable teens that you won't mind seeing dispatched. Heck one poor girl is taken out before she even makes it to the bar. One of the girls has a past that includes a horrific accident and an experimental brain surgery the rest are pretty typical until they all keep getting killed one by one! Well not all of them are killed but a significant portion are.This film has some interesting kills such as a weight kill that could have easily been avoided. Seriously I had weights come down on me and I did not explode like that.

It uses many of what I see as key elements in science fiction  known science theoretical science possible futures and our fear of the unknown I personally think even with what we know we still know very little about black holes.This movie was made in the feel of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea and Moby Dick with the mad yet brilliant captain sailing a state of the art ship knowingly into certain and utter doom in the name of some idealistic obsession. And as it usually goes you have your idealistic yet rational unwilling passengers who want to get off the ship and survive the mad man's nightmarish dreams.The robots while used in a highly symbolic fashion were original in their concept and design. I particularly liked the way V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and B.O.B. were constructed as the avatars of humanity  completely manmade with humanlike eyes and a soul that only allowed them to see the right side of things  as we see them. While on the other hand Maximilian was brilliant as the epitome of evil and twisted humanity in this movie  a man silently trapped and condemned to an inhuman fate as part of a mechanical nightmare.Lastly I feel that the space backdrops and the internal renderings of the space ship which I feel have somewhat of an impressionistic flair are awesome and were very well done for the period. If you passed on this movie the first time I recommend giving it a second chance. Take in the movie  see its symbolism its social commentaries and far reaching vision.

	schema:reviewBody "A team of space travelers locates a long lost massive spacecraft the U.S.S. Cygnus perched in space near an imposing black hole. They meet its commander the mad genius Dr. Hans Reinhardt Maximilian Schell who's created an army of obedient robot slaves and who fully intends to explore this black hole and see what might lay beyond it. It doesn't take our heroes too long to realize that they should get out while the getting is good.The Black Hole came along at a very interesting time during the reign of Disney Studios when they took some unusual chances with their projects and dipped their toes into genres like fantasy scifi and horror. Also of note during this time are The Watcher in the Woods Tron and Something Wicked This Way Comes. The result is a very dark and highly operatic piece of work that offers great fun although it will have more appeal to older kids and adults than the very young due to its themes plot details and suggestion of violence. As a matter of fact some pretty nasty violence is suggested at one point not that we ever see any blood or gore. It does play as reminiscent of earlier works  Disney's own production of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea Forbidden Planet 2001 A Space Odyssey and Star Wars.Some of the visual effects may show their age now 37 years later but overall the movie is quite agreeable as eye candy and looks especially nice in its intended 2.351 aspect ratio. John Barry's music score is somewhat repetitive but also utterly thunderous and ominous perfectly suiting the material.The human cast is steadfast and reliable with Schell making the most of his madman role. It's hard to go too wrong with a group of actors including Anthony Perkins Robert Forster Joseph Bottoms Ernest Borgnine and the lovely Yvette Mimieux. As was the case with Star Wars the cute robot characters tend to steal the show V.I.N.CENT voiced by Roddy McDowall and B.O.B. voiced by Slim Pickens.

	onyx:emotionText "A team of space travelers locates a long lost massive spacecraft the U.S.S. Cygnus perched in space near an imposing black hole. They meet its commander the mad genius Dr. Hans Reinhardt Maximilian Schell who's created an army of obedient robot slaves and who fully intends to explore this black hole and see what might lay beyond it. It doesn't take our heroes too long to realize that they should get out while the getting is good.The Black Hole came along at a very interesting time during the reign of Disney Studios when they took some unusual chances with their projects and dipped their toes into genres like fantasy scifi and horror. Also of note during this time are The Watcher in the Woods Tron and Something Wicked This Way Comes. The result is a very dark and highly operatic piece of work that offers great fun although it will have more appeal to older kids and adults than the very young due to its themes plot details and suggestion of violence. As a matter of fact some pretty nasty violence is suggested at one point not that we ever see any blood or gore. It does play as reminiscent of earlier works  Disney's own production of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea Forbidden Planet 2001 A Space Odyssey and Star Wars.Some of the visual effects may show their age now 37 years later but overall the movie is quite agreeable as eye candy and looks especially nice in its intended 2.351 aspect ratio. John Barry's music score is somewhat repetitive but also utterly thunderous and ominous perfectly suiting the material.The human cast is steadfast and reliable with Schell making the most of his madman role. It's hard to go too wrong with a group of actors including Anthony Perkins Robert Forster Joseph Bottoms Ernest Borgnine and the lovely Yvette Mimieux. As was the case with Star Wars the cute robot characters tend to steal the show V.I.N.CENT voiced by Roddy McDowall and B.O.B. voiced by Slim Pickens. The towering red robot thug Maximillian leaves quite the impression as well. Director Gary Nelson cameos as the drone whose mask is removed.Great fun overall which is made all the more memorable by its truly haunting ending.Eight out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw the Black Hole when I was in college and I remembered just enough to know that I liked it.  Others here have commented on the movie in great enough detail I can only sayLighten Up!  Sure the effects are not perfect but they really are pretty good. The acting is acceptable not oscar level but then neither is the script that they were given to work with. Many of the events depicted are not plausible but how many movies really are? Even non SF ones The Black Hole is in some ways Captain Nemo in space.  The Elizabethan structure of the ship in particular.  Also Reinhart and Nemo are similar characters.  However Nemo is not truly a villain.  His crew is composed of volunteers and they are very loyal to him whereas Reinhart must lobotomize his crew to retain their services.  Reinhart cares for no one but himself but Nemo was concerned though grudgingly for the welfare of even his prisoners.  In short Nemo is a sympathetic character Reinhart is not. This brings me to the point of my review.  The mood of this movie is what really makes or breaks it.  I must credit my sister for defining it for me because I could not find the right word.  The word is CREEPY! There is a feeling of forboding that builds untill the action sequences are finished and our heroes enter the black hole.  After that it is just intensely weird and CREEPY. Having not seen this movie for twenty years and remembering only the cool effects and robots I allowed my 5 year old to watch it. Big mistake!  He was afraid to go to sleep and it bothered him for about a week.  This kid has handled action and SF movies OK before although I do not let him watch the more violent or intense stuff.  This movie is intense!  Star wars did not bother him at all but the Black Hole . . . Parents of small children beware!  The Black Hole is CREEPY!".

	schema:headline " An unfairly marginalised bit of scifi";
	schema:reviewBody "The Black Hole was one of many films that were released with the intention of cresting the scifi wave created by the huge success of Star Wars 1977. More specifically this was Disney's attempt at the genre and I think it was the studio's first movie that didn't go for a U certificate. The film that it can best be compared to is Star Trek The Motion Picture which was also released the same year. Both movies sport fantastic special effects and production values while both also are surprisingly  and pleasingly  slightly leftfield in their approach. Neither really fall squarely into the actionadventure bracket that Star Wars so obviously did they rely more on atmosphere some psychological aspects and have some enigmatic qualities which seem to indicate the influence of the earlier hard scifi masterpiece 2001 A Space odyssey 1968. For these reasons I find both these films to be decidedly underappreciated and interesting. The Star Trek franchise of course went down a different more comforting route from the second feature The Wrath of Khan 1982 onwards while The Black Hole remained a one off that has become more and more obscure as the years go by. So much so that it could reasonably be considered a cult movie on account of its selective appeal.From the off this is visually a very interesting film. It has great sets and model work which make the giant space craft where the majority of the action takes place an evocative setting. The special effects throughout are in general very impressive and still look good today. But the visuals have been constructed for more than mere spectacle as they combine to create a pretty interesting atmosphere on the whole they ultimately are used also to set up the strange and ambiguous ending which involves visions of Hell and an alternate universe. This kind of oddness stands out these days as most big budget scifi endeavours mostly avoid such ambiguity but this is definitely a plus point for The Black Hole. Another serious asset is the really effective main theme from John Barry. This is in all honesty one of his best bits of individual music its sweeping yet mysterious and complements events on screen extremely well.The story itself is pretty simple and boils down to a deep space crew discovering a mysterious spaceship near a black hole they board it and events escalate. The story is perhaps oddly presented in some ways as there is material quite obviously aimed at kids like the cartoonish robots the main one V.I.N.C.E.N.T. being voiced excellently by Roddy McDowell but at the same time there are also some decidedly sinister aspects to this one too. So I guess it had a bit of a split focus in some ways not that that is a terrible thing but it may have accounted for its marginalised position in the scifi cinematic pantheon. But whatever the case I consider this to be one of the best that 70's science fiction has to offer. It's mysterious and leftofcentre nature mean that it is one of the more interesting entries in the genre to revisit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie in the theater when I was 6 years old. So you have to remember that frame of reference when you read these comments. I saw The Black Hole when I was six years old and of course I loved it. Although what I remember the most about that experience was my first glimpse of Maximilian the giant killer red robot. Maximilian terrified me. And he ended up being the first movie character to ever really scare the crap out of me.If you were 6 years old kid in 1980 you would remember this film. Because even though it's silly to make the comparison today at one time the Black Hole held a special place in the hearts of kids everywhere mainly because it featured a character who was even scarier than Darth Vader. That's right Star Wars came 2 years earlier than the Black Hole and Star Wars had a frightening guy in a black mask named Darth Vader. But let me tell you that to a kid growing up in 1980 Darth Vader was NOTHING compared to Maximilian. Darth Vader was a pansy compared to Maximilian and I'm not just joking around. If you were a little kid in 1980 you knew about this movie. And you knew who Maximilian was. And you spoke about him in terms of reverence. Because you don't mock the robot who haunts your nightmares every single night.That's how big a deal Maximilan was at the time.Yes The Black Hole has flaws. Yes the rest of the robots are comical. And yes the science fiction in the movie makes no sense. And sure I'd agree that the sight of Ernest Borgnine in a tight turtleneck is disturbing and I never want to see it again. But none of that really matters to me. All I care about is that this movie features Maxmilian the bleeping killer red robot. And from a pop culturemovie history perspective that makes this movie a classic.Personally I think that the Black Hole is a pretty lame movie. But in 1980 I would have ranked it alongside Star Wars as the coolest thing I had ever seen in my life. And of course that is almost solely because of Maximilian. So don't make fun of this movie. Just remember that it cause a lot of nightmares in kids from the 70's and early 80's. And please give it props for featuring a villain that at one time was cooler and scarier than a guy named Darth Vader.So here's to you Maximilian.Please don't Cuisinart me through a book.Mario's Movie Rating 5 out of 10 at least it's somewhat entertaining Mario's Maximilian Rating 10 of 10".

It's a vision of the future that strikes a chord in me dark uncaring space the black hole a crushing force more powerful than the sun ego and insane genius science and what's beyond science the horror of the old crew's fate. The music with its heavy repeated theme is like the crushing presence of the black hole itself relentless. A new God if ever there was one.In my opinion it has more emotional impact than Solaris which threw in too much murder mystery and sort of confused me. The Black Hole is simple it is clearly beyond knowledge and all the spookier for it.If you get a thrill from the idea of scientific discovery give this underrated film a chance.

I think that's a reasonable response on her part actually.I suggest a new improved tagline There is a force in the universe that sucks harder than anything else known to man... It is The Black Hole!!! the movie that is!spoilers followOkay first the good In its time it was found to be visually impressive. It definitely hasn't held up like 2001 Star Wars or even the first Star Trek movie though. I do remember being pretty overwhelmed as a tyke watching this back in the day. The end is still vertigoinducing looking suspiciously like a ride at Disneyland. Did they plan to build a spin off very literally in this case ride based on the anticipated success of this film? I know! Let's have their seats all spin around inside the spaceship when they enter the hole! Why the hell the seats in a spaceship would be designed to spin madly is never addressed... Sorry more good Maximilian is a badass looking robot. I am suddenly seized with a desire for a good model of him because he is the very archetype of droid evil. His immobility just adds to the menace.The opening and closing credits score not the lame overture is pretty creepy cool too. On to the bad The rest of the film. Script acting direction plot dialogue... By any reasonable measure of a movie's worth this is a total failure. There are so many ridiculous embarrassing moments that this is a great choice for those compulsive smartasses who enjoy mocking a movie nonstop MST 3000 style. Nothing in this movie makes any sense. The science of this fiction is beyond wrong the design of the spaceships is absurd gigantic formal dining room with huge crystal chandelier wtf? the characters have no motivation and the ending... Ouch.Most of the dialogue is risible and all of it is delivered woodenly at best. The gravity is at maximum! Uhh what? The ugly There are two disturbing eviscerations in this film which somehow takes it from a silly space opera for children into more serious territory. They should have kept it light and grated or made a film worthy of adults.My disbelief failed to suspend in the face of such a hamfisted production. Why would anybody design an enormous empty gallery through the middle of a spaceship? Oh right so a giant flaming meteor could roll through it later in the film gotcha. Why is the meteor flaming and red hot? Because it's in proximity to a black hole silly! And everybody knows that the most powerful force in the universe is... Gravity! Uh no actually gravity is the weakest force known. Those of you at home can play Spot the Glaring Errors! Worst of all is the ending. Oh the awfulness! On the other side of a black hole which is portrayed here as a whirlpool in a tub in a gravity well oddly enough is... A JudeoChristian morality play! Surprise surprise. But nominative determinism wins the day with Maximilian Schell ending up in Maximilian's shell in hell. Choose your child's name carefully folks!If you're a film effects historian you should probably see this film as it was a landmark and the last big Disney studiosystem effects extravaganza. The results obtained may explain why they changed the system actually... If you want to prove your worth and brilliance by ridiculing a silly terminally confused movie you have found your victim. Beer popcorn irony!If you are looking for a trip down nostalgia lane like I was jump on board! Maybe without the wife though. But if you are looking for a film that is satisfying as a film burn your main engines at full power to escape the lethal suck of... The Black Hole!".

On the other side of a black hole which is portrayed here as a whirlpool in a tub in a gravity well oddly enough is... A JudeoChristian morality play! Surprise surprise. But nominative determinism wins the day with Maximilian Schell ending up in Maximilian's shell in hell. Choose your child's name carefully folks!If you're a film effects historian you should probably see this film as it was a landmark and the last big Disney studiosystem effects extravaganza. The results obtained may explain why they changed the system actually... If you want to prove your worth and brilliance by ridiculing a silly terminally confused movie you have found your victim. Beer popcorn irony!If you are looking for a trip down nostalgia lane like I was jump on board! Maybe without the wife though. But if you are looking for a film that is satisfying as a film burn your main engines at full power to escape the lethal suck of... The Black Hole!";

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen this movie in the theater when I was 8 I and everyone in my school was spellbound by it. Many parts of it haven't held up well 30 years later the acting is similar to any 70's made for TV show. It was made at a time when every show had a wisecracking character think SNL and had a symphonic theme just listen to any TV theme show from the time. While the movie gets often nailed for the stoically wooden acting 90 of the characters are scientists robots or following the contemporary stereotype of astronauts as strong and taciturn. The plot is essentially 20000 Leagues Under the Sea set in space. Culturally the movie felt topical at the time. It was a perfect amalgamation of popular culture in the late 1970's science fiction Star Wars et al. video games Space Invaders space exploration the Voyager probes laser guns and robots everything from Battlestar Galactica to Buck Rogers as well as ESP parapsychology and heaven vs. hell c.f. see the number of books on psychic phenomena and mysteries from the late 70's as well as the popularity of things like Heaven Can Wait and the George Burns' Oh God! movies. Disney took a huge gamble on a movie that was so overtly dark both in tone and set lighting. The movie was not a runaway financial success but was not a loss either a major achievement considering its extremely high price tag. Even if its ethos and pacing don't fit well with today's audiences its design sense holds up today. The sets create a feeling of both scale claustrophobia and tension. The robot V.I.N.CENT actually steals the show both in his insight and action. His action figure was more popular on the playground than any of the Star Wars figures yet most of his constant clever yet arrogant wisdom comes from literary quotes far beyond any child's entertainment  from Shakespeare to Cicero to the Bible. Like the best Disney movies this one was made to be simultaneously enjoyed on different levels by both the kids and adults in the audience.All in all taken in terms of its time it's a remarkable achievement in special effects and seeing Disney push its limits. The pacing acting musical themes juxtaposition of long exposition with laser fights scientific theories and portrayal of robots as rigid goosesteppers all seem dated today. The rest is a good allegory of balancing scientific genius with ethics. The practical effects still hold up. V.I.N.CENT is more human than any CGI creation and  with his constant humanities references arrogance and compassion for his crewmates  the most human component of the film. For anyone expecting a Disney movie circa the late 80's and afterwards you may not be entertained. For classic science fiction fans as well as those who have nostalgia for or are interested in American culture in the late 70's don't miss this. SPOILER BELOWThe ending is very 2001esque and gets attacked for its obscurity but the symbolism was clear to anyone who went to Sunday School which at the time was nearly everyone the bad guys went to hell and the good guys went to heaven. What's behind a black hole? According to the movie the world all souls go to when they die.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was born in 1981 and saw the Black Hole on television as a child and immediately fell in love with the robots production designespecially on the Cygnus one the of the coolestlooking ships ever and the dazzling effects with the black hole. That being said yes the movie does have its flaws. It feels like a combination of the swashbuckling action of Star Wars with the cerebral qualities of Kubrick. The movie soundtrack is rather annoying especially the main title theme. But does that make it bad? No just misguided. The movie's plot is clich A mad scientist wants to pilot his ship into the black hole in search of immortality. Some of the dialogue is cringeworthy and the ending tries to outweird 2001. But the movie is still an underrated film nonetheless. For 1979 the visuals are aweinspiring featuring more specialeffect shots than Star Wars. The characters while stock are still likable. The opening sequence featuring a wireframe computer generated black hole yanking you towards the center of the whirlpool is fantastic and the enemy robot Maximillian comes in second only to the Horned King as Disney's scariest and most intimidating villain. Yes Disney made this movie. As far as Disney live action films go this is easily one of the most watchable. The best part is that there isn't any singing tacked onto it like so many of their Disney films of the time. The Black Hole was an experiment some would say failed but I say that while it may not be as acclaimed as others this film is vastly underrated and deserves a second look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Uhh OK where to start? I remember when this movie came out but never saw it until it was on TCM the other night.I couldn't get over how incredibly cheesy this movie is. Watching it I couldn't believe it was made in the 1970's. It's obvious the writers  producers must have sat  watched numerous 1950's  60's scifi movies in order to get the idea for this one. The set  acting all reminded me of an old movie in which all the spacecraft have cavernous rooms with highly polished floors and robots who move with jerky movements.How is it cheesy? Let me count the ways.First the two robots VINCENT  Bob. Robots afraid? And then shaking in fear? This worked in the comedy The Ice Pirates but that was a comedy. Black Hole is supposedly a serious movie. When I first saw VINCENT I realized I was watching a cheesy movie. The robot's eyes could have been so much better than just painted on. The robot reminds me of Cartman from South Park. And don't even get me started on Bob the robot with the Texas accent. Also how can a human have a psychic bond with a robot? I could have bought it if they said she had some kind of electronic implant or something. Incredibly advanced humanoid robots which move with stiff jerky movements can shoot balls of light with no problem but can't hit stationary people.The characters being able to breathe in outer space. Near the end when the ship is breaking apart yes they climb onto the outside of it. Earlier they experienced rapid decompression in the garden chamber but later when a meteor takes out the rail car tube they don't experience the same problem. They also have the ability to breathe in space at this point. The meteor shower. Meteors as glowing fiery round balls? In the real universe meteors are cold chunks of rock floating through space. The scene where the one meteor tears through the skin of the ship and then rolls down the long chamber may have been cool from a special effect point of view but is simply laughable. Notice how the meteor is just the right size to fit in the chamber? Near the end when they all go through the black hole appears to be a ripoff of 2001. The rocket even flies toward the same shining eclipsed star that you saw a few times in 2001.The deranged scientist dies on the ship when the giant flat screen TV falls on him yet near the end he's alive again to be merged with Maximillian the robot? And what's with the Helllooking area he ends up in? Is this supposed to make him the devil or something? And yet the good people fly down an arched hallway.This movie could have been so much better yet wasn't made to be. There's just no comparison with that other 1979 scifi flick Alien. Black Hole shouldn't be seen by anyone over the age of 10 yet those under 10 are going to be bored with much of the movie and will not understand the ending. Actually I don't think many people will understand the ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Black Hole 1979 was one of the first films that I can remember watching in a movie theater. A small cinema near to where I lived played Disney films and I saw this one there. A fun film about a group of astronauts and a robot who are welcomed aboard a gigantic spaceship manned by Maximillian Schnell. Sadly he's as mad as a hatter and has some unsettling plans for his guests. The leader of the space travelers is portrayed by one of my bmovie favorites Robert Forester. Creepy Anthony Perkins is also along for the ride as well as several other familiar faces. When I was a lad I was really into this genre. The robots were cool and the special effects were quite impressive.Not a bad film except it confused me a bit when I was younger especially the end. Entertaining for a Disney film and I wouldn't mind seeing it again in the near future. I have to give this one a passing grade. Not one of my truly favorites but a great time killer. If this one was on video for rent at my local rental store I wouldn't hesitate to watch it. But stay away from T.V. or Cable versions because this film was shot in Cinemascope.Recommended for camp value.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was pleased to read the comments of Andrew 31. I was a 28 year old adult and quite familiar with science fiction films and with science when I saw The Black Hole. I was awestruck. It is an incredible work of visual art. It is not so much a science fiction film as it is a magnificent piece of art and fantasy. I never understood why The Black Hole was not a major success. When I left the theatre I thought I had seen a true masterpiece of cinematic craft and beautiful visual presentation that set a new standard. Of course there were errors. But I thought that the creators of this film chose cinematic beauty and spectacle over more believable cinematography and plot. Remember that we must suspend disbelief even for the most realistic of science fiction films. It's just that we are more used to suspending disbelief in some ways than others. And we are not used to science fiction filmed for shear beauty.It is nothing like any other science fiction film I have seen. I cannot recall another visually gorgeous science fiction film. Lots of spectacle little beauty!I found Dr. Reinhardt to be one of the most disturbing characters in science fiction and Maximillian with the rotating can opener hands to be truly terrifying. The Black Hole hits some primal chords of violence fear life death coerced and tortured existence more typical of a horror film than science fiction. I will readily admit that The Black Hole is an oddbird that doesn't fit preconceived ideas of what science fiction should be. But ever since seeing this film I have wanted to have dinner in Max Reinhardt's dining room with the Chippendale furniture oriental carpets and an entire wall and ceiling of glass open into outer space.I generally prefer scifi that has an odd or new flair. So I don't rank lots of good scifi in my favorites because it is simply the same old story done well.Here are some of my favorite scifi films. You may look at this list and decide that I have no taste at all. Then again you may understand why The Black Hole is at the top of my list! I got carried away sorry. Bladerunner Naked Lunch Altered States Star Wars the first one Dark City The Matrix Mars Attacks Manchurian Candidate Frank Sinatra Starship Troopers Fantastic Planet European animation Enemy Mine The Day the Earth Stood Still Brazil 12 Monkeys E.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw The Black Hole when I was a young kid and I just didn't get it. Sure the special effects looked pretty neat to my young eyes. And occasional bits of the film got me excited  like the scene where the heroes are trying to get across a bridge while a huge fireball rolls towards them. But I couldn't make sense of the long philosophical chitchat that passes between Maximilian Schell's mad scientist and his unwanted guests aboard the spacecraft Cygnus. Furthermore the final sequence in which the heroes travel through the titular black hole left me totally bewildered. Having recently rewatched the film as an adult I found it rather more comprehensible and in some aspects quite interesting but the thing I just couldn't come to terms with was the fact that a film made with children in mind could allow itself to get bogged down in so much complex talk and could end with such a metaphysical final sequence.The space shuttle Palomino is travelling through space when its crew unintentionally stumble across alonglost spaceship called the Cygnus. Stranger still is the fact that the Cygnus seems to be parked on the edge of a huge black hole yet is somehow resisting its tremendous gravitational pull. The Palomino's crew  Captain Dan Holland Robert Forster Lt. Charlie Pizer Joseph Bottoms Dr. Kate McRae Yvette Mimieux Dr. Alex Durant Anthony Perkins and Harry Booth Ernest Borgnine plus their droid Vincent voiced by Roddy McDowall  board the Cygnus to investigate. Dr. McRae in particular is keen to get to the bottom of its mystery as her father was one of the Cygnus's crew when it was last heard from 20 years previously. Once aboard they find that the whole spaceship is under the command of Dr. Hans Reinhardt Maximilian Schell an eccentric genius who claims that most of his crew left the Cygnus to respond to an order to return to earth. He says that he is the only surviving member of those who chose to remain. Dr. Reinhardt's plan seems to be to take the Cygnus into the black hole and to become the first man ever to learn what lies beyond....There are some dependable names in the cast and they give enjoyable if undemanding performances on the whole. The special effects are generally quite impressive. John Barry provides a really memorable score which sounds similar to some of his work for the James Bond films. Where The Black Hole comes undone is in its very timeconsuming and complicated talky scenes  in particular a heck of a lot of time seems to be taken with Schell imparting his philosophies to his unexpected guests. Also the final sequence reveals that black holes are gateways to heaven and hell. While this is an intriguing idea it is very deep and metaphysical for kids to get to grips with.... and the sequence is rather clumsily put together anyway so that it seems more muddled than clever. Adults will enjoy the film more than their kids but whatever your age you're likely to find that the film just doesn't quite fulfil its potential.".

The house was packed. I never saw so much disappointment in an audience. You could hear the audible gasps in certain scenes along with muffled snickers it was that bad. Everyone was polite when the house lights came up but you could tell... it flopped in a big way.This was also the year of Star Trek  the motion picture and Alien. During that 70mm premiere at the Egyptian the film jumped the track and the 70mm film burned up before our eyes. A woman actually screamed which sent a wave of very loud gasps through the crowd. Fortunately a friend of mine had other friends in Westwood showing it 70mm later that day. We ran over there and they managed to squeeze us in. Compared to the Black Hole whether that comparison is fair or not Alien was then and still is a scifi masterpiece and complete pushed the Black Hole off the page for the year. No one associated with scifi would even mention Black Hole at the cons.The Black Hole tried so hard to be legit Scifi. But in the end a great roster of seasoned actors had a poor script TV writer Bob Barash's only feature film poor direction TV director Gary Nelson's only feature film and all the wonderful special effects or sweeping score cannot save an inherently bad movie. Disney has yet to make another attempt at Scifi that has or will be considered successful.".

Well I didn't either but you can imagine what it must be like. You'd love the thing all the more because of its flaws because it'll never be perfect and because it needs someone to love it. And such is my love for The Black Hole 1979. It is an interesting story that is rendered and explored in a mechanical manneralthough visually in terms of its set design and special effects it is really stunning. It's a Disney product and like Star Trek The Motion Picture it was put on the slates mainly to cash in on the space opera craze that Star Wars had ignited. Movies are commercial art they exist to make money hopefully entertaining us at the same time and the Disney people got their best filmmaking talent together assembled a dynamite cast and cranked this out in a very lavish and polished way productionwise. The money is slathered all over the screen and everything is handled in the triedandtrue Disney Studios fashion of preplanning and choreographing everything down to the tiniest of details actors don't even PAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LINE unless it was dictated planned and rehearsed that way...this was very near the end of Disney's run as a major producer of liveaction features and The Black Hole is a fitting finish. It even features cute touches like the way the nastiest demise is saved for Anthony Perkins. If you're gonna make a slow mechanical movie you can at least do it with style and they did. It is an impressive production. In a certain way you might say I lovehate the movie. The methodical way it's constructed seems lifeless. But at the same time it is a strange joy to see its methodical construction. It takes tremendous energy to create something so controlled. It's certainly not a film made by accident or unconsciously.The Black Hole manages to be strangely tranceinducing. Once I put it on it's hard to turn it off.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a very good reason the attraction in Tomorrowland at Disney World has always been called Space Mountain and not The Black Hole even though the ride was obviously modeled after this movie.Overall sub par acting especially for a veteran cast thin plot with more suspension of disbelief than is necessary except for maybe kids under 10.

I can't understand what some people want with effects these days and I agree with some of the comments here the effects in the film look better stylistically than many modern films. You still can't beat a good model and good lighting there's something about the human eye that can still at the moment anyway tell computer generated graphics a mile away and they are never totally satisfying.As for the plot I'd forgotten how dark it was and it's worth watching again just to get that feel for it.

My generation could do that you know! That's what surprised me with watching it so many years later all the intense action really is in the last twenty minutes or so and the film builds up pretty nicely up to the end.

If you're a modern film viewer looking for popcorn type entertainment it's probably best not to bother you'll end up disappointed.

The character Liz is narcissistic to the point of parody. She immediately takes up with a brooding young actor and predictably leaves that relationship to search for happiness.

Liz goes to Italy eats her way across the boot never gaining an ounce quickly finds new friends celebrates a glorious Thanksgiving with a bunch of strangers and claims she is the luckiest girl alive. The only real moment in this film is a young girl giving Julia the middle finger from a balcony. It has a lingering moment that rings true. She goes to India washes floors on her hands and knees which making her actions so unbelievable that an urbane Manhattanite like herself would suffer the indignities of menial labor. By the time she goes to Bali I checked out of this disaster of a film. Even the scenery can't save this atrocity. The movie is wretched to watch. You may enjoy it if you want to see an egotistical character goes around sulking whining and moping about the meaning of life. Liz has been gives so much a home husband jobfriends health a few bucks and still she is not happy. Ingrates like her character are what is so wrong in this world.

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't read Elizabeth Gilbert's autobiographical book on which this movie is based and I'm not sure I want to after viewing this movie although I'm sure the book is wittier and more inspiring but even reading the New York Times book review I can see that the movie missed the boat. As such Julia Roberts plays a character who takes the prize for being a world class narcissist. A more selfcentered heroine would be hard to find. After asking her heartbroken husband played by Billy Crudup for a divorce because she is not happy and needs to find herself she jumps into an affair a struggling actor whom she leaves as soon as her divorce becomes final and she is free to travel to Italy India and Bali to spend a year trying to sort out her id.

Most of us cannot do this because we have responsibilities and loyalties and are not financially independent. This drab story fails to connect on any level except for pointless selfindulgence.

As such Julia Roberts plays a character who takes the prize for being a world class narcissist. A more selfcentered heroine would be hard to find. After asking her heartbroken husband played by Billy Crudup for a divorce because she is not happy and needs to find herself she jumps into an affair a struggling actor whom she leaves as soon as her divorce becomes final and she is free to travel to Italy India and Bali to spend a year trying to sort out her id.

The greatest emotion I felt from the film was hunger for Italian pizza thirst for Italian wine and an occasional dizziness due to director Ryan Murphy's apparent recent discovery of how to pan. It was laughable camerawork throughout the first 45 minutes and occasionally throughout. The first 12 hour of the film was almost unbearably bad even though the first section of the book was amongst my favorites. Perhaps someone who did not read the book could enjoy this movie but I somehow doubt it. One time Liz made a joke that was a nice break from the feeling of being in a lukewarm bathtub for 2 12 hours. Not unpleasant just meh. Instead of finding Liz intelligent and thoughtful she seemed selfish boring and obsessed with men. Instead of finding spirituality she seemed vapid. When the character becomes shallow a film centered around that character becomes a throw away. Maybe I'll just watch the trailer again.".

Freethinking neverbeentome writer Liz Julia Roberts decides to escape the rat race and her wellmeaning but smothering husband to of course find her true self by travelling to Italy India and Bali as you would and experiencing real life in the process. We all should have her problems. And yes by the end she's made umpteen lifelong friendships found her own guru and the power of zen built a new home for a singleparent and child from contributions solicited from the aforementioned new pals and of course to top it all off finds true love way out east to a handsome swarthy Brazilian who openly discusses his sexlife with his 19 yearold Australian don't ask me why son whom he kisses on the lips at goodbyes. Along the way she breaks the hearts of two young handsome guys turns down another and connects seriously with everyone from a Swedish tourist and her tutor in Italy a recovering Texan alcoholic and teenage girl going through an arranged marriage in India not forgetting her Latin lover toothless ancient swami and his homeless nurse in Bali.

	schema:reviewBody "Just like Sex in the City this film glorifies female borderline personality disorder. This film highlights fundamental flaws and defects in a woman's character and frames them as character assets. The film starts out with a pampered princess who has a loving and decently handsome husband who falls over himself for his wife Julia yet she is discontent due to major character flaws which are likely attributable to selfishness selfcenteredness and arrogance so she she decided to go find herself with foreign lovers while eating Italian food.If this movie's main protagonist were a male oh my God could you imagine the female response? A male leaves his adoring attractive wife to go bang foreign chicks while eating food? He would be considered a complete pig and further considered to be worth killing. These romcoms are now depicting women as these spoiled privileged brats who are entitled to leave everybody else miserable while they find themselves. And the people they destroy both mentally and emotionally still understand that their torturer is just finding herself. These movies continue to portray hurtful and harmful behavior as a spiritual awakening. Julia Roberts plays the role of a spoiled arrogant brat who is full of herself. After her jaunt to India maybe she wants to go join the other vapid female crew over in Dubai for a walk in the desert with no water.In typical romcom fashion we have the arrogant female who leaves a trail of emotional wreckage in her wake which we're supposed to discount completely as a sacrifice to the greater good of the female while she searches the world for hippies food and lovers. We have these sorry sack men who continue to tell her how great and special she is although she is the complete opposite of these things. We have arrogance and selfishness put on display and covered with a false veil of gold. This woman should be in court losing 12 of all her earnings to her husband whom she left to go whore about for no good reason. This woman should be the scourge of the Earth and should receive social contempt for her behavior. However like most romcoms the female can hurt everyone she knows if it will aid her superficial quest for some kind of make believe fulfillment and then like Stockholm Syndrome all her victims will forgive her or tell her she is the most important thing in the world and her happiness comes before anybody or anything else. I can't believe men are still depicted as the heartless characters in films when every romcom depicts evil as good.This movie made me cringe. I was forced to see it with mom sister and wife. I told them all that the film literally made me sick. They agreed. This sort of behavior that is being engendered into women is sickening. Women who believe such a film represents anything positive about anything need to have their head checked for borderline personality disorder. Men need to stop treating women like little precious pieces of glass when those same women are not pieces of glass are not these cute little powerless creatures but are instead like Liz in the movie arrogant snotty pampered privileged rude morally bankrupt conniving selfish dolts who believe that their superficial happiness is worth any emotional cost to other people.".

I read another review that questioned why this is even a movie. My thoughts exactly. At one point in the movie Julia Robert's character Liz asks another character if he always speaks in bumper sticker. I was thinking that about the entire movie almost right from the start. The only thing that got me through it was that I am an optimist and kept thinking it would get better. Some of the views were beautiful but there were moments when the camera was spinning around so much I was almost nauseous. So to sum it up in Italy I wasn't watching Liz learn to enjoy nourishment I was wondering who was going to do all the dishes. And in India I wasn't watching Liz learn to pray I was wondering why she was praying to a picture frame of her exlover's guru. When she finally gets to Bali I thought maybe the movie would gain substance. Instead Liz jumps on a boat with a guy who was a little heavy handed in the control department because her guru gave her permission. In my opinion there was no attraversi for poor Liz. The only crossover she made was across the Atlantic.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've kept up with my reviews lets pretend you have you are going to find that the genre I touch most seldom is the romantic comedy. They are by nature a contagious quagmire of failed puns roads repaved with familiar plots and their stars have signed with the devil. Enter Julia Roberts queen of the romcom. No doubt a talented actress if not the most famous of her generation Julia has played a big role in cashing in on the average woman's dream.In her latest effort Julia plays Liz Gilbert in the autobiographical book turned movie Eat Pray Love. Liz is a writer visiting Bali in search of a wisetoothless medicine man. He reads the palm of her hand and she takes everything to gospel. Leaving behind husband Stephen Billy Crudup Liz seeks out new adventure in the form of exotic cuisine Eastern religion and male suitors.Eat Pray Love is directed by Ryan Murphy. Murphy is best known as the creator of Glee last year's breakout TV show about misfits who triumph through song. With his name in the mix people are going to be disappointed that Julia and friends don't break out into song and dance. Even if you consider that Murphy could have interests outside of musicals you'd expect some sassy dialog exchanges like those seen on the show between the characters Will Schuester and Sue Sylvester. Hate to disappoint you but that's not going to happen either.Julia Roberts is a darling despite the degrading material and I'm sure the draw of her chowing down will appeal to the target demographic until they realize that phase is left behind once Liz leaves Italy. If this were the story of a woman looking for the best things in life I wouldn't take as much issue as I do. See that's how one half of the population would view the plot. I see it more along the lines of a typical entry in the long catalog of films where the female lead has no idea what she's looking for in her life so she does whatever is irrational and fun because that's how movie magic works. Liz throws out a man who has given the viewer no reason for dismissal but this is standard procedure in a chick flick because here woman can do anything and their lives will always improve. I've encountered far too many girls who take these plots to heart and implement them in the real world leaving a trail of confused men in their wake. I'm a guy and I'm not dumb enough to think that all the explosions I see in the films designed for my gender need to be realized at home.What Eat Pray Love has going for it is a borderline competency that lifts it slightly above film festival rejects. Actually the presence of Alist talent and obvious travel expenses add more to the production value than any cinematic technique on display. Many scenes are littered with mishandled lights resulting in a glaucoma simulation that gave me a headache. It's even a tossup as to whether or not to anoint the audio as clear since half of Javier Bardem's dialog would be read as inaudible should one rent the Bluray down the road and turn on subtitles. Speaking of Bardem his character's late appearance goes against every screen writing rule. In fact it felt like I was two hours into Eat Pray Love before I started to question whether or not I had seen him in the TV spots. There is so little of consequence taking place that I don't understand why this is a movie. Plenty of books have plots that don't equate into a twohour film and many of those actually have tension. Liz's only conflict is from her own sociopath concepts. She's established early on as a poor playwright highly gullible and dare I say spoiled. These are not desirable traits. It's amazing how easily everyone accepts Liz. Italy India and Indonesia extend nothing but open arms and everyone who she turns to for advise is essentially the same character with the one exception being Richard from Texas Richard Jenkinsthe sole character that doesn't seem to exist for Liz's personal amusement. I haven't seen such a patronizing boring alleged comedy in years. Eat Pray Love is a marathon that will surely test any burgeoning relationship and possibly cause a divorce. Girls if your male friend can stomach this you've either found an idiot or a liar. Pray for mercy.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you've kept up with my reviews lets pretend you have you are going to find that the genre I touch most seldom is the romantic comedy. They are by nature a contagious quagmire of failed puns roads repaved with familiar plots and their stars have signed with the devil. Enter Julia Roberts queen of the romcom. No doubt a talented actress if not the most famous of her generation Julia has played a big role in cashing in on the average woman's dream.In her latest effort Julia plays Liz Gilbert in the autobiographical book turned movie Eat Pray Love. Liz is a writer visiting Bali in search of a wisetoothless medicine man. He reads the palm of her hand and she takes everything to gospel. Leaving behind husband Stephen Billy Crudup Liz seeks out new adventure in the form of exotic cuisine Eastern religion and male suitors.Eat Pray Love is directed by Ryan Murphy. Murphy is best known as the creator of Glee last year's breakout TV show about misfits who triumph through song. With his name in the mix people are going to be disappointed that Julia and friends don't break out into song and dance.

We develop a sort of craving to see them again. So a new Julia Roberts movie? Sure. Absolutely. I'm only a few years younger than Julia Roberts which means we have grown together. So to see her play a woman facing a sort of middle age crisis makes you look inwards with a smile the nervous kind. I must also say I'm a guy heterosexual but not fanatically so. I don't have the fears that Jay Leno for instance shows when confronted by a chick flick If anything Eat Pray Love proves that men and women are not that far apart we simply deal with the same problems in different ways. Here the filmmakers don't shy away from the conflict and the balance is real. Julia's husband played beautifully by Billy Crudup accuses her of leaving the marriage without an explanation. He is the one with the broken heart. In Italy Julia eats and our own gastric juices start to do their thing. I glanced at my watch I was ready to run into the nearest Italian restaurant and have a relationship with a pizza myself. Italy Rome and even Naples look so clean that I hardly recognized it. CGI? Luca Argentero plays Julia's tutortourist guide. He is a good looking guy that after appearing in the Italian version of the Big Brother reality show he became a sort of local movie star and shows promising acting chops. Here strangely enough he looks small but charming all the same. India brings the wonderful Richard Jenkins and a solid piece of advise don't give up on love Bali well Bali is something else and it is there that Javier Bardem comes into the picture and provides us with the best scene in the film. I'm not going to tell you what it is but let me just say that involves his son and gives us finally a side of Julia we didn't know how much we missed. Empathy. Feeling something for somebody else's feelings. I think I may see the film a second time just to see that scene again. I also should mention that James Franco plays a young actor  not what I call a stretch  considering he is my favorite of the young actors around. I will challenge other members of my sex to go and see it. Not to be afraid to feel identified or even chocked up. I can assure you it's not going to diminish you manliness in any way and will awake your appetites big time.".

There are plenty of movies center in such topics. For instance Baraka for landscapes or los lunes al sol for Javier Bardem. It is not fair for other movies put more than one star just for such things. I watched the movie in a travel so I should watch. About the half running time I was very upset for spending time is such garbage. I agree with all the bad reviews I've read. I really hope all the women do not believe that is the way to start and look for inner quest. How does she do to pay all the traveling? That was the first I thought when I saw it. There is no reference to the expensive that is. I hope at least one real reason to break her marriage. Even is good to be selfish this is excessive. And the male characters Are stupid or what? They are so perfect so soft. Do really is the way of men that women think should be. It feels like really bad soup opera. The mystic characters try to do something for the story but the movie is so focused in Julia's that they vanish. It is also a presumption of movie I haven't read the book but it seen like there in all those beautiful places just because they can. It a sample of spend money just because they have it. Why not to use in a better proposal. I could try to describe all the characters but it is a waste. I just tell the end this modern woman having left behind her comfort life including her marriage with a really good husband with no apparent reason but her feminism finds herself with another excellent man.

I liked them the characters not the antics.Basically Liz has a very nice life that is already pretty exciting. She's a writer in NYC who sometimes travels for her job. Her perfectly nice husband appears to love her a lot thinks about issues like public education and is interested in going back to school for an MA.It just isn't enough for Liz though.She ditches her husband has an affair and speeds off to Italy as soon as the divorce is finalized. She eats. She goes to India where she finds her exboyfriend's guru and prays. She goes to Bali where she eventually falls in love.Everywhere she goes to the very end Liz needs constant validation and guidance from others. She doesn't grow as a person she just sees a bunch of stuff and meets a bunch of people.The movie is too long but Italy India and Bali are showcased nicely if superficially. I bet Julia Roberts signed on because filming this must have basically been a paid vacation.The script is pretty bad. Liz complains that one character always seems to talk in bumper stickers but she should look at her own speech patterns.I could see how this movie would appeal to some people as an escapist fantasy  every once in a while most people think about pushing the eject button on their life and doing something completely different. Still the impulsivedecision lifechanging journey of selfdiscovery is a common movie type and others have done it far far better.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film fully deserving to be in IMDb's top 250 Jim Sheridan's In The Name of the Father is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon DayLewis who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family including his father Giuseppe Postlethwaithe whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one however as they start to go through the ordeal together Gerry gradually matures and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.The story is heartbreaking and shocking at the same time all the more so when one realizes that these things actually DID happen. Although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film the backbone of the story is left completely intact.The two protagonists Daniel DayLiewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances and they both deserved the Oscar handsdown. However it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in hisher role.Jim Sheridan's direction is also very good giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective although the film might initially appear as proIrish  antiEnglish in fact I consider it as quite objective. Granted it vividly shows that some key figures in the London police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the Conlons yet it also shows that English public attitudes turned highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. We have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions with emotions running high to levels of hysteria so we have to understand the events within this context.Of course what happened to the Conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. Still one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy such as the judge for example who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. The Conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place in the wrong time and with the wrong nationality the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent.In the Name of the Father is a fantastic film which one should not miss. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gerry Conlon is a small time Belfast thief who gets excluded from Northern Ireland by the IRA for antisocial behaviour and goes to live in England with his old school friend Paul Hill. They are in London when the mainland bombing campaign becomes more intense and they are both picked up for the bombing despite their claims of innocence. After more than week of beatings abuse and threats the two men break and sign confessions longing for the beatings to stop and hoping the courts would see through the lies. However they are found guilty and along with other relatives sentenced to time ranging from 14 years to life. As time goes on Gerry and his father campaign for their case to be reopened until eventually the lawyer Gareth Pierce takes up the case.I came to this film having not seen it since its release in the early 90's at which time I was still living in Northern Ireland in a mostly Protestant area. Given the subject matter the film was well received in this area. I decided to rewatch the film last night so that I could review it for this site and since first seeing it I have actually more of an insight on the subject matter since I had been held without charge under the same legislation that held the Guildford Four and had been taken to court twice before the charges were entirely dropped. I say this not as some claim to having a more valid opinion than anyone else but simply as a counter to those who will accuse me of being biased on the basis of being a Protestant.While I can see myself that the majority of reviews here for this film are slanted and full of political bias I will attempt to keep my review as free of this as I can either one way or another.Despite the fact that the film leaves out glaring facts none of these facts actually affect the film's main thrust  that these men were for this crime unjustly accused tried and convicted. The facts that are ignored are those which would have made the film a bit more complex eg Hill's membership of the IRA and I can understand why the makers decided to just make the subject as clean cut as they could and not present the audience with anything that may cause them to be in any doubt about what they are meant to be feeling. I can understand why they did it  but that does not make it right and I would have welcomed a more complex film because those of us from Northern Ireland know that nothing is ever as simply as rightwrong blackwhite  but Hollywood is not there to inform but to entertain and hence the facts get lost on the road to a good film. And it is a good film.It is frustrating that people take what it tells them as fact but this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a well made engaging and quite moving film. Regardless of political beliefs the idea of a justice system that would do this is interesting and worrying to me and the film does a good job albeit it overegged of letting us see the extent that the police went to to get if not 'their man' then at least 'a man'. The film does well to deliver characters although simplified that are easy to get behind and they helped me get involved in a story that was already pretty involving in its own right. The direction feels professional and injects enough emotion and sense of anger into the film to give it a solid sense of pace without it ever really tipping over into sentimentality or out and out preachingranting. Of course the material also helps from a great cast that deliver well and do their bit to keep it edgy and not sentimental.DayLewis is a very good actor and he does well here making his Gerry go through the stages of being a cheeky young man frightened shellshocked defeated angry and then driven without us ever thinking he is a different character. If anything it is a shame that the film did paint his character so clean because I think DayLewis could have easily handled the moral complexities that would have come with that territory. Postlewaite is the real emotional heart of the film in many ways and he does very well with a role that could easily have been cloying and sentimental  but Postlewaite plays it straight till the end. Thompson is all too simple and upright and her performance is little more than a cameo this is made worse by the fact that the vast majority of English people are biased and corrupt according to the film  again like leaving facts out just an attempt by the film to simplify things to make the audiences' emotions clearer and stronger.Overall I like this film but it is not a perfect piece of cinema nor should it be taken as the whole story. The film has dropped facts and directed its presentation to ensure that we the audience are in no doubt over what we should be feeling and thinking throughout. This does not change the message of the film or the injustice of the things that happened but it doesn't do justice to the alwayscomplicated situation that is my country. The film as a film is very good  well acted well paced well directed and engaging from the early realistic shots of Belfast in the 1970's through to the 'I'm going out the front door' finale that is no less impacting for us knowing it is coming.".

Instead of blaring political bias viewers are treated to a compassionate human drama without the preachings and irritating banter of most other social dramas Dog Day Afternoon All the President's Men Norma Rae. It's shameful that this film didn't receive at least two academy awards despite it having been nominated for 7. Now considering that this was the same year that Schindler's List and The Piano two outstanding dramas were released it isnt surprising nor unreasonable that they beat In the Name of the Father for many of the awards.The acting in this film is terrific. Lewis is low key and quite effective as the petty Irish thief Gerry Conlon. Pete Postlethwaite is spectacular as Gerry's father Guiseppe certainly better than oscar winner tommy lee jones was in the fugitive. Emma Thompson's portrayal of attorney Gareth Pierce received much acclaim and properly so. Beatie Edney who had a small part as a wrongfully accused British teenage hippie was so enamoring that its a wonder we don't see more of her.Of course much of this film is exagerrated and perhaps fabricated for the purposes of entertainment as all movies which are based on a true story tend to be but it's so finely done that it doesn't seem to matter. Some terrific scenes include the beginning when Gerry and his friends are chased by British soldiers after being mistaken for IRA snipers the trial in London the prison scenes which expose the loneliness and honesty of the characters rather than the crude violence and gang rapes of so many other pathetic prison movies and of course the powerful ending where the marvelous dramatic talents of all the actors are evinced in a final crescendo. Be sure to see this film if you haven't it will definitely stir your emotions and renew your faith in the human spirit. And for those who eschew political films give it a try anyways the acting and craftiness outweigh the civic themes.".

	schema:headline " Terrorism hurts everyone.";
	schema:reviewBody "In watching this fine film on idea kept running though my mind. That being terrorism often hurts the innocent much more than the declared enemy. In the Name of the Father is a powerful wellacted drama about terrorism and injustice. And also the love one man feels for his father. Some of the events in this film are factual and others are not. Despite some liberties taken with history the film still makes a strong point however.Daniel DayLewis plays Gerry Conlon a young man falsely accused along with several other friends and family members of bombing a London pub in 1974. The bombing performed by the IRA killed a few persons and wounded several others. Conlon and his friends just happen to be near by when the bombing takes place. Through police torture Conlon and his best friend confess to the crime thinking a trial will exonerate them. Trouble is there had been so many recent bombings that the legal system in Britain was just crying out for a scapegoat. Conlon and four friends are given life sentences. Several members of Conlon's family are also given stiff jail sentences. Even his own father who seems to be the most righteous and kind person imaginable and who never set foot in England at all during the time of the bombing!The film starts out like a shot from a cannon as we see just how violent and chaotic Blefast was during the early seventies. Just living a normal life looked impossible. If the British troops weren't after you then the IRA members were. The film also scores when we see Conlon head off to London to presumably make a better life for himself. He and a friend force themselves into a commune and enjoy a brief period of free love and decadence. The film gets very heavy once Conlon is arrested and tortured. And the last hour detailing his time behind bars is just plain somber. We watch his father just sort of waste away with him behind bars while an aggressive lawyer Emma Thompson fights to get them out. Pete Postletwaite is exceptional as Gerry's father and seeing him grow sicker and weak is very difficult for the viewer. The film tries to shift gears down the stretch and show how Conlon has become determined and more radicalized but these scenes are nothing spectacular. Even the conclusion seems a little anticlimatic but at least we see some justice finally get done. The acting is very very good. Lewis is as good as ever and nobody looks out of their league. There are some historical liberties taken. Gerry and his father never actually lived in the same cell for instance. Overall this film will stick with you though.In watching this film one cannot help but feel for the victims of terrorism. I have personally not much knowledge of the conflict between the IRA and Britain except to say that I'm well aware of how long and deep the scars run between the English and Irish peoples. That said there is simply no excuse for terrorism. Look at how many victims that pub bombing created. Not only those who perished or were injured. That act of terror sent several innocent people to jail and ruined their lives! The British legal system is certainly to blame for sending the wrong people to jail but would this have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests! Will we ever all learn to get along on this planet?8 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

When Conlon returned to Belfast in December 1974 he did drunkenly mention to IRA acquaintances in pubs that hed met Hill in England and in order to punish Hill for his suspected crimes against the organisation and to take the heat off their own cells active in Britain at the time it was the IRA themselves who deliberately leaked the false information to the intelligence services about Conlon and Hill being involved in the Guilford bombings  not as the film shows a jealous boyfriend .

	schema:headline " Disquieting great film";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie is based on a true story. Belfast guy Gerry Conlon is suspected of being one of the IRA terrorists responsible for a bomb in Guilford London in 1974 which killed several people. He spends 15 years in jail fighting for his innocence and for truth.After working with Daniel Day Lewis in My left foot director Jim Sheridan teams again with the actor for this drama. The strong cast is completed by Emma Thomson and Pete Postlewaite. The result is a brilliant passionate feature which tells about injustice.

	schema:headline " In the Name of the Father and of the Son";
	schema:reviewBody "Although considerable liberties have been taken with historical facts this film is based upon true events. In 1974 an IRA bomb in a pub in Guildford England killed several people. Four young Irish people the Guildford Four were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Several others the Maguire Seven were convicted of assisting them and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. All were innocent of this crime and were later exonerated and released from prison when fresh evidence was discovered particularly evidence that their confessions had been obtained under duress.Although all the main characters are Catholics some devout some only nominally so the title does not have any real religious significance. Rather it alludes to the film's central relationship that between Gerry Conlon one of the Four and his father Giuseppe one of the Seven. The two are very different. Gerry is a wild and rebellious young man unemployed a petty criminal and a druguser. He wears his hair long something fashionable in the early seventies but often regarded by the older generation as the sign of a hooligan. Giuseppe by contrast is a conservative figure deeply religious hardworking lawabiding and honest.A key moment comes when Gerry recalls a football match in which he played as a boy. His team won but instead of congratulating him on his victory Giuseppe reproached his son for a foul committed during the match. This encapsulates the difference in their characters. For Gerry winning and success are all that matters. Because he has achieved little success he has no faith in himself and has always drifted through life. For Giuseppe adherence to moral values is more important than achieving outward success and it is these values which enable him to retain his selfrespect. Because of these differences in character and outlook the two men's relationship is a difficult one. Beneath their differences however they also have a deep love for one another Gerry is persuaded to confess to the bombing after the police have failed to obtain a confession through bullying and violence by the threat that his father will be killed if he does not. Later Gerry's love for his father is strengthened by the realisation that although the older man is physically frail his religious faith and selfbelief enable him to cope with the injustice of his plight.Daniel DayLewis has been much praised for his performance as Gerry and he was certainly good if at times too showy. For me however the real star was Pete Postlethwaite as the longsuffering but dignified Giuseppe. The strongest scenes were those between Gerry and Giuseppe the weakest were those when Gerry in prison befriends Joe McAndrew an IRA man who claims actually to have planted the Guildford bomb. McAndrew is an invented character and psychologically this did not seem likely Gerry was after all as much a victim of the bomb as those killed and injured by it. Had there been no bomb there could have been no conviction wrongful or otherwise for planting it. Moreover by associating himself with the IRA's cause even temporarily Gerry although legally innocent makes himself seem morally guilty.There were other things that did not ring true. I was unsure why Giuseppe's lawyer thought that Inspector Dixon the policeman who originally investigated the crime would be responsible for deciding whether her ailing client should receive compassionate parole or why so much attention was paid to Gerry's alibi that he was in London on the night of the bombing. As the bomb would have had a delayedaction timer he could easily have returned before it exploded the Horse and Groom pub I used to live in Guildford is only a short walk from the station about half an hour by train from London. The brutal and corrupt Dixon is another invented character the name may refer ironically to the popular British TV show Dixon of Dock Green which featured an honest and decent bobby named Dixon.It surprises me that some have criticised the film as being proIRA. If one were setting out to make a proIRA propaganda film one would not make it about the Guildford bombing an event in which the IRA coldbloodedly murdered several innocent civilians without warning. Nor does the film ignore the IRA's violence towards the Irish Catholic community it supposedly represents. At the time of the Guildford bombing Gerry is living in London having been forced to flee Northern Ireland by IRA threats like most terrorist organisations it has a sternly moralistic attitude to all crimes other than those committed by its own members and punishes with mediaeval severity those who like Gerry are guilty of petty larcenies. The fact that the Four and the Seven were undoubtedly treated unjustly by the British authorities does not retrospectively justify the IRA's crimes of which they were wrongly accused.The film does not attempt to be a comprehensive statement about the Northern Ireland situation the Unionist community for example is not even mentioned. Indeed given the complexities of that situation and the even greater complexities of Irish history from which it springs it would not be possible to make such a statement in a film. Nevertheless In the Name of the Father is a very good film both as a study of fatherson relationships and as a warning of the possibilities for injustice inherent in any criminal justice system. 710 A goof. In the early scenes set in 1974 Gerry while driving along London's Lower Thames Street passes a set of orange and white barriers designed to stop vehicles from entering The City London's central financial district. These barriers did not exist in 1974 they were erected following a later IRA bombing campaign".

It still remains very impressive and the idea that injustice in the name of protecting the country should be allowed is awful and so it is good that at least some movie makers aren't afraid to protest against it.The movie tells the story about Gerry Conlon and his old school friend Paul Hill. They both are small time criminals and because of their own safety they have to live in London for a while. Otherwise they might get shot by the IRA. In London they stay in a community of hippies but aren't welcomed by everybody. As a bomb explodes in a pub one of the members from the community goes to the police and accuses them of the crime. They are immediately apprehended together with Conlon's father his aunt and her family. What follows is a process full of corruption and false accusations putting them in jail for many years even though they haven't done anything wrong.The film is very good.

Shawshank is a great film but Name of the Father has more of human story to it.   Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor with more potential now than he did when he won his first Oscar for My Left Foot and since then he has never starred in a film which he has acted badly in.  Some of the stories have not been amazing but his acting makes up for it.   This was the second time That Daniel Day Lewis and Jim Sheridan have come together to make a film. In all they have done three but Name of the father is by far the best.   Pete Postlethwaite is another example of fine acting as he is the best actor in England since who ever was the last greatest actor.Daniel Day Lewis plays Gerry Conlon who is a seventies hippie who doesn't want to grow up.   He has had so many troubles at home his fatherGiuseppe  played by Postlethwaite decides to pack him off to London for his own safety and not become a lost soul amongst the troubles in Belfast. But when Gerry gets there he might as well wish he never went there in the first place as the trouble from Belfast follows him and before you know it a bomb goes off in a pub near to where he is staying and is not long arrested for the bomb along with his friends and family including his father.From there we are taken into this grieving story of strength hope tragedy and family. The story between father and son in jail is more touching and compelling than any love story you will ever see because these two men who have never really seen eye to eye are forced to confront each other's feeling and face up to where they stand in the world.   Also Pete Postlewaite reminds me of my own father and my grandfather and yours two. He plays Giuseppe so well so would have thought he was the old guy living next door to you or the man you look up to as a father and spend time with as a granddad.   What you have to remind yourself is that the movie is a true story of the Guilford Bombing and the men who paid the price for it. Whether or not you believe Gerry and Giuseppe were guilty of the Guilford Bomb is not the case in the film as it's more about the characters and there trials and tribulations.One film that will always be remembered in my mind about making a difference with your life not matter where you are in the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jim Sheridan's astonishingly fantastic 'In the Name of the Father' tells the brutally direct story of a wrongfully accused family who are tortured into making a false confession and imprisoned by the British justice system. Sheridan has a way of telling his stories where he gets straight to the point and does not fear to show the reality of the situation while keeping us viewers at the edge of our seats. The film is based on Gerry Conlan's autobiography where Daniel DayLewis plays the central character. Sheridan effectively portrays Gerry and Giuseppe's struggle and fight against injustice and his portrayal of the corrupt British justice system is frightening. Just the idea that people could get away with such things in a country like the UK is chilling and Sheridan skillfully brings that across on screen. Terry George's brilliant screenplay with rich characters and solid dialogues forms a good backbone for the film. I also liked how the humour was infused in a modest dose as not to interfere with the intensity of the story. There are some excellent performances. Daniel DayLewis delivers a suitably explosive performance as he breathes fire into the role while Pete Postlethwaite is sublime and equally outstanding as Gerry's father Giuseppe. Though father and son do have issues to fight over it is Giuseppe who is Gerry's conscience and Postlethwaite's heartbreaking act really touches the heart. Emma Thompson holds her own and she is simply excellent. The rest of the cast do a superb job watch out for Tom Wilkinson in a bit role. The soundtrack fits the mood of the film and the cinematography is good especially in the prison sequences where it creates that feeling of claustrophobia which gets stronger after Gerry is alone in his cell. I have liked all of Sheridan's ' films that I have seen so far and 'In The Name Of The Father' is another remarkable film from this fine director. It is a difficult movie to watch due to some disturbing themes and scenes though most of them are rather suggestive it is the idea behind that sends chills down the spine but it is definitely worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "'In the Name of the Father' is a compelling portrayal of the harrowing ordeal faced by Gerry Conlon his family and friends who were wrongfully imprisoned for the Guildford Pub bombing in the 1970s. The film is skilfully manipulated to show a myriad of contrasts and juxtapositions such as when Gerry is being tortured and interrogated in his cell the police in the hallway are unconcerned as they celebrate someone's birthday with a cake.The framing of shots and camera angles used emphasise the helplessness Gerry and the others experience. There is also a particularly moving scene in which prisoners show their respect when Gerry's father dies by dropping flaming material from their windows like a waterfall of burning tears.The soundtrack uses music which is carefree or haunting in all the right places perfectly mirroring the scenes and adding to the mood of the film. The themes of injustice and corruption are heightened through irony in the dialogue and are representative of the problems faced by Irish Catholics in the 1970s and beyond.'In the Name of the Father' is a beautifully constructed film which is a credit to the actors direction and production crew.I challenge you not to be moved by this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's 1974. The IRA bombs a pub in Guildford England. Gerry Conlon Daniel DayLewis is an aimless petty thief. His father Giuseppe Pete Postlethwaite is a straightarrow softspoken man. He and his friend Paul Hill John Lynch are in London staying with hippies. They leave the flat when the pub bombing happens. A prostitute drops her keys and Gerry breaks in. The parliament passes the Prevention of Terrorism Act which allows for suspects to be held for 7 days. Gerry Paul and others are arrested and coerced into false confessions. Giuseppe and other relatives are also implicated. The actual bomber Joe McAndrew Don Baker is arrested and tells the police. However the police refuses to admit its mistake. Gerry befriends Joe in prison while ignoring the peaceful faith of his father. Joe becomes the leader of the prison as Giuseppe declines in health. British attorney Gareth Peirce Emma Thompson works to free the falsely imprisoned. After Joe burns the lead guard Gerry saves him and turns on Joe.This is a meticulous telling of a compelling life wrongly convicted. It's a bit up and down at times. The first trial is not the most compelling. The results are preordained and not that compelling. The most compelling is the father son relationship. When Joe get into the middle it's a great turn in the story. These are two great performances from Daniel DayLewis and Pete Postlethwaite. The two of them in prison is a terrific movie filled with emotions and character growth. The final court case is theatrical as heck.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do not see this film as being political nonsense at all.Rather it serves as a warning of what can happen when blanket stereotyping is allowed to influence the course of justice.As Gareth Peirce impressively portrayed by the excellent Emma Thompson points out the only reason Giueseppe Conlon and Co were tried in the first place was on the shaky premise that they were bloody well Irish. As Irish people living in England in the 1970s they must therefore have been terrorists.Logical?I thought not.The authorities never thought for a second that they might actually have been trying to escape that nonsense through carving out a new life for themselves in England.With a British public baying for blood the police capitulated by picking up the first paddies they found and making an example of them without making any serious efforts to root out the real perpetrators and ensuring they were rendered incapable of causing more harm through doling out lengthy imprisonments to them as opposed to ruining the lives of an innocent family.Ironically of course such actions could well have served to make terrorist sympathisers out of the Conlons through the horrific treatment meted out to them!It didn't of course but there is always the danger in that type of case that a person could become embittered to that extent.Obviously given the unstable climate of the time Irish people in England were sometimes regarded with suspicionyet the fact remains that the events portrayed in the film were unacceptable in a supposed western democracy committed to the rule of law.While neither side was entirely innocent the fact remains that England was undeniably culpable in this instance and the judiciary involved in the case must bear full responsibilty for the devestating effects of their kneejerk ruling given to appease an irrational and hysterical public.In this respect the Conlons and Co can viably be seen by some as Irish martyrs. While I am no fan of Hollywood fare which seeks to glamourise Irish terrorists at the expense of England who is invariably portrayed as the cold and unrelenting oppressor inaccurate and unfair in the present day I feel I strongly believe that in this case the criticism and negative portrayal of the English legal system is justified to a considerable extent.The film has especial resonance and significance for us today in the wake of alQuaeda and the resultant perceptions of Muslims as a whole as being the enemy in certain quarters.The recent incarceration of an innocent Syrian who had lived his entire adult life in Canada and who was imprisoned purely on the basis of his ethnicity only serves to remind us of the perils of judging a book by its cover and making snap judgements a danger which is admirably illustrated in this wellacted film.".

While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed well written and executed the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon  Daniel DayLewis a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon Pete Postlethwaite a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce Emma Thompson.The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests torture trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel DayLewis is reliable as ever playing a reallife character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite".

	schema:reviewBody "An emotionally wrenching and immensely powerful true story of an innocent man who is put in prison for fifteen years after being forced by interrogators to sign a confession out of the threat that they'd kill his father if he didn't and this man's fight to clear his name and his father's. Due to an incident with the IRA Gerry Conlon Daniel DayLewis moves to London and after a chance opportunity to rob a prostitute he returns to his home in Belfast coincidentally the day after a huge bombing committed by the IRA in London. His best friend who was with him that night Paul Hill is arrested and after being forced to confess with a gun in his mouth he lists Conlon and two other friends as members of the IRA. Now known as the Guildford Four these innocent people were all sentenced to very lengthy jail sentences and after painful torture the government plants false accusations on members of Conlons' family including his father Giuseppe Pete Postlethwaite. Gerry has to deal with pentup aggression that he has built up against his father for years while also trying to survive in a British prison as an accused IRA member.Even after Joe McAndrew Don Baker is arrested and confesses to the police that he was behind the Guildford bombing and the people they have in prison were innocent Gerry and Giuseppe remain in prison suffering more and more by the day. Eventually Giuseppe begins working with Gareth Pierce Emma Thompson to investigate their case and prove the innocence of the Conlons and the other members of the Guildford Four. After Giuseppe dies of natural causes Gerry gains a new drive to prove their innocence and takes over the task of working with Gareth. The film is a powerful character study of a man put under unimaginable circumstances and has the discipline to rise up and along with Pierce prove the innocence of not only himself but of his father and the other three members of the Guildford Four. It's an immensely heartwrenching emotional story that had me in tears several times throughout.Highlighting this sensational film is Daniel DayLewis who further proves that he is the greatest actor of all time and delivers what I believe is the best performance of his career. Taking on the role of Gerry Conlon requires the ability to subtly flow from a naive immature young man to a disciplined adult working to clear the name of his father. Along that journey there are several highly emotional scenes that could have felt melodramatic or silly if another actor were portraying the man but DayLewis brings a power to Conlon that no one else could. His brilliance is unparalleled. Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson also deliver fantastic performances that rank among the best of the 90s. In the Name of the Father is a phenomenal film that studies the torture that one man had to go through due to the government and the journey he took to clear his name and the name of his father. It's the best film of 1993 in my eyes and DayLewis' portrayal is very high among the best performances of all time.".

This is Gerry Conlon  the Guildford 4's story.This is real powerful stuff that thankfully is directed with careful hands. Director Jim Sheridan is equal in his demonizing of the police and the IRA here because it's crucial for us to focus on the Guildford 4. Focus on the Conlon family for they are victims of injustice when they have no political or nationalistic affiliations. He centres in on the relationship between Gerry  his father Guiseppe as they find themselves both wrongly imprisoned. It's that family heartbeat that drives this film on and it's testament to the makers talents that it never comes across as maudlin it's all very potent and is the films major axis point.Based on a true story the picture has a finale that will not surprise anyone but come the last reel you feel emotionally drained you have come thru the mangler and myself personally felt both joy and anger in equal measure. Containing brilliant performances from Pete Postelthwaite  Daniel Day Lewis as father  son Conlon respectively In The Name of The Father is a truly great film that demands not only your head but also your heart. 910".

My favorite part has to be the musical production number at the end. I thought it was a fun scene for him to go out with. Yes Peter Sellers has made much better films. And if this weren't his last his fans would probably dislike it a lot less. This movie isn't funny in a slapsticky kind of way. It's funny because it's such an unusual mix of comedy and adventure. I think it's a cult classic waiting to be rediscovered. And remember Peter Sellars was warned by doctors not to do this movie. His poor health was in part a result of his insistence of doing all of his own stuntwork. If fans really respect Seller's dedication to his craft they will appreciate the fact that he nearly killed himself doing what he liked to do best  playing an eccentric characters like this. So why not honer the actor by watching his final screen performance? Allow yourself to forget all about Peter Seller's other work and let his portrayal here stand on it's own.

No it is not greatest project by Peter Sellers that would be A shot in the Dark but whoa is it funny and a bit nonPC.It pokes fun at Caucasian actors playing Asian characters....and about every B movie ever made. If you like MST3K you might want to take a look since it is for fans of satire.My favorite line is The yellow fiends have stolen delight You will have to watch the movie I am not going to spoil that.";

A gentle spoof of all of those Fu Manchu films over the yearsand frankly better than many of them It contained many of the hallmarks of Sellers films such as playing multiple roles Fu Manchu and nemesis Nayland Smith Using comic actors of similar stripe Sid Caesar reuniting with Bert Kwouk his manservant in many of the Pink Panther movies. This was also the farewell film of actor David Tomlinson and John Le Messeur both of whom retired from films after this. The movie is a fun romp with a mix of the absurd slapstick and the witty dialog of the characters. One of my favorite lines happens after a line of dacoit assassins appear in front of Fu Manchu and he says you can't fool me with a cheap cinematic trick. This was very fitting farewell to a great comic genius.".

THAT'S where this film belongs.It's VERY British and enters that whole territory that includes One of our Dinosaurs is Missing The Magic Christian Peter Cook's Hound of the Baskervilles The Adventure of Sherlock Holmses Smarter Brother and their ilk. Not a bad thing really but perhaps a minority taste. These tend to play more like extended TV sketch shows and tend not to appeal to the majority. I mean.. flying houses?!My irritation is the addition of Sid Caeser and Steve Franken.. WHY??? Merely to make the film sellable to the US one would imagine! They serve no purpose at all.  They come across as caracture Americans.. shooting at plants and the like!And oh boy...Helen Mirren as PC Rage.. just TOO much!! The Lady of Warrington Minge!! It's very Goonlike in terms of plot and characterisation David Tomlinson as Neddie Simon Willams as Bluebottle Sellers as Colonal Bloodnok.... but it DOES lack Milligan's edge and drive. Descendants of this film include The Crimson Permanant Insurance...What about the scene with FIVE sets of the King and Queen in the theatre box?? Hysterical...Make no mistake though....this is a vehicle for Sellers and his characters. Sellers is in top form as the bonkers but delightfully deadpan Nayland Smith and his .... attachment to a lawnmower! and the evil Fu Manchu.. Hello boys!.... He's Dr Evil before the fact! More impeccable characters. It is in fact quite gutting to see how much he still had to give just before his death and one does wonder what would follow given his huge profile after the completion of Being There his pet project for nearly 10 years.So there you have..... my attempt to balance things a bit. If you wants fullon Hollywood Sellers.. go see the Panthers. But maybe you'd like to have a closer look at Sellers the comic actor in a pearl of the British comedy. His last.".

Sellers also makes several little nudges to the audience when his dialog speaks about the movie.  Sure there are several dumb bits but I think that the good parts greatly outweigh them. The movie while with some Panther feeling seems to be stretching a little toward Python and away from Stooges slapstick.  There's something else I recently picked upon and that's its early 70s feeling or late 60s although it was made in 1980.If you're looking for something a little dumb and silly but that a person with a little extra brain would pick out the extra bits in this is a pretty good movie.".

I could go on and on but you know what I mean. In at least 90 of cases a movie will get a bad review simply because it is NOT the movie the viewer was expecting. This movie is a case in point. It's a spoof. For some unknown reason 98 of the world's population cannot usually digest spoofs. Why this is so has been studied since the year dot and no one has come up with a convincing answer. My personal feeling is that people react negatively because they feel that they themselves andor the values they hold dear are under attack. This would explain why a few spoofs have proved very successful like Bob Hope's Paleface 1948 in which noone was actually under attack  except film makers of course and they don't count! Getting back to this Fiendish Plot I found it hilariously entertaining. True it does run out of steam before the climax comes around  I thought that climax was just too ridiculous to be funny  but there are many marvelous moments along the way thanks mostly to the efforts of Peter Sellers. Miss Mirren's musical interpolations are also a high point.".

I remember reviewers measuring the posthumous Fu Manchu against that one and the film rightfully could only come up as the poorer for it. Since its release in the summer of 1980 the film has never been regarded as any good. Certainly in watching it the first time it appears unworthy of any reevaluation. But going back to it again and again over the course of more than 30 years the movie's charms start to materialize.Sellers' performances as both the villain AND its hero yield many sly little character bits unique linereadings and embellish laughoutloud set pieces. He can also be heard in overdubs as the King and other characters which just adds to the attempted tour de force on view. Despite a fractured plot and uneven tone the film cautiously reveals its DNA in classic British pantomime and music hall filled with post Goons era silliness. There's playsonwords humorous asides larger than life performances British satire and an abruptly absurd conclusion that is both poignant and stupid  all at the same time. It's a throw back 50s or 60s programmer that Sellers excelled in but by 1980 was well out of step with the more punctuated audience taste.The movie largely ignores coherency and rarely takes itself very seriously. It doesn't seem to have much in the way of an intentionally nasty bone in its body though the stereotypes and racial insults embraced do take a bit of the fun out of it in retrospect. Still the enjoyable Fu Manchu highlights Sellers game skills as a handily interpretive and original comic performer.

And not only do we get one Sellers but we get to for Sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis the equally bizarre Nayland Smith the detective on the hunt for the crazed 168 year old Fu. The story is equally outlandish as we follow Fu's outrageous antics to make his agedefying elixir and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him. Just like any of Sellers greater films the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him as well as many of his familiarfaced costars  David Tomlinson Sid Caesar John Le Mesurier Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few. It's also nice to see Pink Panther stalwart Burt Kwouk Cato enjoying a cameo with Sellers  albeit playing the same role but still nice. The story is indeed pretty ridiculous as are many of the characters involved which classes this as a film strongly under the Goon influence. And although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film failed commercially on it's initial release due to the entire world mourning after Sellers' death the film was released less than 3 weeks afterand there is always that sorrowful thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was Sellers last film. It's far from a great film  it's often slow too ridiculous and sometimes the jokes simply aren't there  but it is nevertheless enjoyable  if only for another top rate performance from Peter Sellers.".

It is certainly as good as the other 16 Fu Manchu movies from 19121970. Sellers makes a good Fu Manchu in the mode of Henry Brandon Boris Karlof and Christopher Lee. He has the long thin face described by Sax Rohmer. He is missing only the eyes of a true cat green. I was 42 when I saw it on TV for the first time. On that occasion I recorded it on VHS and had it for years but the tape wore out. I have sought replays of the film on cable or an official DVD release but is does not exist. As I type I am watching a purchased VHS commercial tape. It is the first time I have seen it in 10 years. One highlight is Helen Mirren playing saxophone and singing Good Ship Lolly Pop while wearing a reddish hip length ruffled skirt and yellow ankle boots. This is a far cry from The Queen but she plays a police woman selected to impersonate Queen Mary wife of George V. Talk about foreshadowing! The scene in the opera loge is classic. Sid Caesar gets to do dialects but the plant shooting that one reviewer decries is a part of the plot and not gratuitous. The dacoits are a great group of acrobats. One closely resembles Jackie Chan but apparently is not. My personal favorite part of the movie is the part where the world gets Blown Away at the end of the movie. Warner Brothers is releasing a lot of lesser titles on made to order DVD DVDR's burned not pressed. Yet they have not selected this one to be included.

Set for no real reasonin the 1930'sPeter Sellers does his best with the material at hand but he's not given any really good reason for his comedic moments. The rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and I sat all through this barely laughing at anything. It was only natural that we were expecting a Pink Panther type comedyPeter Sellers was so great at that. It's a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died. His appearance on the Muppet Show was more entertaining than this illconceived flop. StillI don't fault him.

Maybe somebody will buy the rights to it and have it mercifully destroyed.

He had some nice scenes notably the ice skating scene where they dance together on the pond.  And then there's the gas station attendant who finally gets our hero in such a graphic sex scene I was dumbfounded.  But you have to see for yourself what I mean.  Go rent this VHS.

I almost wonder if the version I first saw in the U.S. was released intact. I didn't remember gay sex scenes clearly showing bj's and penetration. Maybe I blocked them out.The overall quality of the DVD is lacking. It's definitely a transfer from video fuzzy and jumpy. The dim white subtitles are an exercise in frustration. This groundbreaking film deserves better. I wonder if Criterion would have the balls to tackle it?It's a good movie clearly autobiographical. The story is a gay relationship in late 1970s Berlin. The main character a teacher struggles to reconcile his political conviction of sexual liberty and promiscuity with the more traditional lifestyle of his lover. The style of the film is Cassaveteslike. We get the sense that the directorwho is also the lead actor used his friends and lovers from true life to act along with him. Transitions are abrupt and not always logical. The cinematography is literal and conventional if not downright crude but somehow it still manages to yield a couple of shots that are beautiful. The ending feels hurried and unfinished. And it's hard to escape the suspicion that the explicit sex is used primarily for shock value.Nevertheless this is an important film in gay cinema and one that anyone interested in the genre's development and history should see. The story line is the essential if now stereotypical dilemma of the modern gay male do we emulate hetero straight values or invent a new sociopolitical lifestyle for ourselves? It is a theme repeated in countless other gay films but never as directly or as raw as it was here just as a gay cinema was beginning.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you rebell at even the mildest samesex love scene you'd do well to keep your distance from Frank Ripploh's autobiographical TAXI ZUM KLO. Not only is the film shot through with casual male nudity and film clips of vintage pornography it also contains several extremely explicit sex scenesincluding at least one that will cause even the most jaded viewer to wince.Filmed in Germany in 1981 TAXI ZUM KLO which translates as Taxi to the Toilet is the saga of Frank Ripploh himselfwho finds that his job as a school teacher impinges upon his sexual escapades in an annoying sort of way. Pressed for a piece of paper he writes the telephone number of a potential sexual partner in a student's theme book determined not to miss a moment he grades student papers while cruising a public bathroom frequented by likeminded homosexuals. But then Frank meets Bernd reallife partner Bernd Broaderup and a onenight stand turns into a relationship in which Frank seems to have it all handsome sexy Bernd has eyes for Frank onlyand he can even cook.Up to this point TAXI ZUM KLO maintains a certain eccentric humor that balances distaste with amusement now however we begin to see that Frank is essentially a sex addict a man who both desires and fears a permanent relationship. As the relationship intensifies Frank begins to undermine it turning to casual drug use that fuels an everescalating round of sexual extremes. Can Frank maintain his daytime facade as a school teacher? How much is Bernd willing to endure? TAXI ZUM KLO is often described as an erotic comedy and when it first made the rounds of art house cinemas and film festivals in the early 1980s it proved an audience favorite and critical darling even so the words erotic and comedy are more than a little dicey. Heterosexuals will have to be incredibly broadminded to find the film erotic and after a certain point the same becomes true of homosexuals as well for the sexual escapades become increasingly dark increasingly disasteful as the film progresses. Much the same is true of the comic elements which very soon become dark and by the end of the film less funny than disturbing and bitter. This is particularly true when one considers that Ripploh's behaviorand the behavior of others like himfueled the AIDS crisis that exploded in the 1980s not long after this film debuted.The performances generally consisting of actors playing themselves are unstudied yet interesting and the visual style of the film approximates documentary. Although I do not own the hardtofind DVD I have seen it it has no extras and the picture quality is mediocre at best. I do own the VHS and while I would not describe that as pristine I consider it distinctly superior in picture quality. In both cases however the subtitles are rendered in white printand this is unfortunate for they are often shown against light backgrounds that make them difficult to read.In closing I find it difficult to make a recommendation on TAXI ZUM KLO. Over the years I have shown it and loaned it to various friends and few were able to sit through it from start to finish. Heterosexual viewers who weathered the graphic nature of the film usually found the veneral disease clinic scene a turning point homosexual viewers endured longer but generally found a urinelaced scene toward the end of the film so distasteful that they stopped the film. Those able to reach the end of the film seemed to feel that its interest was undercut by the very unsympathetic nature of the central character and a considerable ick factor.Ultimately it probably best to consider TAXI ZUM KLO as a historical portrait of a certain segment of Berlin's preAIDS gay community. If you have an interest in that place and time you will find it worth the effort if not you are likely to think the hurdles involved aren't worth the effort. Final word enter at your own risk.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

But then Frank meets Bernd reallife partner Bernd Broaderup and a onenight stand turns into a relationship in which Frank seems to have it all handsome sexy Bernd has eyes for Frank onlyand he can even cook.Up to this point TAXI ZUM KLO maintains a certain eccentric humor that balances distaste with amusement now however we begin to see that Frank is essentially a sex addict a man who both desires and fears a permanent relationship. As the relationship intensifies Frank begins to undermine it turning to casual drug use that fuels an everescalating round of sexual extremes. Can Frank maintain his daytime facade as a school teacher? How much is Bernd willing to endure? TAXI ZUM KLO is often described as an erotic comedy and when it first made the rounds of art house cinemas and film festivals in the early 1980s it proved an audience favorite and critical darling even so the words erotic and comedy are more than a little dicey. Heterosexuals will have to be incredibly broadminded to find the film erotic and after a certain point the same becomes true of homosexuals as well for the sexual escapades become increasingly dark increasingly disasteful as the film progresses. Much the same is true of the comic elements which very soon become dark and by the end of the film less funny than disturbing and bitter. This is particularly true when one considers that Ripploh's behaviorand the behavior of others like himfueled the AIDS crisis that exploded in the 1980s not long after this film debuted.The performances generally consisting of actors playing themselves are unstudied yet interesting and the visual style of the film approximates documentary. Although I do not own the hardtofind DVD I have seen it it has no extras and the picture quality is mediocre at best. I do own the VHS and while I would not describe that as pristine I consider it distinctly superior in picture quality. In both cases however the subtitles are rendered in white printand this is unfortunate for they are often shown against light backgrounds that make them difficult to read.In closing I find it difficult to make a recommendation on TAXI ZUM KLO. Over the years I have shown it and loaned it to various friends and few were able to sit through it from start to finish. Heterosexual viewers who weathered the graphic nature of the film usually found the veneral disease clinic scene a turning point homosexual viewers endured longer but generally found a urinelaced scene toward the end of the film so distasteful that they stopped the film. Those able to reach the end of the film seemed to feel that its interest was undercut by the very unsympathetic nature of the central character and a considerable ick factor.Ultimately it probably best to consider TAXI ZUM KLO as a historical portrait of a certain segment of Berlin's preAIDS gay community. If you have an interest in that place and time you will find it worth the effort if not you are likely to think the hurdles involved aren't worth the effort. Final word enter at your own risk.GFT Amazon Reviewer";

	schema:reviewBody "Taxi zum Klo or Taxi to the Toilet is a West German 90minute movie from 1980 so this one had its 35th anniversary last year. The writer and director and lead actor is Frank Ripploh and this is his careerdefining film his only really known work although he was pretty close to Rosa von Praunheim occasionally. This connection also tells you the direction this film is taking. It is a fairly early full feature film about the homosexual scene in Germany. The protagonist is a gay man and during these 1.5 hours we get to gain an insight into his life his personal life and his professional life. In his personal life he meets another man and they become a couple. Occasionally they seem pretty happy but there are also moments when there's major conflict such as insecurity about where to move insecurity whether to move at all jealousy faithfulness and their relationship in general. The main character played by Ripploh is a school teacher very much liked by his pupils but his colleagues as well as parents are very critical because they seem to know or at least suspect that he is into men. And as they don't like him because he gets along well with the pupils and because he gives some pupils bad notes they try to use his homosexuality against him. I really liked the last scene with the kids being allowed to do what they want as it felt a bit as if the main character was breaking free from his struggles but there's also a negative side to it as he will certainly lose his job after that. And what was that outlet comment. He can't let them do that can he? Anyway there were scenes I liked in here but they were also scenes I did not like and the latter includes a rectal examination at the doctor for example which was very graphic. I don't mind such scenes if they add anything to the film but honestly this one did not at all. It was only in there to shock audiences and make this film even more controversial. Sometimes subtlety is the right path. As a whole I would say that this was not too interesting of a film even if I can see how progressive it was for 1980s. It's a shame it was weak in several areas as Ripploh clearly elevated the material with his acting. May he rest in peace. The bad outweighs the good and I give it a thumbsdown. No need really to make a sequel too.".

This would be true of any youthful drama I think. Side completely with Bernd when all is said and done. Frank Ripploh types usually end up alone. The zoomy nutty promiscuous glamor of gay life is paper thinbut it was fun!RECOMMEND";

	schema:reviewBody "Gilbert Roland was perfectly suited to the spaghetti western he seemed to GET it the rituals pauses steely glances the ambiguity of his characters. You're never quite sure of his motives is he the hero or the villain on the hero's side or against him? Already elderly when the Italian western made its debut he was in remarkably good shape and looked a good decade younger than his actual age. He made several Italooaters including BETWEEN GOD THE DEVIL AND A WINCHESTER GO KILL AND COME BACK THE RUTHLESS FOUR JOHNNY HAMLETand this one SARTANA DOES NOT FORGIVE my favorite of these. He plays Kirchner a veteran gunfighter who may or may not be an adversary of Uriah Sartana George Martin who is searching for a man Slim Jack Elam who raped and killed his fianc. Standing between Uriah and his vengeance are the Mexican bandidos led by Reyes who are allies of Slim and a Mexican rancher Jose Alfio Caltabiano who wants vengeance against Slim for his own reasons. There is the usual maneuvering of gunfighters a fun Laurel and Hardytype routine between Kirchner and Uriah with cigarillos being put out in drinks drinks poured into dishes of food dishes of food spilt onto boots...they don't mix up their hats thank goodness. Martin is good as the steelyeyed avenger who typically gets the snot beaten out of him without losing his good looks. Elam is slimier than ever as Slim who doesn't regret the rapemurder of Uriah's fianc and even taunts him about her. The lovely Rosalba Neri makes an appearance to get some of her clothes ripped off and instigate a gunfight and a nicely set up duello at the end will keep you in suspense even though you KNOW how it's going to come out and this turns out to be an entirely satisfying entry in our favorite genre. And of course the music by de Masi is outstanding as well. This cries out for some attention from Wild East or Franco Cleef. The version I saw was from SBS in Australia nicely letterboxed if not the O.A.R. but dialog was in Spanish with English subtitles. Does an English track of this one exist? If not too bad because Elam's voice is definitely missed!".

	schema:reviewBody "Passable TortillaSpaghetti Western coproduced between Balczar Producciones Cinematogrficas and Fida Cinematografica including customary scenarios from Fraga  Huesca  outdoors that bear remarkable resemblance to Almeria . Afonso Balcazar directs the Spanish Jorge Martin and two American actors in this tale of revenge about a gunfighter who sets out in pursuit some bandits and avenge death of his wife . As Sartana George Martin looks for the nasty Slim Kovacs Jack Elam and Jose Alfio Caltabiano . Meantime  Slim and a veteran gunslinger Gilbert Rolandattempt to rob a gold shipment .Sonora is an exciting Chorizo western that contains a story full of violence and vengeance  good dramatic pace and slick direction . Agreeable ButifarraSpaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and Italian secondary participation  it follows the Sergio Leone wake  including closeup  zooms  choreographic duels and no being proceeded in American style . All in all this film is predominantly a Spanish film rather than an Italian one. It's a two country coproduction but is clearly dominated by the Spanish contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings. The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing but their product though here in Sonora is developed in violent Spaghetti wake . The film packs action  shootouts  drama  high bodycount and it's fast moving  being quite entertaining and approaching increasingly Leone Italian style  but keeping some details that make it special in this particular genre . It's a thrilling western with spectacular scenes and breathtaking confrontation among heartless protagonists George Martin and Jack Elam . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor  George or Jorge Martin is acceptable in his usual tough role . The film is well starred by Spaghetti star as the Spanish George Martin who worked much for Alfonso Balcazar's factory such as Clint the strange The return the Clint Oeste Nevada Joe Thompson 1880  Taste of killing A pistol for Ringo and The return of Ringo .Nice acting by Gilbert Roland as a cocky gunfighter  he starred some Spaghettis such as this Sonora Goldseekers  Johnny Hamlet and Any Gun Can Play and Between God the Devil and a Winchester. And  of course  Jack Elam who steals the show as a relentless Pistolero  he starred various American Westerns as a notorious secondary with special mention to Rio Lobo . In the film appears familiar faces from Tortilla or Spaghetti Western such as Grard Tichy  Alfio Caltabiano  Rosalba Neri  Toms Torres  Hugo Blanco  Grard Tichy and Miguel De La Riva . Evocative cinematography by Jaume De Casas  but a correct remastering being necessary . Being mostly filmed in a Western village located in Splugues De Llobregat  it resulted to be the location where were shot lots of Western produced and directed by Catalan people as Alfonso Balcazar  J.J. Balcazar  Jose Antonio De La Loma  Juan Bosch Ignacio F. Iquino and Julio Buchs  among others  because Almeria was too far and the landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design by the usual Juan Albert Soler  he creates a good scenario . Very enjoyable musical score by Francesco De Masi  including catching songs at the beginning and ending .Sartana Does Not Forgive or Three Gun Showdown or Sartana no perdona was professionally directed by Alfonso Balcazar  though with no originality  he managed to make a fluid and passable SW  though mediocre . Alfonso alongside his brothers Juan Jose Balcazar and Francisco Balczar produced and directed a lot of Chorizo or Butifarra Western  most of them starred by Jorge Martin or George Martin  Luis Davila  Daniel Martin or Robert Woods  such as 1972 The return of Clint  1972 Judas... Toma Monedas!  1968 Sartana no Perdone or Sonora  1967 With Death on Your Back 1966 Dinamita Jim  1965 Doc  Manos De Plata  1965 Viva Carrancho  1965 Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace . Rating  5'510 . Average though some moments acceptable . If you like traditional Spaghetti westerns remains watchable .".

Slim and his 3 enemies meet at a small town but since the villain is accompanied by Reyes Tomas Torres and his Mexican bandits he will be difficult to catch...The story is well told Jack Elam in a rare European western performance is a perfect villain though the best role goes to Gilbert Roland who can play the most unpredictable character. Kirchner is tempted by the money Slim offers most of it from a recent bank robbery and might turn against Sartana. However the whole movie is only mediocre.

	schema:reviewBody "I was very disappointed with this movie. It's an honest statement and I am prepared to explain why.This film had so much on its side. Excellent actors a fascinating subject in fact the whole thing reeked of OscarWorthy... until it actually showed up in theaters. Perhaps it really did try and I can tell that it was MEANT to be an awards movie. It couldn't be further from worthy.Amelia is a highlights reel of Amelia Earhart's life faithfully chronicling all the significant events of the famed aviatrix's career. However it is hollow and nowhere is this more apparent than in the depiction of Earhart's relationships. Or the lack of it. There's no buildup no exposition no sort of character interaction to motivate any kind of bond or love forming between individuals. Things just kind of... HAPPEN. Amelia falls in love falls out of love and falls in love all over again all without any sort of event or prompt to motivate it.In fact that's the problem of the entire film. Things just HAPPEN with little or not buildup or motivation in between. Poignant moments come and go with no warning or conclusion rendering them meaningless and out of context. It seems almost as though the director Mira Nair tried a little too hard in the wrong direction.This is a biopic not a biography. Plenty of biographies have been written about Ms. Earhart already the facts belong there. This is supposed to be a movie and whereas I have no quarrel with facts they are not the most important aspects. Movies are supposed to be snapshots truer to the SPIRIT of a character and the MESSAGE of a story than the events within. Events in and of themselves are hollow and meaningless unless the MOTIVATIONS behind them are explained. In Amelia they sadly are not and we are relegated to seeing the brilliant moments of Amelia's life pass with emotionless detachment. Why? Because this movie makes no effort in building character assuming that the actors' charisma and the fame of their names would automatically make us invested in their fates.Ms. Nair you were mistaken.".

	schema:headline " The story behind the legend";
	schema:reviewBody "Mira Nair brings to life the story of Amelia Earhart in Amelia. It stars Hilariy Swank who just might have acted her way into another Oscar nomination and potential win. Alongside her is Richard Gere as George Putnam as her publicist and partner. The story starts with her emergence into the public eye when she tried to become the first woman to fly over the Atlantic Ocean. She does so but not alone something she would later try to accomplish.As her popularity grows so does Putnam's interest in his starlet. He wants her to be famous and to be loved. All she wants is to fly. Together they help make strides for female pilots everywhere. In the days leading up to and including the Great Depression aviation was a primarily male dominated world but that mattered very little for Amelia.Along the way she becomes acquainted with Gene Vidal Ewan McGregor a pilot himself and someone that Amelia becomes very close to. Amelia's free spirited nature and desire to be set free come in the way with her feelings for Putnam and as well as Vidal.The film is not just about one person but about a person's dreams desires and ambition. Amelia lectures and speaks out for women's rights advocating for them to follow their dreams of either becoming a pilot like her or just living their life the way they want to. She doesn't want to be tethered down or restricted.Swank gives a solid performance as the flying ace. She both looks the part and acts the part very well. I must say that I did not know an awful lot about Amelia Earhart other than the common knowledge about her but I feel like Swank embodied pretty much what I would expect Amelia to be. Swank has such confidence on screen and is not afraid to let it all hang out there. Though her performances in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby are more impressive this is a finely tuned character she has developed and a very likable one. Gere too gives a great performance. He does a great job of becoming Putnam ever so slightly with his voice. It's the tiniest of inflections but it is effective nonetheless.Nair does a great job of capturing the beauty of flight and the ability that the world has to take you breath away. I didn't think this was a visually stunning film but a well constructed biopic that tells a story we want to hear. I was interested in how she would present her final flight around the world and I was pleased with how she broke it up into segments and didn't try to make it recreate things we don't know about like in The Perfect Storm. The mystery is still there.Parts of the film are a bit dry clichd and repetitive but overall this was a nice film about someone who shouldn't be forgotten. It's a good story with great characters fine acting and is pleasing to watch.".

Swank and Gere usually play interesting roles so to see them so bland here is a bit of a surprise.Kudos to Stuart Dryburgh director of photography for a very pretty picture. He's done some nice work in the past such as The Painted Veil.

	schema:headline " Conflictfree dull portrayal of an interesting woman";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite reading a few negative reviews I had high hopes for Amelia. Of course the critics were right and it was not good. The best thing about this film was the cinematography. With grand sweeping aerial shots of all the gorgeous land and sea Amelia flew over there's no denying it was stunning visually. That and the fact that Hilary Swank looked just like Amelia Earhart are the two things I could say were done well. The rest was a mess.There were little things that were irritating about the film. Hilary Swank's weird accent bothered me. I don't know anyone from Kansas so I'm not sure what women from Kansas in the 1920s and 30s would have sounded like but if they truly sounded as irritating and awful as Hilary Swank did then the acting coaches should have taken poetic license and allowed her to speak normally. Her accent was so odd it was distracting. It was also inconsistent and drew attention to itself taking me out of the experience of the film.The chemistry between Amelia and George Putnam played by Richard Gere was entirely lacking. While Richard tried his best to feign love and said all the right things I just didn't buy it. And Amelia was cold and completely unlovable towards him which I assumed was just part of her character since when he proposed marriage she responded with a grimace and a promise that she would not be faithful nor would she expect him to be. Because she was so honest it was not dramatic interesting or exciting when she began her passionless shortlived affair with Gene Vidal.The only thing keeping me awake through most of the film was my popcorn but I perked up slightly when I thought perhaps they were hinting at Amelia being gay. This at least was a new take on her life that I hadn't heard of yet. While at a bar she pointed out that a woman nearby was very attractive. That her masculine appearance and her support of other female pilots particularly the mentoring of an attractive young competitor combined to make me wonder if maybe the filmmakers were going to explore that side of her story. But no it was just an idle comment used to explain why Amelia always wore pants she admired the other woman's legs and thought her own were inadequate. Yawn.The primary problem with this film goes back to the script at its very basic level. There was an utter lack of conflict that made the story incredibly dull. Biographies are hard to do well as most people's lives are meandering and episodic by nature. We all know the fascinating story surrounding Amelia Earhart's disappearance. This story should have brought us into her life engaged us so thoroughly that we were on the edge of our seats and calling out No Ameliadon't get on that plane! as we watched her take the fateful voyage. Because if we had cared more about her and been brought into her world by an exciting conflictdriven look at her life we would have been emotionally attached and deeply moved at the thought of her demise. We all knew how Titanic would end but were nonetheless moved to tears when we watched Jack sink to his watery grave because the writers of Titanic did what the writers of Amelia did notthey got the audience emotionally involved with the characters so that we cared whether they lived or died. Watching Amelia was like watching a historically accurate documentary which included all the dull parts of a real person's life. There was little focus on the obstacles and conflicts Amelia Earhart no doubt faced in doing what she did at that time in American history. Instead everything seemed relatively easy for her. The main conflict arose from her feeling like a sellout while endorsing product after product but this too was explained and accepted as necessary and didn't create any real drama or conflict for the hero.When the ending we all saw coming finally arrived it was just that the end of a story we already know no less exciting after watching this uninspired portrayal of a woman who truly was groundbreaking and inspirational. It's a shame that the writers did not craft a more engaging Amelia for Hilary Swank to embody. The real woman was a passionate pioneer whose life was interesting dramatic and groundbreaking. This bravery and zeal could have been captured by an actress as talented as Hilary Swank if the writers had given her a story to work with rather than this dull retelling of facts.".

Because she was so honest it was not dramatic interesting or exciting when she began her passionless shortlived affair with Gene Vidal.The only thing keeping me awake through most of the film was my popcorn but I perked up slightly when I thought perhaps they were hinting at Amelia being gay. This at least was a new take on her life that I hadn't heard of yet. While at a bar she pointed out that a woman nearby was very attractive. That her masculine appearance and her support of other female pilots particularly the mentoring of an attractive young competitor combined to make me wonder if maybe the filmmakers were going to explore that side of her story. But no it was just an idle comment used to explain why Amelia always wore pants she admired the other woman's legs and thought her own were inadequate. Yawn.The primary problem with this film goes back to the script at its very basic level. There was an utter lack of conflict that made the story incredibly dull. Biographies are hard to do well as most people's lives are meandering and episodic by nature. We all know the fascinating story surrounding Amelia Earhart's disappearance. This story should have brought us into her life engaged us so thoroughly that we were on the edge of our seats and calling out No Ameliadon't get on that plane! as we watched her take the fateful voyage. Because if we had cared more about her and been brought into her world by an exciting conflictdriven look at her life we would have been emotionally attached and deeply moved at the thought of her demise. We all knew how Titanic would end but were nonetheless moved to tears when we watched Jack sink to his watery grave because the writers of Titanic did what the writers of Amelia did notthey got the audience emotionally involved with the characters so that we cared whether they lived or died. Watching Amelia was like watching a historically accurate documentary which included all the dull parts of a real person's life. There was little focus on the obstacles and conflicts Amelia Earhart no doubt faced in doing what she did at that time in American history. Instead everything seemed relatively easy for her. The main conflict arose from her feeling like a sellout while endorsing product after product but this too was explained and accepted as necessary and didn't create any real drama or conflict for the hero.When the ending we all saw coming finally arrived it was just that the end of a story we already know no less exciting after watching this uninspired portrayal of a woman who truly was groundbreaking and inspirational. It's a shame that the writers did not craft a more engaging Amelia for Hilary Swank to embody. The real woman was a passionate pioneer whose life was interesting dramatic and groundbreaking. This bravery and zeal could have been captured by an actress as talented as Hilary Swank if the writers had given her a story to work with rather than this dull retelling of facts.";

She was one gutsy woman portrayed by this film who put flying first and love second that is why clearly Richard Gere had to take a peripheral role in this role and though I feel Gere was the wrong man for the job this time around he did the job well enough. the British Christopher Eccleston produced an extraordinary American accent playing Fred Noonan and Ewan McGregors role was comfortable enough.the flying element of the film has received a lot of criticism by those who understand aviation and by those me included who know nothing of aviation. As an aviation spectacle the film definitely works because this is a love story of one woman with flying not one womans love story with George Putnam or the other 'chap'! let us clear be about that and enjoy the film for what it is.Not award winning at Oscar level but entertaining and interesting. Some of the facts may have been changed around but not the basics again I say this is a movie for entertainment and not a documentary and thank god I didn't get dished something like Nights at Rodanthe which I was served the last time I watched Gere with a mature woman.Hilary Swank is beyond criticism in this role she clearly researched her character and acted with great integrity and pride. Amelia Earheart clearly flew at a time of aviation transformation and full credit to her for what she did in her life whether she was foolhardy or not she died doing something she loved.Sometimes we can know too much and it spoils our instinctive enjoyment of something don't let that happen with this film. I am not a fan of Swank or Gere but to be honest they delivered the goods here against the odds.".

Excellent shots of early planes and the roaring days of flying in the 20s and 30s. Sad ending which could not be avoided considering the tragic way Amelia Earhard vanished on the way to a tiny island in the vastness of the Pacific ocean in 1937. I read somewhere that someone found a pair of flying boots washed up on a small atoll in that area of the Pacific back there somewhere timewise that some folk think might have originated with the last flight of AE. There are thousands of small islands in the Pacific but not much where AE was flying according to what I have read about her. Well all in all a film for history buffs and aviation fans not for everybody but not bad at all if you like that type of thing.People were not the same back then and I think the film strives to capture the way people were and perhaps now they appears stuffy but I think they were that way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Given the source material and the fact that Mira Nair has occupied the director's seat I had been expecting great things from this movie. Sadly 'Amelia' doesn't live up to being close to those expectations. Nair captures the era very well through the costumes set design and music. The visuals especially the sceneries are stunning. However the story at times feels contrived and at times more like a documented account of Earhart's life rather than a movie. The pacing is quite slow. However unlike many others I didn't find it this one to be a snoozefest but that may be because of my previous knowledge of Amelia Earhart and because of a particular performance which I'll come back to a little later on. It's quite disappointing that Nair didn't demonstrate much back story on Amelia like how did she make it this far in what was then considered a man's world and how she developed her passion for flying. Despite its flaws the last fifteen to twenty minutes were wellexecuted. Here Nair very subtly builds tension and while the viewer knows what it going to happen they are in suspense as they anticipate Amelia and her passenger's fate. Richard Gere is quite adequate as Putnam. Ewan McGregor is marginally better. But it is Hilary Swank who steals the show. She is the force that drives this movie with a nuanced performance. I wonder why she didn't receive much recognition for this portrayal. Needless to say Swank owns the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Susan Butler's 1997 East to the Dawn The Life of Amelia Earhart Mary S. Lovell's 1989 The Sound of Wings and Elgin Long's Amelia Earhart The Mystery Solved this film offers the story of Amelia Earhart with those parts of her life that have touched the psyche of so many since that day she and Fred Noonan disappeared 72 years ago over the tiny atoll of Howland Island. Not only does this film beautifully create striking visuals of the Great Depression Era but Hillary Swank is an amazing choice for the Amelia Earhart role... the black and white newsreel footage of the real Amelia Earhart is very telling.This delightful epic period film focuses on Amelia Earhart from her first taste of fame in 1928 to her 1937 disappearance. We watch the charismatic dilettante whose true fidelity is basically her love of flying leaving her romantic life as secondary the men in her life seen as her stepping stones to realizing her big dreams. Even her sinusitis does seem to deter her from soaring high in the pursuit of her challenging goals. Hilary Swank's Amelia is a woman who chafes against gender barriers to inspire young women to follow her footsteps. This is the woman who as a young girl has let her sight of an airplane to grip her interest. An inexperienced pilot of her earlier years with her many unexpected and false landings the fearless and determined Amelia in 1932 insists on taking her first solo flight in the fireenginered Lockheed Vega currently housed at Washington DC's Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to succeed and become the first woman to fly across the Atlantic. Hilary Swank's Amelia mesmerizes. And this film brings an era in which flying is not without perils. And yet nothing deters the determined the gutsy and spunky Amelia as she overcomes one obstacle after another. And yet behind her feisty determination the gentler feminine side of Amelia does not escape the viewers. Director Mira Nair's film celebrates Amelia Earhart as a heroic aviatrix as well as a woman with human sensibilities and sensitivities. The scenes of her interactions with young Gore Vidal are pretty telling. And love for Amelia and according to this film is being defined in various interesting aspects.Scenes involving the NinetyNine organization that includes its original female pilots her marketing of her Modemaire Earhart luggage and her involvement in promoting commercial air travel speak of Amelia's creative organizational and enterprising spirit and talents. And as we watch Amelia moving among the elite her fashion sense is obviously different from the norm. It is not surprising that the real Amelia Earhart was known to influence a line of extraordinarily unique sportswear to the era. Indeed Director Mira Nair's film focuses on the human foibles of the legendary Amelia Earhart instead of merely letting the viewers see the same icon as created by George Putnam and his publishing machine! Interestingly each supporting character renders a unique purpose in this film to offer the audience a better sense of the personality of Swank's Amelia as she pursues her dream and fame. It's truly cool to watch Richard Gere's charismatic George Putman Ewan McGregor's charming and thoughtful Gene Vidal and Christopher Eccleston's macho Fred Noonan get to learn and accept Amelia's free spirited personality. Indeed Gabriel Yared's orchestral score splendidly captures the varied moods of the spunky and fearless Amelia throughout the film.A gorgeously crafted film that is both captivating as well offering a study of Amelia Earhart both as a celebrated and fearless aviatrix a gutsy feminist in her era yet never failing to reveal the humanely sensitive nature of Amelia as a woman! Indeed Director Nair has revealed Amelia not only a courageous and determined restless woman with phenomenal spirit but underneath her closecropped blond hair hidden under her aviator helmet her goggles her leather flight jacket and sported flight pants Amelia was also a human being with feminine sensibilities. The final few scenes in this film are both touching and unnerving. It's finale succeeds in bungling my mind with lots of unanswerable questions in the same way the mysterious disappearance of the real Amelia Earhart have continued for the past seven decades to trigger in so many minds!".

As a young girl she was smitten with the the idea of flying to be free to move in three dimensions. From Kansas a very straightforward person she knew what she wanted and forged ahead until she got it. She wanted to see the world the whole world and flying would take her there.She was not the best female pilot of her time but she was the most persistent. We would still probably have female airline pilots military pilots and space shuttle pilots today even if Earhart had never come along but she sure helped make sure it happened in a timely manner.Hilary Swank coproducer is Amelia Earhart. The movie begins in earnest on June 1 1937 in Miami where she and her navigator set out for the aroundtheworld flight that was to be completed in California on July 4th. But as history witnesses she didn't make it the plane and crew were lost at sea searching for the tiny Pacific island where they were to refuel for the flight to Hawaii.Between the first scene in June 1937 and the last scene in July 1937 the middle of the movie takes us from 1928 to 1937 the years where she was expanding her flying experience and getting involved with those who would be key participants in her life. Richard Gere is George Putnam whom she married even though she had always thought she was not the marrying type it would be too confining. And Ewan McGregor as Gene Vidal former Olympian and then West Point aviation instructor and who went on to form several airlines in the USA. And who also is the father of Gore Vidal.I found and watched the documentary DVD of Amelia Earhart's life several weeks before I watched this movie on DVD. Both are worth the time to view them. I know it is silly in context but during this movie as Amelia was searching for the tiny island I found myself hoping this time she would make it safely.Good movie.".

And Ewan McGregor as Gene Vidal former Olympian and then West Point aviation instructor and who went on to form several airlines in the USA. And who also is the father of Gore Vidal.I found and watched the documentary DVD of Amelia Earhart's life several weeks before I watched this movie on DVD. Both are worth the time to view them. I know it is silly in context but during this movie as Amelia was searching for the tiny island I found myself hoping this time she would make it safely.Good movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Compared with many other bio pics in the last few years this one suffers from lacking in emotion stirring ingredients. While Amelia Earhart may still be a popular icon to the general American public the name may not even register in a global context. Even more realistically the story of the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic almost a century ago would generate only mild interest at best. I would not have watched it but for Hilary Swank.The narrative style is straightforward. Anchored on Earhart's closeup in the cockpit in her final flight across the Pacific from which she vanished her life story unfolds in her reflections with a sprinkle of her own voiceover at the beginning and the end. The scenes alternate between her life's passion flying in a plane and the rest of her life essentially emotional entanglements with two men. Both would have been somewhat banal today but back in the nineteen twenties and thirties would raise some eyebrows.In the first department we are treated to various mildly exciting episodes dangerous fuel shortage in a flight across the Atlantic as a passenger flying solo through perilous thunderstorms in the same route attempted takeoff in a Pacific Island that ended in crash. In the second department the relationship is slights reminiscent of Camelot. Although the husband Richard Gere and the lover Ewan McGregor are not even as remotely as close as Richard and Lancelot the tolerating husband and bewitched lover suggest the thought association.If there is something in this movie that gives you its money's worth it would be the last scene. Even though everyone knows or must have heard that Earhart's fateful flight disappeared over the Pacific some say mysteriously or even to the extent that it ended in the soils of an enemy state that Earhart was spying for that last sequence generates considerable tension as we witness how she together with the copilot gradually loses wireless contact with the ground her last hope of finding her bearings. The movie suggests without showing the actual visual that the lost plane plunged into the ocean a logical treatment given what was known or not known. But it's the final conversation over wireless before takeoff between Earhart and her husband that really plucks a heartstring. Gere provide good support but it's Swank that is at her best.Just one more comment on Hilary Swank's uncanny resemblance to the object of her portrayal. Think back on the portrayals of celebrities in the last few years and you'll notice that such a resemblance has become almost a basic requirement  Meryl Streep's Julia Child Jamie Foxx's Ray Charles Philip Seymour Hoffman's Truman Capote Frank Langella's Richard Nixon just to name a few. In some cases particularly the last in my list the resemblance comes not so much from physical likeness as from the actor's superb acting. This is where praise is most deserving.".

You will not be bored in the movie however you must like the 'Academytype' films. It's a drama and a biography so know that going into the cinema. Hilary's performance was mind blowing. She got into the character exceptionally well and she is definitely an actor of high calibre. I felt that Richard was a miscast. The time frame of the movie was supposed to be set in the 1920s1930s but it felt like it just happened yesterday. As a viewer you are looking to be taken back into the time but that's where Nair scored low for me. Overall it's definitely worth seeing and depending on the rest of the films of 2009 it may or may not get selected for an Oscar nomination. It's hard to tell with this one.".

The movie depicted a sailor typing all transmissions onto a typewriter so I am certain somewhere there is paper proof of the circumstances just before her disappearance.

	schema:reviewBody "I usually find German comedies about as amusing as bad diarrhea. I love German cinema but films like Der Schuh des Manitus and the entire Otto series have traumatised me to the point where I now just stick with German dramas and thrillers. Therefore it was a big surprise to find that Alles Auf Zucker is not only an extremely well made and acted film but also very funny.The set up in Alles Auf Zucker has been done many times before bringing two mismatched parties together in order to reach a common goal. In this case brothers Jaeckie and Samuel are forced to end their long running feud and strictly follow Jewish customs for 7 days after the funeral of their mother in order to accept her inheritance. The twist being that while Samuel's family live as orthodox Jews Jaeckie has entirely forgotten his religion. Many of the laughs stem from Jaeckie's wife's last minute crashcourse in Jewish culture and Jaeckie's general disinterest.The film owes a lot of its charm to Henry Huebchen who plays Jaeckie and Hannelore Elsner who plays his wife. Alles Auf Zucker is really built around Huebchen's performance and he is effortlessly convincing as an endearing loser. Elsner in my opinion the best actress working in Germany at the moment brings her usual skill and world weary charm to what is really little more than a supporting role. Udo Samel also deserves praise for his turn as Samuel fleshing out a character that could have been little more than a stereotype in the hands of a lesser actor.In addition to some fine performances Alles Auf Zucker is also blessed with a witty script and stylish direction by Dani Levy. These qualities more than makeup for some lazy plotting such as Samuel's Ecstasy experience and the unnecessary touches of whimsy that have Jaeckie speak directly to the audience. I think the film could have also done without the creepy intercousin romance. Nevertheless these are minor faults with what is a very funny and charming film.".

It's a fine example of sloppy screen writing with an implausible plot and characters loaded with clichs that might be true but surely are not funny either.The most annoying character is that of Zucker's wife played by Hannelore Elsner. She has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving. For example She doesn't know a single thing about Judaism but by reasons most likely unknown to even herself she gets the idea to play the charade that she and her family are Jewish laws obeying Jews for her husband's family who really are and of the very orthodox and selfrighteous variety. To make it a bit more complicated she invites the four of them to stay at her city flat because they arrive from Frankfurt in Berlin without having booked their hotels in advance something no 60 years old business man actually no grownup German would ever do. This gives the viewer a lot to swallow but still fails to produce any jokes.Zucker and his brother Samuel haven't seen each other for forty years but it turns out that his daughter  now a lesbian  and Samuel's son  now a militant orthodox  were once lovers and he's HER daughter's father. Samuel's daughter  a nympho  goes after Zucker's gay son. Is this supposed to be a somehow humorous parody of Jewish incestuous tendencies? Probably it's just a thoughtless way to add some love action turbulence every screwball comedy needs. And of course is also fails to produce any jokes.The praise for this movie is purely political. Therefore only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be politically important will enjoy this one  even though Alles auf Zucker! quite clearly has no importance of any kind.For all the rest Don't watch it without a Fast forwardoption. I really missed it.".

	schema:headline " Really baffled by this film's success with awards bodies";
	schema:reviewBody "Alles auf Zucker! or Go for Zucker! or just Zucker is a German movie from 2004 so this one is already way over a decade old as well. It runs for roughly 1.5 hours and it is among the most known works by director and cowriter Dani Levy and lead actor Henry Hbchen. Buth received a great deal of awards attention here for example at the German Film Awards. I have no idea why that is really. It may have to do with Levy's Jewish background and that he makes a movie about Jewery that has nothing to do with the years of Nazi Germany or war crimes but is a more modern take on the subject. And maybe comedies on this subject are actually really rare especially here in Germany. But this alone does not make it a good film. I myself cannot say I enjoyed the watch very much let alone that this was really entertaining or deep. Hbchen is okay for the most part but even if I like him I cannot really deny that his performances sometimes look very much alike. A German Film award may have been too much. A nomination may have been fine too. And Hannelore Elsner's nomination is definitely way too much. She was not lead and she did not give a portrayal that was memorable whatsoever. In my opinion the film lacks clear focus on some occasions and when it doesn't it is also merely okay from the perspective of storytelling. I wish I could at least recommend this to snooker players worldwide but this is also not the case as this storyline was not as memorable as it could have been either. So what stays eventually? Not much. It is in my opinion not even among the better German films of 2004 and it's outrageous this film dominated back then over Sophie Scholl and Downfall. I have no idea how anybody could think this one is better than these two Oscar nominated films really. Absolutely no idea. Alles auf Zucker! is not a really bad film by any means but it never gets beyond mediocre quality even if you ignore all the unrealistic moments it has. I personally would call it something you'd get if a Coen Bros movie goes very wrong which luckily never happened really a very poor man's version of A Serious Man almost. Don't watch.".

It's refreshing to finally see a German comedy rather than the pap that the American cinema churns out. There are many twists in this movie that will add levity to your day. Go Go Go And take someone with you. Germany has become so strict and gloomy in the world's eye that it's great they can cross boundaries that many are scared to talk about. C'mon we're all people.

	schema:headline " I don't understand some of the negative reviewsthis was a nice little comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "As I stated in my summary I can't understand how negative some of the reviews are for this film. While I strongly agree that it is not sidesplitting funny it works very well as a light comedya comedy that has some important things to say about family.The central character in this film is a guy named Jackie Zucker. He is an exsports announcer from East Germany and now that the Wall has fallen and he's no longer famous he's a bit of a weasel. Much of his time is spent gambling making promises to be a better person and then ignoring his family. He's also very deeply in debt and is about to lose everything. His only chance he thinks is to win a huge pool tournamentgiving him money to pay off everyone and get his life back on track. But since he's alienated his wife and grown children it won't be easy to convince them to stake him in the tournament.Then quite inconveniently just before the competition begins his mother dies. She was apparently a religious Jew as was her other son while Jackie was a communist party man and atheist or at best an agnostic. In her will she promises to split her inheritance between her two sons IF they give her a proper Jewish funeral AND bury the hatchet. Considering that the two men haven't spoken in forty years and are as different from each other as possible this is no small order. Plus a proper Jewish funeral includes sitting 'shiva'a one week mourning process that coincides with the pool tournamenta week when you are not allowed to do anything!! How Jackie conspires to cheatby seeming to observe shiva and sneak away to the pool tournament is rather funny. However the movie while funny is far less a comedy and far more a film about alienation and reconciliation. Seeing these two proud but exceptionally flawed men and their families work through all this actually is rather charming and interesting. A very good filmjust don't get your heart set on it being a laugh out loud comedy.PSA note to parents. There is adult content in the film and it's probably not appropriate for younger audiencesthough for most teens it's probably okay if you watch it with them.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two big divides in the family that this film centers on and these are the premises of what could have been a very fun and touching movie at the same time with a political and human message not to be missed. It's about Jewish family led two brothers where one side are orthodox and observant Jews while the other side are completely agnostic actually involved in mixed marriage between a Jewish man and a nonJewish woman which would make the children nonJewish according to Jewish faith. The other divide is the Berlin wall and the division of Germany during the cold war which makes the observant family leave in the prosperous West while the other half of the family leaves in the East. Not that the Eastern European brother lacks success and charisma he is actually the more interesting character of the two a former TV sports reporter dealing with a small prostitution business and a champ in billiards but who finds himself in dire straits because of gambling and debts. Ten or fifteen years after the fall of the wall when reunions are possible the mother of the two dies and in her the testament she asks for a traditional burial followed by the one week shiva mourning period and a true reconciliation as a precondition for inheriting.There are two ways to approach making such a movie. Rely on character comics but here you need to be quite careful as a movie dealing with Jewish characters risks to be considered as too offensive if they pedal too much on this line. Although a lot of stereotypes are present I did not find them offensive at all yes I am Jewish actually it's more the gay and sexual allusions that some may find more visible and doubt there good taste. The other approach would be to deal more with the political theme but here the film is just a pale social commentary and it never gets even close to the subtlety and human dimension of a film like 'Goodbye Lenin'.Unfortunately by choosing the middle of the road the director condemned the film to mediocrity and instead of good laughs it's mostly polite smiles all along. It's not that good comedy scenes are completely missing but I could not escape the feeling that the premises of the movie are better than the outcome and that if the authors had chosen a more definite line or just dared to be more crazy the result would have been better.".

	schema:headline " Silly Broad Comedy of German Jewish Reconciliation that Has Endearing Moments";
	schema:reviewBody "Go for Zucker! Alles auf Zucker! is a broad comic take on East vs. West reconciliation issues in Germany today that was done better in Goodbye Lenin!.Cowriterdirector Dani Levy goes further in making German audiences comfortable to laugh at their 20th century history by somewhat ridiculously adding in the Jewish issue both past and contemporary. He makes it safe to joke about the Holocaust and its aftermath. There have been countless comedies through the decades that have scheming beneficiaries pretend something or other in order to claim an inheritance marriage children etc. etc.. Here the premise is Jewish brothers and their families separated by the construction of the Berlin Wall need to reconcile and be observant Jews. But the joke as they accuse each other is that one grew up with the religious attitudes of Stalin and the other like the Ayatollah. This is first played for very broad laughs as the exCommunist brother's estranged Aryan wife frantically tries to learn Jewish household rules through a kind of Kosher for Dummies book while he's off gambling. Similarly the Orthodox Jewish family displays every stiff visual stereotype of piety known to film from the long beards to the triple chins on the wife.The actors playing the older generation who lived through Germany's traumas are very worldweary effective. There's a lot of running around like a French parlor comedy. Their adult kids are mostly silly and too slapsticky sexually confused. Maybe it's a German comic thing that the men are all passive dolts the women are sexually aggressive and their relationships make no sense. The best parts of the film are when the brother from the East is comically doing his funny grifter thing to get into a pool tournament and at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum when the brothers actually start to communicate about how history tore up their family. This makes history personal and poignant amidst the laughs. Everyone turns out to have faults and secrets including the rabbi who is supposed to moderate. Some of the Frankfurt vs. Berlin jokes probably have more meaning to the German audience.For all the film's silliness and stereotypes it does end up endearing.The subtitling is very difficult for an American audience. The opening credits are very funny with the Eastern brother talking to and over the camera a technique that continues throughout the swooping camera work. However the subtitles are mixed in with the credits and are impossible to read. The subtitlers just assumed that any English speakers coming to see the film would understand Yiddish as all the Yiddish expressions by the Western brother and his family are just transliterated as Yiddish and are not translated though some words are not that widely part of American conversation and could be a problem for some viewers.".

The unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the orderlies are gay. The orderlies kiss. I watched this in a DVD version and I have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny  it said comedy on the DVD case after all and it goes on like that. Had I seen this in a movie theater I probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny  and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy. While it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn't this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn't.Brilliant brains can MAKE anything funny people like Ernst Lubitsch Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proved that fact. But you have to know the mechanics I suppose. Director and coscriptwriter Dani Levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply ARE funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example. Do not get me wrong some people can MAKE that funny Dani Levy can't not for me anyway.The main problem I have with this movie is that I can't see a reason behind the way the main characters behave. I could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox Jew from West Germany one a third class carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany so strongly disliked each other. They are both rather bland characters. Their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin. But even these incestuous relationships  if anything they are embarrassing  just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better.The acting is not bad Udo Semel I actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor Helmut Kohl a lighter version than of a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe Levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else. Now I heard he did a comedy about Hitler. Oi Vai!".

A Jewish mother dies leaving a will that will only be decided if she's given a proper Jewish burial and if her two sons would bury the hatchet. The problem is is that one of her sons is totally Orthodox Jewish and the other one is definitely not. BUT WE'LL TRY! Oh right the unorthodox guy has an important pool tournament that takes place smack in the middle of the Jewish observance of his Mom's death. Plenty of other problems raise their head and most of it is quite funny. The script though does lose steam about 34 of the way through but this made me laugh at the right places".

A Jewish mother dies leaving a will that will only be decided if she's given a proper Jewish burial and if her two sons would bury the hatchet. The problem is is that one of her sons is totally Orthodox Jewish and the other one is definitely not. BUT WE'LL TRY! Oh right the unorthodox guy has an important pool tournament that takes place smack in the middle of the Jewish observance of his Mom's death. Plenty of other problems raise their head and most of it is quite funny. The script though does lose steam about 34 of the way through but this made me laugh at the right places";

	schema:headline " One of the best comic book films";
	schema:reviewBody "Towards the end of World War II the Nazis engage in efforts to win the war through means of invoking the paranormal. They attempt to open a portal for seven beings who are meant to invoke the apocalypse on Earth but a U.S. Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense is on hand to stop them before they get too far. They do not stop them as quickly as they'd like however and the U.S. troops soon discover that a bizarre infant part devil part man red with horns and the demonic works with a large right hand made of indestructible stone has gotten through. They acquire the infant we go forward in time to the late 20th Century and most of the film concerns an adult Hellboy still working in conjunction with the U.S. government to help battle monsters and the paranormal.Hellboy was a 10 out of 10 for me but there are a number of criteria for any viewer to have such a high opinion of it. One even though director Guillermo del Toro is a big fan of the Hellboy comic books and many comments have been made by him comic creator Mike Mignola and others that the film is faithful to the books they've also said they've changed it to suit the context of the film so you have to not be a purist about source material to screen translations or current screen instantiations. Two you have to have a taste for fantasy where the creators are not very concerned with making the material coherent with or plausible in the actual world. Three you have to enjoy your fantasy both very dark on the horror side and humoroussarcastic at the same time. Four you have to like an epic sprawling feel to your fantasy. And Five you have to not hate cgi creatures. I meet all of those criteria. How many you meet will likely determine how well you'll like Hellboy.What worked best for me was the material that showed Hellboy portrayed exquisitely by Ron Perlman as just a regular guy cum sassy detective. Even though he's half demon a large part of the comics at leastand this is hinted at in the film particularly in the climaxis a continual nature versus nurture debate. He was raised by humans who were as normal as they could be being government agents in a bureau dedicated to the paranormal. So he has a large number of humanlike quirks including a love of old music beer cats pancakes chili and so on. He's also a cigarsmoking smartassed detective. Hellboy is at its best when it focuses on these characteristics.But everything else works well too. Hellboy has a monsterlike counterpart Abe Sapien Doug Jones and a freak love interest Liz Sherman Selma Blair who are almost as fascinating as he is. The villain and neutral creatures such as the halfcreature with a speaking role towards the end are just as captivating. There are also other characters providing enjoyable comic relief most notably Tom Manning Jeffrey Tambor. His adopted father Professor Trevor Broom Bruttenholm John Hurt is intriguing. And newly recruited caretaker John Myers Rupert Evans shows promise even if we do not get to spend much time with him here. Like many films of this type I'd love to see all of these characters further explored in prequels sequels and spinoffs. That's a good sign because it shows that del Toro and fellow writers Mignola and Peter Briggs have successfully conveyed a world with deep characters who have extensive histories.Also worth noting is the cinematographylightingproduction and set design which is consistently beautiful and ranges from the popular recent trend of more monochromatic textures blue is the color of choice here to the strong chiaroscuro of the comic books to striking contrasts such as a mostly monochromatic scene which is suddenly penetrated by a supersaturated red stream of blood. The sets are all engaging from exteriors one hilariously claimed to be in Newark New Jersey to interiors urban to expansive countryside and even outer space environments.As for effects which are a large part of the film I can't for the life of me imagine someone claiming that cgi looks fake compared to mechanicals practicals stop motion ala Harryhausen and so on after they see this film. For my money these are some of the most impressive cgi creations yet including some great cgi fight scenes.Hellboy is captivating suspenseful and humorous. It is well worth watching for anyone with a taste for fantasy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's be blunt the movie is in essence a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical but once you realize this is a very different world a comic book really and normal rules don't apply it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.This is one of few movies I've ever gone to see on the opening weekend possibly the only one. And I did so because I was already a fan of Ron Perlman and it was great to see him in a leading role even though he's covered in makeup. Perlman is the best thing in this movie he is perfect as Hellboy. He swaggers through it as if he'd always been a leading man. Delivering oneliners with ease and to perfection battling monsters through subterranean sets and city streets and giving a great comedic performance as well as a very emotional one that makes you just love the big red oaf. A great feat considering the extensive makeup he had to act through.And the makeup and prosthetics are the best of its kind I've ever seen. There's movement and expression in the lips at times that you would think would be impossible. You might at first think that the lips are rather stationary and unexpressive but if you just pay attention you'll see that there is a lot of movement and subtleties to it. Rick Baker should be praised for his work in this it's amazing.Doug Jones is awesome as the body of Abe Sapien. His movements are truly beautiful. And David Hyde Pierce as the voice is perfect. Abe is a very interesting and neat character that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. And his makeup is as amazing or even more so than Hellboy's.John Hurt is great in this as is Jeffrey Tambor. Everyone in this does a great job. But Perlman's performance as Hellboy really holds the movie together. His character stands out and speaks to the audience better than any other.If you liked XMen or SpiderMan don't expect a movie as well polished and put together but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie. And unlike the aforementioned movies there is quite a bit of light humor throughout Hellboy that should garner some laughs from most anyone.Hellboy isn't perfect I would have changed some things but I had fun watching it and in the end especially for a movie of this type I think that's what matters most. In fact I like it more now after seeing it again than I did when walking out of the theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy is really the sort of comic book adaptation that should be commonplace a film that feels every bit like a comic book in its energy style and visual feel but is entirely worthy on a cinematic level as well.Sadly Hellboy doesn't really have much of a plot at least for half of its running time. Its first hour is Hellboy fighting squids and the mandatory character introductions and its second hour feels pretty rushed as a result having to introduce and resolve the bulk of the film's story. Thankfully however Hellboy avoids the comic booktofilm clich of basing the first film of any given franchise on the 'superhero origin story' not that Hellboy is much of a superhero he's really just a smartass with a gun except he's from hell instead keeping all that to a short and dazzling precredits sequence. Other than the somewhat rushed and oddlyplaced plot aspects Del Toro's screenplay is fairly impressive providing plenty of nods towards the comics and a good amount of wit and humor also echoing the nature of Mike Mignola's work.The most impressive aspects of Hellboy are Del Toro's direction and Guillermo Navarro's photography. Del Toro was always a superb director in terms of visuals although I've had issues with several of his scripts. His most accomplished film to date in this regard would probably be the superb The Devil's Backbone but Hellboy shows that he has a surprising knack for directing action in a fluid manner without resorting to the cheap method of quick cutting. Also notable in terms of Del Toro's work here is how he subtly manages to pay homage to the memorable artwork of the comics for example the overhead shots of Hellboy.The CGI effects are quite good considering the film's relatively modest budget and thankfully they don't form the basis for much of this film. The cast are all solid if not fantastic although Ron Perlman is probably the best actor I can think of to play Hellboy. The final shot is beautiful and perfectly in keeping with the pulp poetry of not only this film but also the comics it is based on. 810".

All I will say is Go see the movie. But before you do you must take all logic all sarcasm and cyncism and toss those all out of the car window on the way to your local cinemas. This movie has alot of things that may contradict alot of things that most people believe in but remember ITS JUST A MOVIE. Thats what movies are for they are meant to take the impossible and make it possible and so on. Like I said this movies not going to be an award winner and won't be on any critics ten best lists but it will be a film that you'll laugh at and generally have fun watching. Its a great escape from the surrealistic existence that many of us live every single day. So take my advice go see this movie sit back relax and have some fun.".

	schema:headline " Guillermo DelToro's exciting fun tribute to the flamboyantly cool powers of comic books";
	schema:reviewBody "Hellboy is selfconscious perhaps but in the best ways possible. Actually it's more due to writerdirector Toro being very aware of what makes up the conventional bits to every sense characterwise to the world of a comicbook but also what can be entertaining as well than it is just to having it being a Hellboy movie where the comicbook Hellboy already exists IN this world guy sees the Hellboy comic looks up it's Hellboy!. We get the toughasnails dryly witty and possibly tickingtimebomb hero in Hellboy a deadly serious villain in Rasputin yes Rasputin with a blonde Nazi as his evil sidekick no less the young apprentice to the hero Ruper Evans as John Meyers the hero's love interest Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair the father figure John Hurt's Professor and the reluctant 'boss' Jeffrey Tambor not to mention the plucky side mutant in Abraham Doug Jones AND a magnificent creature in that hardass slug. They're all there bright as day or dark depending on point of view and it all works wonderfully due to Toro running with it all head on. It's not done in a way that's meant to pander to the audience either but just to have fun with the conventions to see what makes them all crackle and pop under bigtime special effects. It's not quite a guilty pleasure because Toro is also a smart craftsman.And craftsman just as much as director he crafts this world where the creatures which were and still are Toro's forte are fierce and radically charged whether they're crucial to the picture like Rasputin's rabid rapidly hatching slugmonsters that can only be killed one or two ways or if it's just a minor creature like the zombie Russian corpse that leads a little of the way when Hellboy and his crew are in the main hideout of the villains I was better off dead!. Toro is sensitive to the characters alongside this and makes them all pretty believable and I say pretty cause it's all a little simple yet effective in the main thrust of Hellboy's emotional core being about Liz and if she may or may not go for John over him and doesn't dumb it down too much or contrive the relationships for the audience. It's a good balance because there is A LOT of action in Hellboy in fact probably at least a 60 allotment to either Hellboy fighting the monsters after him usually in the subway or in the Russian castle or with the possibly undead assassin in the mask and leather who marks as one of the fiercest forces in comic book movies.So fanboys rejoice because Hellboy should and hopefully will have everything one looks for in a brawny highoctane entertainment where humor isn't confused with cheesiness Perlman is too well focused as a possible antihero to get into any of that as he makes that hugely built red lug a very real being and the action isn't overdone with a tongueincheek. Not that Toro doesn't flirt with having goofy things in his picture like a moment where Hellboy has to save a box of kittens from the grasp of the slugmonster. But they're earned moments among a very tightly constructed story where human evils in history and the bizarre in what is in the facts Hitler into the occult Rasputin's very long death into a comfortably understood framework of comicbook clichs that never get too old when done right. Bottom line can't wait for number 2!".

	schema:reviewBody "When you are watching a comic book movie you have to take certain things for granted. The superpowers strange villains things like that. They are there in a nonexisting world saying they are implausible is true but not relevant. What a comic book movie needs is a nice story that is set in its own world although real existing places can be there too an entertaining superhero played by an actor who is able to really create the character spectacular visual effects that fit the action but most of all it needs to breath the right mood. 'SpiderMan 2' did a perfect job 'X2' 'Blade II' and now 'Hellboy' come very close. The difference is that 'Hellboy' is the first from what will probably become a series.The superhero in 'Hellboy' is of course Hellboy Ron Perlman. How he arrives on earth has something to do with Nazis around 1944 which we see in the first ten minutes of the movie. Let us say he is just here present day on the good side with a professor named Bruttenholm John Hurt as his father figure he was there when Hellboy came from hell. The villains are the same Nazis you learn why they are still alive and a lot of monsters they have created. We also meet a love interest for Hellboy named Liz Selma Blair and his new partner Agent Myers Rupert Evans.So Hellboy will fight the Nazis and the monsters but there is more. His father figure is close to death and the love interest who sets on fire when she is excited is not really interested. What makes this movie entertaining besides the right mood we constantly feel is the dry humor Ron Perlman brings to the character. Hellboy is supposed to be a secret for the outer world although rumors of his existence are there. When Agent Myers goes for a walk wit Liz Hellboy gets jealous and follows them over rooftops where he encounters a nine year old boy. The boy recognizes Hellboy and the scenes that follow the encounter are close to brilliant.There are other very fine moments. At one point a character asks why photographs of UFO's aliens or Hellboy are always blurry not very sharp. We see the truth in this question although ironically in a comic book world the question is very out of place Hellboy does exist. May be this is not the best comic book movie but entertaining it is. Compare it to another 2004 movie like 'SpiderMan 2' this one seems flawed although we can see the same amount of fun the characters have. Compare it to the dark and brutal 2004 comic book movie 'The Punisher' and this one is terrific feels like a comic book the entire time has an interesting hero with humor. That everything around it is pretty silly we just have to take for granted.".

	schema:headline " A highly overlooked movie that surpasses Van Helsing";
	schema:reviewBody "Someone told me a long time ago that Van Helsing and Hellboy were in the same level of quality saying they both sucked. Well that's a filthy lie. What you have here is a movie based on a popular comic book of the same name that does EVERYTHING that it seems Van Helsing slipped on. Don't get me wrong I liked Van Helsing but let's face it it wasn't the best movie ever and it lacked a lot of character development and an ending that was a bit of a cliffhanger because you never find out what Van Helsing's past is but Hellboy is another story.The movie starts off during the end of WWII. It appears that Nazis have been meddling in something that Paranormal Specialist Dr. Broom doesn't like too much dark magic. With the help of the notorious Resputin along with some unnamed woman with a sledgehammer and despite him being a Nazi my favorite assassin Alex Kronen the bladewielding gasmasked bad boy that you meet in the early part of the movie. In an attempt to awaken the seven gods of chaos Resputin's plan is foiled by American soldiers who are aided by Dr. Broom. After a cool looking gun fight the portal that was built to reach the seven gods is destroyed along with Resputin. However the portal was open for too long and Dr. Broom warns the American general something may have gotten out. Which leads to the discovery of a certain red 'ape' with the world's largest whammer for you sickminds out there I mean he has a large fist made of stone and is quickly adopted by the Americans after given the name Hellboy.Then the movie sets off and that is when more of the fun begins. Hellboy now about 60 but looks just out of his 20's since he doesn't age as fast as we do is the monsterhunting character that Stephen Summers wanted Van Helsing to be. Hellboy is a lord of wisecracking and doesn't really take things seriously and he also has the coolest gun in the world the Simaritan a revolver that shoots big bullets.The acting in the movie is very well done. Hellboy's character is realistic and believable since you can't help but love his sarcasm such as discovering a egglike parasite on his arm and when Agent Myers asks What is that thing? Hellboy puts the parasite in his lap and replies I'll go ask. Then there's the smart guy that makes up for whatever Hellboy lacks in intelligence and knowledge the fish guy Abe Sapien who by touching any object can see its past and future. Finally you have Hellboy's exgirlfriend and stillloveinterest Liz who is a pyrokinesis who is trying hard to control her fiery powers and is scarred from a childhood memory of when she killed many people in one of her outbursts which means her fire lets off a big explosion killing everyone and everything around her at quite a distance without harming her.The villains are also very convincing and though there is some acting quality lacking in Sledgehammer Girl I didn't catch her name she has little lines and doesn't have much screen time unlike the very creepy and justasdeadly Alex Kronen who has been made into something of an immortal due to his surgical addiction he's like a killing cool version of Michael Jackson except Jackson's blood isn't dust and can't increase his adrenaline by cranking a dial on his chest.The action scenes are also very fun to watch and never go out of quality like Van Helsing sometimes did. This is done by not a lot of shooting or explosions or people running in circles screaming like in Van Helsing but is done by clever dialogue Hellboy's constant wisecracking and some awesome special effects . . . along with a lot of shooting.Hellboy is a highly overlooked and sometimes underrated movie that makes us remember how Van Helsing lacked in character development and highquality action scenes. While Van Helsing has its big mean monsters which outnumber the amount of monsters in HellboyHellboy gives us the experience Stephen Summers wanted Van Helsing to provide along with some extra wisecracking and a little more attitude. Hellboy is a mustbuy for fans of the comic or just about anyone who likes special effects and clever scriptwriting.".

Hellboy has it's faults but it's truly comic bookhorrorfantasy hybrid masterpiece. It is the probably the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Based on a little known comic book I'm sure people will be running to buy now. Hellboy is the story of a group of bad guys whom are trying to destroy the world and end up bringing forth a small child like hellboy. After years of being raised by his founder he becomes a superhero monster fighting bad guys like himself and bringing them to justice while defending humanity. He's helped along in his quest by pyro girl Liz Sherman played beautifully by Selma Blair. And a very cool intellectual fish Looking guy referred to as Blue. But those people are back to destroy the world again as they have ressurected their master and it's up to Hellboy and his gang of misfits to protect humanity and foil their plan. I'm sure it sounds surely predicatble but that something this film lacks in troves. It's completely original completely new and just great. The performances by Ron Pearlman John Hurt and Selma Blair are completely involving. The story is well developed emotional scary and funny. The direction is taut and well developed. Definatly Del Toro's reigning masterpiece. I must say I was overly impressed by this film probably because I wasn't expecting too much but I can guarantee you one thing I will be going to see it again. Hellboy is amazing!".

The action is well done and the story is great but Perlman makes the character of Hellboy a demon raised by the good guys just amazingly human with a wry sense of humor. You would be hard pressed to find anyone anywhere who could do this character as well as Perlman let alone better. The physicality seems to have been tailor made to fit Perlman's features and the delivery of the lines is just so understatedly comedic that there are few who could pull it off at all.Of course there are a couple times when the special effects are a little weaker than you would hope but it doesn't detract from the movie as a whole. For instance in the final battle scene there are a couple shots where the Hellboy character clearly appears to be GC. But the fight moves so fast that you don't have much time to focus on those shots before something else amazing happens.See it. Love it.".

This can lead to a neverending list of deadbeats such Hulk SpiderMan and Catwoman and rarely ends up with a good movie Batman Begins is one rare example. Guillermo Del Toro seems to make a compromise of introducing Baby Hellboy during the end of WWII and then flashing forward 60 years to adult HB though genetically he's barely out of his 20s working for the Government.The Beurau of Paranormal Research uses Hellboy as a weapon against the forces of evil.

Raised by Professor Broom John Hurt he regularly has fallings out with his human father and even hides his cigarette smoking from him. I find the stroppy teenager attitude a unique character quirk that works well. What's even cooler is HB fondness for cats. Which not a typical characteristic of a demon born in Hell.The world's last living superevil Nazis resurrect the madmonk Grigori Rasputin and aim to bring about Armageddon by awakening sleeping Lovecraftian Gods frozen in time at the edge of the universe. A tough job even for HB but it's all in a days work for the Beurau of Paranormal Research.Del Toro works wonders in bringing to life atmospheric sets check out the flooded subway station and horrific creatures but stops short of making Hellboy a dark epic. The CGI is impressive and the visions of Hell are interesting but there's just some intangible element that seems to be missing and the film feels incomplete. Even the Director's Cut still feels a bit alienating.However the action and humor is quite entertaining and the villains especially 107yearold crazed assassin Kroenen are definitely the kind you want to see die horribly. Enjoy it for what it is even if you feel it's not entirely wholesome by the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hellboy revolves around classic comic bookactionsuperhero genre story lines. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth. He is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural rather then be a menace the normal career route for a demon.The set up of the story involves creative uses of history combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's preposterous but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets. I find the explanations of the characters who they are and how they came to be very well handled. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact the opening is the best part of the film therein lays the problem.Essentially Del Toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it. The film is absent of all tension or any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably Hellboy will be OK and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any actionhero film. Well yes it is but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die. Die Hard works because John Mclane looks likely to die at all parts. He escapes death by the slimmest of margins. The stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc etc Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero. The threat and tension is constant.Some of the other major weaknesses are Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina. Characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story. The villain is featured in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the one scene Hellboy looks to be up against a real threat groups of monsters a character unleashes her abilities  the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives. A minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Her character is so thin the relationship so undeveloped. It is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense. I don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life.The film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren't smart or funny. After a while it all starts to grate.What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And whoever made the creative decision to make hellboy's primary weapon a gun instead of his clunking arm should be fired. Essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out The few positives include The cinematography is very good. At all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette. As well as the use of interesting locations. Yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well.The use of cgi and Fx is well done. Never do we get an over load. When effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see.All in all this is a pretty poor film. The real shame is that despite not reading the comics I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored. The film has watchability in the sense that if it comes on TV and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing. But in any other situation I wouldn't bother with it.".

Too bad that the story and most of the characters don't really work out the way they're supposed to.The character of Hellboy self works out just great! This is thanks to mainly Ron Perlman but also to the very convincing makeup effects. The rest of the characters feel like they are only put in the movie to fill up the screen. Selma Blair is very boring as Liz Sherman and it never became clear to me in the movie why professor Bloom out of all people picked John Myers. Not really a good character either. The two characters Abe Sapien and Tom Manning Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful! who were about the two most entertaining characters disappear way too soon out of the movie. But most disappointing are the villains which are often the most important in 'superhero' movies like these. Having Rasputin as the main villain of course is already a ridiculous idea itself but on top of that he simply isn't a very good and convincing villain. UberNazi Karl Ruprect Kroenen is a way more interesting villain. He is the kind of villain I love in movies cool outfit awesome weapons he can't seem to die and he has no lines. Excellent scary cool and mysterious all in one. Not bad for a 107 year old. He also was way more better than the most of the time special effects monsters.The special effects were at times good mediocre and just at times unconvincing.The action also was somewhat disappointing. I think this is due to the wrong offbeat pace in the movie. Everything is happening way too fast. One moment Hellboy is giving away some great fun and cool oneliners and the next he's fighting a monster in the subway. Because everything is happening so fast the story also isn't always easy to follow. The movie wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped and expected. I'm sure that when I read the script I would like the story better than I did while watching the movie.It still is a somewhat entertaining movie to watch but not one that I would recommend to everyone. However I'm still looking forward to Hellboy 2 also because 'superhero' sequels are only getting better and better these last couple of years SpiderMan 2 X2.

But even Satan can fall in love with another freak of his type and even Satan can be attached to the catholic professor who became his father the one who provided him with candy and sweets because Satan has a sweet tooth. Satan somewhere is slightly human and a tiny bit catholic. A cross may burn his palm but when it has been served to him for sixty years by a benevolent old man who he considers his father he may start to like it to love him and then to hate those who are on the other side. Don't expect any kind of deep emotional feelings though but expect some beautiful special effects that look so realistic that they will make you thrill and shiver. And what's more they will be exotic and lead you to rainy New York City and snowy Moscow and underground everywhere in the NYC subway or in some Russian cemetery. You will meet with dead people who are revived and then can lead you to the very center of hell or with surgical fetishists who have recomposed their bodies bone by bone and muscle by muscle. But the most attractive element is in the use of fire the fascination with fire and that has to do with the constant reference to the apocalypse that of the Book of Revelation of course? Fire seen as the ultimate cleansing element that can bring the universe to its end or destroy up all evil from earth. The ambivalence of this fire is fairly surprising in many ways since most people are afraid of fire and here it is the ultimate redeeming element. It is true when you are surrounded by meters of snow and tons of ice you are grateful for one little small fire in the living room hearth. And be satisfied the FBI director who is in charge will end up locked up underground to die peacefully at least deep enough for no one to be pestered by his protest and yelling.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

Satan somewhere is slightly human and a tiny bit catholic. A cross may burn his palm but when it has been served to him for sixty years by a benevolent old man who he considers his father he may start to like it to love him and then to hate those who are on the other side. Don't expect any kind of deep emotional feelings though but expect some beautiful special effects that look so realistic that they will make you thrill and shiver. And what's more they will be exotic and lead you to rainy New York City and snowy Moscow and underground everywhere in the NYC subway or in some Russian cemetery. You will meet with dead people who are revived and then can lead you to the very center of hell or with surgical fetishists who have recomposed their bodies bone by bone and muscle by muscle. But the most attractive element is in the use of fire the fascination with fire and that has to do with the constant reference to the apocalypse that of the Book of Revelation of course? Fire seen as the ultimate cleansing element that can bring the universe to its end or destroy up all evil from earth. The ambivalence of this fire is fairly surprising in many ways since most people are afraid of fire and here it is the ultimate redeeming element. It is true when you are surrounded by meters of snow and tons of ice you are grateful for one little small fire in the living room hearth. And be satisfied the FBI director who is in charge will end up locked up underground to die peacefully at least deep enough for no one to be pestered by his protest and yelling.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines";

	schema:reviewBody "Hellboy is a fascinating monster character from the creation of Mike Mignola's of the Dark Horse comic series. This supernatural spectacle movie by Guillermo de Toro is brazenly directed which moves fluidly with full vigour and rich characters. What makes Hellboy work is the magnetism of the character itself. Underneath the reddish grotesque prosthetic makeup is Ron Perlman whose wonderful acting with a touch of delicacy and monstrous charm delivers a hero with knack for humour and a flair for showmanship.Other notables include the benevolent fatherfigure Professor Broom John Hurt who raised Hellboy since his bizarre birth. Then there is Liz Sherman a pyrokinetic beauty aptly played by Selma Blair with an uncontrollable gift to start fires. One other exceptional freak is Abe SapienDoug Jones a fishman with telepathic powers. Finally to round up the cast is an FBI agent John Myers Rupert Evans a straightarrow with a tendency to be jittery and sceptical. Collectively all the aforementioned characters are the various inhabitants of the secretive Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.Hellboy here is faced with battling Rasputin Karel Roden an evil mad monk who wants to ignite the trapped demons of evil force and in order to succeed he needs to beckon back Hellboy to the dark side. This is orchestrated by unleashing villainous creatures that are fairly interesting as well. Rasputin brings along his own cohorts with zombielike Nazi soldier Kroenan Ladislav Beran and sexy Illsa Biddy Hodson as they attempt to bring the demon god to Earth.The subject matter is interesting enough despite a skeletal storyline that it doesn't require a full scrutiny. It is Guillermo del Toro's exquisitely realized vision for the film that dominates it for the most part. Even though the pacing at times may drag but it nevertheless succeeds on being entertaining and is also visually stunning to look at.".

On the other hand it's hard to know how del Toro would really sell a battle with a Lovecraftstyle monster in a library in any realistic.

The only other film I know of that goes anywhere near these areas is Britain's Come Play With Me but the tight integration of these genres witnessed in the Danish pictures especially this one is completely unique.While much of the humour falls flat this is more than compensated by a genuine sense of wackiness.

I never forgot the Danish title of this great erotic movie that I first saw in a cinema in Holland the country where I grew up.It is a film in James Bond style. In common with the Bond films it has the humor throughout the film although this is more towards slapstick. It also has love scenes but unlike the Bond films it shows all the juicy details. Nevertheless it's a real nice film far better than the majority of porn films it's good for a laugh and it's been filmed beautifully with spectacular dancescenes and some nice classical music.It tells about a microfilm that gets lost and eastern as well as western and Danish secret services are after it. Literally everything is done to obtain it again. Anna Bergman a beautiful young woman is a joy to watch. When you read this review you will understand why I liked it so much.This film is an absolute must especially compared to the majority of porn movies which are not romantic drenched with the naked facts while they lack a storyline! Compared to those this film is a relieve.I was really delighted when  years later  I could get hold of this film Scorpio Stingson VHS together with 3 others from the series featuring the other horoscope signs Taurus Leo and Sagittarius.Try to get one and enjoy.

	schema:headline " Not too remarkable but not unentertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "European spy spoofs were very big in the 1960's but by the late 1970's they seemed pretty passe not to mention pretty unnecessary since the serious spy movies like the Bond film Moonraker had pretty much sunk into selfparody. This Danish film though adds a very 70's element into the mixhardcore pornography! Actually anyone looking for hardcore sex will probably be disappointed as the graphic sex scenes are few and far between and are all lacking the money shot. It was typical in Europe at the time to insert brief hardcore sequences into even some of the most innocuous films when they were showing in more liberal markets like Scandanavia. The only difference here is the inserts actually seem to have filmed at the same time and involve some but not all of the same talent. This film is somewhat similar to Le Porno Killers or the unedited version of Thrillera Cruel Picture in this respect but while those are very sleazy films this is a lighthearted comedy which makes the hardcore sex scenes especially jarring. On the plus side however this is far better than than any of the American porn parodies of the era. It isn't too funny but at least it isn't painfully unfunny.The only recognizable actress here is Anna Bergman the daughter of the famous Swedish director Ingemar who otherwise mostly appeared in British sex comedies with Mary Millington and Suzy Mandel. She actually has a hardcore scene here but she uses a very obvious body double. But I'm forgetting somethingoh yeah the plot. Well it's some nonsense about a secret spy agency run by a guy named the Scorpion operating out of health food store. An older female Mata Hari type sends her incredibly dim son in to intercept a delivery in order to take revenge on the Scorpion who killed the son's father years earlier right after they had sex for the first and only time. Really the only interesting thing about this besides it being the hardcore debut of the daughter of an internationallyrenowned film director is that the opening sex scene between the Mata Hari and her lover might be the only hardcore porn sequence in history to lead to an actual conception within the world of the movie of course. Otherwise though this movie is not unentertaining but is not too remarkable either".

But that's exactly the opposite of the same character in his very own movie. In fact he struggles to overthrow an evil ruler for those very reasons.So when and why did he become bad? I'm afraid I'm not following this. The movie however is entertaining if rather short and silly. Chuck Russell tries to cram in loads of fighting and hokum as he can. It works and The Rock is very cool as said King or Mathayus and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantilyclad Cassandra. Grant Heslov and Michael Clarke Duncan fill out their usual roles as ethnic comicrelief and big muscley guy.The film has slightly less integrity to it than the Mummy movies. This is evident with the fun and lively but completely inappropriate score by John Debney. I'm not expecting anything like his Passion of the Christ score but blaring death metal guitars seem kinda out of place in a movie set 3000 years BC.But this movie is a cheeseburger not a 17course dinner. So why bother complaining. After all it's a prequel of a sequel of a movie that was a remake of a movie that was made in the 30's. But it's well made and loads of fun so just go along with it and you'll enjoy.Filmed in Panavision the DVD is in perfect 2.351 anamorphic widescreen with very loud and thrilling DolbyDTS 5.1 sound. The extras are fluff but that's to be expected.".

Still it has quite a bit of eyecandy and in some sense it's superior even to the famed Gladiator as it doesn't pretend to be any more than it is.

The beautiful Kelly Hu showed that she can be good on the big screen and the ever reliable Michael Clarke Duncan played a great part as well. The action scenes were hard hitting and brutal and the scenery was fantastic as well.The only thing that spoiled the film for me was the fact that it was not an original idea. The plot has been done in so many movies before. Sometimes in the movie world certain plots are churned out time and time again and you just get that feeling of deja vu. The plot for this film has been done in dozens of movies and countless TV shows.I saw this film with a friend of mine and he really really enjoyed it. However he usually likes cop movies and hasn't seen many fantasy adventure movies so watching this was a first for him. I have seen dozens of movies like this and whilst it was very good I did get that feeling of familiarity.But anyway I still recommend it. The fight scenes are awesome and there are some funny scenes in it. And again the Rock does have a future as an actor. I just hope that his next project is a fresh idea.I'm going to really be awkward here but there's three other things that bothered me about this movie. There was a short scene with an Indian elephant in. Did ancient Egypt have elephants? I'm no wildlife expert but I didn't think they did. Secondly wasn't it amazing that there was such a variety of accents in the film. Lastly gunpowder in ancient Egypt? No way!I'm just getting old thoughwatch and enjoy!".

In quality it fares about as well as the average swordandsandal epic. There is a camp factor that hangs over the story that you feel when listening to some passages of dialogue.  Also noticebale are Grant Hislov's comic relief role as Arpid and Kelly Hu as the bellybaring sorceress Cassandra.  Wrestling fans may enjoy this vehicle for the Rock but I don't think many others will.".

	schema:headline " Fun for the shear cheese of it";
	schema:reviewBody "The ability to win over new fans is not easy when one is shoved into the limelight so quickly. After briefly appearing as The Scorpion King in Stephen Sommers' anticipated sequel The Mummy Returns 2001 Universal Studios believed that it was time to create their spinoff starring none other than Dwayne The Rock Johnson. Originally only taking part in wrestling Johnson was bit by the acting bug and agreed to star in this film as his feature debut. As known by many this spinoff movie was a prequel to a sequel of a movie that was a remake of an older movie. Sounds confusing but it can be understood. Once you think about it it does make sense. As for being a wellwritten story..not really. There are a lot of pluses to this film but it has its drawbacks too.As a film that tells the background to how Mathayus The Scorpion King Dwayne Johnson got his name it doesn't really declare itself publicly. Yet somehow everyone knows by the end. Originally Mathayus belonged to a group of hired assassins during a time when a ruthless dictator known as Memnon Steven Brand was looking to conquer everybody and anybody. Mathayus and his fellow assassins were hired to take out Memnon and a powerful sorceress Kelly Hu who sees visions of the future. All the same like other assassins hired to kill they end up getting caught caring too much. This happens when Mathayus and the sorceress become attached to each other. As an origin story the narrative is mostly predictable. Also since it is a prequel audiences already have an idea of what is going to happen. However this doesn't make the viewing experience unwatchable. Aside from the story being a touch too clich there are a couple of other setbacks.The first belongs to the sorceress' powers to see into the future. There isn't any logic behind this other than it just being shown that she has these powers. In other words the audience just has to accept this as a fact and not care about the reasoning. Yet for viewers who have a harder time shutting off their brain or are just more inquisitive the understanding behind how she acquired her powers would've been appreciated to have. The other issue is the tone of the script which constantly flipflops in the midst of goofy and serious. Thus the end result tends to be an entire cheese fest because you want to take the story seriously but can't because of how certain situations are handled. Having a character give a rather immature nod to the audience because someone went to bed with them kind of breaks the rules on how serious a viewer can take this story. Another example is pairing up the protagonist with mildly unneeded sidekick named Arpid Grant Haslov. Most of his comments are just too obvious to be even said. As for who wrote those moments into the script it most likely belonged to William Osborne best known for writing Twins 1988  everyone's hated Stallone film Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot 1992. The other writing credits belong to Stephen Sommers rightfully so and David Hayter XMen 2000 XMen 2 2003  Watchmen 2009. So it's not like every writer behind this production didn't have the credentials. The directing was also headed competently by the underrated Chuck Russell A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors 1987 The Blob 1988 remake  The Mask 1994. Even with its cheese factor the main cast is able to perform okay. Dwayne Johnson was no doubt the right choice to be Mathayus because what would a spinoff origin movie be if the actor doesn't return to play the role he made? Steven Brand is a worthy opponent to Johnson but it probably would've been an even better idea if Michael Clarke Duncan who plays along side Johnson was the enemy. It just would've been a better showdown.Kelly Hu is attractive in her own right and doesn't give a bland performance either. The rest of the cast including Grant Haslov also act okay but nothing that is of much importance. They do help near the end and add to the overall cheese at times but they a necessity. Cinematography was ably contributed by John R. Leonetti who was able to mimic Adrian Biddle's work from Sommers' The Mummy 1999 universe. There are lots of desert shots while the set pieces appear grand and ancient. The action was also well choreographed and since sword fights aren't exactly the most used types of action sequences it entertains. For the musical score John Debney composed behind the film. For this listening experience Debney uses a blend of organic orchestra with what also sounds like occasional rockpop beats. This was probably used in order to accommodate Johnson's fans but the beats actually don't mess with the score too much. The action cues sound appropriate with the scene it follows and it's in line with the genre. If the story to this movie was taken a little more seriously this probably would've entertained more.Its script is not clear on everything and its unequal tone makes the actors look occasionally cheesy on film. It's okay in some ways and others not so much. Luckily the camerawork action music and main cast are able to manipulate it in their favor to entertain on very mindless level.".

Despatched to assassinate Memnon Mathayus is forced to save a child and misses his opportunity. Fleeing the city he kidnaps Memnon's sorcerer Cassandra who he is also meant to kill and heads into the desert. Deep in the Valley of the Dead he intents to use Cassandra to draw Memnon out of the safety of his loyal city and into the desert where he will be more vulnerable and easier to kill.Despite not being impressed at all by Mummy Returns I thought I would veg out in front of this prequelsequelspin off thing which was just as well since vegging out mindlessly in front of it is pretty much all it is good for. The plot is essentially a collection of action scenes held together by some overlyserious plot with a bit of flesh and titillation thrown in just in case the teens get restless. It is very derivative and very obvious and if you are actually paying much attention to it then you'll find it pretty tiresome at times. Of course in my brainless state I found it to be brightly colourful and noisy which was enough to keep my eyes busy and let my head rest. It would have been much more fun if the material had had its tongue in its cheek and allowed the performances to match this but by taking itself a bit too seriously at times it only ends up looking silly.The Rock is a solid star for this sort of thing but he isn't very versatile  he needs the material to match him rather than the other way round. By having a big character in an overly serious tale he looks ill at ease and doesn't suit it that well. Brand is a bythenumbers villain who fills the role but not much else. Hu is undoubtedly attractive and at first I felt that she was being exploited by having her in tiny clothes and as much flesh as possible however then I watched her performance and realised she was just playing to her strengths. Duncan takes himself too seriously and his scenes lack fun  surprisingly even in the action scenes. Support from Hill Heslov and others don't do much other than fill out the cast.Overall then a fairly bland uninspiring action movie that lacks excitement tension characters story and indeed fun which is where the biggest problem lies. It is probably enough of a film to satisfy teenage genre fans but I must confess that there was so little that was special that I could barely care about it when it was on and found it unmemorable by the time it was finished.".

If you're a big fan of The Rock then check out The Scorpion King.  He rocks!  Rocky Rocky Rocky Rocky!!!!A  out of  stars 1313";

'Mdchen Mdchen' is the greatest eroticteenage comedy nowadays.If I could I would sooooooo kiss Lena's wonderful lips and Victoria's extraordinary sexy bootie!    And of course I would play with Inken's lovely tummy!    God these chicks are sooooooo piercing!!!I think this film somehow gives us a portrait of this age we are living in. Guys and girlies both want to have multiorgasms no matter how no matter where. Both sexes do alot to do their bests for the very first time but I think they always overrate it I mean having sex with somebody is not a ritualanimalsacrifice. And this film touches the spot the better we wanna have big grooves the more doubtful we will achieve it. I say to all the youngvirginteenagedudes just live your life have good parties and stuff like that but don't rush after the Great Love just because you need someone.

	schema:headline " Long way to go for everybody involved";
	schema:reviewBody "Mdchen Mdchen! is an almost 15yearold movie and the first theatrical movie directed by Dennis Gansel although it is actually not even good enough for television. I read that this is the only film for which he did not work on the screenplay so I'll hold it in his favor. For basically this film is stupid and unfunny sex jokes for almost 90 minutes. What is especially embarrassing is that it took no less than four writers to come up with this mess. And they even made a sequel a couple years later without Gansel though. Still this film features some of Germany's most famous actors right now and pretty much all of them were still fairly unknown back then Amft Herfurth Woll Baum Lukas Bazman M'Barek and last but not least Max Riemelt who became a regular in Gansel's films.There is really nothing in this film except talk about orgasms for 90 minutes and here and there they also experience one. The bicycle scene is a bit famous but all it is really memorable for in my opinion is how cringeworthy embarrassing it is. It certainly helps that Diana Amft does not have the slightest ounce of acting talent in my opinion and only has a career because of her looks which I don't find too great either though. She was much older here already than the character she plays. Woll was slightly older too and only Herfurth's age was accurate. She was still under 18 when this was made and I guess that's also why she does not have any real sex scenes. And now that I talked about the girls I would love to say that the boys are written and portrayed better but nope they are just as bad. Really everybody involved with this film still had a long way to go in terms of their talent. It's hard to believe that Gansel came up with a pretty good movie like Die Welle a couple years later. The humor in Mdchen Mdchen! is about orgasms vomiting condoms clitoral espresso sadomasochism cybersex etc. Nothing unfunny is left out really. Unfunny tryhard comedy from start to finish and one of the negative highlights was certainly when there was a truly terrible dialog in the first half of the movie between a boy and a girl about wearing socks. And it is predictable as hell too. Strangely enough near the end Riemelt's character suddenly only wants to be friends with Amft's in order to not risk their friendship. And all this after he told his friend earlier that he wants to lose his virginity to Amft's character. The stuff out of which disastrous films are made. Nothing surprising and nothing worth watching here in general. An infantile mess of a movie with terrible music too. The only good thing about it really is that we don't have to bear with it for more than 85 minutes.".

Really everybody involved with this film still had a long way to go in terms of their talent. It's hard to believe that Gansel came up with a pretty good movie like Die Welle a couple years later. The humor in Mdchen Mdchen! is about orgasms vomiting condoms clitoral espresso sadomasochism cybersex etc. Nothing unfunny is left out really. Unfunny tryhard comedy from start to finish and one of the negative highlights was certainly when there was a truly terrible dialog in the first half of the movie between a boy and a girl about wearing socks. And it is predictable as hell too. Strangely enough near the end Riemelt's character suddenly only wants to be friends with Amft's in order to not risk their friendship. And all this after he told his friend earlier that he wants to lose his virginity to Amft's character. The stuff out of which disastrous films are made. Nothing surprising and nothing worth watching here in general. An infantile mess of a movie with terrible music too. The only good thing about it really is that we don't have to bear with it for more than 85 minutes.";

	schema:reviewBody "Regardless of how faithful The Spiderwick Chronicles movie is to the original stories by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black the film is tremendously entertaining and thankfully resolute. Unlike the recent flock of fantasy epics including The Golden Compass and The Seeker which conclude feeling wholly unsatisfactory due to an abrupt resolution that suggests further films in the series The Spiderwick Chronicles easily stands alone as a complete story. With sensationally mirthful creature designs and likable human characters topped with stateoftheart special effects The Spiderwick Chronicles is another big win for Paramount and a high bar for family films of 2008.The moment the Grace family moves into the dilapidated Spiderwick Estate strange things begin to happen. Jared Freddie Highmore is a curious adventurous boy who quickly seeks out the hidden cobwebcovered remains of great great uncle Arthur Spiderwick's laboratory. He unleashes a mysterious force when he locates a field guide full of the secrets of the magical creatures that inhabit the forest surrounding the mansion. His twin brother Simon is calm and reserved and very much the intellectual one but is rapidly drawn into the fantastical world of faeries and goblins. Older sister Mallory and their mom are harder to convince but after the almighty and ruthless ogre leader Mulgarath Nick Nolte begins to attack the home everyone must band together to combat the hordes of goblins and ensorcelled creatures that lurk outside.The Spiderwick Chronicles is on the surface an alluringly delightful fantasy that blends the very best of character designs both human and CG into a story that effortlessly engrosses without stumbling out of the realm of suspended disbelief. Everything within the story makes sense as it unfolds and we don't question why certain things are feasible  because as the world of goblins and boggers is defined we have no reason not to become completely immersed in the fantasy. Director Mark Waters doesn't rush the process of illustrating the multitude of magic and myths and doesn't overload us with jargon that we couldn't possibly comprehend. The pacing is fantastic for a family film and doesn't fall into the three hour trap that The Lord of the Rings sets.The children have more appeal and charismatic personalities than those of the Narnia kids and the creatures are more lovable and waggish than those in Harry Potter. Each computer animated monstrosity and cuddly ally beautifully blend into the forested environment and never reach a level of utter annoyance. The designs themselves are ingenious with a mix of gelatinous abominations like Redcap the angry henchman goblin a furry old hamsterlike man Thimbletack voiced by Martin Short who speaks in rhyme and a mighty griffin that soars above the picturesque clouds. Eloquently wispy faeries and an enormous horned ogre are also substantial parts of the Spiderwick mythology and many other exciting creatures frequent this actionfilled fairyland.The Spiderwick Chronicles undeniably makes fantasy and magic fun. While a few scenes of unnecessary predicaments involving the children's divorced parents could have been cut the film manages not to be overly preachy even with its many positive messages and abounding morals. With pleasing characters familyfriendly magical adventure and a mindbogglingly fantastical world of faeries goblins and ogres The Spiderwick Chronicles is extraordinarily entertaining fantasy fun.The Massie Twins".

	schema:reviewBody "I work at IMAX theaters and we showed an advanced staff screening tonight. Having been surrounded by posters and trailers for Spiderwick Chronicles for months I was already sick of the film before I even saw it. But I went into it with an open mind and found myself pleasantly surprised. The plot centers around a broken family that moves into an old house that has been in the family for years in hopes of starting over. Freddie Highmore plays two roles twin brothers Jarod and Simon and does an impressive job at keeping the two personalities distinct and different. Jarod the angsty protagonist of the film discovers a book titled the Spiderwick Chronicles written by his late great uncle depicting in explicit detail the creatures of a hidden world all around us. Jarod reads the book and in the process awakens an evil Ogre and a horde of goblins hell bent on obtaining the knowledge hidden within the book to destroy mankind and creaturekind as well. The pacing is decent and the acting works well within the context of the film. Oddly it's the adult actors that deliver the lamest lines as they seem profoundly out of place in this otherwise fantasy and child actor filled film. The CGI effects were well implemented too with various characters and creatures popping up here and there to provide comedic relief and often pivitol plot development. The various supporting characters do a great job of keeping things moving most notable being Jarod and Simons sister Mallory played by Sarah Bolger who delivers a great performance. Having never read the books I can't make any comparisons but what I saw in the film I liked quite a bit. Not the most complex of movies and there are some glaring plot holes here and there but overall it holds up pretty well albeit some wonky script writing here and there.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Spiderwick Chronicles is based upon the books of the same name by Tony DeTerlizzi and Holly Black. The film centers around a mother and her three children who move into a mysterious and creepy new house pretty much in the middle of nowhere. The one son Jared who is the main character in the film finds a book written by the previous owner of the house and Jared soon discovers that this is a magical yet very dangerous book that a lot of goblins and little creatures are after but with the help of his twin brother his older sister and some friendly creatures he gets the book to safety and also protects himself and his family from the evil monsters that want the book to do harm. Ever since The Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter films have done so well filmmakers are taking other fantasy books and turning them into feature films as well. The majority of them that have been released over the past few years I have not seen because for one thing they did not look appealing to me at all and also because of bad word of mouth and reviews. I wasn't sure what I would think of The Spiderwick Chronicles but to my surprise I thought it was pretty good. The film is aimed at a family audience even though some young children might be afraid of some scenes but this is a film that I think kids will absolutely love and there is enough here for the grownups as well. The story sounds simple enough but it is enhanced by a lot of creative creatures and imaginative things going on. The young cast each did their own and carried the film and even though I don't usually like computer generated effects in films I didn't feel it was overdone here just for the sake of showing what today's new wonderful technology can do and I really appreciated that the film didn't go overboard with that. The running time moves along fairly briskly and the film is involving and interesting from the start and keeps it's energy and charm throughout the running time. There were a few repeated story patterns and clichs in the script but there were also a lot of surprises and new takes on things so that can be forgiven. When looking at a film like this at a child you would like the magic imagination and the story that is woven in front of you with interesting characters environments and a grand sense of storytelling that can make the make believe into a fun and entertaining film. This is all captured very well here and works as a fairy tale for kids 8 to whatever age. A creative enough story helped by good filmmaking and an eye for what kids and adults love about these movies make this film a generally good and above average family fantasy film of the past few years.".

But to my amazement the movie was not only entertaining to both of my boys NO SQUIRMING!!! both my husband and I loved it. My husband wouldn't even get a refill on the popcornand believe me that doesn't happen often!!!! I have nothing negative to say about the film. Some might think it's a little too scarry for younger kids but neither one of mine were scarred. A couple of times I had to explain some things to my 5 year old. The head goblin is kind of scarry looking but not too bad.".

This movie has great acting especially by the dualpart playing Freddie Highmore who loses his British accent quite convincingly. Also Sarah Bolger and MaryLouise Parker do superb jobs with their acting considering it's mostly a fourperson cast. Excluding voice overs The special effects alone are amazing. If you don't like this movie you have to admit the special effects were amazing. If there were a sequel I would most definitely see it as long as it has the same actors special effects team and director.".

I was disappointed. If you don't know this film is based on 5 books. However the movie ignores the 4th book which is probably because of budget issues andor limited running time. Still I can't help but complain. There could've been more creative production designs to see more action and more magical creatures.Apart from that I felt that the film was well put together especially the fact that they skipped a lot in the books. The special effects are very good as well as the action scenes. I also may feel this film pushed the PG rating. It certainly is not as intense as Harry Potter 3 but there might be about 2 to 3 scenes that could make this film a PG13 rating.The performances here are decent although not captivating. The film may be a bit fast paced if you asked me. Overall this is a decent adaption to another fantasy book. If you have read the books you might be disappointed. If you have not enjoy it.".

There also are some scary scenes that are probably too much for small kids but fine for teens on up. In all you get a good mix of horror comedy fantasy and drama all rolled into one odd fantasy story.Child acting star Freddie Highmore who seems to get cast in a lot of these fantasies Charlie And The Chocolate Family August Rush Arthur And The Invisibles and The Golden Compass has a dual role in here playing brothers Jaredand Simon Grace. Freddie is a fine actor so no problem in that department. I hate to hear child actors using God's name as exclamations though but that's not Highmore's doing. The only other annoyance is the frequent shouting with an older sister. However once the adventure kicks into high gear the arguing stops as the kids try to solve their major dilemma as a unit.Nick Nolte plays the big villain Mulgarath. but his role is surprisingly small. It's all those ugly nasty little creatures who surround the house who are the bad guys. There are a number of somewhat scary scenes involving them enough to entertain the postpreadolescent crowd.The star of the film isn't Freddie or the actors or the story.....it's the specialeffects which are very good and a lot of fun to watch from little beings to monsters to fairies to whatever. I saw this on BluRay and it really looks good. All of it is very colorful and entertaining to view making this a film fun for both kids and adults.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie that will definitely plunge the audience young and old  into plenty of filmwatching fun with its strange and fantastical mysteries challenges unpredictable chills and thrills. Examine the Spiderwick Estate with its crumbling mansion that the three Grace children and their mother must now consider as 'home'. Yep a mansion that seems more like a haunted house whispering to be explored and one where invisible eyes seems to watch or stalk at every corner. Yet there's more these family members must need to confront than just a spooky home. The film's introduction to David Stratham's Arthur does give subtle hints of the horrifying events to come but only its ending will eventually expose the dark secrets not only of their family heritage but of the family's burden. Yep this film does have abundance of twists and turns to keep the audience emotionally glued to the screen.Watching Freddie Highmore slip into the roles of the twins Jared and Simon is simply astounding. The film does focus on Jared's rebelliously thoughtless and unpredictable character yep his uncontrollable fits and tempers his raging and bold independence and his unwillingness to cooperate nature so marvelously molded into the story as in Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black's book series offering credible connection to the story's characters and eventful occurrences. I had expected the supporting actors to play fiddle to to the prominence of the main character yet here it's Highmore's Jared who seems to hold the support for the need and purpose of the rest of the characters. The talented young actor exhibits that fabulously well. Just observe how his despair gets from bad to worse to provoke the other characters' reactions and to win over the audience's compassion in seeing him as the victim of injustice! Yep Highmore does lash out his two roles with perfect treatment to reveal the differences in traits and personalities. Well done Highmore! This movie does give a good summary of the book series without going chronically to a tee nor does it exactly flush out everything that follows in the series. Yet the main substances are present cleverly crafted to keep everything dancing and integrated in spectacularly satisfying momentum and perspective for the film version. Director Mark Waters has successfully flashed out even the boggarts' emotional traits and temperaments that are common to Simon's very much in line with the book series. Book fans of the Spiderwick Chronicles will especially be delighted to see Arthur Rackham's book illustrations of Thimbletack the faerie creatures Mulgarath the ogre and his ferociously evil goblins and even the griffin and Hogsqueal come alive on the screen. The voices of all the characters are well articulated succeeding in generating audience appeal and interactions throughout and the scenes are at welldefined pacing to keep the audience's adrenalin flowing. Watch out for the very brief livecameo take of Nick Nolte who provides the voice of Mulgarath. A unique list of intriguing characters presented by a well selected team of performers! A great fun and excitementfilled family film but there exists some really scary and violent visual moments. Parents should take heed when making decisions to bring kids under 8 to see it. It did trigger off some of those memorable highlights of films like Jumanji the Harry Potter and Narnia film series without being condescending in its approach. I was fully swept into it and oh yes I love it!".

Freddie Highmore was great and I am quickly becoming a fan and it was nice to see Mary Louise Parker doing her thing as I think she is very underrated.Go check it out.

Whiny hateful aggressive etc... and NO the breakup of their parents doesn't explain it at all. At least not at this intensity.After the first halfhour I was really like meeeh don't care what happens with them. Another thing that added to that was the bad acting but the adults were not better at all. Maybe that's a subjective matter but I know a lot of movies with child actors and even Freddie Highmore had seen him playing better in other movies so maybe the reason is to find in the script or directing. Then the seemingly repetitive fighting where they could had better invest some time in developing the characters story or the world about the spiderwicks I read in the commentaries there are five books so source material shouldn't have been the problem. All in all the beginning about the book  1P and a few good new ideas here and there another point are the only reasons for me to give it 310 in the end.".

Additionally my kids read the books and said it was an impressive adaptation of all five ! of the books. Having not read them myself the movie still felt coherent without missing any parts.I can't recommend it highly on the basis of its being far too violent and sometimes downright gory. Now I'm not a puritan I like horror movies and my family likes action movies. But the violence was a little too closeup and the monsters too real for a movie described as a family film. We saw closeups of cutopen eyes and exploded heads. My ten year old walked away disturbed and my three year old I thought it would be okay by the trailers spent most of the time with his head underneath my coat. This movie should have been PG13.Action can be good even thrilling. Star Wars Harry Potter and Narnia all had great family friendly action scenes. The difference I realized after thinking about it is that all of the action in this movie was desperate. Not thrilling just outnumbered and kind of awful. When the good guys do win it's sudden and almost random so you feel less like cheering and more like just unclenching your teeth glad that it's over.In addition the nonaction scenes weren't fun either. The dialogue outside the action scenes was almost entirely the family being angry at each other. There may be two laughs in the whole movie. Even the good magical creatures had a kind of sinister look to them. There wasn't a lot to enjoy here. You may walk out of the theater saying the movie was amazing or exciting but you won't be able to say that it was fun.".

The two twins are annoying in the film but the most annoying thing is that there is so much fuss about this book! The addition of the scenes geared towards adult viewers such as the subplot about love and parental separation are not so engaging at all. It is in fact better been left out so that the film is more focused.I thought it was a kids' story but it is far too dark and violent to be enjoyed as a light hearted story.

You need to have some unique imagination in the creatures or the forces they operate under. And you need to have basic narrative shape to the thing.This has none of that. Now this may just be my experience because I made the mistake of seeing it in Imax and when things get bigger you expect the spaces to be filled.

His cinematics are a bit stagebound for my tastes but knows how to shape things so that you go somewhere. Waters the director has done some poor work recently but his first film House of Yes really impressed me. That was based on a play and used the same stagecraft preferred by Sayles. So I thought we'd get something both tasty and nourishing.Alas neither. What do parents think? That you can scrimp on children's imagination and narrative sense and not have them suffer?I suppose a bright parent could say that the story was about stealing a book with lessons in it and the book was destroyed.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

A real disappointment in my opinion because they focused on the kids in terror aspect instead of allowing us to understand the fantasy world a little bit better instead of jolting us for 90 minutes. The basic storyline revolves around a troubled family that movie into an old house and find a book that isguess what not supposed to be opened!! And of course one of the Freddie Highmore characters he plays a dual role of American speaking twins opens it and all hell breaks loose in the fantasy world. The book was written by a man named Spiderwick 80 years earlier and tells of the unseen world and all of it's secrets. An evil character wants the book and a protective character voiced by Martin Short tries to explain the scenario to the child. The rest of the movie the kids are pursued by the evil forces and their goal is to not be killed by it and kill it of course. Sounds like a horror movie doesn't it?? Anyway the last 15 minutes are good but getting there is not fun. This movie was based on a series of books but I find it hard to believe that the series boiled down to this action piece. In my opinion this was Hollywood's attempt to make it marketable and it doesn't work. Too bad because I'm sure this movie disappointed many adults and the kids they brought in to see it.".

I know that not everything from a book can be put on the screen but to change the element of battling wits against the Troll to scream stab squish seemed like a cop out to appeal to the simple viewer. Way too much changed or ignored. A huge disappointment. In the words of my 6 year old son What happened to the Dwarfs and their mechanical dogs?".

I know that not everything from a book can be put on the screen but to change the element of battling wits against the Troll to scream stab squish seemed like a cop out to appeal to the simple viewer. Way too much changed or ignored. A huge disappointment. In the words of my 6 year old son What happened to the Dwarfs and their mechanical dogs?";

Thus far there has been five Spiderwick Chronicle books written by Holly Black  illustrated by Tony DiTerlizzi beginning with The Spiderwick Chronicles The Field Guide 2003 to be honest before watching The Spiderwick Chronicles I had no idea it was based on a series of books  this simply failed to capture my imagination.

The creatures are alright but the bad guy's are defeated a bit too easily including one of the worst send offs for a main villain ever while the friendly creatures are mostly played for failed laughs  I just found the whole affair rather bland going at an hour  a half it moves along at a reasonable pace but it's pretty repetitive  it's a little bit too safe as the character's are never put in much peril  the evil monsters never seemed to pose much threat or menace. As well as a rather complicated fantasy based plot the script tries to raise a few social issues like how parent separation affects children anger management issues  trust but it never made made much of a meaningful impact for me. I suppose The Spiderwick Chronicles might appeal to younger kids but the cuteness of it the safeness  predictability of it made it a bit of a chore for me to sit through  there's a horribly sentimental happy ever after ending that I could have done without. Overall The Spiderwick Chronicles is alright if your under seven years old but maybe it's not one for the adults like me.With a predictably big budget one would expect spectacular CGI effects work  while it's alright it never amazes there's a huge flying Griffin which looks good  the Ogre Mulgarath in his true form at the end looks good too but otherwise all the creatures are quite cuddly  cute with maybe a line in toy's in mind. The CGI is alright but never outstanding while watching The Spiderwick Chronicles I didn't have a clue that both Jared  Simon were played by the same actor which I presume meant the makers uses CGI  split screen techniques to have them both on the screen together.With a supposed budget of about 90000000 I am sure the studio was thinking about a possible series but I doubt there will be anymore or at least anymore mega budget Hollywood productions. Filmed in Montral in Qubec in Canada the production values are glossy  polished as one would expect. The acting is alright nothing special but alright with Nick Nolte making a small cameo appearance.The Spiderwick Chronicles is a typical childish fantasy epic that didn't work for me the effects are alright but not amazing  the plot failed to capture my imagination which was the real killer. Not terrible if your under ten but not very good either  any adults out there might want to just leave the kids to watch it on their own.".

	schema:headline " Too truthful to the book";
	schema:reviewBody "Not long ago De Brief voor de koning  A letter for the King  was voted most popular Dutch children's book ever. The story of Tonke Dragt's book takes place in the Middle Ages. Young Tiuri is to become a knight but as a last task he must stay the night in a church chapel with three other pupils. They must not talk. They must not leave. They must not listen to anybody. Late at night a voice is heard from behind the door. A cry for help! Tiuri is the only one who dares opening the door. Knowing he will not be knighted the morning after he still goes out and helps this stranger. He must bring a secret letter to the king from a foreign country. But is he up to the task? The movie De Brief voor de koning stays true to the book and that turns out to be a bad choice. Things that worked fine in the book suddenly seem not enough to turn it into an exciting movie. As a film the story could have used more tension and perhaps more action. I loved the book. But seeing it as a film... As a sort of road movie most of the scenery looked the same. The locations were beautiful though but the tone of most scenes was rather dark. Only at the end there were scenes filmed in daylight.But the main flaw of this movie is the casting. Yannick van de Velde who did very well in In Oranje is a rather colourless hero. He isn't helped by the dialogue either. It uses polite Medieval sentences which makes it even harder for the audience to live along with his triumphs and disappointments and deprives it from any emotion. To make an audience believe that a young inexperienced boy can complete a dangerous task like Tiuri does you'd expect the hero to have something extra. But Tiuri isn't extremely smart strong or charming. He can fight okay. But he should at least have a dark side  to ignore the rules to win after all when he's outnumbered. How far would he go to complete his task?His sidekick is Piak played by Quinten Schram. He's a young actor known from his two Pietje Bell movies. Quinten doesn't have as much screen time as Yannick but somehow his relationship with Tiuri never comes off the ground. There's hardly a spark between these two and that's a real shame. His haircut looks rather silly.Being a fan of the book for so many years I've always imagined that Hollywood would take up this story. The way it was done now  with a small Dutch budget  is courageous. But it does not do justice to the quality of the book. Brief voor de Koning is a nice attempt to turn one of the most popular Dutch children's books into a movie. But unlike a similar project like Kruistocht in Spijkerbroek Crusade in Jeans  in which the director had the courage to make some remarkable changes in the story to make a good movie translation  this one is a small disappointment. I say small because it isn't a bad movie and maybe the fact that I'm a big fan of the book is in the way of a truly objective movie judgement. In Holland it turned out to be a huge hit at the box office. 65 out of 10".

I really can not understand why the director is being praised for what he created here.Every scene seems to be rushed as if there wasn't enough film in the camera. Like when Piak throws Tiuri his sword. Piak doesn't throw it further than a few feet yet when the camera changes its angle all of a sudden the sword flies another 8 feet. Is it such a bother to just throw that sword a few times more often?And then there are the actors almost all of them the best Holland has to offer and a few of Germany's great. How come none of these fine actors seem to shine in their parts? Isn't it a big part of the directors work to ensure they do their best?Then there are parts of the book that are altered for no good reason. Why doesn't this film start with Tiuri in the chapel? That would have been a great introduction for the main character. A dim lit chapel and then the knock on the door and the cry for help. It is easy to convey a bit a drama to that but it doesn't happen. Vokia is also wounded no idea why he wasn't in the book. And it doesn't quite fit either.There are parts that I liked in this movie. The shots of the landscape through which Tiuri goes are pretty good. The actor that plays Jaro does a good job. And when Tiuri meets the lord of the toll I got an emotional response from this performance even though it doesn't really make sense in light of the book.All in all I just think it is too bad they didn't put some more effort into this. It could have been something if the makers would have just spend some more time in preparing dramatic effect storyboard and a decent script.I sincerely hope they don't ruin another great book by Tonke Dragt.A disappointed fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "After hearing Tonke Dragt's brief voor de koning was about to be filmed I really was looking forward to it. Kruistocht in spuikerbroek showed a dutch filmmaker can do really well. So when I saw the trailer and read about it I hasted myself towards the cinema assuming this would be a great two hours movie.In the beginning all was fine nice locations beautiful costumes all looked like it could be part of the book. But then after ten minutes or so the audio became very irritating with horrible lip syncing. It looked like afterwards in the audio recording studio the director forgot to show the movie and actors had to read their lines straight from paper  at once without retries or any rehearsal. And why didn't any one bother to think about distance?? On film the actors turn their head walk away stand one meter from the camera or ten but the volume is always the same.I guess I could get used to this wasn't it for the horrible stage acting pronunciation. I mean if an actor is on stage he should speak as clear as possible. But hey this is cinema the audio comes from several speakers speak naturally do not overdo it! Then there's the acting how many shots did it take to make this movie only one? Was half of all shooting days wasted on rehearsals? With every single scene I was under the impression the director shouted Great well done! Next one! You can sometimes even see main characters without lines looking around like what am I doing here or hey what kind of lens is that cameraman using? And then the locations though well chosen did anyone really bother to recheck them before filming?? Why are electricity cables running on walls in a medieval setting? And was it so hard to cover up twenty century electricity boxes?? After this I think it was twenty minutes into the movie everything became very annoying. The night shots taken at day time with dark filters but with the sunny shadows so clearly visible. The rare good acting of even fewer actors became bad rapped by bad voice recording.And then halfway through the movie I became angry very angry this was not a movie made to do just to the book or to entertain the audience. It was made so uninspired famous actors had a job and a film crew without any talent could make a full movie.Was it all bad then? No the choice of many locations was great even some actors really tried hard and costume design was great but what remained was this horrible feeling I completely wasted my time money and even worse my good mood. So I left the cinema with an very angry feeling. This movie was an insult a blasphemy of what good cinema is all about. Besides very few efforts it all looked like the makers wanted to make a very very quick buck.But hey this is my opinion. I still would say go see for yourself. But please rent it or much better try to lend it from friends or family or any one who was drunk enough to buy this one because in all honesty the idea the creators of this flick receive any more money makes me sick they should be in the TV business not the film industry.".

So when I saw the trailer and read about it I hasted myself towards the cinema assuming this would be a great two hours movie.In the beginning all was fine nice locations beautiful costumes all looked like it could be part of the book. But then after ten minutes or so the audio became very irritating with horrible lip syncing. It looked like afterwards in the audio recording studio the director forgot to show the movie and actors had to read their lines straight from paper  at once without retries or any rehearsal. And why didn't any one bother to think about distance??

	schema:reviewBody "When filming a book one has the possibility to correct the flaws of the story to make it fit the two hours attention span that the audience needs to have. Reading a book for two weeks immersing yourself in another world is a different feeling than watching a story unfold in front of your eyes.Sadly no one bothered with this book to make it into a believable script. First of all there is a never ending list of invented names kings kingdoms cities knights princes... After the first minute you don't know where you are whom you're watching and even in which country you are. Confusion is created. That goes on with the next scene in which the aspiring knight Tiuri just has to sit quiet in a chapel for one night. Not an impossible task. But with the first knock on the door and a voice whispering for help he opens it and has failed the test. No internal struggle no struggle with the other aspiring knights just plain stupid behaviour.And after this unbelievable act there follow many. If the main character which of course needs to be the one with whom the audience identifies itself takes these kind of inexplicable decisions he never gets any compassion. And he is not the only one with strange behaviour. The scoundrels who rob him let him choose between a ring an a horse and set him free after he has made his choice! Then there are the characterizations. No character gets any depth. No one is tormented by doubt. Every thought is said out loud. The writer helps Tiuri because strange things are happening in the country. Even the red knight that decides not to kill Tiuri after he has saved him from falling of the cliff tells him as if it is a material issue instead of a moral one Now I cannot kill you anymore. Why is his sword stolen? No it's something moral but I'm not sure what it is. The friendship that can evolve between characters who need each other is missed here completely. Tiuri and Piak his yes what? Helper? He never helps him. His companion? They never share anything. They just ride next to one another through the endless woods.The letter in the end turns out to be nothing that couldn't have been told to the king via other ways. The way that the treason is stated by the king He wanted to murder him! is plain painful. We are watching a movie for eight year olds! And even they might be bored. To cast not really beautiful people is not a crime as long as they either can act well or have a devastating charisma. The role of Tiuri a boy we have to watch almost the full two hours is played by the not so handsome Yannick van de Velde and he neither can act very well nor has any charisma of sorts. He is like a spoilt artistic kid from Amsterdam complete with pretentious brawl. His hair is strangely yellow although the whole film the evil people are looking for a boy with brown hair.The rest of the casting is made up of TVactors never taking the time to deliver the lines being used to the just say themregime. With a good script you can get away with that. With this crappy writing you can not. Only exceptions are Jeroen Willems as the Lord of the Toll and the first Broeder Martijn. To take this script these actors and head for eastern Europe with all the medieval rental costumes of Holland voor al uw feesten en partijen no costume seems to be made especially for this movie plus the ugliest wigs ever made borders on hubris. Let's hope this director these producers get punished for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having read the book as a kid I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and because I couldn't watch it immediately my anticipations were only rising.Checking the list of actors in here I stumbled upon some bad reactions this movie didn't entirely deserved in my eyes.First of all this is a film of a children's book you can't expect all blood and gore. Second of all like mentioned in one of the reviews above it's a 2hour movie! You can't expect the characters to get a hold on you the very same way they did in the book you were reading.This movie was more true to the book than Crusade in Jeans which I really didn't like because they've modernized it so much that they deleted a main character for the sake of having a leading woman for the leading man from beginning to end. There was no need to make Piak a girl or for a deep romance between him and the other knights daughter... This is a book of adventure go watch romance if you want romance. This was about bravery not giving up and dangers among the way.The landscapes castles and costumes were great the choice of actors was a bit less good some actors looked like they loved to be there just because now they'd be more famous. But others were really well cast and they all looked the part. The reason why I checked this site in the first place was because I recognized a lot of voices but not the faces. Congrats to the grime indeed! Things I didn't really like but I understand why they did is is the intro I wanted the movie to start and instead I got a history lesson! But then I knew the story already. Other movies start like this like The Golden Compass and I disliked it all the same. But I can understand people would probably appreciate to know a bit of the setting where the story would be before it started.The movie rushed a bit at times for no apparent reason except maybe to save time and keep as much from the book as possible. So yeah maybe I felt rushed from one scene into the next at times but it followed the book so I wasn't too unhappy about it. What I was a bit unhappy about was a scene in the beginning where Knight Edwinen's helper just sends him out without giving him the password that I so loved from the first time I read it and memorized   and the scene at the end where the King doesn't shake his head in disbelieve because he can't understand a word of Tiuri's gibberish and Tiuri tells him he also memorized the spelling in case his pronunciation was wrong. So OK it would have made the movie a bit longer I know but for me I wanted those 2 scenes in there as well.So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10 my childhood memories are mainly in the movie great costumes settings scenes some great actors and fantastic grime this movie was everything my memory told me and so it stayed in tact. But the rushing through scenes the sometimes bad acting and the lacking of the 2 scenes I really wanted to see made it a 7.".

But then I knew the story already. Other movies start like this like The Golden Compass and I disliked it all the same. But I can understand people would probably appreciate to know a bit of the setting where the story would be before it started.The movie rushed a bit at times for no apparent reason except maybe to save time and keep as much from the book as possible. So yeah maybe I felt rushed from one scene into the next at times but it followed the book so I wasn't too unhappy about it. What I was a bit unhappy about was a scene in the beginning where Knight Edwinen's helper just sends him out without giving him the password that I so loved from the first time I read it and memorized   and the scene at the end where the King doesn't shake his head in disbelieve because he can't understand a word of Tiuri's gibberish and Tiuri tells him he also memorized the spelling in case his pronunciation was wrong. So OK it would have made the movie a bit longer I know but for me I wanted those 2 scenes in there as well.So I'm giving it a 7 out of 10 my childhood memories are mainly in the movie great costumes settings scenes some great actors and fantastic grime this movie was everything my memory told me and so it stayed in tact. But the rushing through scenes the sometimes bad acting and the lacking of the 2 scenes I really wanted to see made it a 7.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like The Bow  Kim KiDuk's masterpiece Amen is a story about the human Soul female part of our life energy who is looking everywhere for her consort  the missing Spirit the so called male part the Father. She wanders without a specific purpose and direction barely remembering that she has something important to do and that she MUST find Him. She is calling Him vainly by His name knocking on foreign doors false doctrines. Deep in her heart with her intuition the human Soul knows that once upon a time she had a partner but now she is confused  they are somehow separated she can not remember where is He gone. In the divine state the Soul is unite with the Spirit. In common humans  they are separated. She feels she is lost but He always takes care of her. The Spirit is always near the Soul until the life energy is completely exhausted. There are two lying in one bed one will die the other will live  Gospel of Thomas. In the ancient times people made very clear difference between Soul and Spirit. The Soul Shakti Shekina Prakriti Isis is the flexible life energy we take from the outward world food water sun radiation and we use it for perceiving outward world eating drinking vomiting having sex having abortion killing people playing football watching movies to know good and evil in general. The so called Spirit Siva The Father Purusha Osiris is the primordial steady life energy that we inherit from above. He is like the king in the chessboard. It takes personal effort to know Him. In Amen we may see some parallel with the Cobbler  the Father is alive He is watching over His son's development but everybody thinks He is missing or dead. In the beginning of the human life the ONE life energy is dichotomized  that's why in the Scriptures it is said God made the human being male and female regardless of gender Everybody has immovable hidden male energy usually in the head and flexible curious female energy inside the body sense organs etc. Usually profanes spend all of their energy to perceive the outward world and they never get to the point to know the Father because He is hidden in their inner world  it is more real than common people imagine. Human beings are born like orphans see the apocryphal Gospel of Philip they are Sons of the Widow  they know only their mother Shakti Prakriti Shekina because they are ignorant about the presence of the Father and the possibility to see Him face to face. He is in exile symbolized by the police station in Amen To be able to connect the female and the male part means to restore the primordial divine state. To become immortal god again. Is it possible? Yes the initiated persons follow the methods to reunite the Soul female with the Spirit male. Those sacred methods are called religion or yoga both meaning to reunite and every viable doctrine deals with the ways to do it correctly. With arousal below comes arousal above. The Soul must say that She loves Him see The Great Gatsby and He will forgive her. This so called alchemical marriage hierogamy is the most important goal of the human life. The alchemical marriage happened in the human heart  so called bridal chamber. Unfortunately most of us are educated that the Scriptures are a pile of mambojumbo and that this sacred reunion is impossible. How sad! People let themselves to die like common mortals without knowing the presence of the Father. Without make any effort to reunite the Soul with the Spirit. In Amen like in The Bow Kim KiDuk presents the sad story where this alchemical marriage is inhibited by the ignorance of the Soul. It is the case of 99.99 of human profane population in 21 century.".

When two lengthy scenes in a movie consist largely of footage borrowed from better movies and when both of those scenes could be removed without anyone noticing the break you know that the director's aim was to exert himself as little as possible to get the required length of film in the can. Anyone here with a burning zeal to uphold the reputation of THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU against its boorish detractors is almost certainly exerting more effort on the movie's behalf than Jess Franco ever did.Nevertheless the film is not among the alltime worst. Roger Ebert is correct when he says There's probably a level of competence beneath which bad directors cannot fall....they've got to come up with something that can at least be advertised as a motion picture released and forgotten. It can be safely conjectured that this was just what Jess Franco wanted. The dialogue is passable the acting what little is needed is serviceable and occasionally the editing actually drums up something like tension.So if no one aspect of THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU is really that bad why is watching the whole film such a chore? A bad movie can be difficult to watch but an aggressively mediocre one can be worse. When Roger Corman cranked out his listless paintbynumbers adventures and fantasy movies at least he had the excuses of working with zero budget a cast of thirdstringers and shooting schedules permitting him maybe a week's use of a sound stage. I'm guessing that Franco's budget was scarcely greater but he had a decent cast and enough freedom for location shooting in more than one country. Yet he produced a movie as uninspired and perfunctory as Corman did at his worst. What was Franco thinking?The plot seems almost to go out of its way to abandon consistency. Fu Manchu kidnaps Prof. Heracles and then his doctor because he needs help to make the magic freezing crystals in quantity crystals by the way which also perform the totally unrelated duty of a knockout gas but then even though we see Heracles at the end refuse to help Fu Manchu his refusal doesn't even slow Fu Manchu down who initiates his freezing plan without apparent need for Heracles's assistance. We had seen Fu Manchu demanding a ransom earlier one without bothering to name terms but any idea of actually collecting on the ransom never comes up. Fortunately for the world NaylandSmith shows up to foil his plot to freeze the ocean although Franco can't be bothered to show us how he foils it. We see him beating up some flunkies and trying to contact London by radio then suddenly there's a loud report and soon Fu Manchu is watching helplessly as everything blows up around him. I'm used to villain's fortresses improbably blowing up because the hero fires one wellplaced shot or smashes one control panel but THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU gives us the only case of a villain's fortress exploding merely because the hero makes a longdistance phone call.It's not as though Franco didn't have enough screen time to fill these plot holes. It's just that he decided to fill that time with lengthy establishing shots walking and creeping around dark corridors and tunnels. He also directs his actors to speak as slowly as possible and pause whenever possible. They have excuses I suppose. Fu Manchu is inscrutable being an offensive Oriental stereotype and Omar Pasha is probably stoned out of his mind on opium half the time. The police chief in Istanbul simply doesn't care and spends a good deal of his screen time sulking and telling people not to bother him. And why should he bother doing his job? He's played by Jess Franco after all.With so little actually happening in THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU we have to be content with watching the scenery. There are some beautiful background shots in the film to be sure. Mostly though Franco traps us in Fu Manchu's lair. The quarterhours slip by as the action takes us from one room or chamber to another and another none of them very well lit while Christopher Lee sits and looks smug or stands up and looks smug or even speaks while looking smug. Eventually a lot of people die and Fu Manchu disappears into the billowing fake smoke. Dry ice Rosco fog and blood indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film that was to be the final entry in the new Fu Manchu series from international quickie film financier Harry Alan Towers made its belated theatrical appearance four years after it was made.  In the USA it played the bottom of the bill on the drivein theater circuits.  It crept into theaters sheepishly victim of the commercial and critical thrashing given to its predecessor.  The word in fan circles was that Castle of Fu Manchu was a new low even worse than what had come before.  It would be years before many of these same fans were able to see the film which rapidly disappeared into obscurity until resurrected from its public domain limbo by the home video market.

	onyx:emotionText "The film that was to be the final entry in the new Fu Manchu series from international quickie film financier Harry Alan Towers made its belated theatrical appearance four years after it was made.  In the USA it played the bottom of the bill on the drivein theater circuits.  It crept into theaters sheepishly victim of the commercial and critical thrashing given to its predecessor.  The word in fan circles was that Castle of Fu Manchu was a new low even worse than what had come before.  It would be years before many of these same fans were able to see the film which rapidly disappeared into obscurity until resurrected from its public domain limbo by the home video market.

	schema:reviewBody "It is 1969. Your on your way back to your car at the driveinn where your fianc is happily sleeping off her double shift at the diner and you are about halfway through a film  Folterkammer des Dr. Fu Man Chu Die or the Castle of Fu Manchu  which has already put you through two bags of popcorn and 3 cokes because the popcorn is just so much more interesting and the worst happens  you can't find your car. Nightmares flash through your mind  maybe your fianc was so annoyed by the cruelty of your decision to force her into a late night driveinn triple feature full of Sax Rohmer films so she drove off or maybe the film got her so upset that she drove off the nearest bridge. Trying to get a hold of yourself you look up to the screen to verify that you're at the right part of the drive in. No help all you can see is a smear of dark blue and dark red shadow across the lower part of the screen. After a minute or so the lighting crew finds the onswitch and some out of focus people show up on the screen. They appear to be three Shriners sneaking up on an Imam who has just begun his afternoon prayer. Still no help. You resign yourself to the fate natural selection has accorded you. You  after all decided to see this film with your intended reproductive partner and that choice has probably ruined your opportunity to allow your genetic material to be carried on in the next generation of humans. So you decide to move to California to buy that house on the side of hill overlooking the San Andreas fault where you always wanted to live and to pursue your dream to rekindle the Fu Manchu series this film killed. More power to you. To be fair I did not see the touted Blue underground DVD version of the film. Supposedly this pressing is so much better than what I saw that it is incomparable.Even my television objected to this film. It kept trying to turn itself off switch channels etc. It even unplugged the cable converter for a few minutes. Whoever it was that decided that Sax Rohmer's various Bgrade stories ought to be made into movies should be forced to watch all of them in a row  at least once. As they say garbage in garbage out. These films are a decidedly acquired taste. And this one is even more difficult to acquire a taste for than Sumuru... httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0061976usercomments8Peruse the IMDb reviews  you will notice that most of the people who write positive reviews for this film do not describe the plot. There are two interrelated reasons for this  1 there isn't one to be described and 2 they've never seen the film and simply get a perverse pleasure believing that their opinions might be taken seriously enough to convince people to see the film a poor assumption at best. Christopher Lee plays Fu Manchu  an inexplicably powerful meanie who wants something from all of the world's governments we are never privileged with the knowledge of what in particular he wants but I couldn't care less anyway and is threatening to freeze the world's oceans to get it. The technology he is using has been developed by a dying scientist who he has kidnapped and soon he finds himself having to kidnap a surgeon in order to arrange a heart transplant as well. There are various fight scenes which don't appear to be related to the film and may indeed have been found on a cutting room floor somewhere in the Middle East or even reused from a previous Rohmer feature I really expected Sumuru some of her army of Amazon ninjas or even Frankie Avalon to show up at one point. There are also a few scenes with Lee standing around looking ominous and using that great voice of his. I am not sure he knew what was going on in the rest of the film and indeed with that voice it doesn't matter but these scenes are nonetheless the ONLY remotely entertaining aspect of the film. And OH YES lest I forget there are a few inept 007s who were likely rejected from the extras audition for Casino Royal making some roughly British sounding noises and taking all of this way too seriously.I didn't think it was possible but this film was even more difficult to get through than Manos Hands of Fate and quite possibly should replace it as the worst film of all time. httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0060666usercomments419To state what in particular is wrong with TCODFM is an easy task  EVERYTHING. The acting is mediocre the plot is idiotic the cinematography and editing are so bad that I don't believe TRYING to make a hideous mess of a film would net you anything worse. You'll either laugh hysterically or stare at your screen until you start drooling unless you take my advice and avoid this. Why did I watch it? I enjoy challenges.".

I don't really understand the universal dislike though as this one really didn't seem to warrant this level of abuse. Don't get me wrong it has problems. The script being a pretty obvious one. The story was very difficult to comprehend. It involved the master criminal Fu Manchu devising a method of turning the oceans into ice by using opium or something. And by way of this he would take over the world. Okay whatever you say! Yeah so admittedly the narrative is a bit senseless.But the thing is I've seen a lot of Jess Franco movies and I thought this was quite coherent by his standards! In fact it was from a period in Franco's career where he had more production value at his disposal so again when people say this is ultracheap I'm thinking it's quite big budget for Jess. I mean he has even managed to hire Christopher Lee for the title role  I thought he was pretty imposing and well suited to the character to be fair. We also have Rosalba Neri as a gangster chick and she is always worth watching so again this is a good thing. Even the blatant lifts from other movies were entertaining enough such as the whole opening scene that utilises scenes taken wholesale from A Night to Remember. Maybe the pacing could have been better perhaps but this is a constant Franco fault and in here it's no worse than usual. But overall the film while being often senseless did have enough action and Euro cult value to keep me watching. Ultimately I am probably the idiot for liking this but I guess I'll just have to live with that.".

I should have expected it coming from Jess Franco the schlockmaster of Eurotrash but I wasn't even prepared for the intense pain that this film caused.  What in the hell was Christopher Lee thinking?  Granted he has been in some bombs but this has got to be the very bottom of the barrel.

I often wonder how actors can hold their heads up after appearing in films of this caliber....it must be absolutely humiliating.The faults of Castle are just too numerous to mention but a few of them go something like this  they were obviously having power failures during filming since the shots are either totally dark or green the actors can't act even Lee is bad here and the badly written dialogue often doesn't match the action the fight scenes involving overweight over age Greene are embarrasing to watch the premise of the story freezing the oceans or whatever they were attempting to dois feeble  and then there is the doorway to eternity which leads to the front porch! Huh?So......if you are looking for a movie so bad that it is good this is not the one.  Watch Plan 9 From Outer Space for those kinds of laughs.

	schema:reviewBody "Castle of FuManchu The 1968  12 out of 4The fifth and final film in Christopher Lee's FuManchu series is considered by many to be the worst but I personally found it so bad that I was able to have a little fun with it. The film has FuManchu Lee once again trying to take over the world and by now you might be asking when the guy is just going to give up and go home. Anyway this time he plans on freezing all the oceans in the world so he kidnaps a doctor to perform an operation on the one man who knows how to do such a thing. THE CASTLE OF FUMANCHU isn't a good movie so you shouldn't go into the film expecting anything other that pure silliness. There's no question this is a bad movie but thankfully it's bad enough to be mildly entertaining but I'm sure most people will be smart enough to hit the eject button by the thirtyminute mark. Once again Lee appears to have only enough energy to cash a paycheck as he's obviously not too thrilled about doing this picture. As in the previous film Lee pretty much just sleepwalks through the film and offers up very little energy. The supporting cast includes Gunther Stoll playing the doctor Jose Manuel Martin as an opium dealer and cult favorite Rosalba Neri playing an assassin. These supporting players are certainly one of the few good things in the film. The film has a bigger budget than most Franco pictures but that's not saying too much because we still get all sorts of cheapness including some stock footage from the Titanic picture A NIGHT TO REMEMBER which certainly doesn't mix well with any of the new footage. The film does have some decent cinematography but there's just not enough here to make it worth viewing. Fans of Lee Franco or FuManchu are bound to be disappointed with this film which turned out to be the last in the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "dreadful. This total mess of a movie makes as little sense as our modern tax code and is as hard to pick your way through.Basically we have Christopher Lee doing some of his worst work ever dressed in Chinese drag and a terrible makeup job that doesn't make him look oriental but does make him look pretty gay. He drones on in a monotone as the dreadfully evil Fu Manchu sucking the air out of the room in every scene he's in. The only thing I can think that is oriental about him is the obvious opium addiction because he must have been high on SOMETHING to help him get through this stinker. Plus his eyes are pretty glazed. That could be just boredom however. Couldn't blame him if it was.The plot such as can be made out of it is that ol' Fu has acquired a way to turn the world's oceans to ice and is using that as his threat to make the world's government's kowtow to him a la Dr. Evil. Unfortunately this scientist with the silly name who's the only one who can help him make this device has a heart problem and is at the edge of death. So Fu kidnaps an English heart specialist and makes him perform the world's first heart transplant. They never show on screen whether there was any tissue typing of any kind so the scientist could easily have rejected the unwilling donor heart. Oh wait that would require the plot to make sense and be coherent and it's not having anything to do with that no sirree. In the meantime Fu's killed the governor of a province in TurkeyI think and stolen his castle with the aid of a girl who he promptly locks up in the dungeon. I was never sure about her role in this film but like so many other things it was a loose end that never really got resolved. It might have been Turkey or it might have been a huge Shriner's convention I can't be sure.To convince the English heart doctor to go through with the surgery Fu obliquely threatens his girlfriend by blowing up a dam. A pretty puzzling way to carry out a death threat but o.k. This scene like so many of the others in this movie was unnecessarily long and tedious. They should have called it the Sleep Aid of Fu Manchu that would have been closer to the actual substance of the film.Fu's enemy is a bland English guy with zero charm and a habit of blending into any background like a chameleon. I wasn't even totally sure of his name throughout most of the film. James Bland I think it was.Anyhoo Fu's plan is foiled and his castle blown upI was never sure how or by whothe editing's pretty bad at the end. The doctor and his girlfriend escape through the sewers which couldn't stink more than this movie. The boring hero type drags the heart patient scientist out the front way and the movie comes to its incoherent end with no idea on the part of the viewer about what was going on for the last hour and a half. There aren't words enough to describe how bad this film was at least not in the English language. Maybe in Mandarin? We should ask Fu Manchu eh? Oh wait he probably doesn't speak any Chinese dialects being British and all..".

The screenplay is incredibly dumb and the film contains some of the cheesiest moments in history.

If I didn't know any better I would think that Franco rips off Titanic 30 years before it was made! The acting is weak poor Christopher is very uninterested there's no sleaze and not even a bit of humor. Jess Franco honored himself by playing an insignificant supporting role while he can't even handle the directing properly. This film is so bad that even the exhilaratingsounding titles are fake!

It's not only notorious schlock producer Harry Alan Towers at his worse he got the notorious Jess Franco to direct a director who didn't make many good or even merely okay movies during his prolific career. There are many things wrong with the end results. It's really cheap from the tacky sets to blatant use of stock footage. The actors including even Christopher Lee seemed bored and demoralized to be there. It's frequently poorly photographed and lit. But the biggest problem with the movie is that it's unbelievably boring. There's almost no action and the character of Fu Manchu not only doesn't show up very often he doesn't do that much that's interesting. The movie is a pretty painful slog to sit through and long before the end you'll be thankful that Fu Manchu was retired from the big screen for the next eleven years before he returned one more time in the 1980 comedy The Fiendish Plot Of Dr. Fu Manchu  which was almost as bad as this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the roundly derided 'Blood of Fu Manchu' director Jess Franco once again tackles Sax Rohmer's indomitable moustache twirling super villain. Richard Greene 'guest stars' as sleuth Nayland Smith and Howard Marion Crawford in his last performance plays second hand man silly old Professor Petrie.As Fu Christopher Lee is exactly as you would expect  clipped precise and cool. Under impressive oriental makeup he conveys moments of anger complacency and effective degrees of evil.

Lisa is a duplicitous and beautiful creation often dressed in a suit She fights like a man  and yet like everyone else here she is fearfully underwritten and little more than a cypher.Added to that much of the stock footage that provides the more spectacular moments is generously scooped from other productions notably a dambusting scene from 'Campbell's Kingdom' from twelve years earlier.Despite a strong start this soon dissolves into the kind of muddled plotting that blighted 'Blood' previously. Although I actually found this slightly more entertaining than that previous film it is still difficult to maintain interest in events when both storyline and characters are so sketchy.A further entry into the Fu Manchu series was contracted but due to the drubbing 'Castle' received both critically and commercially Fu's promise that 'the world will hear from me again' remains unfulfilled. With a fairly generous budget most likely due to the further involvement of Harry Alan Towers and a good cast it seems to me that Franco just wasn't interested in telling a story about Fu Manchu  and subsequently the audience felt the same way about paying to watch it.".

Richard Greene 'guest stars' as sleuth Nayland Smith and Howard Marion Crawford in his last performance plays second hand man silly old Professor Petrie.As Fu Christopher Lee is exactly as you would expect  clipped precise and cool.

	schema:headline " The last of the Fu Manchu movies starring Christopher Lee";
	schema:reviewBody "I can understand why this is the last of the films but I have to wonder how five of these things got made. I am guessing that the other films were a bit better as even the Dracula films that Lee starred in started to go down in quality as the series progressed but even so none of them were as badly done as this film was. I have never seen any of the other Fu Manchu films so I really cannot say for sure if the quality in them is any better. The whole premise of the films just does not seem very good as they are all focused on the villain rather than the hero. It is like if in the James Bond films had the exact same enemy every time and Bond was more behind the scenes and did not really do much. The action is nearly nonexistent and the same can be said for the plot too. There are also periods when the color of the film will change and then there are a couple of scenes that looks as if they are from other movies included here as well. Just a huge mess of a film then again it is the fifth film of the series. Back in the day sequels generally garnered less money than their predecessors so the budget would continually get cut so that may explain some of it but not the totality of it! The story shows Fu Manchu sinking a boat with some new process that creates ice in the water wow that is so new and innovative. The boat he sinks seems to be a part of a different film. It is in this scene that one of his henchmen tries to stop Manchu by refusing to pull a lever. The diabolical Fu Manchu has servants who will die for him by letting a doctor remove their heart but a lever is too much! Soon he takes over a castle and Nayland Smith is off to Istanbul to stop the evil madman! I guess James Bond is way too busy stopping way more nefarious villains so the more bureaucratic Nayland Smith is sent instead because you do not really need anyone with the skill set of Bond to take out this villain! Doctors are kidnapped and a dam that also seems like it is in another film is collapsed before we reach the awesome conclusion where no one really does all that much to stop Fu Manchu's plans.This made for a rather good episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 which is how I saw the movie. When I got the set of DVDs containing this episode I thought this may have been one of those films that was borderline good that they have done over the years. Seeing Christopher Lee was the star is one of the main reasons. I generally love seeing him in anything however this film was really bad. I only give it a two because of Lee. The jokes are aplenty but I do believe they exaggerated how bad this film was. It was not worse than Monstera Go Go or quite a few others they have done. Just kind of a poorly edited film that liked to change color schemes a bit too much.So this is not really a good film and it did mark the final film of the Christopher Lee Fu Manchu films. Lee is a fine actor but he is also one of those actors of a bygone era where they actually felt that acting was a job so they appeared in as many movies as possible. Today there are stars that will appear in a film and not do so again for multiple years. I cannot speak for the other films but if this is as low as they got I somehow doubt the other films are Oscar worthy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fifth and final of Christopher Lee's FuManchu outings  a planned sixth film was cancelled due to its overwhelmingly poor critical and commercial reception  and the second to be directed by schlockmeister Jess Franco. Played as a parody 'Castle' might actually have been quite fun. FuManchu is essentially reduced to a poor knockoff of a Blofeld though I'm not sure he was ever much else. Lee actually brings his Agame here having phoned it in previously in the series lifting the ludicrous dialogue to the point where it's almost palatable but everything else about the film seems to be mocking itself without knowing it. The production design is so camp it makes The Ipcress File look like The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. The action and violence is again tepid and clumsy lest we forgot this is a Jess Franco film and the plot manages to be confusing in spite of being threadbare. There are some babes thrown in but this is a PG movie so again Franco fans expecting anything resembling titillation will be thoroughly disappointed. Unlike its predecessor which is by far the more insipid and dreary of the two 'Castle' has a handful of things going for it. One is Jess Franco in a supporting role wearing a fez and dubbed to sound like I don't really know. The score is totally derivative but actually rather nice. The wacky production design and multicoloured fluorescent lighting add a lot of hammy fun. The attempt at seamless inscene cutting between the various disparate filming locations is endlessly amusing. Some of the dialogue is hilariously quotable and played to the hilt by everyone involved. Frankly though the two high points of the show are the sizeable inserts from A Night To Remember and Campbell's Kingdom. While definitely a cut above its predecessor in some ways I'm still struggling to give this any kind of recommendation.".

The caverns below the Castle of Fu Manchu are full of psychedelic lights green red purple smoke and water are pumped into them while the heroes must runs for their lives  it turns out to be quite some compensation.

	schema:reviewBody "Evil Oriental mastermind Fu Manchu CHRISTOPHER LEE and his daughter in crime Lin Tang TSAI CHIN return to their ancestral China from where they plot their latest diabolical scheme for world domination. First they create an explosion causing a rocky mountain to subside thus creating the illusion that all communications have been cut off between the village that neighbors Fu Manchu's palace and Shanghai. Secondly they abduct a renowned plastic surgeon called Dr Lieberson WOLFGANG KIELING and force him to create a double of Nayland Smith DOUGLAS WILMER. The real Smith is subsequently abducted and brought to Fu Manchu's palace. Meanwhile the double who is a prisoner under a deep state of hypnosis kills Smith's housekeeper and is subsequently arrested tried and hanged for the crime. Fu Manchu is delighted as the whole world thinks that Nayland Smith was a psychopathic killer and his reputation is posthumously ruined. While all this is going on Fu Manchu will have the pleasure of murdering the real Smith on the quiet. A wanted American criminal mastermind called Rudolph Moss NOEL TRETHARNAN has recently arrived at Fu Manchu's palace with a pact signed by the world's criminal bosses agreeing to the Yellow Peril becoming their leader. Fu Manchu plans to use Dr Lieberson to create further doubles of all the criminals' enemies and give them the same treatment as he intends for Nayland Smith. Smith must escape clear his name and stop an international murder spree erupting.THE VENGEANCE OF FU MANCHU was the third of producer Harry Alan Towers' series of international productions starring Christopher Lee as Sax Rohmer's fiendish Oriental mastermind. Don Sharp had directed the first two films in the series but Jeremy Summers took over for this one entry. Summers was essentially a TV director who occasionally made feature films. These include the Gerry  The Pacemakers movie FERRY CROSS THE MERSEY 1965 and the Tony Hancock vehicle THE PUNCH AND JUDY MAN 1964. On TV he has directed episodes of such British cult classics as JASON KING and RANDALL  HOPKIRK DECEASED as well as contributing to notable UK soap operas such as CORONATION STREET and BROOKSIDE. Summers' father was Walter Summers who directed the notable Bela Lugosi horror film THE DARK EYES OF London 1939. Incidentally this was the first film in the UK to receive the H for horrific certificate in Britain. The film marks first step down the slippery slope of the series' degeneration into becoming shambling nonsense. The script is both poorly plotted and confused. Matters are not helped by an unwise emphasis on torture and sadism like when Fu Manchu brands Liebrson's daughter MARIA ROHM with a branding iron in order to force him to carry out his demands. These scenes are disheartening and make one wish for the return of the light direction of Don Sharp in THE FACE OF FU MANCHU 1965. The production also has the air of being a halfhearted effort all round as most of the performances are all at best average with the possible exception of Tsai Chin whose portrayal of Lin Tang is still undeniably evil without any sign of remorse in her actions. The direction is coherent and wellpaced which saves the picture from being a complete disaster but shows little enthusiasm for the material. The film wasn't particularly successful but Towers was able to squeeze out two more and even worse sagas featuring Fu Manchu. They were THE BLOOD OF FU MANCHU and THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU 1968 which were shot back to back by Spanish director Jess Franco. This series could have lasted for a long time if they had referred back to the original source for plots rather than trying to invent their own.".

For reasons unknown Summers chose to shoot with live sound on Hong Kong's nonsoundproofed stages and in the sceneof a delicate medical operation conducted supposedly in the bowels of a Tibetan temple construction noises and traffic sounds are clearly audible.The part of nominal star Christopher Lee is essentially an extended cameo. Instead the film highlights Maria Rohm Towers' Germanborn wife who has never made a film for anyone but her husband.  Here she has one of her showiest roles as a nightclub singer wearing a variety of glamorous costumes and lip syncing two awful songs performed on the soundtrack by Samantha Jones.Ironically this would be the only film in the series given USA release through a major distributor Warner Brothers.  But they held it low regard a number of release prints were struck in black and white and it played on the bottom half of a double bill with The Shuttered Room.".

	schema:reviewBody "Try try try again. That should be evil super mastermind Fu Manchu's motto. After one failed attempt after another that pretty much ends up in his hideout  palace spectacularly exploding for his credit he always returned on his quest for world domination. As each scheming plot being more diabolical than the last but the quality of these features were also on the slide. Same formula but wellworn. Despite Christopher Lee returning dressed up in makeup as Fu Manchu his presence seemed lacking with a script that didn't really offer him all that much to do. The Vengeance of Fu Manchu would be the third film internationally produced by Harry Alan Towers but director Don Sharp of the previous two films is replaced and it shows in the final product. Vengeance isn't all that bad but it's bounded by feeble writing and lackadaisical direction for most part making it quite an uninterestingly limited and convoluted venture. The story follows Fu Manchu and his daughter return to China to his isolated palace hideaway in the hills where he plots his vengeance against his arch rival commissioner Neyland Smith of Scotland Yard while hosting a criminal diplomat for gaining support to lead the world's criminals. While this had two subplots within the narrative neither one projected much excitement with its elaborate developments and the location work felt rather stagy with less adventure and scope. The local Hong Kong locations were done through Shaw Brother studios. Director Jeremy Summers brought a crisply polished tinge but the execution is drably projected with a less than speedy pace. Too few hardy setpieces but its misogynistic edge is still evident in some torture sequences. The performances are decent. Douglas Wilmer admirably acquits himself as Neyland Smith and Howard MarionCrawford gives a finetuned performance as his friend Dr. Petrie.

	onyx:emotionText "Try try try again. That should be evil super mastermind Fu Manchu's motto. After one failed attempt after another that pretty much ends up in his hideout  palace spectacularly exploding for his credit he always returned on his quest for world domination. As each scheming plot being more diabolical than the last but the quality of these features were also on the slide. Same formula but wellworn. Despite Christopher Lee returning dressed up in makeup as Fu Manchu his presence seemed lacking with a script that didn't really offer him all that much to do. The Vengeance of Fu Manchu would be the third film internationally produced by Harry Alan Towers but director Don Sharp of the previous two films is replaced and it shows in the final product. Vengeance isn't all that bad but it's bounded by feeble writing and lackadaisical direction for most part making it quite an uninterestingly limited and convoluted venture. The story follows Fu Manchu and his daughter return to China to his isolated palace hideaway in the hills where he plots his vengeance against his arch rival commissioner Neyland Smith of Scotland Yard while hosting a criminal diplomat for gaining support to lead the world's criminals. While this had two subplots within the narrative neither one projected much excitement with its elaborate developments and the location work felt rather stagy with less adventure and scope. The local Hong Kong locations were done through Shaw Brother studios. Director Jeremy Summers brought a crisply polished tinge but the execution is drably projected with a less than speedy pace. Too few hardy setpieces but its misogynistic edge is still evident in some torture sequences. The performances are decent. Douglas Wilmer admirably acquits himself as Neyland Smith and Howard MarionCrawford gives a finetuned performance as his friend Dr. Petrie. A methodical Lee is given small opportunities and so is and effective Tsai Chin's maybe even more so minor as Manchu's sadistic daughter. Horst Frank venomously overdoes Lee in the evil stakes and a beautiful Maria Rohm flaunts around. Patchy serial comicstrip entertainment.";

Can't say that the movie moves up a level though if I compare it to its predecessors. The 3rd one of the series was the first one not directed by Don Sharp it was most likely not made with the same production time and budget and the story is mildly put simple. Fu Manchu wants revenge on his personal enemy Nayland Smith and afterwards achieve world domination of course. Some unnecessary things are stretching the story to 80 minutes such as the tavern brawl with the sailors or the introduction of Horst Frank as an additional villain. Fu Manchu asks him to do the torturing for one day as if he thought he must give this character something to do. Peter Carsten gets a better role as a gangster who is joining the good guys after his downfall. Although it is impressive to see the impersonator of Nayland Smith become a murderer under Fu Manchu's command showing absolutely no emotion and not saying a word during his trial one can't help wondering why the judge and lawyers didn't think he might be hypnotized or something like that. Did they just think he must be the shy type of guy who doesn't talk much? The green misty hills of Ireland are posing successfully for China again compliments for the choice of locations. Voted 78574 for the five movies.".

Indeed Sax Rohmer's books  initially a trilogy in the mid1910s before several more appeared in the '30s  were borne out of a xenophobia for East Asia grandly termed 'the Yellow Peril' and were offensive to some even then. Surprisingly the character himself rarely showed up in his own franchise. Most of the action followed his enemies the Holmes and Watson avatars Sir Denis NaylandSmith and Dr Petrie in a series of exotic ludicrously pulpy plots.The 1960s saw contentious producer Harry Alan Towers revive the character for a cycle of five independent British films so cheesy that the ushers must have handed out crackers on the way in. Christopher Lee  best known at the time of course as Dracula in several wonderfully schlocky Hammer productions  played Fu Manchu in yellowface in what basically amounted to a series of extended cameos. The Holmes and Watson connection remained with the starring of Douglas Wilmer who had played Holmes on television for the BBC and Howard MarionCrawford who had been Watson to Ronald Howard's Holmes in the drily amusing 1954 TV series. This third film jettisoned the director of the first two films Don Sharp and replaced him with Jeremy Summers who had made the deservedly obscure Gerry and the Pacemakers film Ferry Cross the Mersey but also episodes of many of my favourite ITC series.The plot in this one is thin but does the business sure enough. After previous encounters with his English foe Fu Manchu is so hungry for vengeance  hence the title  that he forces a plastic surgeon to change one of his servants into a doppelgnger for Nayland Smith. As the servant is also Oriental we get a reverse Gustav Graves from Die Another Day.Is it me or do many of these badguys make the most unreasonable demands? So while the real Nayland Smith is captured and brought to Fu Manchu's wilderness lair the lookalike replaces him moves around like a robot and commits murder. He is then arrested tried and scheduled to hang thereby ruining Nayland Smith's reputation as one of England's finest. Fu Manchu plans to do this to several other prominent lawenforcers across the world thus undermining that whole law and order thing that bothers him so much. Meanwhile he plays host to a seedy man in a cowboy hat who is apparently  and this bit I loved  the Ambassador of the American Underworld.There's a fair bit of filler of course  a boring meeting with Interpol a nonsensical fight on a boat a sprawling bar fight with sailors an FBI character who does nothing at all and an unnecessary lounge number  but there is some surprising shots of the Chinese mountains and a couple of exciting ninja scenes which while doing nothing for the Bruce Lee fan does bring the energy up. Christopher Lee is listless as ever while Douglas Wilmer somehow keeps his dignity while he is bundled into a crater a prison cell and a hay cart and inexplicably walks around with what appears to be a door around his neck. It's all wonderfully silly and despite lagging at some points is exciting enough. As long as you're in the mood for some cheesy fun it's worth a watch.".

I mean how many times can we go through the same old 'kidnapped scientist' scenario? Still there are a few minor thrills and chuckles to be had for those of us who are fans of this kind of '60s wackiness and of course the nostalgia to be had from any of the items from this jampacked decade of cinematic obscurities.This time around the comic book style is even more apparent than normal with a bare minimum of plot merely serving as a basis for a series of fights scraps and one or two huge brawls. Once again these fight scenes are a lot of fun but there are lots of other familiar ingredients in the film to enjoy too. These include strangulation hypnotism a fairly explicit decapitation some torture the rack and branding irons are brought into play and much much more. Obviously the changing more liberal attitudes of the decade are evident here in the increased violence content and now evil Chinese minions are stabbed on screen instead of off.The acting is all up to standard and if the characters are clichd at least they're fun. Douglas Wilmer reprises his role as the heroic Nayland Smith this time with grey hair after his tiring skirmishes with the yellow peril and his wooden acting is spot on when he has to play a mindless double of his real self. Tsai Chin is wicked as Fu Manchu's daughter while Christopher Lee has better makeup this time around his slanted eyes are far more prominent and is fun as always.

This is the most interesting from a historical perspective.You have to place yourself in the era a huge percentage of the population believed that the world was in a time of change for the better and this change had something to do with the overlap of free sex drugs some astrological appropriateness and the end of war. At the same time the American government was hammering back on all fronts while the Dutch and Danish governments were seemingly alone in supporting all four.Coming out of Denmark were a series of porn comedies this being the first. I understand the others are more pornish and less comedic but this is something else Woodstock porn.The story is that some astrological time and place a feeling of love is supposed to occur. Two scientists appear in the town one with a drug to minimize the effect and another with a drug that enhances it. In fine Shakespearean fashion the two drugs get mixed up with the enhancing one ending in the water supply.Our field of focus is a girl's school which looks a lot like a nunnery. The main action is of the girls after imbibing the drug and attacking the scientists and other males from the town. Along the way is a psychedelic dream and the ending romp in the reservoir straight out of Hair except everyone is nude and having explicit sex.Unlike the porn of today this is joyful and ecstatic. At the very end the two scientists spy on the clearly pregnant schoolgirls and are pleased with their obvious pregnancies ten apiece. The joyful nature of the thing the drugs the ordinariness of the girls wouldn't happen today nor any time outside of that brief period of hippydom. Sure it is porn but accidentally. This is hippy cinema first.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first of the notorious Danish astrological series. While I wouldn't really recommend this whole series which eventually turned into latterday spy spoofs featuring one Agent 69 it's definitely worth checking one of them out since you're probably unlikely to see a films like this anywhere elseif you don't happen to Danish anyway and this one is probably as good of as any. These films are kind of halfway between softcore sexploitation comedy and harcore porn. Like the former they are fairly long on plot and have relatively high production values. They also have some respectable actors in nonsex roles although since they're Danish no one will probably recognize them. Like hardcore porn films though they do have some obviously unsimulated sex scenes like one girl with her tongue in another girl's rectum in the first five minutes of the movie!.Due to astrological events the planet Venus is going to come very close to the earth which the state authorities suspect is going to have adverse erotic effects on the innocent virgins at one particular school for delinquent girls. I'm not sure why this event would only affect one single girls' school in Denmark or how these girls can be both delinquents and innocent virgins but you kind of have to go with it. Unbeknownst to the authorities the girls at the school are ALREADY a bunch of crazed lesbian nymphos but an agent is duly sent to deliver a drug that will lower the libido of the girls. Unfortunately when he gets to town and asks for directions he ends up at the WRONG house full of young girls the local brothel and even worse manages to get his formula mixed with that of a mad scientist who has invented a powerful aphrodesiac. You can imagine what happens.Aside from one rather unpleasant girlongirl gang rape scene this movie has a surprisingly innocent tone not unlike the silly British sex comedies of that era but obviously it is much stronger stuff as far as the sex goes. The real drawback of the graphic sex scenes though is the movie has somewhat skankierlooking girls than the Scandinavian lovelies that went to Britain to make tamer British sex comedies or Germany to make the softcore schulmadchenreport type films or that appeared in less graphic Scandinavian movies. There is no one in this movie that looks like Christine Lindberg or Marie Lilljhedahl or Yutte Stensgaard girls that look like that generally don't have to put their tongues in each other's rectums to get movie roles. Interestingly Anna Bergman the pretty daughter of renowned Swedish director Igemar Bergman appeared in some of the later films in this series but she used a body double for the graphic sex.This is definitely a weird film and perhaps worth seeing simply for that reason. As Jack Stevenson wrote in his recent book Scandinavian Blue this film and others in this series are kind of like hardcore porn for the whole family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Abolishing all cinema censorship ahead of their Swedish neighbors Denmark opened the floodgates for skin and sin to run rampant on local movie screens. As John Hilbard's tremendously popular BEDSIDE series featuring comedian Ole Sltoft bumbling his way Jerry Lewis style through a variety of illsuited professions was showing signs of running out of steam producer Anders Sandberg snapped up their star for what was to become a serious box office rival. Commonly referred to as the ZODIAC series each episode was built around a separate star sign grinding to a halt after only six signs. Sandberg had earned his stripes as production manager on US expat Vernon P. Becker's 1971 simulated smash hit DAGMAR'S HOT PANTS before turning into one of the country's most prolific porn producers. Testing the waters with Ole Ege's BORDELLO he realized that Scandinavian middle classes took hardcore imagery in their stride with nary a raised eyebrow so he would soon surround Sltoft with primitive porn professionals plying their trade.The first of the series still stays stubbornly soft however with only an occasional and invariably flaccid member intruding on the parade of foxy female flesh. Cunningly rechristened DANISH PASTRIES once the surprisingly above average English dub's producer Robert Sumner who went on to fund several of Chuck Vincent's '80s classics and director Richard D'Antoni perpetrator of such unpretentious fornication fare as CAMPUS GIRLS and TEENAGE CHEERLEADERS got through with it it follows the frantic misadventures that inevitably occur when an experimental aphrodisiac for a bordello and a libido suppressant intended for a nearby all girls school get mixed up. See members of the Copenhagen University's department of astronomy have noticed the approaching passage of Venus and well aware of the ruckus this caused back in 1769 on the island of Tahiti they're not taking any chances this time. An emissary the naive and less than adequate Armand Sltoft is dispatched to the minute Danish hamlet housing both school and whorehouse supplying the suppressant to the former and staying well away from the latter. Meanwhile horny scientist Professor Bomwitz Bent Warburg has arrived at the same town to test his aphrodisiac. Identical suitcases are dutifully switched and voil ! The movie was competently made by Finn Karlsson a proper film school graduate turned journeyman director best known for his 1969 naughty box office blast STINE AND THE BOYS starring local sex kitten Sisse Reingaard. Jack of all trades Werner Hedman took over the reins for subsequent episodes as IN THE SIGN OF THE VIRGIN rather surprisingly proved Karlsson's final filmmaking assignment though he would continue to work throughout the decade in menial peripheral jobs on several sets. An alleged drinking problem may have rendered him hard to employ and almost certainly contributed to his untimely death in 2003 aged merely 66.The time frame which is the turn of the last century allows for elaborate costuming adding luster to lust. Sltoft remains all buttoned up but Warburg half of what was to become Denmark's busiest porno pair lets it all hang out in simulated sex scenes some with wife Anne Bie playing not the school's tormented new girl Geminette as some sources erroneously claim who's portrayed by ravishing one shot wonder Eva Lindberg instead but the first of the students to sense the effect of the Professor's concoction and making him the immediate beneficiary thereof. Mr. Warburg has a particularly memorable dream sequence that's tricky to describe wandering buck naked among enlarged lady parts all set to a chintzy rendition of Ravel's Bolero which weirdly predates a similar spectacle from Chuck Vincent's 1978 VISIONS. The student body contains several starlets who would willingly comply with Danish dirty movies' demands for increased intimacy. The two girls sharing a lesbian liaison in the opening scene are vivacious blonde BEDSIDE regular Vivi Rau and sultry brunette Lene Andersen from Paul Gerber's THE KEYHOLE. The pleasingly plump prostitute is lovely Lone Gersel also spotted in Phyllis and Eberhardt Kronhausen's groundbreaking sex documentary THE HOTTEST SHOW IN TOWN.Although the skinbaring sweethearts receive the lion's share of this fastpaced flick's running time it's the contribution of several highly respected Scandinavian character actors who stuck around even as the series got more seriously sexual that remains these movies' most striking aspect. A veteran thespian whose career started in the '30s venerable Sigrid HorneRasmussen camps it up as the school's colossal head mistress raising her skirts fortunately revealing a pair of demure knickers completely in character and blowing Sltoft a lewd kiss after an inadvertent swig of the aphrodisiac. As blowzy brothel keeper Madame Gina Lone Helmer's another classically trained actress unafraid to appear in XXX fare not as a pornographic participant but still dangerously close to spilling out of her corset on this occasion ! Even so the equally middleaged Mette Von Kohl goes both of them one better as prim 'n proper lab assistant Ms. Troelsen the Professor's first guinea pig stripping down to decidedly less than ladylike lingerie. Sadly all three of these brave grands dames of the Scandinavian screen have long passed away since.As befits a production intended for mass consumption the movie's particularly well photographed by Henning Kristiansen already a veteran DoP since the late '40s working within whatever genre his country's cinema would embrace including Knud Leif Thomsen's French New Wave inspired 1964 black comedy SCHOOL FOR SUICIDE as well as the occasionally dabbling in soft porn Gabriel Axel's 1988 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar winner BABETTE'S FEAST. How's that for eclectic ? Kristiansen was ably aided by a then eager young upstart named Michael Christensen who had already worked as camera operator on another exploitation outing made by an American expat Jack O'Connell's CHRISTA celebrating the breathtaking beauty of blonde bombshell Birte Tove illogically renamed Swedish FLY GIRLS for the US market as they tended to associate Danish with well pastry !".

The two girls sharing a lesbian liaison in the opening scene are vivacious blonde BEDSIDE regular Vivi Rau and sultry brunette Lene Andersen from Paul Gerber's THE KEYHOLE. The pleasingly plump prostitute is lovely Lone Gersel also spotted in Phyllis and Eberhardt Kronhausen's groundbreaking sex documentary THE HOTTEST SHOW IN TOWN.Although the skinbaring sweethearts receive the lion's share of this fastpaced flick's running time it's the contribution of several highly respected Scandinavian character actors who stuck around even as the series got more seriously sexual that remains these movies' most striking aspect. A veteran thespian whose career started in the '30s venerable Sigrid HorneRasmussen camps it up as the school's colossal head mistress raising her skirts fortunately revealing a pair of demure knickers completely in character and blowing Sltoft a lewd kiss after an inadvertent swig of the aphrodisiac. As blowzy brothel keeper Madame Gina Lone Helmer's another classically trained actress unafraid to appear in XXX fare not as a pornographic participant but still dangerously close to spilling out of her corset on this occasion ! Even so the equally middleaged Mette Von Kohl goes both of them one better as prim 'n proper lab assistant Ms. Troelsen the Professor's first guinea pig stripping down to decidedly less than ladylike lingerie. Sadly all three of these brave grands dames of the Scandinavian screen have long passed away since.As befits a production intended for mass consumption the movie's particularly well photographed by Henning Kristiansen already a veteran DoP since the late '40s working within whatever genre his country's cinema would embrace including Knud Leif Thomsen's French New Wave inspired 1964 black comedy SCHOOL FOR SUICIDE as well as the occasionally dabbling in soft porn Gabriel Axel's 1988 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar winner BABETTE'S FEAST. How's that for eclectic ? Kristiansen was ably aided by a then eager young upstart named Michael Christensen who had already worked as camera operator on another exploitation outing made by an American expat Jack O'Connell's CHRISTA celebrating the breathtaking beauty of blonde bombshell Birte Tove illogically renamed Swedish FLY GIRLS for the US market as they tended to associate Danish with well pastry !";

The comedy was given too little room to gather any momentum and as a result this film is not quite as playful and carefree as the others in the series. Its biggest weakness is that its young female characters appear without any signs of individuality they are just fresh meat.  This leaves the film without a focal point for the viewer.  I would not be surprised if the filmmakers simply hired a bunch of whores from nearby Hamburg who did not speak a word of Danish  consequently they weren't given any lines which makes character development somewhat difficult.Still despite all these flaws the film still compares favourably with 1990s pornography which is admittedly not a tough benchmark due to higher production values and a less cynical atmosphere and the unusual genre combination gives it genuine curiosity value.".

Most of these accounts center around Lee's 'mysterious' death from a 'brain edema' never developing anything really new of interest just speculations. Incredibly it took over 20 years for a film to finally put to rest the many theories and innuendo. Dragon is by far the best of the legendary Lee story not only for omitting the many death scenarios but also for giving us the closest account of the man. Apart from these welcome omissions the film wouldn't have worked without Jason Scott Lee in the role. He gives a spirited charismatic performance that captures the zest for life that Lee possessed. It's a long way from one of his first 'extra' roles as an Asian immigrant in the rather forgetful Born in East L.A. 1988. Scott Lee is totally appealing here taking on such a legendary figure and making us believe that Lee is truly up there once again on the screen. The film's major theme of the demon curse Lee's family inherited had a frighteningly real resonance when after the movie premiered Lee's eldest son Brandon for whom the film is dedicated was accidentally killed on the set of The Crow. This would prove to be his breakout film just the same way Lee's last film Enter the Dragon made him a world wide superstar.

	schema:headline " The key to immortality is first live a truthful life worth remembering. I think Dragon Bruce Lee Story somewhat shows that.";
	schema:reviewBody "However it also does stray too far into fantasy. This biopic movie directed by Rob Cohen really does take a lionized approach to the legendary martial artistmovie star Bruce Lee's life. These over the top embellishment really resulted in mixed reactions. Some Bruce Lee fans felt that the use of artistic license really hurts the historic authenticity of the film. Others felt that the extreme improvisation made for a more interesting and challenging movie rather than a straight and boring historic accurate adaptation. In my opinion I felt that slightly haunting but fantastical subplot of Bruce Lee's family being haunted by demons was a bit too over the top and wasn't really needed for the film. It wasn't a childhood nightmare that prompt Bruce to begin his martial arts training. Unlike what we see in the movie Bruce actually began his martial arts training at the age of thirteen after getting beaten up by a street gang. However it was somewhat entertaining seeing Bruce Lee Jason Scott Lee having nightmares of a giant demonic samurai. It was also pretty cool seeing him battling that say demon to protect his son Brandon Iain M. Parker. Even if it's so out there crazy. Who knows maybe there was a reallife curse on Bruce Lee's family? Making this worse is the fact that Brandon turned down the opportunity to play his father here opting to do 1994's The Crow instead. Brandon Lee would die from an accidental gun discharge during the making of that film a few months prior to this film's release. Loosely based off the biographies written by Linda Lee Cadwell Bruce Lee's widow Bruce Lee The Man Only I Knew'  Robert Clouse's Bruce Lee The Biography. The movie tackles how Bruce Lee became the most famous martial artist of all time while dealing with his cultural duality. You really do see his struggles to keep his strong Chinese heritage alive while also finding his identity as an American. While Jason Scott Lee is not related to Bruce Lee and had no previous martial arts training or experience. He was an accomplished dancer and really embody what Bruce Lee was in looks and the way he acts. He's so charismatic and likable here that you simply cannot take your eyes off of him. He is equally adept at action scenes and love scenes and even if you don't like martial arts films you will like this movie very much. I really love how the film dealt with easing of harsh racism tones of the two countries with the romantic subplot of Bruce Lee meeting his future wife Linda Lee Lauren Holly. The two actor's chemistry together really makes this subplot work. I really felt the heartwarming moments between them. However their relationship in real life was a little more complicated than what's shown in the film with Bruce Lee's rumor adultery with actress Betty Ting Pei. Still much credit goes to both Lauren Holly to portraying a realistic character in Linda and for composer Randy Edelman for The Dragon's Heartbeat. That theme song is so uplifting and inspirational it has been used in countless trailers in the 2 decades since it first came out. This film pays a mostly honest tribute to how revolutionary the man was to not only fighting style but his influence in both East and West filmmaking. However in the movie it's said that Bruce Lee's acting career started when a producer discovers Bruce after witnessing his martial arts abilities. In real life Bruce's family had connections to the world of show business and even Bruce Lee acted sporadically since his early childhood. He first appeared in 1941's The Golden Gate Girl when he was only 3 months old and later in 1957's Hong Kong movie The Thunderstorm. It wasn't his martial arts skills that got him into the door of Hollywood at first. While I do champion in the way he change how Asian Americans were portrayed in film. Still the notorious idea that all Asians know Martial Arts is bit laughable. The film make it seem like every Asian knows it. As if it's was a wellkept secret. While the fight scenes in the film were wellchoreograph and done pretty good. I really found most of the wholeforced fighting conflicts to be a lot of filler. Some really good examples are the fight scene at the film set of 1971's Big Boss and the scenes with the Chinese Martial Art School. Contrary in reality there was no real fight on the set of The Big Boss and while other Martial Arts instructors were indeed only teaching people of their own race most Chinese martial arts school in America were a lot more understandable on Bruce Lee training nonChinese in the arts. Another thing I find kinda jarring in the film is how the film portray Bruce suffering a severe back injury due to a fight gone wrong. In reality Bruce got the back injury while exercising with weights. While he indeed fully recovered since then in private however he continued to suffer from chronic back pain. Unlike the movie that says the demon curse lead him to an early grave. It's more like likely that this back pain cause Bruce Lee to die at a young age due to bad allergic reaction to a painkiller given to him for treatment. Overall While this movie does take liberties about the life of Bruce. It was also wellwritten as a tribute to both him and his fans. It was written as a way to include the myths rumors and greatness that made him a larger than life type of a hero. It's an amazing movie definite worth checking out for any fan of his films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very Good But Horribly Inaccurate Account Of His LifeIf you are watching this as someone who has no knowledge of Bruce Lee's life then this is a good fun action film but someone who knows the history and the story of his life may be dissapointed as this is not at all accurate. And knowing Bey Logan he must cringe watching this. The film depicts Bruce's early childhood in Hong Kong his teenage years in the US right way through to his eventual death in 1973. The element that I think drags this film down the most is the mythological side of it if it had just been a realistic account of his life without the myths and demons it would have faired much better. There are many innacurate scenes and occurences in this film which understandably makes the film more exciting for mainstream audiences but as a Bruce fan myself i wish they would have stuck to what actually happened. I wish there were more scenes where Bruce was on set of one of his films like Way Of The Dragon or Fist Of Fury. There could have been more scenes with Bruce with Yip Man or Brandon. There could have been scenes of Bruce being challenged on the street in his infamous street fights the episode of the green hornet they portrayed i don't think was an actual episode. And Bruce was not injured by the fighter at the martial arts challenge in Chinatown it was when he was weightlifting and pulled his back out. But the fight scenes are well choreographed.Jason Scott Lee has got his portrayal of the man spot on he brings the right amount emotion and power to the role he's clearly done his research on Bruce's mannerism's and got himself in shape for the role as well as training for the fight scenes. Its hard to imagine anyone else who could have played the role maybe Jet Li who at the time the film was made was 30 and roughly the right age to play Bruce but Jet spoke very little English. Lauren Holly is equally as good in her role as Linda. The strong portrayals are in many ways successful because of the on set help of the real Linda and Shannonwho makes a cameo as a singer. The music is perhaps the film's strongest part somehow the main score seems to catch the right emotion of Bruce's death and Brandon's death in 1993. I like the way the film captures the aura of Bruce Lee.There will indeed never be another Bruce Lee. I find it fascinating to imagine what Bruce would have done if he had lived the 80's and 90's would have been very different if Arnie Stallone Wiilis Seagal and Van Damme had Bruce to compete with Bruce is sometimes critcised for being a bad actor but i disagree if anyone has seen his episodes of Longstreet' or Marlowe' they will see that Bruce could convincingly carry a dramatic scene given the right script and no dubbing and he oozed charisma and he showed glimpses of good acting in Enter The Dragon.Being a Bruce fan i kind of wish that Jet Li would do the films that bruce did or was planning on doing Jet's early work in Honk Kong like the Shaolin Temple or more recent stuff like Fist Of Legendremake of Fist Of Fury and Once Upon A Time In China was very promising and it seemed he was the successor to Bruce but instead now he's doing crap in Hollywood with DMX and Jason Statham. Strangely the mediocre Lethal Weapon 4 is Jet's best Hollywood film Maybe Jet should do a project with John Woo it would be interesting and they'd probably get the best out of each other.".

Because this is a dramatized biography of possibly the most popular of martialarts masters there's certainly a whole lot of mortal combat some of which is purely extraneous pumped up to satisfy the target audience and the approach is a bit more 'comic book' than serious students might like.

Because this is a dramatized biography of possibly the most popular of martialarts masters there's certainly a whole lot of mortal combat some of which is purely extraneous pumped up to satisfy the target audience and the approach is a bit more 'comic book' than serious students might like. The supporting characters and extras are overdirected in their enthusiasm yet nothing seems to get in the way of Jason Scott Lee who though perhaps more bulky in frame than the real Bruce Lee does everything he can with this role and more.  from ";

He hurt himself when he didn't stretch properly for a workout in 1970.

DRAGON THE BRUCE LEE STORY differs somewhat by including a number of purely fictional moments but these also make the story a bit more surprising to established fans of the actor who already know his life story anyway. In the end the film admirably works as both a biopic and an actionthriller which is no mean feat at all. The action scenes of which there are plenty martial arts fans will be pleased to hear are invariably wellshot and offer maximum hardhitting violence and cool choreography with every punch in devastating detail and every kick captured in loving slow motion.Jason Scott Lee who plays Bruce may well offer the most noticeable performance in his career as the kung fu legend he succeeds admirably. The difference from other Bruce Lee impersonators like Bruce Li and Bruce Le is that Jason Scott Lee displays a keen understanding of the factors that made up the man and puts them to use in his performance here and at times the realism is uncanny. Lauren Holly is also more than adequate as Linda Bruce's wife and although a lot of screen time is spent on the pair's developing relationship it never becomes boring. It's also nice to see a substantial and memorable role for SvenOle Thorsen as nightmare creature The Demon after years of playing only supporting roles.The overall effort of the film is to convey the good qualities of Bruce from his physical prowess to his strong personality and his characteristics of bravery and inner strength. The negative aspects  including his dodgy death  are skipped over but really this is no great loss. Scenes in which Lee combats racism are excellently done and the combination of film clips interspersed with Jason Scott Lee playing Bruce Lee in the process of making his movies comes off well. Not the best martial arts flick out there but definitely a commendable and enjoyable one and perhaps definitive when it comes to Bruce.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining but never quite justifies the claims it makes on behalf of its subject";
	schema:reviewBody "In the early seventies the West went through a period of fascination with the Chinese martial arts. I use that term as it is the one Westerners are most familiar with although I am aware that some Chinese my wife included dislike it as sounding too aggressive and militaristic they prefer the term art of selfdefence. There was a popular TV series called Kung Fu a cartoon called Hong Kong Phooey which featured a martialarts dog and even a pop song called Kung Fu Fighting. In fact it was a little bit frightening! The whole cult was memorably sent up by The Goodies a British comedy team as EckyThump a Lancashire martial art which involves beating people over the head with a black pudding.At the centre of the KungFu cult was the actor Bruce Lee a household name in both Britain and America even though he made few Englishlanguage movies. Lee was born in San Francisco a city which is home to a large Chinese community and also produced the bestknown ChineseAmerican film star Anna May Wong. His family went back to Hong Kong while he was a child but he returned to America in his teens and went on to become a leading expert in and teacher of the martial arts. He became an actor on both sides of the Pacific making martialarts films and television series in both Hong Kong and America. His bestknown American venture was the TV series The Green Hornet in which he played the role of Kato. His last and bestknown film was Enter the Dragon filmed in English in Hong Kong completed just before Lee's tragically early death at the age of 33.It is a common convention in showbiz biopics that success doesn't come easily. The star can only get to the top by battling either external forces or internal demons. Or in this case both. In this film the external force which threatens Lee is that of racism. In the sixties and seventies there was widespread discrimination against ChineseAmericans and AsianAmericans in general in an early scene Lee is appalled by Mickey Rooney's patronising portrayal of a Japanese in Breakfast at Tiffany's. This discrimination affected Lee's career he was originally to have been the star of the Kung Fu TV series but television executives did not want an Asian actor in the leading role so the character became mixedrace and a white actor David Carradine was cast in the part. Lee also faced racism in his personal life in the film his future motherinlaw strongly opposes his marriage to her daughter on the grounds that she does not want yellow grandchildren. Lee was married to a white woman. Of course racism can be a twoway street and we also see how Lee faced opposition from conservative elements in the ChineseAmerican community who objected to him teaching fighting skills to white and black Americans.As for Lee's internal demons the filmmakers seem to have interpreted the word demon absolutely literally. He is shown having recurrent nightmares in which he has to do combat with a mysterious armoured figure. Although this demon can be interpreted symbolically as a representation of negative emotions such as fear and anger there are also hints that Lee actually had to battle against hostile supernatural forces.Jason Scott Lee no relation makes a convincing hero but the film's main weakness is that it is never sure what attitude to take towards its hero. The tone of the fight scenes especially in the early part of the film is often jokey reminiscent of the fights in a Jackie Chan comedy. This light comedic tone however does not sit well with the more reverential attitude of the later scenes. Lee's mysterious death is not dwelt on instead the film ends with a voiceover in which the actress playing his wife Linda announces There are many people that want to know the way he died. I want to remember the way he lived. The film clearly intends that we should remember Lee not only as a good man but also as an international cultural icon of lasting significance and a figure who played a major part in combating prejudice against AsianAmericans.Certainly American society has become less racist both towards ChineseAmericans and towards other ethnic minorities since 1973 for example Barack Obama's candidacy for the Presidency would have been virtually unthinkable 35 years ago. Whether one lone film star played much of a part in that change is debatable the fact that Lee lost a major role to a white actor only a year before his death suggests that he did not make much headway in his lifetime. Even today there are relatively few wellknown AsianAmerican stars in the entertainment industry. Whether one considers Bruce Lee as a cultural icon of lasting significance largely depends on one's view of martialarts based entertainment. Dragon is entertaining both as an action film and as a biography but I felt it never quite justified the claims it made on behalf of its subject. 610".

The whole cult was memorably sent up by The Goodies a British comedy team as EckyThump a Lancashire martial art which involves beating people over the head with a black pudding.At the centre of the KungFu cult was the actor Bruce Lee a household name in both Britain and America even though he made few Englishlanguage movies. Lee was born in San Francisco a city which is home to a large Chinese community and also produced the bestknown ChineseAmerican film star Anna May Wong. His family went back to Hong Kong while he was a child but he returned to America in his teens and went on to become a leading expert in and teacher of the martial arts. He became an actor on both sides of the Pacific making martialarts films and television series in both Hong Kong and America. His bestknown American venture was the TV series The Green Hornet in which he played the role of Kato. His last and bestknown film was Enter the Dragon filmed in English in Hong Kong completed just before Lee's tragically early death at the age of 33.It is a common convention in showbiz biopics that success doesn't come easily. The star can only get to the top by battling either external forces or internal demons. Or in this case both. In this film the external force which threatens Lee is that of racism. In the sixties and seventies there was widespread discrimination against ChineseAmericans and AsianAmericans in general in an early scene Lee is appalled by Mickey Rooney's patronising portrayal of a Japanese in Breakfast at Tiffany's. This discrimination affected Lee's career he was originally to have been the star of the Kung Fu TV series but television executives did not want an Asian actor in the leading role so the character became mixedrace and a white actor David Carradine was cast in the part. Lee also faced racism in his personal life in the film his future motherinlaw strongly opposes his marriage to her daughter on the grounds that she does not want yellow grandchildren. Lee was married to a white woman. Of course racism can be a twoway street and we also see how Lee faced opposition from conservative elements in the ChineseAmerican community who objected to him teaching fighting skills to white and black Americans.As for Lee's internal demons the filmmakers seem to have interpreted the word demon absolutely literally. He is shown having recurrent nightmares in which he has to do combat with a mysterious armoured figure. Although this demon can be interpreted symbolically as a representation of negative emotions such as fear and anger there are also hints that Lee actually had to battle against hostile supernatural forces.Jason Scott Lee no relation makes a convincing hero but the film's main weakness is that it is never sure what attitude to take towards its hero. The tone of the fight scenes especially in the early part of the film is often jokey reminiscent of the fights in a Jackie Chan comedy. This light comedic tone however does not sit well with the more reverential attitude of the later scenes. Lee's mysterious death is not dwelt on instead the film ends with a voiceover in which the actress playing his wife Linda announces There are many people that want to know the way he died. I want to remember the way he lived. The film clearly intends that we should remember Lee not only as a good man but also as an international cultural icon of lasting significance and a figure who played a major part in combating prejudice against AsianAmericans.Certainly American society has become less racist both towards ChineseAmericans and towards other ethnic minorities since 1973 for example Barack Obama's candidacy for the Presidency would have been virtually unthinkable 35 years ago. Whether one lone film star played much of a part in that change is debatable the fact that Lee lost a major role to a white actor only a year before his death suggests that he did not make much headway in his lifetime. Even today there are relatively few wellknown AsianAmerican stars in the entertainment industry. Whether one considers Bruce Lee as a cultural icon of lasting significance largely depends on one's view of martialarts based entertainment. Dragon is entertaining both as an action film and as a biography but I felt it never quite justified the claims it made on behalf of its subject. 610";

The performances are all great with Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly doing a splendid job as Bruce and Linda giving a convincing portrayal of two people fighting against the odds to work together Robert Wagner also excels in his brief role as the movie producer from hell. The score by Randy Edelman has since become one of the most famous ever produced and has been used in countless movie trailers for inspirational movie stories every time I hear it it seems to embody the very nature of triumph over adversity just as much as Beethoven's ninth which is high praise indeed.

Instead there are lots of fight scenes in improbable places with trumpedup foes not to mention some stupid curse of the dragon that the real Bruce would never have believed in. In spots this movie is almost as campy as the old Batman series was.A few documentaries have taken honest looks at the Lee phenomenon and managed to remain interesting throughout by showing us a determined disciplined man who made his own success. In this movie they had the entirety of Lee's life to use and decided to make up whole sections out of thin air just to spice things up. It puts itself not much above the sensationalistic Hong Kong films that made Bruce look nearly superhuman and the victim of some vast Triad conspiracy when the real man was just as fascinating. What a waste. I know conflict is emphasized in most screen writing classes but instead of fight after fight as shown in this movie how about showing some of the famous friends and students Bruce taught? And avoid the idiotic scenes like Bruce supposedly shattering 300 pound ice blocks into chips with a single punch. If I wanted to see impossible feats like that I'd go watch a Superman movie.Bruce's fighting philosophy was to eschew flashy techniques in favor of effective ones. Fighting wasn't for show but to win. Only on film would he do things like backflips somersaults superhigh jumping kicks and animalistic kiai. Show us the man who trained long and hard and studied and thought about not just fighting but philosophy and health. Bruce's success was as much a product of his mind as of his body.We're now nearing 20 years after this movie's release and the 40th anniversary of Lee's death with his legend and popularity only slightly diminished. To this day Bruce remains the paragon of martial arts in the eyes of many the man to whom all others are compared. I have a dream that someone will do a true biopic. His true story deserves better than to be ignored and hidden. I'd like to see a real drama rather than melodrama with characters that have depth rather than the cartoonish ones in this film. There have been too many lies and myths told about Bruce over the years and this movie shamefully introduced more. All these years later people still wonder about the way he died. I prefer to remember the way he lived. Too bad this movie didn't show that way.".

Many have wrongly stated this film is bad having not seen the originals where you can really appreciate the composition of the showdowns visual director with potential  see the rare 'rocking chair' shot in Game of Death.  The script is bad in a few places particularly the humour but this film was never inteneded for the west but designed to appeal to his country men.Now the film features the best array of fighting sequences ever commited to celluloid.  Obviously influenced by Sergio Leones trilogy tension is excellently built up before fight.  The sequences are not overly choreographed or played in slow motion or 'lightly' then speeded up but contain a raw feral edge combined with breathless technique.  The perfect marriage between art and realism.The fights with Wong Ing Sik and Bob Wall while short are underrated even by Lee fans.  Those who have been lucky enough to see the double nunchaku sequence in full will have witnessed one of the best display of weaponary ever shown on the silver screen along with the 'original' and 'complete' nunchaku footage from Game of Death and the wonderfully comprehensive display of martial arts in the underground Enter the Dragon sequence.And then theres THAT coliseum fight.  Perhaps the start is abit overdone But Lee wanted to put forward a point i.e. don't play to your oponents strength but it is undoubtedly the best expression of the human body ever whether fighting dancing running whatever.  Those brought up on Latter day Chan stuff and in particular Jet Li fights will not appreciate this piece but those knowing anything about the fighting arts or good choreography will be shaken not just stirred.".

	schema:headline " Simply Bruce Lee at his best!";
	schema:reviewBody "The United States and the world would discover Martial Arts actor Bruce Lee until 1973 with the release of his first and only Hollywood film Enter the Dragon a masterpiece of the Martial Arts genre and arguably the film that started the trend of KungFu films. However before making Enter the Dragon Lee had already participated in three major films in Hong Kong two of them under the direction of Wei Lo and the third the only film of his where he had complete control under everything Meng Long Guojian the Way of the Dragon. Better known as Return of the Dragon in the U.S. where it was released as a sequel to Enter the Dragon Meng Long Guojiang was Lee's first film as a director and like his following two final films a movie where he was able to express not only his physical abilities but also the philosophy he developed to achieve them.In Way of the Dragon Bruce Lee plays Tang Lung a young man from Hong Kong who is sent to Rome by his uncle in order to help a family friend Uncle Wang ChungHsin Huang. At his arrival he is informed that the problem is that the Italian Mafia wants the family's restaurant and uses violent intimidation to pressure the owner. While at first not everyone is convinced that Tang Lung would be of any help as he is not used to the city soon they discover that Tang is in fact a talented Martial Artist. With Tang Lung's help the Restaurant's waiters manage to defend themselves from the gangsters but the Mafia Boss is completely decided to get the Restaurant so he hires a group of Martial Arts experts including the famous Colt Chuck Norris to eliminate Tang Lung.After proving he was a bankable star Bruce Lee finally got the opportunity of not only writing but also directing his own film. Free at last to make his vision of a Martial Arts film come true Lee builds up a film focused on two very personal themes for him. On one hand his very own experience as a stranger in a strange land and the feelings of being like a fish out of the water and on the other his ideal of the hero who uses his very own technique to fight against the established disciplines. While the plot is very straight forward and a bit typical Lee uses it effectively to showcase his own ideals and philosophies as martial artist delivering finally an action film with some depth beyond watching the character overcome the enemies.Borrowing heavily from Spaghetti Westerns even some score by Morricone is used Lee creates a magnificent epic set on the beautiful locations of Rome where his lonely hero Tang Lung arrives as a modern day cowboy to right some wrongs. While of course not an expert filmmaker it was after all his first film as a director Lee shows a great eye for visuals as the camera becomes an essential part in the creation of the sublimely choreographed fights and the highly stylish set pieces again influenced by Sergio Leone's westerns. Meng Long Guojiang is definitely the basics for what Lee conceived as a Martial Arts film and many of what he developed for this movie would become of great influence for future directors of the genre.Due to his character in Enter the Dragon most people remember Bruce Lee's acting as a serious dark personification of the perfect martial arts warrior however Meng Long Guojiang is a chance to discover a way different side of Lee's persona as he allows himself to be as funny and human as skilled in KungFu. Way of the Dragon offers insight into Lee as a comedy actor as Tang Lung's personality and probably Bruce's real one too is that of a happy man who enjoys life. The rest of the cast ranges from good to average with one amazing exception PingAo Wei. As the treacherous translator Ho PingAo Wei delivers one of the best comedic performances of his career and an excellent and effective comic relief for the film.As written above the cast mostly the case of the many extras in the film most of the time doesn't seem up to the challenge of the film and the awful dubbing done doesn't really help with that. Another truly big problem is that Lee didn't had enough budget to fulfill his vision and in some scenes it really shows. This two problems really hurt the film badly and while Lee's inexperience behind the camera is quite obvious it's safe to say that he delivered a great job against the odds. The epic tone of the film and the superb climatic scenes really make up for the notorious flaws the film has and one gets to wonder how would Game of Death may had turned up if Lee had lived enough to complete it.It's a shame that Lee died so soon and was unable to craft his ultimate Martial Arts film leaving the world wondering what would he do to top this film and the reliable sources agree that Game of Death was really going to be his best. This flawed masterpiece may not be perfect but it's monumental when one realizes how influential it became. Sure Enter the Dragon may be the better film of the two but Meng Long Guojiang is the film that shows us how Lee really was and what he really believed in. In more than one sense Meng Long Guojiang is truly the real Way of the Dragon. 810".

This film showcased his astounding skills agility and charm much more so than the brilliant classic Enter the Dragon and this film will show how truly fast and nimble Bruce Lee is with his fists and feet the people had to accelerate the frame rates of all his films in order to catch his movements properly. The fight scenes are unbelievable and it is already widely regarded that the final Colloseum battle between Tang Long Bruce Lee and Colt Chuck Norris is the best fighting sequence ever filmed for a movie.Do yourself a favor by watching the original Way of the Dragon with all it's original fighting noises intact.  Those who are content on only watching the Englishdubbed version are missing out on a lot!!!!  Any true fans of Bruce Lee can attest the massive difference it makes in experiencing the real voices of Bruce Lee when he is fighting onscreen.".

No matter how many countless times I've seen it ever since I was a kid watching it on the Big Apple movie old skool!!.  This movie introduced me to kung fu and the legend Bruce Lee.  His character is very interesting in this one because he's a stranger in another land Rome.  The people he's supposed to help don't even trust him hilarious scenes of awkwardness between Bruce and Miss Chen.  Ha Goon plays a great comic relief CHINESE BOXING!.  Although the movie takes a dark turn there are many moments of laughs.  I will never forget that you can't order chinese spare ribs. For the action Bruce dominates as he takes on a whole gang of thugs using everything from fists and kicks to darts a pole and of course his awesome nunchuk scene MOMMA MIA!!.  I love the sound effects when Bruce hits his opponents and the WOOSH sound is great!!  His training scenes show that Bruce Lee had 0 body fat and is good motivation for working out.  The finale between he and Chuck is a classic kung fu moment.  Great shots before the fight including the cat too!!This is a great film.  Another example of a great martial artist.".

A number of scuffles take part early on in which he takes no part and which make us doubt his prowess.Lee directed this film and his visual conception is much more inventive that Robert Clouse's ENTER.  Although it lacks the insane invention of A TOUCH OF ZEN or the dizzy verve of Tsui Hark's films Lee is not content with simple ego gratification. His two directorial mentors seem to be Melville and Leone.  The former hugely influenced by Oriental martial discipline himself gave him a hero who is narcissistic check the opening shot whole whose physical prowess is ironically the result of mental superiority an almost Zen laidbackness concealing the coiled taut muscleburst of Lee's beautiful body.Kung Fu is primarily an art of selfdefense and this film returns to these roots its conception of protecting the oppressed rings throughout the film in the seemingly gratuitous picturepostcard scenes Lee makes the connection between European colonial splendour and the poverty and repression of Hong Kong.  Chuck Norris's character has betrayed Kung Fu by siding with the oppressor  his art is bestial and clumsy lacking the spare geometric elegance of Lee's.But Kung fu's selfdefense is also a defence of one's 'self' this is where Melville comes in  it protects one from any threat to one's powerful wholeness especially women and men.  There is a slight whiff of homophobia mitigated by the outrageous campness of the film all that red! The whole idea of SHANE recast in a restaurant!.  This is ironic since it is the proof of Lee's martial art power that makes the initially sceptical heroine very stylish and lovely fall for his charms and who can blame her?.Lee's second master is Sergio Leone from whom he has learnt an irreverent approach to genre with jokey zooms closeups and cuts mocking yet mournful and melancholic Morriconeesque music a ritual standoff between mythical archetypes an awesome setpiece in the Colosseum with the film's heart belonging to the slightly silly but loveable subsidiary characters.The use of these iconoclastic directors adds a reflective and critical dimension to a genre previously in its most populist form a showcase for male vanity although Lee never lets us forget how gorgeous and sweetly small and cuddly he is.  A supremely entertaining film which unexpectedly achieves a climactic power and melancholy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Way Of The Dragon had the potential to be Bruce's best film in my opinion but was bogged down by the dubbing and acting. But it still stands solid as one great Bruce Lee film and boasts the greatest fight scene ever in my opinion. Bruce plays Tang Lung who travels to Rome to help his family battle local gangsters who are trying to take over their resturaunt. Bruce almost plays a Charlie Chaplin type role here which would later be more fitting to Jackie Chan's slapstick style. Much like the Big Boss the first Bruce fight scene is way into the film but in my opinion this good because it creates a good build up the nunchuka scene is second only to the one in Fist Of Fury or the uncut Game Of Death. The fight scene in the Roman Colliseum deserves the credit it gets because of one simple reason its a simple fight there are no gimmicks sure its set in the colliseum and the fight is supposed to reflect two roman gladiators but there are no weapons and no sweet talk.  It truly has epic scale. The thing that also makes this fight scene work is the end when Tang Lung out of respect covers Colt with his Karate jacket. There may have been better fights since on screen and I havn't seen many Hong Kong films with Sammo Hung Jackie Chan Donnie Yen etc but this is the first great one on one fight therefore it set the standard.There will indeed never be another Bruce Lee. I find it fascinating to imagine what Bruce would have done if he had lived the 80's and 90's would have been very different if Arnie Stallone Wiilis Seagal and Van Damme had Bruce to compete with Bruce is sometimes critcised for being a bad actor but i disagree if anyone has seen his episodes of Longstreet' or Marlowe' they will see that Bruce could convincingly carry a dramatic scene given the right script and no dubbing and he oozed charisma and he showed glimpses of good acting in Enter The Dragon.Being a Bruce fan i kind of wish that Jet Li would do the films that bruce did or was planning on doing Jet's early work in Honk Kong like the Shaolin Temple or more recent stuff like Fist Of Legendremake of Fist Of Fury and Once Upon A Time In China was very promising and it seemed he was the successor to Bruce but instead now he's doing crap in Hollywood with DMX and Jason Statham. Strangely the mediocre Lethal Weapon 4 is Jet's best Hollywood film Maybe Jet should do a project with John Woo it would be interesting and they'd probably get the best out of each other.".

The rest of the movie as a comedy works in a sort of The Gods Must Be Crazy What's Up Tiger Lily? way.  But as a martial arts film?  No way.  It's so bad at times that you really believe he made this movie with the full intention of spoofing martial arts films. The one thing that keeps this movie on its feet is the Gay Translator.  That character alone carried the sagging weight of the movie as a kungfu film. Unfortunately the weight was picked up and carried as a comedy.  Still there are some notable fight scenes and if you are kungfu nut I suppose story doesn't really matter much anyway.  I'm a film student and I've always looked at movies as movies.  In watching Kungfu films I've had to discipline myself in detaching the genre from all other standards of film. These films are about the martial arts and it's not supposed to matter how utterly bad the movies can be.  This is where knowing a lot about movies actually impairs me where I can't get used to the concept of a movie not existing for the sake of being a good movie.Oh well.The fight scene at the end makes you forget about everything else.  The way they portray Chuck Norris' character is simply amazing.  During the fight scene there was a surprising depth to it all in which you actually sympathize with Colt.  He keeps getting up and all the while he has this look on his face that shows that he doesn't want to fight anymore and that he knows he has lost the battle.  But he keeps fighting because that is what he has to do.  He knows if he keeps fighting he'll probably die but he goes on anyway wearily.That alone makes the movie and I hope I've made sense to people.".

There is even a running joke about him repeatedly needing the bathroom as he accidentally orders a number of bowls of soup at the airport restaurant. About 30 minutes or so into it however it becomes more of a serious martial arts film with some excellent fight scenes particularly the classic showdown with Chuck Norris at the ultimate fighting ground  the Coliseum in Rome. I particularly like the way that during the fight the camera frequently cuts to a small kitten looking down on the struggle as a kind of juxtaposition between innocence and brutality.There are some incongruities such as the wooden darts that Tang Lung makes and uses to disarm men with guns one of the more imaginative if unrealistic ways of squaring up to the problem that martial arts features always have when it comes to films set in the modern era  and still causes problems more than thirty years on.Much like the majority of Lee's work Way of The Dragon would be largely forgettable except for his magnetic screen presence and superb fighting skills but its influence is undeniable and far reaching even prompting an impression of Tang Lung's actions to scare off the gang boss in 2004's Kung Fu Hustle by the landlady Yuen Qiu. It is also worth noting that one of the stuntmen from Way of the Dragon Yuen Wah also appears as the landlord showing that Lee's contemporaries work on today.".

	schema:headline " Where is the toilet?";
	schema:reviewBody "This must be one of the worst Kung Fu fighting movies I have ever seen. I decided to first watch Bruce Lees first movie The big boss which was laughably horrible dogs jumping through the air and stuff. So then I wanted to see Lee's debut movie Way of the dragon aka Return of the Dragon. I read on rottentomatoes.com that it actually was Lee's best movie so I had great hopes on that one. But after watching this one I am badly disappointed.The Story is about the Chinese fighter Tang Lung Bruce Lee who comes to Rome to help out at a restaurant of a friend of him. The owner of the place a young girl is threatened by a syndicate which wants to buy the restaurant at all costs. Lung on the other hand is prepared to lend a hand by dealing with these thugs his way. That's the story in a nutshell until Lung faces Chuck Norris in a last battle in the Colliseum of Rome.I have difficulties to believe reviews that say that this is the best Kung Fu movie ever made. Because its got nothing worth seeing except for Lee's funny battle with two nunchucks. The rest seems just questionably wrong. It starts off with Lee waiting at the airport while being constantly watched by an elderly women. Then he goes to a caf to order food but he can't even tell the waitress that he wants some eggs although he speaks perfectly good English afterward in the rest of the movie. The peek of awkwardness comes of Lee asking at least three times in the movie where the toilet is. In the beginning I thought this rather to be a Jackie Chan comedy than a Bruce Lee Kung Fu movie. Oh yeah he also asks the girl later if it was possible to buy a gun and she replies Oh yes of course everyone can buy a gun here! Say what now? That is Italy in the 1970's! Since when can anyone yet alone tourists just buy a gun? What's more is that he never really goes to buy a gun. Instead he is making small darts out of light wood which he later throws with high accuracy into the wrists of people being 515 meters away. Have you ever had a 10 cm stick in your hand? Even if you could lift 50 kg you could never toss a stick like that further than 2 meters yet alone pierce someones bone with them! Another example is that none of these gangsters that threaten the restaurant seems to be Italian. They've got blacks Indians Japanese and white Americans except for that one fat dude who screams Mamma Mia in one scene. At one other time the boss of the gang commands his underlings to take Lee outside of the restaurant to deal with him but reminds them to be careful with the guns because of the open public. But every time they go outside of the restaurant in this movie they go to the back ally behind the building where they are surrounded by 2 meter walls so nobody can see them anyway! And when Lee finally finishes beating them up the gang leader hires a Hitman to snipe Lee down at night. But for some reason he is polite enough to send a message to the restaurant beforehand placed inside a little nice coffin... What makes the situation worse is that the girl wants to protect Lee from being shot and recommends him over and over again to leave Rome at once but for some reason never really tells him exactly why and that he will be killed if he doesn't leave.Another weird example is when the gangs' Japanese henchman is calling the worlds best fighter who for some reason is an American. And he even tells the exchange through the telephone Give me America. Yes you heard me right America! WTF??? Then Lee and his restaurant friends have a big fight in the open area against an European and a Japanese karate fighter. But after Lee is done beating up the Japanese guy his friends grab each of his arms and keep kicking him until he is... dead? I don't know but that surely isn't what Kung Fu is all about. Lees master Yip Man would turn around in his grave if you would see this movie today. The weirdest plot twist occurs when the chef of the restaurant is stabbing Lees friends in the back only because he suddenly remembers that he wants to go back to Hong Kong. But that twist is never really further explained in the rest of the movie.The fight between Lee and Chuck Norris is a joke. Before they meet Lee is running around for like 5 minutes in the whole damn Colliseum before they meet in some corridor. Then they face each other stripping off their clothes to show their bare muscular bodies but only showing Norris harry mess of a body. To make the audience wait even longer they start warming up for about 5 more minutes. Then they start fighting and about 5 minutes later Lee is breaking Norries neck and even seems regretting it all of a sudden. What the hell?? I didn't like this movie. The only two scenes I really liked was the one with the fat guy screaming Mamma Mia and the one where Lee is holding his quivering two fists and weaving is forefinger in front of the gang leader just to say No no no you don't to that again. It's funny because the exact same scene is shown in the modern movie Kung Fu Hustle. Otherwise this movie is a disappointment. I will watch the rest of his movies but I have no big expectations anymore. I give this movie 2 of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "This must be one of the worst Kung Fu fighting movies I have ever seen. I decided to first watch Bruce Lees first movie The big boss which was laughably horrible dogs jumping through the air and stuff. So then I wanted to see Lee's debut movie Way of the dragon aka Return of the Dragon. I read on rottentomatoes.com that it actually was Lee's best movie so I had great hopes on that one. But after watching this one I am badly disappointed.The Story is about the Chinese fighter Tang Lung Bruce Lee who comes to Rome to help out at a restaurant of a friend of him. The owner of the place a young girl is threatened by a syndicate which wants to buy the restaurant at all costs. Lung on the other hand is prepared to lend a hand by dealing with these thugs his way. That's the story in a nutshell until Lung faces Chuck Norris in a last battle in the Colliseum of Rome.I have difficulties to believe reviews that say that this is the best Kung Fu movie ever made. Because its got nothing worth seeing except for Lee's funny battle with two nunchucks. The rest seems just questionably wrong. It starts off with Lee waiting at the airport while being constantly watched by an elderly women. Then he goes to a caf to order food but he can't even tell the waitress that he wants some eggs although he speaks perfectly good English afterward in the rest of the movie. The peek of awkwardness comes of Lee asking at least three times in the movie where the toilet is. In the beginning I thought this rather to be a Jackie Chan comedy than a Bruce Lee Kung Fu movie. Oh yeah he also asks the girl later if it was possible to buy a gun and she replies Oh yes of course everyone can buy a gun here! Say what now? That is Italy in the 1970's! Since when can anyone yet alone tourists just buy a gun? What's more is that he never really goes to buy a gun. Instead he is making small darts out of light wood which he later throws with high accuracy into the wrists of people being 515 meters away. Have you ever had a 10 cm stick in your hand? Even if you could lift 50 kg you could never toss a stick like that further than 2 meters yet alone pierce someones bone with them! Another example is that none of these gangsters that threaten the restaurant seems to be Italian. They've got blacks Indians Japanese and white Americans except for that one fat dude who screams Mamma Mia in one scene. At one other time the boss of the gang commands his underlings to take Lee outside of the restaurant to deal with him but reminds them to be careful with the guns because of the open public. But every time they go outside of the restaurant in this movie they go to the back ally behind the building where they are surrounded by 2 meter walls so nobody can see them anyway! And when Lee finally finishes beating them up the gang leader hires a Hitman to snipe Lee down at night. But for some reason he is polite enough to send a message to the restaurant beforehand placed inside a little nice coffin... What makes the situation worse is that the girl wants to protect Lee from being shot and recommends him over and over again to leave Rome at once but for some reason never really tells him exactly why and that he will be killed if he doesn't leave.Another weird example is when the gangs' Japanese henchman is calling the worlds best fighter who for some reason is an American.

I am more of a samurai movie lover and only watch kungfu movies on occasion. So please keep this in mind when you read thisif you are a huge fan you'd probably give the movie an 8 or 9 but if you have little interest in the genre this film probably will only rate a 4 or 5. If you can suspend disbelief and just enjoy the great stuntwork and cute story elements you'll probably be pretty satisfied.Okay the casual kungfu viewer will certainly notice that the film is very grainy and washed out as well as possessing pretty awful dubbing. I really wish these films were available with subtitles instead but in the 1970s distributors thought Western audiences wouldn't see a film with subtitles so they slapped on absolutely terrible dubbing tracks. While this isn't the worst I've seen it is bad and the film has no background sounds other than slaps and celery crunching during the fight scenesso it sounds pretty weird. Also the music is ultracheesy.However despite all these shortcomings it's obvious that the germ of an excellent film is hiding underneath. That's because the plot and idea of putting kungfu action in Rome is inspired! Instead of the usual problems occurring in Hong Kong or elsewhere in China here we have something different. Plus many times the action is pretty funnywith cute fight scenes and parodies of some of Lee's earlier films. For example one of the Italian thugs uses Bruce's own trademark thumb brushing against his nose move. I also liked the cheesy effeminate voice used for the dub of the Chinese guy who worked for the mobit was so silly and over the top you had to laugh. In addition seeing Lee impaling the gunmen's hands with darts was a good way to explain away why this mob didn't just shoot Lee though inexplicably again and again despite their hand being pierced the wounds disappeared an instant later due to continuity problems.The film ended well with some excellent fightsparticularly the finale in the Coliseum with an evil Chuck Norris. It's just a shame that they didn't have Chuck shave off his icky back hair first! This scary sight is repeated by the way in the first few minutes of THE GAME OF DEATHLee's final film and a total mess of a film due to his being dead during most of the filming!!".

The incidental music also seems designed specifically to get on your nerves.

The humorous scenes are simply intolerable and I was itching for the fastforward button the whole time though I forced myself to watch them anyway since I hadn't seen the extra scenes before. The various gang members really eat up the scenery especially the Chinese guy But the worst thing is how disappointing most of the action sequences are note that I said MOST. I mean Fist of Fury aka The Chinese Connection was the first film where Bruce really let loose and gave us a taste of what he was capable of. So in a film written directed choreographed and starring Bruce Lee you'd think the action would be even better right? Well wrong unfortunately. First of all the first 30 minutes have no action at all. But even worse when we are treated to some action it's so...boring. It's just not as exciting as his other films. For a man who prides himself on onscreen chaos it all feels very restrained. Even the nunchukus seem slow! But I can forgive all that because once the film moves to the climax starting with the fight with the two karate guys it picks up like 200. That fight gives us a much better taste of what Bruce can do but it's still nothing compared to the infamous BruceChuck Norris battle. Wow...I mean wow. It continues to amaze me to no end. This mostly lousy film ends with one of the best martial arts sequences ever. It's like John Woo's Hollywood debut Hard Target which is horrible most of the time but ends with one of Woo's best shootouts ever. I guess they figured they've suffered their audiences enough and better give them something to keep them smiling on the way out of the theater.Bruce's directorial skills were amateurish to say the least. Thrill to the snaillike pacing. Glee to the endless scenes of sightseeing. Get a headache from all those rapid zooms. There were only two good points of Bruce's direction the cat's meow starting off the BruceChuck fight was a stroke of genius and he also manages to make the only movie where Chuck Norris is COOL! ".

	schema:reviewBody "This is my first Bruce Lee movie I've ever seen I've just finished watching it 20 years after its production. It's a bad movie really bad the story is stupid the dialogues are surreal the gags are not amusing the direction and the the narration even worse. I must confess that I am not particularly interested in watching kungfu movies because beyond the fight scenes  that can be amusing sometimes  rarely there is a worth watching movie. However I HAD to see this movie because of the Lee legend and I don't regret my choice because I think there is some sociological reason to see it.As citizen of Rome I am not particularly proud of the use of Rome in this movie. In the initial scenes the movie shows some of the wellknown Rome monuments while the car of the protagonists pass through the city center. The girl drives her car even through the michelangiolesque square at the Campidoglio where cars are not allowed to pass...All these scenes are just mediocre postcards that could be avoided. Better would had been to show these monuments in the narration of the movie as in the final scene inside the Colosseum. But even in this scene a good director would have done better the entire fight is among brick walls barely you can recognise they are inside the Colosseum! Would had been enough to build a little stage inside the arena and have the fight where the real gladiators fought and died. The spectacularity of the scene would have gained a lot I think.Apart from this the movie could have been filmed in China. Most of the scenes are inside the restaurant that really doesn't seem a chinese restaurant as we have in Rome and in apartments with postmodern furnitures never seen in Rome.The bad boys are all but romans blacks indians americans even a japanese. Maybe the stupid fat man that yells Mamma mia! is italian.This international team seems to act as Rome was its headquarter police is a ghost excepting the conclusion. If you are eating at a chinese restaurant and a team of armed bad boys invites you to go out what do you think you'll do? will you just go out looking for another restaurant without bad boys if possible? If you are a character of a kungfu movie probably yes.Ok ok but the audience doesn't care of this the audience wants kungfu that's the answer that probably the producers would say. I agree but this movie seems to lack even real kungfu scenes! I mean half of the movie doesn't show any fight and in the rest the fight scenes are slow short and without special tricks or effects. I appreciate more fight scenes of Jackie Chan or Matrix or even Bud Spencer!!The american fighter is beated in one minute and so the japanese one. The chinese waiters without honour I would say after Bruce Lee slayered the japanese fighter continued to beat him without mercy even if he could not react. Is that the chinese philosophy of fight? I'm sure not. In this scene I think the movie shows the hate that chinese people feel against japanese people. Probably chinese people have their good reasons during the last world war Japan committed huge massacres in China and never apologised for this. But this scene has not a good message for humankind I think.In conclusion if this wasn't a Bruce Lee movie I would say don't waste your time watching it. However this IS a Lee movie and if Lee is a legend for so many people we are forced to see his movies just to understand why he is a legend.As I said this is my first Lee movie. I probably have to watch the other movies because so far I can't understand why.".

I'm a big fan of martial arts and beginning to become a very big fan of Bruce Leewho is without a doubt the greatest martial artist ever and there is no doubt about it when Lee does his thing it's hard not to get excited. However he doesn't get to do his thing that much in this filmcompared to Enter The Dragon which I recently saw and the story leaves a bit to be desired. The plot is kind of tame and fairly clichd... it's just the typical 70's martial arts movie nothing more or less. The reason why this is a surprise is Lee... normally you would expect better from him. The pacing is very bad I couldn't really sit through it since I found it so dull. The acting wasn't particularly impressive. I saw an Englishdubbed version which just made it that much worse. The characters are clichs and stereotypes. The action is pretty good but there's too little of it and the sound effects are painfully exaggerated and often poorly synchronized. The main reason I decided to see this movie is due to the great chance of seeing Lee beat up Chuck Norriswho I really strongly dislike. That did happen in the film but I don't know if I would claim that it's worth sitting through the rest of the film for. I recommend this only to very big martial arts enthusiastslike me who can sit through a pretty unimpressive film to see very good martial artsunlike me. Very big fans of Bruce Lee might also like it but the general public should probably see a better Bruce Lee filmlike Enter The Dragon. 510".

I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it and the tenth time I saw it and the hundredth time I saw it. This movie never gets old. There is not one single dull moment. The movie takes off and never lets up not even enough to let you breathe. There is something absolutely mesmerizing and hilarious about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels' performances as the lovable idiots Lloyd Christmas Jim Carrey and Harry Dunne Jeff Daniels.The movie starts out in Providence Rhode Island with two guys who are down on their luck. They've just lost their jobs are late on the gas billagain and make the best of a bad situation by returning a briefcase they've recovered to its rightful owner an attractive woman named Mary Lauren Holly. And LloydCarrey has fallen madly in love with Mary after driving her to the airport. It just so happens that Mary lives all the way across the country in Aspen Colorado or is it California? Sure its crazy and stupid but they've got nothing to lose so they take off in their 84' sheepdog. And let's face it if we were them we'd go too.Dumb and Dumber was not pretentious the actors never made you feel like they were in on the joke. No they played it with a straight face the whole way through and that's really the best way to do comedy. Even when they aren't speaking their body language alone is enough to elicit huge laughs. The reactions and facial expressions are perfect.The film wasn't warmly received by a lot of critics but only because they couldn't lower their snouts long enough to realize that this was not another movie about dumb guys but really a film about earnest guys. And they are pathetically funny just being themselves. They play stupid games in the car to pass the time and sing aloud to keep from getting bored and have crazy dreams of one day opening up a worm store.The movie plays out with a high spirit and feel good attitude that can't be matched. And the soundtrack is perfect it really sets the tone and never feels out of place.Really truly without a doubt the best comedy ever made. I will treasure this movie forever and even when I watch it the 101st time I know it'll make me laugh... and laugh... and laugh till it hurts.The film is well paced and has a spontaneous nature that lacks in most comedies. Behind all the stupidness there is a real glow of brilliance. The fact is more than all the goofiness and crazy antics Dumb and Dumber is a film full of smarts and that's what we end up admiring the most.".

Okay it was not Forest Gump in the way Tom Hanks played the slow guy come good with what I would say was one of the best performances by any actor of all time but it was very funny. I almost swallowed my tongue spat out my drink twice almost peed myself and watched it so many times I know the script even now 10 years on I still laugh it my friends eternal Harry and Lloyd...";

Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are perfect for their roles every time I watch this film uncut I am laughing. I was always thinking How dumb can you get?

After losing both of their jobs on the same day Lloyd Carrey who retrieved a bag which a woman he drove to the airport leaves in the terminal encourages his friend Harry to come with him to Aspen where the girl flew to. They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill but is actually the kidnappers of Mary Holly's husband who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.From their start in Rhode Island until they arrive in Aspen the kidnappers follow Harry Danielsand Lloyd along the road. The script is the most wellwritten comedy I think ever because every thing that they do in the movie leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.Their are more than a few funny scenes and the dialogue is always righton.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Farrley Brothers' movies or anyone who likes Jim Carrey. It's a hilarious comedy and the two stars were perfectly casted especially Jim Carrey of course.And now an excerpt from the film Skies huh? That's right. They yers? Yup. Both of them?".

And along with him came the phenomenal hit Dumb and Dumber a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness.Our tale begins when Lloyd Jim Carrey is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson the gorgeous Lauren Holly who Carrey eventually married and then divorced to an airport. He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine and after he has dropped her off he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport. Rushing inside he grabs the briefcase only to find someone closing the gate to her plane. It's okay I'm a limo driver! he yells to a ticket checker rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it falling onto the cement runway below.After retreating to his apartment he convinces his pal Harry Jeff Daniels to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary. Harry the smarter one or is that dumbless one? at first hesitates and then reluctantly agrees and so they are off. Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her. Now with hitment on their tail Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc.Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this. Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing. Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala and stand at a bar in bright tasteless suits. The way they stand talk and interact is as if they really are bosombuddies two idiots without a clue.The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers Peter and Bobby. You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious There's Something About Mary. But truth be told Dumb and Dumber is even better than Mary. Whereas Mary was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes Dumb and Dumber is a true comedic gem and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste something Mary crosses over and never turns back to.Is this movie dumb? Yes absolutely. Will it offend you? Perhaps if you're a snob. And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here.I don't think it matters. This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully. In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brainless silly fare such as Me Myself  Irene  the difference here is that Dumb and Dumber manages to come across as both likable and entertaining while still managing to feature characters we can actually in some crazy way find ourselves liking.In the end this is just a very funny movie that is wellmade and memorable  much more so than some of its other 1990s stupidcomedy counterparts.".

There is not a slow moment in the adventures of Harry and LLoyd two great but incredibly unintelligent friends who decide to move to Aspen Colorado to get out of their deadend lives in Providence Rhode Island. Jim Carrey delivers a sidesplitting performance as Lloyd the lovestruck limo driver who first suggested the trip to Aspen We got no food we got no jobs our pets HEADS ARE FALLIN' OFF!! mostly so that he can find Mary Swanson Lauren Holly the woman he fell in love with after he drove her to the airport in Providence.Lloyd's and Harry's adventures on their trip are absolutely hilarious to watch especially their runins with the criminals who are chasing them trying to get the briefcase that Harry and Lloyd do not know is full of ransom cash. One of the best things about this film is that it never strays too far from reality. There is never anything presented that could not possibly happen in real life. Also the original and strikingly funny comedy that was written for the film is great! I can't remember ever laughing this hard at a movie.Dumb  Dumber takes a good story adds some tearinducing comedy some endlessly hilarious dialogue I guess they're right old people though slow and dangerous behind the wheel can still serve a purpose. Don't you go dyin' on me! and needlessly good direction and molds one of the funniest films ever. Good for all ages Dumb  Dumber is sheer unadulterated comedy and is destined to become a classic.".

When it works it's very funny such as that bathroom scene.. One thing for sure the language makes this an Rrated film not PG13.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie by no means is known as one of the greatest movies ever. After all it's not suppose to be taken seriously to begin with. It's called Dumb and Dumber for a reason. However to this day this movie is still one of the most beloved comedies in decades. It still has a cult following. This movie is so damn funny that I can't even explain it. The movie does a superb job at what it's suppose to do. It's not perfect which is why I didn't give it a perfect score. It has a flew flaws that some movie critics would pick at. However it's nothing compared to all the good.The storyline to the movie is both ridiculous and hilarious. It takes you on a tour of the lives of Harry and Lloyd two guys in Rhode Island who are going nowhere in life. Once Lloyd finds the love of his life he obsesses over her and even gets involved further in her life then he should have. She leaves an empty suit case at the airport and the content in it is very valuable. Lloyd grabs it and thinks she forgot it and wants to give it back to her but it's too late she flew all the way to Aspen. So Lloyd wants to go on a road trip with his buddy Harry and drive all the way to Aspen to return it to her. Little do they know that kidnappers and the FBI are after them. On their way they encounter several crazy and memorable characters. Seabass the tough redneck Mental a somewhat stupid hit man and many more.The acting is very hilarious and well done. Jim Carrey does a great job at Lloyd who is so damn stupid and hilarious it's hard not to like him. This character is one of Carrey's best. Jeff Daniels does and equally good job as Harry who is less dumb then Lloyd but still gets into plenty of trouble. The story overall is a road ride in the eyes of two likable idiots who are oblivious to everything and yet they still manage to get out of trouble without even trying. The dialog in the movie is very funny and memorable. Several scenes are equally as memorable. Lloyd's fantasy dream for instance with his so called love Mary Harry's explosive diarrhea The cop drinking the pee out of the beer bottles the Seabass scenes the blind kid pretty bird scene the Don't worry I'm a Limo driver scene and several more. There were very few moments in this movie where I wasn't laughing.Overall this movie may not be perfect because the humor will not appeal to everyone. Some people may be too serious for this movie and if so you're lose go watch Titanic. All I know is it's one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and to this day I still watch it. I never get tried of it. It will be very hard for people with a sense of humor not to find this movie funny.".

This is realism of a sort In general incompetent fools do not excel in life and they don't excel in here. The guy does not end up with the girl the protagonists don't end up successful or particularly happy except in their friendship.This gives the comedy so much more impact. If everyone and the world are believable ridiculous antics really stick out. My favorite scene in this movie for example is Harry and Lloyd's interaction with a very serious tough thug. The thug's realistically confused and shocked response to their pure idiocy makes the idiocy itself far more potent and gutwrenchingly hilarious.The plot while not particularly deep acts as a sort of clever satire on most comedyadventures. As I said the heroes actually end up any better off than they started but their blissful ignorance makes it hard for you to feel sad for them.There are two distinct reasons that this comedy stands the test of multiple views though. One is the physical comedic performances of Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey as Harry and Lloyd. So brilliantly overthetop and obnoxious you'll be laughing almost nonstop if you just pay attention to the way the two stars act. The other is how creatively stupid Harry and Lloyd are. It's clear someone of great intelligence wrote this stupid script the jokes are clever and come at a nonstop pace.There are the requisite bodily function jokes but they don't really drag the movie down very much as they are sparse and generally funny. Overall I recommend this movie for all fans of comedy. And I question the wisdom and sanity of anyone who doesn't consider themselves a fan of comedy.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Dumb and Dumber would not be one of those movies destined to fit in the classics. Surely AFI would not want to put this one in the highcaliber humor hits in the history of movies. Still Dumb and Dumber is one of the funnest comedies of the last 20 years. We meet Lloyd Jim Carey and Harry Jeff Daniels. Both are inept moronic imbeciles who plan to own a pet store called I Got Worms. Good luck not only on raising the money but even more on getting the loan. In any case both have their odd jobs to get them through. Lloyd's life changes when he drives a woman Mary Lauren Holly to the airport in his limousine and she forgets her luggage. He decides to take it to her in Aspen Colorado with the help of Harry. However the luggage is actually ransom money for her husband. Harry and Lloyd have no idea but they could really use the money since they have so little. They eventually discover it trying to find Mary and on their tail are the kidnappers. It reminded me of a Three Stooges Marx Brothers or Abbot and Costello movie. However with these guys there is no straight man nor any intelligence. This paves the way for idiotic miscarriages of common sense. Simply put the audience will laugh because we can be assured that our intelligence is superior. This one also started the grossout comedy. Looking back the grossouts in this one were not overthetop. They were simple and much more plausible situations. Again we can laugh because it is not us. There are no breakout performances nor deft screen writing. Another strength for the movie is that it could work for kids as well as adults.

	onyx:emotionText "Dumb and Dumber would not be one of those movies destined to fit in the classics. Surely AFI would not want to put this one in the highcaliber humor hits in the history of movies. Still Dumb and Dumber is one of the funnest comedies of the last 20 years. We meet Lloyd Jim Carey and Harry Jeff Daniels. Both are inept moronic imbeciles who plan to own a pet store called I Got Worms. Good luck not only on raising the money but even more on getting the loan. In any case both have their odd jobs to get them through. Lloyd's life changes when he drives a woman Mary Lauren Holly to the airport in his limousine and she forgets her luggage. He decides to take it to her in Aspen Colorado with the help of Harry. However the luggage is actually ransom money for her husband. Harry and Lloyd have no idea but they could really use the money since they have so little. They eventually discover it trying to find Mary and on their tail are the kidnappers. It reminded me of a Three Stooges Marx Brothers or Abbot and Costello movie. However with these guys there is no straight man nor any intelligence. This paves the way for idiotic miscarriages of common sense. Simply put the audience will laugh because we can be assured that our intelligence is superior. This one also started the grossout comedy. Looking back the grossouts in this one were not overthetop. They were simple and much more plausible situations. Again we can laugh because it is not us. There are no breakout performances nor deft screen writing. Another strength for the movie is that it could work for kids as well as adults. Both ages can have fun with this moviewhich is what I often watch on a snow day. Finally let it be known that truth in stranger than fiction. I knew a guy in graduate school named Mike. In college I knew a guy named Jim. Put them together you have Dumb and Dumber. However I think they would have been smart enough to get on the bus at the end.";

	schema:reviewBody "I never thought this was one of the funniest comedies ever but I found the movie a lot funnier when I was a kid. The Farrelly Brothers are talented writerdirectors who have made several funny flicks like Kingpin There's Something About Mary and Stuck on You. Though Dumb and Dumber is probably second to Mary as far as popularity goes I think it's one of their lesser flicks. The Farrellys are partially to blame but I place most of the blame on Jim Carrey. Whoever decided this moron should be paid 25 million a movie should be shot in the head. Jeff Daniels though less experienced in comedy gives a much performance in my opinion. Unlike Carrey he doesn't use the overthetop anythingforalaugh approach. Instead he's more concerned with being true to the character. Why does Carrey have to do some goofy eye movement or vocal intonation with every line of dialogue he utters? I always say that the rule of comedy is to act normal in ridiculous situations. In Carrey's case he prefers to act ridiculous in ridiculous situations. How anyone over the age of 10 can laugh uproariously at a fool like him is beyond me. The film contains its share of funny gags like the famous toilet scene but most of them are disgusting or stupid or a mixture of both. One of the most annoying scenes is one where Carrey and Daniels both eat these hot chili peppers. Their mouths start burning so they squirt ketchup and mustard all over the place trying to get some into their mouths. And of course there are other gaginducing moments like a man hocking a loogie into someone's burger. I suggest that if you're over the age of 10 and not a sucker for Carrey's incessant mugging you stay away from this flick. It's simply another overrated comedy.".

Think about it  the scenes with Carrey and Daniels playing pranks on the kidnapper with gas are the funniest scenes of the movie so if there was a third straight man the whole time it would be even funnier! The result is that at times one of the stars seems much dumber than the other and at other times vice versa. For example Daniels is the smart one when Carrey can't read the newspaper but Carrey is the smart one when he advises Daniels who has just spilled salt to throw salt over his shoulder for good luck but Daniels throws the entire saltshaker. Just a suggestion this was a very funny movie without the straight man anyway.I've never had so much fun laughing at a couple of braindead perverse idiots. Definitely worth a purchase.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie to me is very bad. I commented on Ace Ventura When Nature Calls which is a lot better than this movie. I only compare these two movies because it is a heated argument in my school between a few of my friends. All the comedy in Dumb and Dumber is said as if it is standup material. So it's very simple to like a movie like this because they are basically telling you what is funny. I think you should have to think more to find the comedy in a movie. If they just tell you what is funny then to me it doesn't seem to be as funny. A line such as why are you going to the airport?...flying somewhere? is an example of what i mean by telling you the funny parts. With much of the movie like this i consider it obvious comedy meaning they put 500 of these together and call it a movie. It could also be classified as stupid comedy because both Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels play retard roles basically anyone can laugh at a retard and they drive some sort of a dog. And then people say that Ace Ventura When Nature Calls Jim also plays a retard. But i highly disagree with this there are no parts in Ace Venture Where Nature calls where he gets his tongue stuck on a pole or anything as dumb as Dumb and Dumber. He may make hilarious faces such as when the hot girl starts walking towards him at the campfire in the tribe dance. But my main point is Dumb and Dumber is dumb after 5 minutes and gets dumber throughout the entire movie.".

The acting the story the script the directing even the IDEA of the movie all combine to make up a fascinating and thrillpacked police film. The crosscutting at the beginning of the film was particularly effective in my opinion as Martin Riggs Mel Gibson and Roger Murtaugh Danny Glover are introduced. The startling difference between their separate lives provides for tons of fun to be had later in the movie. Roger starts his day off as the family man reluctantly celebrating his 50th birthday party with his numerous children and his loving wife in the big family house while Riggs is shown waking up naked in his trashy trailer and beginning his day with a healthy breakfast of a cigarette and a beer. The fact that both Roger and Riggs hated that they had to work together was especially effective in creating a touching atmosphere as they grew to be closer and closer friends. They worked so well together in this movie it was a symbiotic relationship. It was almost like they fed off of each other and kept each other in line and out of trouble. I also liked the way that they showed that Riggs was deeply angered when he learned that the bad guys had taken Murtaugh's daughter. Things like this when done right can really get you to sit up and really get into the movie and it was definitely done right here. Riggs was also very amusing in his anxiousness about being a cop Why don't you let me go to sleep?' No come on we gotta get up and catch bad guys!' and Gary Busey delivers an excellent performance as the lead bad guy. This is the type of role that he plays best see Under Siege.Although the violence was painfully present in some parts the torture scenes were short but extremely difficult to watch the film never relied on violence to pull it along or keep the audience's attention. The story was sufficient enough so that there was no overindulgence necessary in anything like that. In this film you see the first of the now traditional Lethal Weapon scenes in which Riggs and Murtaugh stagger away from a smoking crime scene seeming to hold each other up. The final fight scene between Riggs and Mr. Joshua Busey was a little excessive and there were a few scenes which were a bit faulty how did the guy on the building ledge expect to kill himself when there was such a huge air bag inflated on the ground directly below him? but overall this was a spectacular crime thriller. The movie rushes along at a feverish pace and particularly Gibson's and Glover's success working together on screen make this a timeless action film that is not to be missed.".

Both quickly build up a strong friendship that lead them to uncover a very dangerous heroin ring...Danny Glover is at his best against an actor who can easily steal scenes... He plays an oldfashioned detective who is obsessed about his age and goes by the book... We simply see him scanning reading the odds...Murtaugh  on his 50th birthday  wears his past like a scar... He is a conservative family man who has to follow Riggs' hurtful plan to get his daughter back... Gary Busey plays Mr. Joshua a trained expert killer cool as ice deadly calm... It's essential for him to find out how much the police know... He tries his best to get Riggs out of the picture... His boss the General Mitch Ryan is a rugged man with eyes like chips of stone... The ruthless general thinks that it's now the precise time to turn up the heat... He wants Murtaugh to be tortured... He kidnaps Murtaugh's little girl the gorgeous Rianne Traci Wolfe to make him speak...Richard Donner's 'Lethal Weapon' is one of the finest films to offer its audience the combination of strong acting and scenes out of hell... It is an exciting cop drama cleverly constructed... The final battle where the two cops team up against the general and his henchmen is especially thrilling... Donner's film also skates around the sexual implications of male bonding but the scene in which Gibson and Glover are captured by the crooks and tortured dramatizes male vulnerability in a manner that became familiar in the action film...";

At first they can't stand each other but as the movie rolls along they end up with this type of bond. I'm sure that most people or everyone has seen this wonderful movie. It has plenty of action and violence. I love the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. And who could forget Gary Busey Mr. Joshua a VERY fitting role for the wonderful actor. He couldn't have been replaced for that role. No one could have done a better job than Busey. Go Gary! I love the end! One of the best fitting scenes in film history. I also admire Gibson and Busey doing their own stunts and studying martial arts just to make 4 nights of filming a cult fighting scene for this excellent movie. This one is definitely a winner! If you haven't seen this superb film then I STRONGLY recommend that you do! Great film!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not only one of the best copbuddy movies but it is also by far one of Mel Gibson's best movies. In my opinion it almost matches Braveheart which is by all standards a great movie.First of all the overall acting in this movie is nothing short of excellent. Especially Mel Gibson portrays the deeply disturbed Martin Riggs with great finesse and his ability to create nuanced characters shines through in this movie. You genuinely feel with him and feel the incredible weight of his wife's death on him. Furthermore one of the things that makes Mel Gibson one of the really great actors in Hollywood is his ability to portray rage. Pure uncontrolled rage and he certainly lifts the movie a few nudges acting wise. The other lead actor Danny Glover is also great in his role as the aging family father and he literally embodies the part of Roger Murtaugh and his line I'm too old for this shit has become a legend in the film world. Gary Busey is one of my top 10 screen bad guys. Not because he is an especially talented or great actor but he brings an edge to his character that makes one believe that he is the perfect nemesis for Riggs. Last but not least we have the underused Mitch Ryan whom we have come to know best in the part of Edward Montgomery in Dharma and Greg and he also does a great job with the relatively few lines he is given.In terms of story and interaction between the characters I can only say that it is close to perfection. The meeting between the two main characters is a classic moment and their slowly growing to like each other is also brilliantly done. The onscreen chemistry between the two actors is excellent and I'm tempted to say that they have the best chemistry EVER in film history perhaps bested only by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs. In terms of the story the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh has been weighed more heavily than in the following movies which means that the villains will naturally be less refined than in the following movies and this weighing is very acceptable because the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh is the carrying element of the movie.The action in the movie is excellent for an 80s movie. I'll even say that I think that the action in this movie is better than much of the action in movies today because somehow it just seems much more believable in this movie than it does in movies like Die Another Day for example where the action has been amplified so much that it just becomes ridiculous and lets face it silly. Most of the action involves Mel Gibson and this works great because he really is one of the greats when it comes to action. He gives the action credibility unlike actors like Sylvester Stallone or Steven Segal. You genuinely believe that he could be able to shoot someone with a sniper rifle at a distance of 1  2 kilometers.All in all a movie where basically everything works and is perhaps underrated by the voters of IMDb. 910  watch this movie right now!".

	schema:headline " Fairly enjoyable cop buddy film mainly thanks to great chemistry between the two leads";
	schema:reviewBody "Lethal Weapon has a pretty abrupt start to proceedings as the opening scene shows a young woman jumping off a balcony from towards the top of a tower block and landing on a car. However this proves to have some relevance to the plot of Lethal Weapon.Basically veteran cop Murtagh Gloveris assigned to investigate this incident which is initially deemed to be a 'suicide'. However an autopsy confirms that the young woman was poisoned before she jumped therefore she was murdered before she jumped. Murtagh must try to find out who poisoned the young woman and why but he's not alone in investigating this case and is assigned a partner Riggs Gibson. Riggs is a suicidal unhinged police officer who has a very different method of policing to the more 'by the book' Murtagh.The majority of the humour stems from scenes with Murtagh and Riggs as both of them have a completely different style of policing. Murtagh is more straight laced and has more of a general regard for following police procedure. Whereas Riggs is unorthodox and wild and will go to more extreme methods as you'll see in the scene where he's on the roof with a potential suicide victim. The character development is also good. Riggs in particular is afforded some depth  we learn that his wife of 11 years was killed in a car accident which explains his suicidal tendencies  it perhaps also helps to explain his rather 'gung ho' approach to policing as he already feels suicidal he probably doesn't fear death as much as your average police officer. We also see Murtagh's home life and see that he is a real family man. Both men show their human side but also show that they can kick a lot of ass when necessary.There were a couple of problems with Lethal Weapon Firstly the final scene where Riggs is left to fight Joshua Busey outside Murtagh's house and no police officers bother to intercept until Riggs finally manages to get the better of him. Whilst it was dramatic and a reasonably good finale it wasn't entirely believable. Secondly I also felt that at times the film was a bit drawn out and it was disappointing that the baddies were given a lot less screen time than I would have hoped for.That being said Lethal Weapon is still a good film but this is mainly due to the great on screen chemistry between Gibson and Glover. Worth watching!".

	schema:reviewBody "Do things like magic really exist? Well if you've seen Lethal Weapon  not only the greatest action comedy but perhaps also the greatest movie of all time!  you should know that the answer to that question is YES. If you don't it's very obvious that you need to see a doctor. And in case you for some incomprehensible reason haven't seen Lethal yet I have only one thing to say stop reading this comment and go rent it immediately!!! There's simply no logical excuse for anyone old enough NOT to see this brilliant movie.The Lethal Weapon series started out with this film back in 1987 starring the phenomenal Mel Gibson as psychotic loose cannon Martin Riggs and Danny Glover truly wonderful as well as his total opposite for a partner  family man and bythebook police officer Roger Murtaugh.Murtaugh lives a happy life with his loving family in a friendly neighborhood and is planning to retire from the force. But on his 50th birthday his life takes off in a different direction when the daughter of an old friend from Vietnam jumps out from a window and dies. This incident tosses Murtaugh into a dangerous and twisted investigation. And as if that's not enough he is also teamed up with a new partner  a burnedout lunatic named Martin Riggs who's been leaning on the edge of suicide ever since his wife was killed in a car crash. Roger is shocked when he meets this lethal weapon. These two cops only have two things in common they're both Vietnam vets and they both hate working with partners. This is my all time favorite movie because it gives you everything you could ever ask from a great flick action drama suspense and even love without getting all sentimental. And if you love Mel Gibson God he used to be so beautiful!! like me  this is were he makes one of his strongest and most remarkable performances. Actually I can hardly call it acting  he IS Riggs. The emotions he's going through is so evident in his eyes and so real and cuts right through your soul you can actually feel his pain and his anger. And Mel also contributes a great deal to the humorous element of the film with his attitude witty comments and eagerness of doing his job Man I love this job! Can we put the sirens on? Danny Glover is outstanding as Murtaugh and serves the audience a normal middleaged man who is fighting with his age a daughter who's turning into a young woman and a partner who doesn't care whether he lives or dies. Danny's hilarious making those faces and throwing back at Mel! He plays his part with great sensitivity and I think he just like Mel gives so much life to his character that no other actor could have done it better. And together he and Mel undoubtedly makes the best film team there was is or ever will be! The concept has been copied too many times though...With the fantastic action humor performances and screenplay Lethal Weapon and its sequels definitely top the list of all time action movies. Danny and Mel naturally won an award for best duo on screen on MTV Movie Awards once and considering their work with these series I believe director Richard Donner and producer Joel Silver makes the best duo OFF screen.I'm convinced this is a movie that not only action fans would enjoy watching so I recommend it to everyone. This is a movie you can't afford to miss!".

	schema:reviewBody "LETHAL WEAPON was the first of four pairings of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as LAPD detectives Riggs and Murtaugh. In this first film they reluctantly team up to bring down a drug cartel run by highlevel mercenaries. The plot is rather average but what pushes this film into Alist category is the pitchperfect chemistry between Gibson and Glover and the dark humor throughout. Roger Murtaugh Glover has just turned 50 and is a few years from retirement when the death of the daughter of an old army buddy teams him up with Martin Riggs Gibson a burnedout seemingly suicidal cop grieving over the recent loss of his wife. In a standout scene we see Riggs alone ready to kill himself while looking over his wedding photo. Excellent acting and from a buddycop picture! As the two cops begin to slowly earn each other's trust after Riggs saves Murtaugh's life the chemistry really kicks in. It's as though these guys have known each other 100 years! Gary Busey once brilliant in THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY is reduced to an albino thug here. But if it's any consolation he's very menacing. Watching this film again after about eight years or so it struck me how brooding and sober it was compared to the more cartoonish sequels which are also fun in their own right. But LW 1 has a darker energy and while the humor is still there it's just a little more sporadic. The stuntwork is amazing but not gargantuan! Compared to how ridiculously overthetop bigbudget cop films have become lately LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD for example LW 1 is the FRENCH CONNECTION! Lots of characterdriven scenes the Murtaugh family dinner scene feels improvised as though the cameras just happened to catch it and also some great location work spanning a lot of Southern California from the desert to the beach. Some notsoPC dialogue a nearly subliminal gay slur and some racist bits such as Who's the chin? aside the movie is a product of its time and the writing reflects that. Warts and all. And despite a recycled Miami Vicerehash of a plot right down to a neonlit nightclub as a front LW 1 is the most enjoyable of the '80s buddycop films. It's spawned three sequels so far. And among the countless imitators few have really captured the magic and chemistry of the lead actors one possible exception being the first RUSH HOUR. Watching them work on DVD was almost like revisiting old friends! Not many cop films of that or any period give one that feeling. Lethal Weapon still shoots on the mark after 20 ! years!".

What a team of unlikely hero's in this 'Lethal' of movies filmed in 87' or maybe 86'. This was the best of the Lethal's franchise. The idea was fresh with these two and Mel was as big in this character as king Kong!! I know because of the recent situations with Gibson on that they will disagree. I do love his stand on The Passion of the Christ I live for HIM too. But I'm talking about his character portrayal the quintessential 'Gibson' man in this boxoffice giant that if it had been someone else it may have not done the type of business that it did. The feeling was for Martin Riggs. He wore it well. Losing the love of his life you could feel the agony in his soul. The exchange between the two Riggs and Murtaugh was an incredible balancing act. It would have to be or one end or the other would up end them both. A cop who's on the ragged edge almost explosive and a family man who has a tightnit group that would end up caring for a man in need of care. In return he riggs with his quick acting sharpshooter trained conditioning that actually came natural to his character and his ' wits'  would endup saving Roger from losing his life and that family . This was I think an original story that like some others for instance  Indiana Jones   Predator  etc leaves you feeling a different emotion altogether. Sometimes these features should be left alone not made again and again until the real essence of the original story and characters has been recycled so many times that its water thin in the end. This has an alternate ending on the DVD which was perfect in my eyes they should have used it. But money is 'king' even over art right?The first is best. Shane Black made this right . Richard Donner directed it well. I recommend Lethal Weapon ".

	schema:headline " A Lethal Beginning";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the one that started all the lethal' action and introduced one of the most memorable cop teams in cinematic history.  Lethal Weapon' directed by Richard Donner is a hardhitting fastpaced actiondrama starring Mel Gibson as Detective Sergeant Martin Riggs who once served in the Special Forces in Vietnam and who now serves the city of Los Angeles. Riggs has some inner demons with which he must cope the loss of his wife and starts every day thinking of reasons why he shouldn't swallow a bullet. In the end it's the job that keeps him going it's what he does best in the world.  Meanwhile Detective Sergeant Roger Murtaugh Danny Glover is dealing with some issues in his own life  He just turned fifty has a teenaged daughter who is suddenly grownup and dating and he's just been assigned a new partner Riggs whom he quickly learns has a propensity for dangerous situations and apparently has a death wish.  His assessment of his situation is summed up with his now classic line I'm too old for this .'  And the adventure begins. The plot involves an investigation into the death of a young woman Amanda Hunsaker Jackie Swanson the daughter of an old war buddy of Murtaugh's Michael Hunsaker Tom Atkins who is now a successful banker.  Ultimately it leads Riggs and Murtaugh into some murky waters where they encounter a former General Peter McAllister Mitchell Ryan and some exspecial forces mercenaries including the especially psychotic Mr. Joshua Gary Busey. There's some twists and turns along the way but most importantly Donner keeps the action going and the tension building all the way to the climax. The dialogue is sharp the story and characters are developed extremely well and Donner wisely injects some humorous moments courtesy of Gibson with shades of The Three Stooges that provide a respite to the intensity of the overall proceedings.  But what really makes this movie is the pairing of Gibson and Glover. Perfectly cast as Riggs Gibson is at his charismatic best here.  He brings a depth to his character usually reserved for more dramatic fare and layers him with a complexity that makes Riggs so much more than just another action hero.  If you look deeply enough you'll find a bit of McQueen's Bullitt' in him.  To his credit Gibson took what could have been just another star' outing and created a truly memorable character.  Glover as well breathes real life into Murtaugh he lets you in on what really makes his character tick what his loyalties are and his perceptions of the world in which he lives.  Like Gibson he gets beneath the surface and gives you a lot more much more than meets the eye.  And there's a chemistry between the two that really clicks and makes it all work so well.  Watching these guys operate is real kick they give the audience something to relate to and it's that connection they make with the viewer that is one of the reasons the Lethal' films have been so successful. Also memorable in supporting roles are Darlene Love as Roger's wife Trish and Traci Wolfe as their daughter Rianne.

	onyx:emotionText "This is the one that started all the lethal' action and introduced one of the most memorable cop teams in cinematic history.  Lethal Weapon' directed by Richard Donner is a hardhitting fastpaced actiondrama starring Mel Gibson as Detective Sergeant Martin Riggs who once served in the Special Forces in Vietnam and who now serves the city of Los Angeles. Riggs has some inner demons with which he must cope the loss of his wife and starts every day thinking of reasons why he shouldn't swallow a bullet. In the end it's the job that keeps him going it's what he does best in the world.  Meanwhile Detective Sergeant Roger Murtaugh Danny Glover is dealing with some issues in his own life  He just turned fifty has a teenaged daughter who is suddenly grownup and dating and he's just been assigned a new partner Riggs whom he quickly learns has a propensity for dangerous situations and apparently has a death wish.  His assessment of his situation is summed up with his now classic line I'm too old for this .'  And the adventure begins. The plot involves an investigation into the death of a young woman Amanda Hunsaker Jackie Swanson the daughter of an old war buddy of Murtaugh's Michael Hunsaker Tom Atkins who is now a successful banker.  Ultimately it leads Riggs and Murtaugh into some murky waters where they encounter a former General Peter McAllister Mitchell Ryan and some exspecial forces mercenaries including the especially psychotic Mr. Joshua Gary Busey. There's some twists and turns along the way but most importantly Donner keeps the action going and the tension building all the way to the climax. The dialogue is sharp the story and characters are developed extremely well and Donner wisely injects some humorous moments courtesy of Gibson with shades of The Three Stooges that provide a respite to the intensity of the overall proceedings.  But what really makes this movie is the pairing of Gibson and Glover. Perfectly cast as Riggs Gibson is at his charismatic best here.  He brings a depth to his character usually reserved for more dramatic fare and layers him with a complexity that makes Riggs so much more than just another action hero.  If you look deeply enough you'll find a bit of McQueen's Bullitt' in him.  To his credit Gibson took what could have been just another star' outing and created a truly memorable character.  Glover as well breathes real life into Murtaugh he lets you in on what really makes his character tick what his loyalties are and his perceptions of the world in which he lives.  Like Gibson he gets beneath the surface and gives you a lot more much more than meets the eye.  And there's a chemistry between the two that really clicks and makes it all work so well.  Watching these guys operate is real kick they give the audience something to relate to and it's that connection they make with the viewer that is one of the reasons the Lethal' films have been so successful. Also memorable in supporting roles are Darlene Love as Roger's wife Trish and Traci Wolfe as their daughter Rianne.  In the end Lethal Weapon' is an exhilarating entertaining movie that introduces some great characters that happily for the audience return in the sequels.  It's like meeting good people who become your friends for life.  But be prepared once you've seen this one you're going to HAVE to see the rest.

Badly directed badly written and badly acted it is more like a series of action movie clichs than a story. It borrows heavily from various previous superior films especially Dirty Harry. The 'suicidal jumper' scene in both films makes the comparison in Dirty Harry the scene was honest but the inferior copy version the scene ends with an unearned and deceptive payoff a cheat in other words. It is not possible to speak of the plot being contrived but rather a series of implausible contrivances one after another. The basic idea an unstable cop being allowed to continue working and even being transferred to homicide! is utterly absurd in itself but it gets worse. Basic procedures such as handcuffing subdued criminals are not adhered to leading to two characters drawing weapons and having to be killed. People start shooting for no apparent reason such as at the swimming pool. A hackneyed and unconvincing plot about a secret conspiracy emerges. An over the top shoot out in the desert complete with helicopter. A gruesome but laughable torture scene. Gibson hurls a dead body across a room like a deadly weapon. A submachine gun fight takes place on a crowded freeway. And a final punchup while the cops just look on.Everything about this film is clunky. It takes a long time for the story to get going and it is held together by certain convenient details. The dialogue is wooden as is the acting apart from the kids who at least emerge with credit. The music is of the late 80s variety and sounds very dated now.Nor are the action scenes very memorable just a series of deeply contrived set pieces which neither look good nor convince. Situations are setup just so a car can drive through a wall or hit a bus or explode. There is no artistry in any of this and none of it lingers in the memory.A cartoon and not a particularly good one.".

But oddly enough or not following his t.v. years which included not only several Twilight Zone episodes but also Gilligans Island and Perry Mason it was the unlikely buddy movie with Mad Max star Mel Gibson that has made him very rich and almost famous. Gibson makes it easy to forget all the nastiness that has happened lately in his life from his own doing because he's such a natural screen presence. I had almost forgotten how alive and a little edgy he could be in his goofy handsome way. And Danny Glover equally comes alive on the screen a little goofy as well of course but comfortable as the dad in a functioning middle class family. The two men are cops thrown together and by some stroke of bad luck pitched into high stakes dramas one after another.And if you really bother paying attention the plot is a strain made more for effect than anything that matters or even quite makes sense. There are exCIA heroin dealers and absurd and dangerous helicopter chases fantastic skills with guns and an even more fantasylike muddy handtohand fist fight under the spray of a broken fire hydrant at night. Yeah it's crazy and over the top and you just have to dive in and say cool go for it great filming funny oneliners.It's a moment for moment movie with a handful of clunker moments but hundreds of crazy fast and exciting ones.

Honestly I rented this movie just to help myself remember why I liked it when I was very young and I can't say I figured out why. However if you can handle the movie's cheesiness unrealistic situations and characters and the stereotypes of US cop films you're in for one of the best of its kind at least that's what the majority says. The saving grace of the film the great chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson and while when I was younger I loved the psycho badass Mel Gibson I can see now that Glover not only plays a much much better character but also a more realistic one thus easier to relate to unless you are 8 years old.You'll hate Lethal Gun if You hate these unrealistic cop films and if you want a movie with an actually interesting plot. Honestly what's the big deal with this movie and its far worse sequels? They are one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is pretty typical nothing will leave you with your mouth open or surprise you. The characters are of cardboard quality at best with Gibson playing a cartoon who is more irritating than cool. Glover plays the conservative family man with a moustache of course! and Gibson is the rebel cop who cries at night while trying to kill his self because his wife died in a traffic accident boooohoooooo! Riiiiiight The action sequences are boring and the way the main characters and especially Gibson behave is unrealistic and far from heroic more like suicidal just for the fun of it. You want a good cop movie look elsewhere. Yes I've seen worse but the point here is that this movie is one of the most successful ones!!!FINAL VERDICT A Series Of Action Movie Clichs 4.410 Great main character chemistry.

Towers is probably best known for his collaborations with Jess Franco indeed Franco directed the last two movies in the series but this one is directed by Don Sharp 'Rasputin The Mad Monk' 'Psychomania' and scripted by Towers himself. Horror legend Christopher Lee plays the fiendish Dr Fu Manchu super criminal and Nigel Green 'Zulu' 'Countess Dracula' plays his nemesis Sir Nayland Smith. Towers plays fast and loose with Sax Rohmer's original characters and stories with entertaining results. The main reason the movie works is because of the performances by Lee and especially Green who is just terrific. The plot concerns the kidnapping of a German scientist played by Joachim Fuchsberger who Fu Manchu forces to develop a super weapon. The lovely Karin Dor 'You Only Live Twice' plays the scientist's daughter Tsai Chin is Fu Manchu's evil daughter Lin Tang and Howard MarionCrawford is Nayland Smith's Watsonlike sidekick Dr. Petrie. 'The Face Of Fu Manchu' isn't a great movie by any means but it's fun to watch and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon.".

Horror legend Christopher Lee plays the fiendish Dr Fu Manchu super criminal and Nigel Green 'Zulu' 'Countess Dracula' plays his nemesis Sir Nayland Smith. Towers plays fast and loose with Sax Rohmer's original characters and stories with entertaining results. The main reason the movie works is because of the performances by Lee and especially Green who is just terrific. The plot concerns the kidnapping of a German scientist played by Joachim Fuchsberger who Fu Manchu forces to develop a super weapon. The lovely Karin Dor 'You Only Live Twice' plays the scientist's daughter Tsai Chin is Fu Manchu's evil daughter Lin Tang and Howard MarionCrawford is Nayland Smith's Watsonlike sidekick Dr. Petrie. 'The Face Of Fu Manchu' isn't a great movie by any means but it's fun to watch and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon.";

Anyway Fu Manchu comes to London with a weapon of mass destruction while Smith tries to stop him. Smith had a feeling from the beginning that he was cheated at the execution but it was not completely reasonable for a man like him since the first hints at new activities were vague. So I thought he might have been be a bit more surprised when he actually meets the criminal mastermind. The last third of the movie is a bit rushed especially the scenes in Tibet. It is not a perfect movie because it has a few holes but it was a good start for the new series. I voted 78574 for the five movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "So far only available on VHS in Region 1 I picked up the Region 2 DVD release of 'Face of Fu Manchu' recently and blessed my regionfree DVD player for every wonderful funfilled moment of this enjoyable fantasy romp. Based on the character originally envisioned by British author Sax Rohmer Christopher Lee made a total of five appearances in the 1960s as arch villain Fu Manchu. This entry the first in the series is by far the best closely followed by the second 'Brides of Fu Manchu' another Region 2 only DVD release. What makes this entry so enjoyable is the wonderful Nigel Green as Fu Manchu's greatest nemesis  Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard. In fact it is in the opening minutes of this movie that we see Smith invited by the Chinese government to witness the execution of Fu Manchu. Fast forward a couple of months and Smith is sturdy in his belief that Fu Manchu survived and is behind a series of grisly crimes in western Europe. Then when a professors servant is found murdered in the same manner in which Fu Manchu's followers had practiced Smith becomes even more convinced that he is up against the evil genius. Through a series of machinations Smith learns that the professor has been kidnapped by Fu Manchu and is being forced to make a toxin that could wipe out most of the western world. Of course in a plot device also used in the following 'Brides of Fu Manchu' the professors daughter has also been captured and is being used to comply the professor to complete his task. Directed with skill by Don Sharp this movie is fastpaced enough to overlook the plot holes and colorful enough to keep the fun factor umped up to the ultimate degree. It's a visual feast and the movie is also helped by a tight script and some well drawn characters. I grew up watching these movies on British television and my memories did not disappoint me. Also notable is the inclusion of onetime Bond girl Karin You Only Live Twice Dor ho turns in a strong performance as the professors daughter. This is an ultimate Saturday afternoon movie to be watched relaxed in a recliner with a bag of popcorn in one hand and a soda in the other all the while reveling in every outlandish moment.".

His nightmare coincides with the fact that a huge crime wave has been erupting all over Europe. It is so well organised that only a criminal of Fu Manchu's stature could be behind it. His closest friend and colleague Dr Petrie HOWARD MARION CRAWFORD thinks he's mad but Smith does some research and discovers that a Chinese actor who was an exact double of Fu Manchu disappeared before the criminal was apprehended. Smith is convinced that it was the actor in a deep state of hypnosis whom he saw beheaded while the real Fu Manchu made his escape. Meanwhile a renowned German scientist called Professor Muller WALTER RILLA has disappeared and the body of his manservant was discovered outside of London's Lime House strangled with a red Tibetan prayer scarf which is the trademark of Fu Manchu's henchmen. Smith fears that his old enemy is in London and has kidnapped Muller for his own evil ends. In order to discover what he was working on Smith visits Muller's assistant Carl Janssen JOACHIM FUCHSBERGER who tells him that they were working on the distillation of the seeds of the Black Hill Poppy. This is a rare flower that grows in the mountains of Tibet and when the seeds are distilled it produces a gas that when exposed below freezing point has the potential to kill up to ten thousand people. Smith's worst fears are confirmed Fu Manchu and his evil daughter Lin Tang TSAI CHIN have got the professor and are forcing him to perfect the gas in order to hold the world to ransom...The fiendish Oriental mastermind Fu Manchu and his adversaries Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard and the coroner Dr Petrie were the brainchild of novelist Sax Rohmer whose series of novels were highly popular during the 1920's. The character of Fu Manchu had appeared on celluloid several times before Christopher Lee inherited the role in 1965.

Warner Oland played him in the following talkies made by Paramount THE MYSTERIOUS DR FU MANCHU 1929 THE RETURN OF DR FU MANCHU 1930 and DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON 1931. In 1939 actor Henry Brandon played him in a serial entitled DRUMS OF FU MANCHU. However the most famous portrayal before Christopher Lee's was Boris Karloff in MGM's THE MASK OF FU MANCHU 1932.In the 1960's Rohmer's novels enjoyed a successful reissue in paperback and producer Harry Alan Towers bought the rights to all the novels and decided to create a series of films featuring Fu Manchu's exploits as a possible rival to the James Bond films. THE FACE OF FU MANCHU was the first in the series and Towers wrote the script under the pseudonym of Peter Welbeck. Director Don Sharp shot the film in Ireland in February and March 1965 and he fought hard to get the time and locations he required. The recreations of 1920's London were actually filmed in parts of Dublin with surprisingly brilliant results. The opening execution sequence was shot at Kilmainham jail in County Wicklow and the prison also doubled as the Tibetan monastery in the climatic scenes. The resulting picture was a hit with both critics and audiences on its release in late 1965 and four sequels subsequently followed. They were THE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU 1966 THE VENGEANCE OF FU MANCHU 1967 THE BLOOD OF FU MANCHU 1968 and THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU produced 1968 but shelved until 1972. The series rapidly declined into shambling nonsense in which all aspects of the productions suffered including the loss of period detail abysmal direction inadequate plots poor acting and increasingly shoestring budgets.THE FACE OF FU MANCHU is without doubt the best in this ultimately illfated series. It benefits from the stylish direction of Don Sharp who gets fine performances from Lee as Fu Manchu Tsai Chin as his daughterincrime Lin Tang while Nigel Green is absolutely outstanding as Nayland Smith. Smith and his colleague Dr Petrie are very much in the Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson vein and it makes you wish that both Green and MarionCrawford were both teamed with Sharp to do a Holmes picture. Alas it never happened. Sharp handles the nonsensical material with considerable skill so that we the audience happily suspend our disbelief and just wallow in it. The action scenes are also a delight including a spirited car chase through the Essex marshes with splendid vintage automobiles. Add to that the atmospheric lighting of Ernest Steward and you have the perfect schoolboy's adventure yarn which will appeal as much to adults.".

Quite a lowbudget fare but what makes it a fun outing is Sharp's precisely lean direction makes good use of the detailed location work and moves at a cracking pace since the chase between nemesis's is a race against the clock blending together the unpredictable nature of the unfolding narrativetough action rather well while upfront actor Nigel Green gives a stellar performance as the persistent detective Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard. Green breathes confidence and the hearty script ably compels and allows for the strong performances. Lee fits in the calculative role of Manchu and the likes of Tsai Chin and Howard Marion Crawford are durable in their roles. The venturesome tone is bathed in a comic book frame but I found the music score to be intrusively cued and the conclusion to be somewhat anticlimactic to the actual buildup.".

Quite a lowbudget fare but what makes it a fun outing is Sharp's precisely lean direction makes good use of the detailed location work and moves at a cracking pace since the chase between nemesis's is a race against the clock blending together the unpredictable nature of the unfolding narrativetough action rather well while upfront actor Nigel Green gives a stellar performance as the persistent detective Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard. Green breathes confidence and the hearty script ably compels and allows for the strong performances. Lee fits in the calculative role of Manchu and the likes of Tsai Chin and Howard Marion Crawford are durable in their roles. The venturesome tone is bathed in a comic book frame but I found the music score to be intrusively cued and the conclusion to be somewhat anticlimactic to the actual buildup.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was turned onto the Fu Manchu movies by the seminal Marvel comic Master of Kung Fu which used characters from the Fu Manchu novels as well as original ones. That series was Bruce LeemeetsJames Bond and was filled with atmosphere intrigue action and some humor. So I was expecting more of the same since artist Paul Gulacy used Christopher Lee as his model though he made Fu more Asian. Well that's not quite what I got here but it was still pretty entertaining.Nigel Green makes for an excellent Nayland Smith who was essentially cut from the Sherlock Holmes pattern and Green plays him as such. Howard MarionCrawford made for a suitable Watsonesque Petrie though with a bit more assertiveness than Nigel Bruce. Lee of course was great even though the film required him to be a bit subdued though at least he didn't play a complete stereotype.The films exist in a weird 1920s1960s hybrid. The male fashions and the cars suggest the 20s but the women are pure 60s. There is enough mystery and action to keep things from slowing down too much though the film does drag in parts. Fu's plot is evil enough to propel things with murdered villages and drowned Si Fan to add a bit of grisly horror though these films didn't have the budget to portray the horrors of the books. It was never going to win awards but it is diverting enough on a quiet Sunday afternoon.This series and the German Mabuse films are guilty pleasures of master criminals and evil schemes with neither particularly well made except for the Lang Mabuse films but still providing just enough entertainment to justify their existence. This is by far the highpoint of the Fu Manchu series as things would steadily decline later as rightly skewered by MST3K.If you like a bit of pulp mystery and adventure this film and a few of the others is worth a look but keep a forgiving eye on the production. It does feature a first rate cast and a decent plot which makes up for a lot.".

The racism of this is so selfevident it's probably not worth mentioning although the blazing red whenever the Chinese are around and the workerlike garb of Manchu's henchmen suggest some sort of allegory of Communism  or is this story of a megalomaniacal worlddominationlusting Chinaman a parody of such portentousness?I really wanted to like this film but there's so much wrong with it. It's been called a spoof but if so the joke's on me.  The 1920s setting is somewhat rudimentary  a few contemporary cars and hats in what looks like a very 1960s London although the reviewer below suggests it is in fact Dublin.  Far from camp the plot is played so straight as to be unenjoyable.  Every absurdity and implausibility rather than hurtling us into the giddy realms of fantasy rather lumbers us in a plot of cliched hackery.The acting is abysmal  I've never gotten the point of Christopher Lee he never had Peter Cushing's middleaged anguish although his plummy English tones in the supposed role of a fiendish Chinaman offers some amusement as does his daft moustache worst of all is Nigel Green as the oaklike hero Nayland Smith  a man so unexpressive and graceless should be funny but here is dull slowing down the film at every turn.  Only FU Manchu's very sexy daughter Tsai Chin enthralls her subservience to her father suggesting perverse depths of sadomasochism.This is all the more frustrating in that the film has merit in abundance. The colour schemes costumes setdesigns and compositions are frequently gorgeous if sometimes let down by leaden direction the afoementioned incestuous undertones in the relationship between Fu and daughter a splendid ironising despite the racism of the noble West  Nayland Smith is quite clearly insane and with his Chinese ladyservant and death mask ornaments seems more of a mirror image than a foil for Fu Manchu there is also something wrong with chemists that research into a concoction that can wipe out whole peoples  there is a RIVER KWAIlike frisson in the plight of the Professor who ironically and enthusiastically aids his captor there is a splendidly directed and designed car chase reminiscent as Tom Milne notes of silent serials.Best of all is the setting of this grotesque potboiler in placid England. This discrepancy gives the film an AVENGERSlike chill on occasion especially the amazing scene where Fu Manchu first exercises his power and wipes out an entire village  spinetingling chilling and much more frightening than a similar scene in GOLDFINGER.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sax Rohmer's fiendish menace from the Orient the diabolical Dr. Fu Manchu springs to life on the silver screen embodied by the decidedly European Christopher Lee in this the first of five fiendish flicks of fright.I find it very hard to take these films seriously coming back to them after Steve Coogan and Mark Gatiss' superb parody in Dr. Terrible's House of Horrible. I almost expected the legendary Mr. Lee to come out with lines like 'Something has happened to my WooWoo' or indeed 'You have walked into my trap and now the time has come for me to shut my trap'. However Lee is superb as always with able support from the lovely Tsai Chin as Lin Tang deadly daughter of Fu Manchu. These menaces from the East are ranged against Nigel Green as Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard and Howard Marion Crawford as his stalwart sidekick Dr. Petrie who must stop their plan to distil the deadly poison of the Tibetan black hill poppy.Despite an obvious limited budget with Dublin standing in for 1920s Limehouse the film holds up well. Coproduction cash from Germany means we get a decidedly Teutonic supporting cast including the gorgeous Karin Dor probably best known as Helga Brandt in You Only Live Twice  costarring Tsai Chin funnily enough. One of the biggest distractions for me however was the sight of Jim Norton Bishop Brennan of Father Ted in the small role of the professor's driver.All good pulpy fun from the days when it was acceptable to yellow up a white actor to play an Asian. They don't make 'em like this anymore.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sax Rohmer's fiendish menace from the Orient the diabolical Dr. Fu Manchu springs to life on the silver screen embodied by the decidedly European Christopher Lee in this the first of five fiendish flicks of fright.I find it very hard to take these films seriously coming back to them after Steve Coogan and Mark Gatiss' superb parody in Dr. Terrible's House of Horrible. I almost expected the legendary Mr. Lee to come out with lines like 'Something has happened to my WooWoo' or indeed 'You have walked into my trap and now the time has come for me to shut my trap'. However Lee is superb as always with able support from the lovely Tsai Chin as Lin Tang deadly daughter of Fu Manchu. These menaces from the East are ranged against Nigel Green as Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard and Howard Marion Crawford as his stalwart sidekick Dr. Petrie who must stop their plan to distil the deadly poison of the Tibetan black hill poppy.Despite an obvious limited budget with Dublin standing in for 1920s Limehouse the film holds up well. Coproduction cash from Germany means we get a decidedly Teutonic supporting cast including the gorgeous Karin Dor probably best known as Helga Brandt in You Only Live Twice  costarring Tsai Chin funnily enough. One of the biggest distractions for me however was the sight of Jim Norton Bishop Brennan of Father Ted in the small role of the professor's driver.All good pulpy fun from the days when it was acceptable to yellow up a white actor to play an Asian. They don't make 'em like this anymore.";

Taking over the mantle from Boris Karloff  who had played Manchu in the 1930s  Lee's Manchu films would always be cheaper less entertaining affairs but still served up enough action and twists in the plot to keep things moving along nicely.All of the staples of the adventure genre are there people being tied up to chairs and freeing themselves people being whipped glass tanks filling with water and drowning people and most of all the heroes fighting off villains. I loved the fight scenes in these films. Nayland Smith attacks one of his friends and fights in a laboratory for what seems like an eternity. After the little scrap neither men are bleeding! Of course Chinese people are the ones getting beaten up and stabbed in a variety of PG certificate ways along the way which does make the film seem a little racist in today's society. Nigel Green is memorably sternfaced and proud in his oneoff role as Manchu's chief adversary Nayland Smith while Tsai Chin is also wickedly evil as Manchu's daughter. She would return in later entries in the series. Lee however carries the film on his shoulders and is excellent as the softspoken super villain with the long moustache and funny costume. Very typical of the FLASH GORDONtype serials of the '30s with the emphasis on plot twists explosions kidnapping and escape and fighting THE FACE OF FU MANCHU is a hugely enjoyable yarn to be enjoyed by old and new alike.

	schema:reviewBody "The first of five films starring Christopher Lee as the Chinese criminal mastermind created by Sax Rohmer this is enormous fun from start to finish. I have to admit that I was slightly apprehensive before watching the film as Fu Manchu is the archetypal Chinese character of the Yellow Peril era but I need not have worried. Yes the character is played by a man whose only remotely Chinese attribute is his surname but both Lee's performance and the strong script manage to prevent Fu Manchu from devolving into a racist caricature. The film is very well directed by Hammer veteran Don Sharp and there are some great action scenes and some very memorable visuals.Lee one of my absolute favourite actors is never less than completely compelling as Fu Manchu who is such a frightening figure in part because he never raises his voice. The truly powerful do not need to shout and scream to have their way. He is an amoral genius who wishes to use the poisonous solution that can be obtained from the black hill poppy which grows only in Tibet to gain control of Britain and eventually the world. He is a great villain of the old mould. Nigel Green is excellent in the role of his archnemesis Denis Nayland Smith and it is a shame that he did not return for any of the sequels being replaced by Douglas Wilmer in the second and third films and Richard Greene in the fourth and fifth.The film has a very strong supporting cast overall Joachim Fuchsberger as Carl Jannsen Karin Dor as Maria Muller Walter Rilla the father of Village of the Damned director Wolf Rilla as her father Professor Muller Tsai Chin as Fu Manchu's daughter Lin Tang Howard MarionCrawford as Dr. Petrie and James Robertson Justice as Sir Charles. Like Lee Chin and MarionCrawford appeared in all five films. Unlike Hammer's 1961 film The Terror of the Tongs there were several actors of Chinese descent who had speaking roles in the film and I appreciated that. Lee played a similar character in that film but I am glad to say that he toned down his performance on this occasion.It was filmed in Dublin and the neighbouring countryside and I recognised a few of the streets. I was on the lookout for street signs in Irish or other things that would give away that it was filmed in Ireland but I couldn't spot any unfortunately. Unless of course you count the inclusion of Irish actors such as the great character actor Jim Norton in one of his first on screen roles and Joe Lynch who is little known outside Ireland but is well known in the country for his role as Dinny in the longrunning soap opera Glenroe.Overall this is a hugely enjoyable old fashioned thriller which I enjoyed far more than I expected.".

With that said while there are plenty of good things on display here there's no question that this is still a film with plenty of flaws which is really too bad because with a little editing this here could have been much much better than it is.There's no doubt that the highlight of the picture and the series is the performance of Lee who really does a nice job with the role. This is certainly the type of role that many actors would have just taken the check and sleepwalked through but Lee manages to be very effective here simply because of his body movements. I say that because there's really not too much dialogue for him to work with and instead of screaming his way through the part Lee must use his eyes and gestures to tell the viewer everything they need to know. I really love how still Lee is and this here just adds an evil quality to the role. The supporting players are also good in their parts with Smith making for the perfect hero to go up against Fu Manchu and there's no doubt that Chin brings a nice sexuality to her role.The film has a pretty good story and I thought the cat and mouse games between the Inspector and Fu Manchu were good. The film also benefits from a pretty good look and there's no doubt that director Don Sharp handles the material well. With that said the biggest flaw is that the film simply runs a bit too long and I think some editing would have made for a nicer pace. I'd also say that hang more Fu Manchu would have been a major plus since Lee and the character are certainly the highlights. THE FACE OF FU MANCHU kicked off a five film series and it certainly went downhill after this film but this one remains entertaining in a Saturdaymatine type of way.".

No camping no whitewater rafting no vacation at all. So it doesn't surprise anyone that the young witch is quite disgruntled when arriving at Altenberg Castle. Her roommate is a touchy unpleassant fashion victim and headmaster Quirin Bartels is so muddleheaded that he can't even remember the names of his students properly. But then Bibi makes friends with Elea a girl wheelchairbound since a terrible accident where she also lost her beloved parents. Now Bibi is determined to help the sensitive Elea searching a way to heal her from her palsy legs. Aunt Walpurgia the respectable witch of the coven of Blocksberg tells Bibi the legend of the blue owls also called Solace Owls  magical beasts with a healing powder hidden in their blue coats.

	schema:reviewBody "The title of this German film means literally that it is about the secret of the blue owls and this already has a touch of Harry Potter to it not only because of Hedwig. And there we already have one connection why you could say that these films are the German equivalent to Potter apart from the obvious that the main character is a magician that comes from a family of magicians too. But there are also several aspects that make for crucial differences. One would be that this here released in 2004 is only a duology the first came out two years earlier. There are no people dying and it is generally lighter in tone. And there is a lot more. Hermine Huntgeburth did not return as director from the first film but Franziska Buch took over and did a good job in my opinion. The screenplay is once again by Elfie Donnelly the inventor of Bibi Blocksberg and Benjamin Blmchen. And I liked the script too.This time Bibi struggles at school so she has to go to a boarding school for the summer where she gets a new good friend a boy who may be something like a love interest already played by the really young Frederick Lau but also meets girls who are not exactly to her liking namely the shallow superficial type. I can only say I am a bit disappointed that lead actress Sidonie von Krosigk has apparently stopped acting now because I like her in these films but oh well as long as she is happy it's fine I guess. I already mentioned the name Lau and if you take a look at the cast list here you will find really many wellknown names from German cinema like Noethen Riemann Selge Bleibtreu and Petri some of them reprising her roles from the first film that show you how beloved not just the Bibi Blocksberg character is but also how kids films are generally crowd magnets for known actors here in Germany. To this date actually. And another we have here is of course Corinna Harfouch who plays the antagonist again in this one namely the wicked witch Rabia who can indeed be described as rabiat. Harfouch won a German Film Award for her portrayal in the first film so I really would have been shocked if she didn't return even if her story would have made it look realistic. But with Rabia losing her powers at the end of this film here so ends the franchise relatively quickly.So yes it was pretty shortlived especially if we compare it to Detlev Buck's more recent take on the subject. It is really difficult to compare these 2 approaches I would say because they are really different and have hardly anything in common except the Bibi character. This one here focuses more on witchcraft and mysteries while the Buck films are teenage fun mostly a touch of Hannah Montana with maybe not always the best stories but really good and catchy music. I like them both I guess. The good thing about the sequel from 2004 is also that it never drags despite a pretty massive running time of 110 minutes for a kids movie. I give it a thumbsup and in my opinion a thumbsdown for the sexism against males though as honestly the male characters here were quite on the doofus level at least Noethen and Selge it is very much worth checking out for the not very young ones and those young at heart like myself. Shame they never made a third film.".

If we hear the name Zenthe usually two of his 'films' come to mind though both of them were series the Szomszdok Neighbours and the A Tenkes kapitnya Captain Of The Tenkes so I was greatly surprised to find no comment here.This series is known by everyone in the country. You can hardly find a person in Hungary who doesn't know the music of the film. I didn't write soundtrack because it is more than that. When you hear it from the radio you think Ah yes the Captain of The Tenkes. When the series was first broadcast on TV it was so popular that it was introduced even in China and it is a long way from Hungary and became ever so popular there as well. After the series they made a shorter 2hour version as well and both can be seen on TV quite often even nowadays.One of the actors said that it is almost like a fairytale and it is watched best as that. There is no blood flowing we can't see any murders committed with revenge or hate sometimes it is slow there is no slang and of course it is black and white. But if you actually sit down to watch it it will grab you and will never let you go. It is a tale where the good wins but the bad doesn't really suffer either. The performances are outstanding from the youngest firsttimeactors to the oldest experts.It is about how Mt Eke the 'Captain' and the people near the castle of Sikls try to rebel against the commander of the castle and make his days hell while awaiting the relieving troops of the kuruc's to finally free them from the rule of the foreign soldiers set in the early 18th century. It is a tale which can be watched even by children not just over 12 or 13 and is constantly rewatched by adults.It is one of those rare films which will be broadcast even in 20 years for the 'Captain' and his whole bunch simply cannot be forgotten.".

Her performance alone is worth watching the movie for. But unlike showstoppers like Marissa Tomei in My Cousin Vinnie merely shines the brightest light in a luminescent cast.The cinematography was innovative but not distractingly so Girl Interupted shines primarily for its dramatic power not as a mindblowing work of art. It will not explode your vision of the mundane world in the same way that American Beauty might but it will certainly probe you to question your way of seeing the world at least psychologically.Winona Ryder challenged my preconception of her and proved herself as more than a prettygirl. Her performance was convincing as Suzanna a confused highschool graduate who is eloquent and insightful on paper yet unable to a rticulate her own desperate melancholy.The movie takes place primarily in the women's ward of a mental institution and follows the dynamic friendship between Lisa Jolie's character and Suzanna. Lisa is a kinetic dynamic personality who cuts right to the truth of things. Her truth knows no boundaries and she is a controlling person prone to violence. Her piercing insights about people and social recklessness led to her to be institutionalized as a sociopath.This is not a depressing film. Rather it is suprisingly lifeaffirming. Not cloying not sacherine but not inpenetrably dark either.  Anyone seeking an angstridden portrayal of abuses in mental institutions should check out Jack Nicholson's One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest.This film has little of the violent anger of that old classic. Yet it does echo some of the ebulience the defiance of authority and embracing of freedom at sometimes incalculable cost.Performances by Whoppie Goldberg in a serious and nuanced role and Vanessa Redgrave were excellent as expected.With the exception of a few holywood gimmicks predictable cuts and music this is a nearly flawless film. Deadon dramatically and excellently scripted and based on an eloquent truestory by Suzana Keisen this movie offers a glimpse of one intensely personal experience of truth. Without the quotation marks dark cynicism or pretensions that revelation so frequently entails.".

Based on her memoir the film portrays Susanna Kaysen's short stay in a famous mental hospital supposedly to cure her borderline personality disorder.'  Set in the late 1960's Winona Ryder effectively portrays Kaysen.In a tradition reminiscent of Holden Caulfield the audience knows there is nothing actually wrong with Kaysen except that she is a typical teenager and refuses to conform to the life her parents want for her.  However after spending some time with her ward mates and numerous doctors she starts to believe that she is insane but can't understand why or what exactly is wrong with her.  At one point she asks a sympathetic nurse played by Whoopi Goldberg how she is expected to be cured if she doesn't even understand her illness.  Throughout the film writer James Mangold's exploration of Kaysen's changing emotions and attempts to understand her illness' is captivating.However even more fascinating than Kaysen herself were the supporting characters.   Perhaps the most striking of these characters though is Lisa played by Angelina Jolie.  Jolie completely immerses herself in the role and gives a moving intriguing  and haunting performance as Susanna's best friend at the hospital.  Although Ryder does an excellent job portraying the earnestness and confusion of her character Jolie is the true star of this movie.Adapted from  Kaysen's memoir the film works well to bring Kaysen's' words to life.  The parts that were altered for the screenplay made sense allowing the story to translate well to the screen.  Additionally the length of the film allowed for more depth and details to be explored which sometimes left out of Kaysen's short novel.  Thus the film helped add onto and bring more understanding to characters which were introduced in the novel.".

In the 60's author Susanna Kaysen was in a similar position she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life but knew she didn't quite fit into the norm.  Because of that and because of some legitimate problemsshe tried to kill herself by swallowing a bottle of aspirin she went into a mental hospital and was tagged with having borderline personality disorder a catchall phrase which meant whatever the doctors wanted it to mean.  From her experiences in the hospital Kaysen wrote the book GIRL INTERRUPTEDthe title comes from a Vermeer painting and now comes the movie version from James Mangold and Winona Ryder.Mangold's first two films HEAVY and COPLAND were both about main characters leading lives of quiet desperation the pizza chef in HEAVY unable to express himself and the partly sheriff in COPLAND who must learn to assume his responsibility with that position.  Susanna fits in with those two characters and Mangold does just as good a job with her except for some melodramatic scenes near the end.  There are some major themes going on here like whether Susanna is really crazy just spoiled or conditioned to think something is wrong with her the nature of what crazy is in the 60's and of course being a woman at the time but Mangold avoids making big statements for the most part instead concentrating on Susanna's growth into being a little more sure of herself.As has been said before Ryder brings a lot to the table not just being a talented actress but life research having spent time in a hospital due to exhaustionthis is why she pulled out of GODFATHER PART III as well.  And instead of going for obvious drama she too just makes Susanna's recovery a gradual and detailed journey except for those melodramatic scenes.  The first third which seems to be influence by SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE flashes back and forth through time as if showing Susanna feeling lost and fragmented.  The rest of the movie is more linear but Ryder doesn't make it boring.Some people have dismissed this as a chick ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST which is the usual kneejerk response whenever a mostly female cast tackles what is normally done with a mostly male cast.  In truth they're very different movies primarily because in CUCKOO we're meant to see the hospital staff represented by Nurse Ratched as evil trying to break down the patients rather than build them up.  Here on the other hand while we're meant to see the system's shortcomingsin addition to what I said before the different meanings of promiscuous when applied to men and women the hospital staff is generally seen as trying to do the best they can.  The patients may make fun of the doctorswellplayed by Jeffrey Tambor and Vanessa Redgrave and occasionally challenge the nurseshead nurse Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance in a long time but there's no real hatred here except maybe from Lisa.Angelina Jolie certainly has a flashy role with Lisa the resident sociopath but makes her seem real until the movie betrays her at the end. When she's pushing people's buttons she's actually quite sly about it which is a lot more multidimensional than some have made it out to be.  The rest of the cast playing patients is also goodit was a little heartbreaking seeing Elisabeth Moss playing a burn victim especially when they show a picture of her as a young girl where she looks like she did in IMAGINARY CRIMES.  But it's Ryder who is the main reason for seeing this fine movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "In more ways than one 'Girl Interrupted' is very similar to 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest'. To begin with both the films are set in mental institutions and chronicle life as it unfolds amidst those bland white walls. Characters in both the film are acutely lifelike. But owing perhaps to it being a true story 'Girl Interrupted' has characters that are much easier to identify with than McMurphy's brigade. Set in the 60's the film is an account of the times spent in the Mental Institution by an eighteen year girl Susanna Kaysen a character portrayed with astonishing brilliance by the versatile Winona Ryder. Susanna is a victim of neurosis great expectations confusion an uncertain future and the sundry other problems an average teenager's life are pounded with. For all her brilliance Susanna has the undeniable gift of the cynic and the pessimist who still hasn't made up her mind about life's meaning and is upset about it. She has the nagging feeling that her character is incomplete and gets caught in the depressing vortex of tendencies that earn her the title of what we're later told a border line personality. An almost successful but unintentional suicide attempt lands her in the footsteps of Claymoore a mental instituition. In the confined borders of the instituition Susanna is surprised to discover how well she identifies with the pain and flaws of fellow inmates. Here the atmosphere is sans any prejudice or cliches. Here everyone is a victim one way or the other. Far from the deplorable world outside the instituition susanna feels that she's finally home. And it is this atmosphere that slowly gives way to the realisation of her actual needs her character and her purpose. In the first half of the film the director employs an interesting technique of fusing two different scenes and establishing a coherence that not only takes the story forward but at the same time tells us what is already past. Apart from Susanna and maybe Lisa few characters are generously sketched. This although doesn't allow the loosening of the plot's grip on you. Furthermore the institution is projected in a more agreeable light and the resultant sympathy for the characters  unlike 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest' does not coincide with an abhorrence towards the angle of treatment. The movie does lead the viewer to understand the plight of the inmates but not with the object of establishing the reasons that led to their condition. Rather it concentrates on the way these girls face their fate day in and day out. It also highlights the way the girls identify with each others problems hopes and desires in a fashion that alternates between being poignant and amusing. Perhaps the most distinct factor about the movie is the exemplary performances put up by a cast that mostly comprises of females. I haven't seen a film that could hold its own without a single male lead as good as this movie does. Winona Ryder is very convincing as Susanna. Angelina Jolie delivers so well that I am having a hard time getting over the fact that she agreed to Lara Croft. Whoopi Goldberg is good but her role is regrettably restricted. Constrained performances by all the actresses make this film worthy of being watched. It is funny sad mischievous and optimistic all at the same time. Watch it if you can for it is very unlikely that you would get disappointed. Like I said it is quite likeable!".

	schema:reviewBody "GIRL INTERRUPTED  1999 12 out of fourBy Blake FrenchHave you ever confused a dream with life? Or stolen something when you have the cash? Have you ever been blue? Or thought your train moving while sitting still? Maybe I was just crazy. Maybe it was the 60's. Or maybe I was just a girl... interrupted.Those are some of the most memorable lines from James Mangold's honest heartfelt drama Girl Interrupted. The speaker is Susanna Kaysen played by Winona Ryder. The film is based on the memoir of Kaysen herself reencountering the experiences she actually spent in a mental institution after an attempted suicide. The book of the same name was published in 1993 it spent time on almost every bestseller list including 11 weeks on the New York Times. It was in the 1980's when Kaysen began to revisit the most formative time in her life20 years after the actual hospitalization. Memories of a nearly twoyear stay at McLean Psychiatric Hospital a private and exclusive institution near Cambridge resurfaced while constructing her second book. She began writing vignettes of her experiences in the hospital writing short stories about a time in her life she had not discussed for two decades.The only thing that ever made me less loony was writing remembers Cambridge Massachusettsbased writer Susanna Kaysen author of her memoir Girl Interrupted. Set in the turbulent 60's the film details the young Kaysen who finds herself at a mental institution for disturbed young women. Susanna makes friends including a seductive and dangerous regular named Lisa Angelina Jolie. I have never read this book but after watching Girl Interrupted I am seriously considering it. The film is a powerful exploration into a depressing bleak situation. When this movie was released theatrically in late 1999 I wondered how many people would want to see something about a young writer who tries to kill herself and then spends time in a nuthouse. However I was wrong to presume anything. Girl Interrupted contains a vivid convincing world for its characters but never do we feel awkward while watching this film but involved and concerned. Screenadapters James Mangold Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan construct a central character that is both consistent and empathetic.

	onyx:emotionText "GIRL INTERRUPTED  1999 12 out of fourBy Blake FrenchHave you ever confused a dream with life? Or stolen something when you have the cash? Have you ever been blue? Or thought your train moving while sitting still? Maybe I was just crazy. Maybe it was the 60's. Or maybe I was just a girl... interrupted.Those are some of the most memorable lines from James Mangold's honest heartfelt drama Girl Interrupted. The speaker is Susanna Kaysen played by Winona Ryder. The film is based on the memoir of Kaysen herself reencountering the experiences she actually spent in a mental institution after an attempted suicide. The book of the same name was published in 1993 it spent time on almost every bestseller list including 11 weeks on the New York Times. It was in the 1980's when Kaysen began to revisit the most formative time in her life20 years after the actual hospitalization. Memories of a nearly twoyear stay at McLean Psychiatric Hospital a private and exclusive institution near Cambridge resurfaced while constructing her second book. She began writing vignettes of her experiences in the hospital writing short stories about a time in her life she had not discussed for two decades.The only thing that ever made me less loony was writing remembers Cambridge Massachusettsbased writer Susanna Kaysen author of her memoir Girl Interrupted. Set in the turbulent 60's the film details the young Kaysen who finds herself at a mental institution for disturbed young women. Susanna makes friends including a seductive and dangerous regular named Lisa Angelina Jolie. I have never read this book but after watching Girl Interrupted I am seriously considering it. The film is a powerful exploration into a depressing bleak situation. When this movie was released theatrically in late 1999 I wondered how many people would want to see something about a young writer who tries to kill herself and then spends time in a nuthouse. However I was wrong to presume anything. Girl Interrupted contains a vivid convincing world for its characters but never do we feel awkward while watching this film but involved and concerned. Screenadapters James Mangold Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan construct a central character that is both consistent and empathetic. As the movie opens we never see Kaysen's suicide attemptthere is no need to show it. This is a film about the results not the action. We gradually learn about Kaysen as the movie progresses thus the lack of initial character development. Even with little introductory material to establish her character Winona Ryder creates a soothing intriguing sole for Kaysen. The audience cares about Susanna before we even understand why she was sent to the mental institution.The film's supporting cast including Jared Leto Clea Duvall Elizabeth Moss Jeffrey Tambor Whoopi Goldberg Vanessa Redgrave and Angelina Jolie who won an Academy Award for her performance actually develops the mood of the filman essential aspect of its overall impact. James Mangold Copland has a ambiguous style here but it works extraordinarily well in this film.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Let's be honest for a moment. As humanity settles itself into a new millennium there are so many aspects of life which we remain ignorant about. One aspect in particular is the realm of the human mind. With countless philosophical theories designed to explain the interaction between the brain and the body science is still at a major loss to explain it. In the modern world we deal with the mentally ill through discussion and pumping them full of drugs. It's a practise which has been in use for decades in one form or another and it remains a practise which treats the ill with a varied degree of success.If we look back in time at the 1960s however the process was of a similar format. People would be locked in an institute pumped full of drugs and often for the simple fact that their behaviour was different to the social climate. Girl Interrupted was a book written by a woman who experienced this case of affairs and whilst altered slightly in story the film adaptation is a brilliant story which raises more questions about mental health than it cares to answer.Susanna Kaysen Winona Ryder is a promiscuous rebel who spends her time depressed and pondering her death. With an alternative point of view to people of her time but a mindscape that most modern teenage Goths would probably agree with she finds herself placed in a mental hospital. There she meets interesting people both doctors and patients as she tries to come to terms with her own mind.Sometimes labelled as the female equivalent of One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest Girl Interrupted is a clever film which leaves you questioning your mental health throughout. Based on the book by Susanna Kaysen it has insider information giving it a solid basis.In the lead role Winona Ryder gives perhaps her finest performance to date as she questions everything around her before she begins to question herself. Whether she ever really needs the hospital in the first place or whether it does her any good or not is open to interpretation but from the first moments of the film she keeps us involved with the character and never allows us to stop caring about her.In a mirror image of Ryder Angelina Jolie plays the sociopathic Lisa. Coming from a broken home Lisa is another of these characters who you find it very difficult to understand just how sane she is. Jolie manages to give the character an air of menace throughout the film whether friendly or aggressive. She provides a solid character and whilst Ryder arguably deserved more award recognition for her role Jolie is definitely worthy of the Best Supporting Actress Oscar which she won with this role.Both women's superb performances are also helped by some great acting by the rest of the cast. Including an impressive Brittany Murphy Clea DuVall Whoopi Goldberg Jared Leto and Vanessa Redgrave the acting is always above standard and hard to fault.In a time of social revolution there was as is ever a thin line between genius and insanity. Whilst people like Martin Luther King changed the world there were others who were locked up for mental instability. Whether they were truly insane or not is a difficult question to answer. But set at this time of great importance it is magnificent films like Girl Interrupted that ironically open our minds and get us thinking. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is very similar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest inevitably as it's almost entirely set in a mental hospital at roughly the same time in this case the late '60s. Cuckoo's Nest was a great film but though flawed this allfemale version based on a true story is better. This review contains spoilers but only of a general nature.The plot concerning a young woman who commits herself following a failed suicide attempt and is 'cured' more through contact with the other inmates than the rather hapless attempts of staff to help her is more connected and purposeful than that of Cuckoo's Nest. The supporting cast of inmates here are real people with real backstories rather than twitching Christopher Lloyds leering weirdos and silent Indian giants.The acting is what sets this film apart though. Winona Rider's lowkey Susanna is easily a match for Nicholson's McMurphy and Fletcher's Big Nurse and she's ably supported by a superstraight Whoopi Goldberg as a nurse and an interestingly odd Vanessa Redgrave as the head doctor. But this film is all about the stunning performance by Angelina Jolie proving that truly great acting sometimes does win Oscars she got Best Supporting Actress. As the ward's sociopathic 'top dog' Lisa Jolie flits from the vulnerable and charming to the terrifyingly pitiless conveying more with half a glance than others can through whole speeches. This is one of the great acting performances of cinema history all the more astounding as this actor though always competent has never produced anything near this level elsewhere. Not to be missed.There wasn't much about the film I didn't like but the ending left me feeling dissatisfied. The message almost seems to be that Lisa is the problem and the hospital however ineffectual is a kind of solution. In fact Lisa is just as much a victim of the barbaric practices electric shock therapy lobotomy etc used in psychiatry in those days as McMurphy but while we can hate the system that destroys McMurphy  a powerful element of the final payoff in Cuckoo's Nest  it's not so easy here. All the hospital staff despite varying degrees of competence are uniformly pleasant and wellmeaning and it's harder to hate a system that contains no hint of any villain. This is a true story of course. I'm not sure how closely the film follows the book but the truth was that many psychiatric staff in those days were honestly applying damaging treatments which they believed were helping their patients. With the human mind still largely unknown territory this still happens today.Though this lack of a villain to hate detracts from the power of the film's conclusion the brilliantly acted cast of real people with real problems ensures that this is in fact the definitive nuthouse film.".

	schema:headline " Director James Mangold hits a slight interruption of his own...";
	schema:reviewBody "After being touched by the sensitive film Heavy I couldn't wait to see what would happen with director James Mangold. This brash barbed insightful and touching drama is the result and although it has problems you end up caring about a lot of people you might otherwise try to avoid. Winona Ryder's performance as a young woman being treated for psychological problems in the allgirl wing of an institution in the late 1960s is very fine she's mannered at times and a little coy but she seems a sweet puppet with her wires cut a bobbing head doll and one never grows tired of her.

This brash barbed insightful and touching drama is the result and although it has problems you end up caring about a lot of people you might otherwise try to avoid. Winona Ryder's performance as a young woman being treated for psychological problems in the allgirl wing of an institution in the late 1960s is very fine she's mannered at times and a little coy but she seems a sweet puppet with her wires cut a bobbing head doll and one never grows tired of her.

	schema:reviewBody "It's always a simple task to relegate a movie or piece of work to a niche in the wall claiming that it borrows or steals from one thing or another.  In the case of Girl Interrupted it's very easy to say It's a 'Cuckoo's Nest' with girls.  Looking at things on such a superficial level one could argue that every story steals from all those before it.  But the truth of the matter is that certain ideas are so fundamental so classical that they have applied to us for as long as anybody can remember.  If basing a movie on a mental institution and its patients concocts triteness then basing a movie on love is as much of a sin.Girl Interrupted places us in the eyes of Susanna Kaysen Winona Ryder a teenage girl who suffers from depression and is signed into the custody of a psychiatric hospital after a failed attempt at suicide.  Like most young people who suffer from this state Susanna is unable to acknowledge the disorder that affects her.  Seeing things from a practical point of viewbelieving in cause and effectmakes it difficult for her to understand what she suffers from when she doesn't understand what caused the condition to begin with.Enter Lisa faultlessly played by Angelina Jolie.  Beautiful savage defiant and extremely charismatic she introduces Susanna to a new line of thought it's the world that's screwed up not them.  The world is afraid of aberrations such as themselvespeople who create a dissonance in the perfect balance of their ideal society.  Thus they lock them up in mental institutions and rejoice once that the problem is taken up by the hands of others after the exchange of a sizable amount of cash.Susanna needless to say is enthralled by her new friend  Lisa is somebody who knows the inner workings of the world someone to latch onto.  And when one latches onto somebody else in such a manner either individually or in a group selfexpression and individuality are more often than not sacrificed. Susanna who was once overwhelmed by the number of choices that confronted her in life is now ecstatic at the simplicity of her new life in the ward revolting with Lisa against an unfair system an unfair world.At the heart of this film however lies a much more fundamental classical idea  friendshipwhat causes it how it can invigorate us in the worst of times and its short and longterm effects.  With a beautiful poetic grace the movie states that it's not the duration of a relationship that matters but who it is that you befriend and the place that they earn in your heart while it lasts.  Every relationship in our life is shortlived as we're continually moving forward in our journey towards a fulfilled existence time does not stand still and the film makes a conscious effort to constantly accentuate this point.For a movie that was almost entirely shot in a hospital ward the cinematography is exceptionally good.  While it's mostly a characterdriven piece there are a number of interesting shots and tricks that truly place us in the eyes of Susanna and a few montages that are propelled by what I would consider a perfect soundtrack.  At the forefront of course are the actresses themselves and no words could describe what they've accomplished here.  It's simply astounding.Though the light that Girl Interrupted attempts to place on mentally unstable people is a little questionable at times it does a nice subtle job of exposing the puerile nature of a profession which we could nowadays consider an industry.  They're delicate subjects to touch upon sure.  But in the end the journey is definitely worth taking.  When I asked myself why I found the manner in which the story was handled so endearing I recalled one of Winona's most insightful lines Crazy isn't being broken or swallowing a dark secret.

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who has ever had an obsession felt impulses to be drastic over something inconsequential felt a bit out of place or ever had in the back of their mind the sinking suspicion that they might be just a little bit crazy should see this film. Girl Interrupted is rather selfindulgent like watching children attack a bowl of Halloween candy or witnessing family members playfully fighting over the last piece of pumpkin pie.Is Girl Interrupted really saying crazy people are different from normal people? I don't think so. Alleged crazy people are normal people. They're the ones who say yes to thoughts that other people say no to. Borderlines are people thinking maybe. Winona Ryder's character Susanna Kaysen based on the author of the book is the narrator of this story. It is her 'borderline' eyes that we are peering through. We learn that Susanna flushed a bottle of aspirin down with a bottle of vodka. This leads her parents into carefully goading her into locking herself up inside Claymoore a mental hospital. She goes willingly but reluctantly not really paying attention to anything because her mind is filled with echoes of the past and she deludes herself into becoming delusional. Eventually she is diagnosed as a borderline personality disorder. When compared to the other tenants on her ward in Claymoore however the more appropriate phrase would be psycho wannabe.Susanna's roommate is a pathological liar who is obsessed with the Oz series of books. Across the hallway is a girl who set herself on fire because she loved her cat. Another refuses to eat because 75 pounds is her ideal weight. So what we witness is a scared teenage girl in the late sixties surrounded by scared girls all rapidly turning into confused young women. We witness Susanna interrupting her own life for a year and a half in order to see in them what she has been what she is and what she might become if she crosses the borderline. Then comes Lisa. While Winona Ryder plays the tossed raft of this story upon which we skittishly cling Angelina Jolie appears on the scene like a powerful stormy sea ready to capsize us blow us off course or merely keep us company while we navigate the rough waters. Jolie steals the limelight from Ryder while simultaneously making her look good. Ryder holds the show well enough in the start much like Henry Winkler in the 1982 movie Night Shift before Michael Keaton's entrance but Jolie's performance of the sociopathic and charismatic Lisa gives this production a needed jumpstart. It also gives us a chance to examine the proceedings from another perspective Susanna's only just arrived but Lisa Rowe's been there half her life. While Susanna's borderline Lisa's already rocked her own boat so far she's drowning and builds temporary flotation devices by demeaning those around her but it leaves her dead inside. Somehow Jolie is able to present this hateful person in such a way as to make you want to punch her and hug the stuffing out of her at the same time. Whoopi Goldberg is a steady rock. While the madness and childishness spreads and recedes like beached waves on an ebbing tide Whoopi's performance of nurse Valerie lends us a consistent perspective of reason and duty. In one of the more powerful moments of the film Valerie picks the drugged and lazy Susanna up out of bed and plops her down into a tub filled with cold water. Valerie then tells Susanna in no uncertain terms what we have already surmized by this point Susanna doesn't belong here. She's not crazy now but if she drops anchor in Claymoore she eventually will be.Girl Interrupted is a powerful and moving film about what it means to be sane what it means to be a social animal and inevitably what it means to be human. It does get bogged down at times in the messages it tries to convey. Still the performances of the talent supercede the sometimes preachy dialogue and move the action along even those times when it appears the story's just running in circles. The plot is not so much invented in a classic way. After all this is based on real life and Kaysen's book is a memoir  a diary. It's real. So there is no real beginning middle and end. We're told basically why Susanna went in there we experience some of the highs and lows of her stay and she tries to show us why she got out. The first time I viewed the film I found myself wondering towards the end when exactly was it going to end and how. I was not personally satisfied with the rather ambiguous ending that was finally presented to me but the slice of life presented to us is an ambiguous one so ironically it seems fitting if not satisfying by design. It's not some golden destination of sanity that this film focuses on but the realization that being socially fit to function in society means to be a part of it and so it is the journey that keeps us sane.The rare references to The Wizard of Oz are just enough to bring light to the metaphor Susanna is like Dorothy. The people she meets along the way are like the scarecrow lion and tinman friends on the journey to getting back out. Claymoore hospital is in a way a land of Oz either a daydream or a nightmare depending on how you look at it. And perspective for someone who believes themselves insane is everything. Sanity is not a place but a state of mind. And after seeing this movie I was amused at myself as if I need a film to tell me something that should be so incredibly obvious.".

An excellent plot based on the true story of Susanna Kaysen's autobiography on her stay in a mental institution. Susanna Kaysen is played by Winona whom was hoping for this to be her big comeback to the big screen. However unlike Winona hoped Angelina stole the spotlight taking up all the attention for this movie in her role as Lisa Rowe Susanna's best friend a sociopath who takes the movie to extreme limits. Angelina Jolie won a well deserved academy award for best supporting actress for the flick. Definitely one of Angelina's better movies. Fast paced and exciting Girl Interrupted is definitely one of the greatest movies of 1999 and deserves all the credit it gets.".

	schema:headline " Interesting time capsule...";
	schema:reviewBody "From the years 1800 to 1960 very little progress was made in the understanding or treatment of mental illness. Part of this stagnation had to do with the fact that religious repression of medical science was still being shaken off at the time but the biggest culprit was the inability of society to wake up and realise that just because a fat suit behind a desk said all was well didn't necessarily make it so. Given that Australia calls itself the lucky country in spite of having the highest youth suicide rate in the entire world it doesn't appear that we'll be getting over that hurdle any time soon.But the treatment of the mentally ill in the 1960s is a radically different beast to what it has been since the patenting of Prozac and Zoloft in the mid 1990s. In the 1960s it was belived by medical staff of all walks that patients of any description had no real rights and that they had better do what was ordered or look out. Nowadays hospitals and doctors can be taken to court for trying to make a patient take pills without informing them of what the pills are meant to do. That's one area where progress has been made and films like this are useful in this way as they provide a bit of information about how things used to be. Maybe in another thirty years they will make a film about the treatment of mental patients in the 1990s. I'll probably get around to writing my own memoirs by then so Hollywood can give me a call if they are interested. I have some stories that will make their ears bleed.That's the one flaw with this film. The results of the primitive and often excessive treatments given in this film are very much prettiedup for the Hollywood audience. The 1960s is a time when such things as Deep Sleep Therapy a treatment where patients were put into druginduced comas and given ECT were thought of as a good idea. Many a patient was killed by this treatment and to not have such barbarisms mentioned at all in a film that is almost entirely set in a mental hospital is a mistake.Winona Ryder in the lead role is a bit of a nonevent. While it is true that she resembles a lot of archival photos of the real Susanna Kaysen her flatasaplank delivery makes her patently unconvincing. In a real mental hospital where patients are often climbing the walls it is truly difficult to believe that this woman would be kept there for the entirety of a day. If anyone needs to know why Angelina Jolie is one of the most wellregarded actors of her generation despite some shocking script choices this is the film to look at. She truly steals the show here and absorbs every last bit of audience sympathy. She acts rings around the entire cast including Whoopi Goldberg.All in all I gave this film a seven out of ten. It is just too prettiedup to have any impact but it does provide an interesting look at how far things have come as well as remained the same in around thirty or forty years.".

It does lose its momentum but regains it for an action packed finale. The actors and actresses are dressed sexily but never reveal anything nor is the violence ever overly bloody. This is rated PG13.

Shaike Ophir is endearing as put upon character Lelz.Accompanied by a quite appropriate cheese ball rock music score by Tony Berg and effectively lit and photographed by David Gurfinkel America 3000 is overall just too hard to resist.

Korvis is not like a ordinary american name too I guess. One strange is that all women in the movie looks like models except for one old woman. At the end of the movie their are a great battle between the frollos women and the plugarts men. You see both a lot of women and men die and beaten up. From the beginning there was ecually many women as men but in the end it remains five men but around 2030 women strange. I gave the movie a 5 out of 10 because it's really dumb and silly but at the same time really good because of its cheesyiness. If you like silly movie go rent this one  we did.".

Since the film takes place 900 years AFTER World War III and in the radioactive wild of Colorado how could anybody be suffering from bad '80's style haircuts?  Moron.  The hair is typical of a bunch of people stuck in the wild with the intelligence of a lower primate with no vanity.  Just wild unkenmpt hair.  Specifically mine.  I played Young Korvis the good looking one. The film is narrated by Mr. William Wallace who plays my grown up sidekick Gruss.  It could have been worse.  Chuck Wagner of TV's AutoMan who's a GREAT guy if you ever get a chance to meet him could've narrated which would have been a mistake.  While he has physical presence vocally he may be lacking.  And this is odd considering the amount of stage he's done before and since this film. Compared to the last Mad Max film this movie is downright inspirational even if filmed on a 3 million dollar budget.  The Director David Englebach went on to develop Over the Top with Sly Stallone.  Yeah I barfed too but it wasn't half bad.  Last comment since this is hardly a review but more of a defense of a terrible flick.. This movie never made it to MST3K....I checked.  What am I doing now?  I shoot music videos for up and coming rock bands.  If you're in the Los Angeles Area Friday march 5 2004 come to Johnny Foxx's and see Flying Venus the hottest group from Northern California destined to become the next big thing.

Weird! The leader of the men and the women's tiara queen 'rediscovering' sexual intercourse breathing and fumbling over each other.Some great dialogue When the leader discovers the bunker and receives a message intended for the president the message states No one asked for this war but GODDAMN it Mr President we've won it!

You would have to have been living under a rock for the last 100 years to not know how Romeo and Juliet ends.

	schema:headline " Beautiful Modernization of Shakespeare's Classic Play";
	schema:reviewBody "The amazing thing about this movie is that it has managed to redo Shakespeare's famous tragedy in a modern setting while still retaining its original dialogue. What's even more amazing is it works. I admit that I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie fearing that Luhrman had either destroyed the play's beauty and power by setting it in modern times or had butchered Shakespeare's eloquent words by making them sound more modern. I was wrong. Almost everything about this movie is just incredible.Luhrman brilliantly casted Claire Danes as fourteenyearold Juliet. The actress certainly looks the part with her youthful features and innocent eyes. More importantly she acts the part. Ms. Danes almost flawlessly captures Juliet's distressing journey from childhood to womanhood beautifully showing her dramatic transition which had taken toll on her during her five day relationship with Romeo. When the story begins Juliet is a naive girl having not yet experienced true love and by the end we can clearly see just how much her love for Romeo has deepened in passion and how dramatically her character has developed.Leanardo DeCaprio's Romeo was almost equally impressive. Some of his recitations of Shakespeare made me cringe but for the most part he was perfect. One of Romeo's most important characteristics in the play is the intensity of his emotions and DeCaprio captures this feature incredibly. Romeo is brash and impulsive with a tendency to act on the heat of the moment rather than to first consider the situation like the more levelheaded Juliet. This unfortunate characteristic which played a huge role in leading up to the lovers' tragic fate is wonderfully mastered by DeCaprio and retained throughout the film. But we also like with Juliet get a glimpse of his character's development. At the beginning of the play Romeo is a hopeless romantic who fantasizes of love and seems to dwell more in his daydreamed world than actually on earth. At this point he has no idea what true love really is he only thinks he does. It is not until he meets Juliet that he can begin to comprehend the true depth and passion of love. DeCaprio triumphs in this area as well.The other actors are superb and wonderfully portray their characters as Shakespeare intended. But what really impressed me was as I stated earlier the keeping of Shakespeare's original dialogue in Luhrman's modern setting. I know some people criticize this film for destroying the romance and beauty of Shakespeare's words by setting the story in modern day Verona but I feel that it only made the film more romantic. What Luhrman did was both bold and brilliant and he succeeded wonderfully.I won't speak any more of the brilliance of this film I just highly recommend you see it as soon as possible. If you're a fan of Shakespeare like me I think you will enjoy this hip yet still lovely modernization of his most famous play ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their lives will pay the forfeit of the peace. We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo but that's because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes someone I haven't seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you'll notice that some say sword some say rapier and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who's who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo's best friend and I wish I could spell his name but I'd rather not butcher it dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics for those who aren't getting it it's Romeo is the knight in shinning armor Juliet is the angel of Romeo's dreams and Romeo's best friend is the comic relief. There's other things you'll notice at the party also like Tybalt wears devil hornsi.e. he's a villain. Both families you'll also notice are rich which also follows the script accurately. Overall if you're a Shakespeare fan a fan of romantic movies a fan of tragic movies or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It'll sweep you off you're feet make you laugh make you cry and make you fall in love.".

	schema:headline " An eyecatching starkly bold and breathtaking update of Shakespeare's greatest work.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is incredible. Yes the play is modernized and for those who panned the film I suppose originality was too much to take. Luhrmann stays with the original dialogue which I believe adds much to the film and gives it authenticity. Therefore it cannot be dismissed as a masterpiece dumbed down to appeal to us easy to please teenagers. The camera work at the most dark parts of the film is quick and choppy adding to the already potent and ever present depressing tragic atmosphere. All of the leads were strong with Danes and DiCaprio having amazing chemistry. In this film DiCaprio wasn't popular yet so again critics can't say Leo was the draw for this film. Danes was emotionally pure and driven and this is her best work to date aside from the critical darling My SoCalled Life. No the leads were cast with good reason  there couldn't have been any better. Supporting roles were wonderful with the roles of Mercutio and Tybalt being exceptional and the friar who may be the most important character in the story is brought to life by Postalwaithe  The dreamy underwater shots are fantastic. Luhrmann's version of this classic tragedy plays to both a younger and older audience adding touches such as the names of the guns being the names of swords and he yet updates the setting bringing the fantastic Verona Italy to Verona Beach Florida. A timeless story such as this makes any criticism of this film unnecessary and foolish view it with an open mind and you will see the story as Shakespeare wrote it and as Luhrmann envisioned it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is incredible. Yes the play is modernized and for those who panned the film I suppose originality was too much to take. Luhrmann stays with the original dialogue which I believe adds much to the film and gives it authenticity. Therefore it cannot be dismissed as a masterpiece dumbed down to appeal to us easy to please teenagers. The camera work at the most dark parts of the film is quick and choppy adding to the already potent and ever present depressing tragic atmosphere. All of the leads were strong with Danes and DiCaprio having amazing chemistry. In this film DiCaprio wasn't popular yet so again critics can't say Leo was the draw for this film. Danes was emotionally pure and driven and this is her best work to date aside from the critical darling My SoCalled Life. No the leads were cast with good reason  there couldn't have been any better. Supporting roles were wonderful with the roles of Mercutio and Tybalt being exceptional and the friar who may be the most important character in the story is brought to life by Postalwaithe  The dreamy underwater shots are fantastic. Luhrmann's version of this classic tragedy plays to both a younger and older audience adding touches such as the names of the guns being the names of swords and he yet updates the setting bringing the fantastic Verona Italy to Verona Beach Florida. A timeless story such as this makes any criticism of this film unnecessary and foolish view it with an open mind and you will see the story as Shakespeare wrote it and as Luhrmann envisioned it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone is familiar with William Shakespeare's boymeetsgirl love story and it has already been interpreted into films plays TV adaptations and songs. But Baz Luhrmann gives this worldknown love story a modernday twist setting it in Verona Beach and piling on the religious imagery. The result is quite spectacular.Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes play the starcrossed lovers and whilst the latter is sadly a little bland never truly convincing us in her portrayal of Juliet's loss of innocence or torment of feelings towards the foe DiCaprio completely redeems her performance. He is a revelation. His Romeo is a wonderful mix of sad eloquence a loving heart and a troubled soul and all these elements come together beautifully in a performance hotter than a pepper sprout with more layers than the proverbial onion. He is the very embodiment of sexy in his role. There is an extremely alluring way in which his character is filmed which only enhances Romeo as a lover. This is epitomized in the opening shot of him where the Leo is illuminated illustriously against the sunlight and Radiohead's languid sexy tune Talk Show Host plays.The film itself has sexy written all over it and with the Gen X teenagers as his target audience I don't think Luhrmann would have things any other way. But unlike with that atrocity Moulin Rouge! with Romeo  Juliet the overstylization is appropriate making the movie more accessible to teens for example through gun warfare rather than swordplay and the canny symbolisation of Queen Mab as a drug. But perhaps the most ingenious stylistic technique here is the slapinface Shakespearean references which range from a ball called the Merchant of Venice to 'Such stuff as dreams are made on' from The Tempest making the film an absolute goldmine for trivia fans.Style aside there is more than enough substance. Romeo is presented exactly as the play does  at first the mawkish gawky lovesick teenager then the fickle boy and finally the devoted and caring lover and much of this loyalty to the play is due to the screenplay from Luhrmann and Craig Pearce which maintains the original memorable dialogue and descriptions but also dares to stray from the sidewalk in some of the plot turns and the film completely benefits from it. The set designs are intricate and beautiful and suit every frame of the film perfectly and the icing on the cake is the music. Craig Armstrong's score for the swimming pool scene is as stunning as it is original and the use of nonoriginal music from Kym Mazelle to The Cardigans give the film the added edge of cool making Romeo  Juliet one of the boldest sassiest and most unforgettable adaptations to date and English Lit. GCSE has been made far more digestible for us kids across England. It's what Shakespeare would have wanted. A.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a bit late to be reviewing this movie but I find it an exceptional reboot. Everything about it is on permanent overdrive as exemplified by the oversaturated setting and terse cinematography. Some people have reviewed this and expressed distaste at Harold Perinneau's portrayal of Mercutio in favour of the 1968 John McEnery. While de gustibus non est disputandum certainly applies here I think it's worth pointing out that McEnery's performance brought a certain boorishness and abrasion to the character that Perrineau did not. Romeo played by DiCaprio was excellently cast and acted striking a healthy balance between stunningly handsome and endearingly clumsy and exuberant. And I don't care what all you phonies say Claire Danes was gorgeous.Others have derided the film for certain choices made in the staging combat andor nonverbal action remarking Where did Shakespeare write that? Well. First we are already working in a modern setting so the assumption that historical accuracy in staging and direction should be followed to a T is frankly absurd. Second the plays are public domain which is a mixed blessing as it brought us the 2013 RJ Sparknotes movie adaptation. But with that freedom comes a brilliant opportunity of artistic expression from the director and each choice of omission or interaction in this production was apparently made with great care to maintain the integrity of the story being told.To touch on comparisons between the 68 and 96 movies don't try to tell me Leonard Whiting acted like he had any idea what he was saying. Have you people seen the movie? This film is definitely worth your time. I find it to be a wellwrought revamping of one of my favourite plays from the Shakespeare Corpus.".

	schema:headline " A contemporary twist to a classic play";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Baz Luhrmann knew what he was doing when he cast Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio in the title roles of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  The two young actors have the power to captivate their audience and together they are unsurpassable.From the famous opening line of Two Households both alike in dignity.. to the tragic end the viewer is whisked away into the depths of the surrealistic world of Verona Beach.  Don't expect to see British people prancing around in tights when you rent this one.  Luhrmann creates a world where gun toting teens sport Hawaiian shirts and beach front brawls are an everyday event.Giving the classic play this modern twist makes for a new understanding of the text and brings the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets to a whole new level.  Shakespeare may be rolling around in his grave after seeing this film but english classes all over the world can breathe a little easier when it comes time to take the RJ final exam because this new adaptation makes the theme remarkably understandable.Danes brings life and incentive to the character of Juliet.  Danes' Juliet reaches far beyond the subservient stereotype of most Elizabethan characters and has ambition and assertion. It is a step beyond her critically acclaimed work in My SoCalled Life and has thankfully made her a more prominent figure in the entertainment industry.This marked the last feature for Leonardo DiCaprio preTitanic mayhem. It put his talent out for a wider range of audience RJ being his first major studio production.  The king of the indie and the troubled child role was now being recognized.  His passionate portrayl of Romeo Montague will forever be remembered.  He spoke the immortal words of Shakespeare as if they were his own and touched the hearts of millions.  Too bad the boat movie shoved him further into the spotlight than he had ever wanted.  But we won't get into that.The supporting cast in this film was also outstanding.  John Leguizamo played the wily Tybalt.  Harold Perrineau brought humor and diversity to the renowned role of Mercutio.  Big names also lit up the credits of RJ with Paul Sorvino and Brian Dennehey as Capulet and Montague as well as Pete Postlethwaite as the starcross'd lovers confidante Friar Laurence.This is my favorite movie of all time and I believe it was sadly underrated.".

	schema:headline " Poetry to Visual Affect";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not Shakespeare's best play but it has his best poetry that's because the play is ABOUT language about the difference between what something is and the language used to describe it. So among the plays this may be one of the hardest to film. But alas it suffers from another blessing which is also a curse the story itself is so powerful that one can build any sort of film or play or whatever around it and have it be likely to work. Thus we often lose the language.Zefrelli made his own choices in the earlier film these were relatively conventional. While it cut some valuable language sacrificed to the gods of contemporary patience it is by far the better version. But here we have some interesting choices.First the setting. Italians to Shakespeare's England were a comical people and his setting of the play there would have encouraged the audience to bring heavy stereotypes to the drama. Latins in his day were considered Foppish Quick to violence a stereotype that has been inherited by blacks today but to Londoners Italians were nearly Africans Incredibly proud especially as regards slights to masculinity Obsessed with weapons.Today we roll those up under the relatively crude notion of stupid Latin macho. In this film the director has exaggerated the Latin macho ethic to have the same effect 16th century Londoners would get. It works because these stereotypes are powerful memes which attract many hosts which perpetuate their underlying truth. Baz adds the additional dimension of the people being captured by the superstitious underbelly of the Church.He deliberately straddles the border between apparent truth and satire. These Latins are superficial visually and not verbally. So here is the solution to the problem on how to make a film which is primarily a visual medium out of a play that leverages poetic language. The solution is to convert all the metaphors from language to vision. Hence the muchnoted lack of poetry. I imagine Baz directing the players to not worry so much about the poetry.Both Romeo and Juliet are incapable of performing the poetry anyway they are children learning on the job. And what acting skill they have from film is all in the face not the tongue. They are pretty enough though.I like this film for its boldness. Some of the experiment works since we get the message of the difference between what we see and what is true. This is why Juliet has to see a LIVE Romeo at the end. Living under water is used to good effect. But in the real play there are so many and such subtle explorations of the theme and these are scoured away here for a few broad effects. The real message which comes through loud and clear if you know the play or even Zefrelli's film is not the distance between the reality of events and the language but the reality of the richness of the real play and this film. Equally vast. Equally powerful statement. So we have a playhouse with the back part blasted out to the sea.As a separate matter the play has three anchors Mercutio the Friar and the Nurse. These are handled interestingly here.The Friar is an alchemical master hiding under the cloak of the Church. The play equates the magic of language with the magic of potions equally deadly. The congruence is lost in this film but Baz definitely gets the magic part as well as the superfluous ritual of the church. This friar is a terrific memorable performance of someone who believes he can defeat nature. Serves as an anchor as intended.The Nurse is the true domestic raw nature full of uncompromised loyalty but ultimately compromised. Her character is lost here. We NEED to know about the dead sister and why the nurse turns on Juliet in order to save her life. Baz fails here and so provides no center. For Shakespeare she's the white space on the palette.Mercutio in the play is a emotionally engaged visionary mystic. We understand that Romeo and Mercutio studied magic philosophy' abroad together much as Hamlet and Horatio had. The dream they shared the night before is the axis of the whole action rather like the magic of the witches in Macbeth. Baz gets this as well Modern magic is what? Drugs. So Hamlet is given a psychotropic by Mercutio before going to the party. Works for me because it allows everything to be visually blasted and inexorably tragic. The whole thing after the party is a trip see? It is why they can meet become entranced and arrange marriage after an hour or two. Remember that until this point Romeo is hopelessly smitten by Roseline.Anyone who wrestles with problems of filming the Bard and comes out alive deserves my respect. This is a weird interpretation but that's the point.".

	schema:headline " A horrible remake of a classic story";
	schema:reviewBody "I find it a shame that there is only one peer submitted review of this awful version of a classic play that has withstood the test of time. As such I wish to give another view as well as an opposing view to the only one on here.Luhrmann may stay with the original dialog but he plays fast and loose with the script. Anyone who has actually sat down and read the play as Shakespeare wrote it would know this. Example Opening scene. In this version the Capulets are the targets of the Montague's insults. In the real version this is reversed. A minor yet significant example since in the original the reader has a small sympathy for the Montagues who are apparently just minding their own business when these idiots harass them. The names of the families on the guns to represent their swords is just ludicrous not to mention the duel between DiCaprio and Tybalt. And yes DiCaprio wasn't popular when this film was made but that doesn't mean he did a good job at acting his part. He didn't. Nor did Claire Danes. They sounded like my 9th grade peers reading the text from their English book in total monologue. No emotion no passion no reason to listen to them 'Nuff said.And while we are on the subject of DiCaprio's reaction to Mercutio's death why don't we talk about a little something known as Breaking the Tension something that Luhrmann does better than anyone. During the famous scene where Romeo's best friend dies we see perhaps the one and only time Leo shows true emotion to convey sorrow of losing his friend. Then we see the rage in his eyes as he swears revenge on his enemy. The pressure builds. We can feel the tension building up.Then out of the blue Danes is singing a song and laying on her bed leaving us to wonder what the heck just happened.Do you see what has happened? We were all set ready to see this dramatic scene unfold and climax knowing its inevitable conclusion we felt the blood rushing as we leaned forward on the edge of our seats then we are smacked in the head with a sappy lovely scene.Anyone who knows anything about filmography knows that this completely breaks the tension that was building up. That is bad. It is bad because now the audience feels like it has been removed from the action like waking up from a dream suddenly. After doing that it is impossible to get back into the movie. And sure enough we see Mr. Leo with a fixed look of anger and determination. We see him take out a scared Tybalt. But you know what? We don't care anymore because we're still miffed about a moment ago when Luhrmann decided to throw us for a loop. We can't engage the moment anymore because we're now between two opposite feelings One being the love Danes has for her Leo and the hatred and anger Leo has for Tybalt. If Luhrmann had done this right he would have had the entire scene with Romeo from the beginning to end like Franco Zeffirelli did and THEN put Danes bedroom scene in AFTER the duel between protagonist and villain. This way we would have felt the way Juliet does when she realizes something is wrong. We would have felt her world fall apart in front of her eyes when we were supposed to have done so After the fight with Tybalt winds down and Romeo's rage is calmed.And give me a break regarding the this movie is above criticism line. Even without all of its flaws which by the way I have only touched some of the flaws in slight detail ANY movie ANY book ANY play ANY song ANY piece of art that has is or ever will be made for commercial use is open to criticism. Why? Because the authorartistwriteretc. wants to be paid for their work. Now if I am going to pay for something I want the item in question to be quality. That goes for everything including movies. I have only seen this movie in passing on the television so I have not paid a penny for it. Nor will I.And yes it is dumbed down for teenagers. Watching this version is like watching the vast majority of MTV music videos. They look visually pleasing but that's to cover up the fact that the performers can't write good music. Same concept here.In short if you want a good Romeo and Juliet movie this isn't it.".

It remains more or less unchanged in the movie aside from needed adaptations to suit the new time period but it simply does not work. The play itself is rather contrived. To expect an audience to see people in modern day falling into the same pitfalls as their Elizabethan counterparts did is insulting to their intelligence. The director and writer does not go to any lengths to attempt to make it seem possible either.Characterizaton is also changed but whether it was really the writing at fault remains to be seen. The lines are almost always taken directly from the play but atrocious acting could easily have twisted it. It certainly exists in large amounts. By far and large the cast is horrible with extremely overrated and miscast Dicaprio and Danes at the helm. Both resort to overblown and soap operatic acting to convey the emotional turmoil of their characters and neither do it well enough to merit anything but a laugh.The film is nothing if not imaginative however. The cinematography is gorgeous and many shots whimsical lavish and inspired choices on the director's part. However this distracts from the dark morbid tone of the story and rather than complement it it only makes the film lose impact during the important scenes. The director also uses gratuitous shots of Christ and crosses and wide shots to emphasize drama but only manages to come across as full of himself in a Neon Genesis Evangelionesquire move.The Breakdown Cheesy overdramatic with terrible acting to boot.

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe there are people who actually like this version of Shakespeare's play. Or those who prefer it to the 1968 version. The producers who wished to make a modernday Romeo  Juliet just failed woefully. Only Leonardo DiCaprio seemed to stand out with his portrayal of Romeo and that's because he's such good actor isn't it a surprise that his 1968 predecessor is also named Leonard Whiting? But let's face it Claire Danes was so damned unconvincing as Juliet and very plain too. She is nowhere near the beautiful talented Olivia Hussey who wowed the audience with her performance as Juliet in 1968. No matter how you look at it the part of Juliet doesn't fit her at all!Also in the 1968 adaptation Michael York made me admire the Tybalt character as he portrayed him with a cool and calm grace that nearly made Tybalt a likable character even though we know he isn't. Unfortunately John Leguizamo's Tybalt was so downright irritating and annoying that he made him a whole lot more unpleasant than Shakespeare himself did. There are several issues I find appalling in this flick. In the first place who says that Tybalt beats up Romeo when Romeo initially declines to fight him? Because Shakespeare definitely didn't. Secondly when the bloke who plays Benvolio says Part fools! Put up your swords you know not what you do I'm like Swords? What swords? They are using GUNS not swords. Why doesn't he say Hey! Put your guns down!? That would have been more realistic.Thirdly Harold Perrineau's Mercutio unlike that of John McEnery is simply brash. He doesn't have the wit. And the idea of dressing him up like a drag queen is simply disgusting.And finally 4 crying out loud who said Juliet woke up just before Romeo's death. Didn't the director read the story? I believe if Shakespeare got up from his grave and seen what they had done with his play he'd call down GOD's curse on the script writers. In short I was so disgusted with the movie that I wished I hadn't seen it at all. My brother who was watching it with me said he preferred it to the other one because it was modern. He is one of those who believe that the movies made from the 80s backwards i. e. movies of the 80s 70s 60s etc are rubbish but that's his opinion not mine.Call me oldfashioned or whatever u like but here's my verdict If u are looking for a Romeo  Juliet movie LOOK FOR THE 1968 ADAPTATION! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE IT'S BLOODY TERRIBLE!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "After only watching a few minutes of this adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet I couldn't take much more of it. It was something that I could laugh at rather than take seriously. I tried after a few minutes more but it's hard to take Leonardo DiCaprio who I believe is a very talented actor and Clare Dane who is just as talented playing in modern times. We know nobody talks like that. If they had adapted Romeo and Juliet to more modern language I think I would have bared the film in general. But the language and the modern day scenery do not mix well for me. I'm old fashioned I guess in general. I know the director wanted something different for Romeo and Juliet. Few films can beat the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and this film would not be very welcome if I was teaching Romeo and Juliet. It's too far fetched and ridiculous. I know it's modernized for the audience. But I like my Shakespeare to be precise and old fashioned. I love Miriam Margolyes as the nurse and Christina Pickles as one of the mothers but it just doesn't feel right. Mercutio's supposed to be a drag queen which I felt was really something that made my stomach turn in general was out of this world. It's not for me and I accept that. If there are others happy with it so be it but not for me.".

To see a man with pink hair in a halfopen Hawaiian shirt saying thee and thou and other such nonsense is generally not pleasing to the modern audience. In addition if you didn't know the story you'd be extremely confused. There are some well not plot holes but very confusing sections. In general the movie shows almost no traces of the fact that the Capulets and the Montagues hate each other. Furthermore several completely unnecessary and rather disgusting additions have been made including a crossdressing Mercutio. The prince of cats title attributed to Tybalt is atrociously overdone  he hisses at people. So if you want to see a great version of this classic story see the 1968 version with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey  a much more satisfying movie.".

Now I first heard about Romeo  Juliet back in fourth grade when I was 10 years old.I didn't know what it was about at the time so I asked my cousin who was in ninth grade but graduated in 1999 what it was about.  She told me it was about two teenagers from two feuding families who meet and fall in love. They soon enough get married but all that ends tragically when they commit suicide.  As a result of their deaths the two feuding families agree to peace.Now I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater so I patiently waited until it debuted on Cinemax a few months after it was released.  Let me just say it was amazing!  I had never seen a more beautiful film.Baz Luhrmann's updated version of the play is absolutely stunning.  What really surprised me about it was that it was set in present day Verona Beach California.  They drove around in cars instead of riding on horses and instead of fighting with swords they fight with guns.  All of this was good.  One thing surprised me though it contained it's original dialogue. Now many films that are updates of the play don't contain the original dialogue.  1010".

The TV Anchorwoman replaces the narrator gun play replaces sword play Verona beach replaces the city of Verona gang violence replaces family rivalries and other elements like the taking of hallucinogenic drugs and the drag act appear convincingly with the original dialogue as if they were always meant to be there.Keeping the original script was essential since it is written poetically people in Shakspeare's time didn't really talk like that and no one in there right mind would change the words of a poem since that would defy the whole point of it.

	schema:reviewBody "ATTACK FORCE Z is the only Aussie war movie I've seen yet besides RETURN FROM THE RIVER KWAI. It's fastpaced fun cheesy and plenty entertaining.Jon Phillip Law DEATH RIDES A HORSE stars as an Allied commando who leads 4 international commandos to rescue a Japanese defector from a Japaneseinfested island in the Pacific. The movie features a lot of familiar plot elements and strongly resembles the earlier American features AMBUSH BAY and BEACHHEAD. Only here the movie is based on fact a similar mission involving the Z Special Forces team was actually undertaken in the Pacific. The cast features a lot of young actors who were unknown at the time including Mel Gibson WE WERE SOLDIERS as the team leader and Sam Neill as the radio operator.The movie is obviously pretty low budget as the action scenes involve few extras and are mostly skirmishes between the 5 commandos and Japanese patrols. There's some great martial arts action as a Chinese commando judochops dozens of Japanese soldiers to their deaths. The final battle scene in which a handful of Chinese resistance fighters hold off at least a few dozen Japanese soldiers with shotguns is corny as the Japanese always charge right into oncoming fire and never attempt a flanking movement. One resistance fighter stands in the alley blasting away with a shotgun only dying once he's taken 6 direct hits and grenade fragments. The Japanese soldiers look and act like idiots and use American machineguns and the Aussies have M3 machinepistols with silencers that never run out of ammo and never miss  but what the heck it's pretty entertaining and logicfree entertainment. The musical score is great patriotic stuff by Eric Jupp and the cinematography is pretty stunning. The Taiwanese crew does a great job with the little budget they had. The version shown on TNT and TBS once in a very great while is of good quality. Unfortunately there were some scenes in Japanese and others in Chinese which lacked subtitles. The closed captions weren't much help either as they read Speaking in Oriental Language. I haven't seen the NTSC video yet because it's far too expensive for my taste.All in all this really isn't the best war film out there. The action scenes bring the worst excesses to WINDTALKERS to mind as they're excellently photographed by defy all logic known to man. Still the pace is fast the characters good and the scenery is stunning. I give this a 610.".

The cast features a lot of young actors who were unknown at the time including Mel Gibson WE WERE SOLDIERS as the team leader and Sam Neill as the radio operator.The movie is obviously pretty low budget as the action scenes involve few extras and are mostly skirmishes between the 5 commandos and Japanese patrols. There's some great martial arts action as a Chinese commando judochops dozens of Japanese soldiers to their deaths. The final battle scene in which a handful of Chinese resistance fighters hold off at least a few dozen Japanese soldiers with shotguns is corny as the Japanese always charge right into oncoming fire and never attempt a flanking movement. One resistance fighter stands in the alley blasting away with a shotgun only dying once he's taken 6 direct hits and grenade fragments. The Japanese soldiers look and act like idiots and use American machineguns and the Aussies have M3 machinepistols with silencers that never run out of ammo and never miss  but what the heck it's pretty entertaining and logicfree entertainment. The musical score is great patriotic stuff by Eric Jupp and the cinematography is pretty stunning. The Taiwanese crew does a great job with the little budget they had. The version shown on TNT and TBS once in a very great while is of good quality. Unfortunately there were some scenes in Japanese and others in Chinese which lacked subtitles. The closed captions weren't much help either as they read Speaking in Oriental Language. I haven't seen the NTSC video yet because it's far too expensive for my taste.All in all this really isn't the best war film out there. The action scenes bring the worst excesses to WINDTALKERS to mind as they're excellently photographed by defy all logic known to man. Still the pace is fast the characters good and the scenery is stunning. I give this a 610.";

The team is plagued by recurring bad luck which quickly alerts the Japanese to their presence and by friction between the inexperienced team leader Captain Paul Kelly Gibson and his more experienced but erratic subordinate a Dutch lieutenant named Jan Veitch Law the team's most fluent Chinese speaker. When the team manages to enlist the aid of the local resistance further friction develops between Kelly and the local cell leader Lin ChanLang Ko who resents Kelly's holding back information about the plane's occupants. About halfway in however we do discover why Kelly is under strict orders to keep clam.For a relatively lowbudget war movie Attack Force Z is pretty good. The costumes and weapons are about as historically accurate as feasible and the filming locationTaiwanis convincing enough as an island at the other end of the South China Sea. Particularly enjoyable is the fact that Asian characters speak their respective languages on screen rather than accented English. This however does lead me to the film's main problem at least to me which is that it's a mess ethnographically and consequently linguistically. Because it was shot in Taiwan with a mostly Taiwanese or otherwise ethnically Chinese cast the island's population appears to be entirely ethnically Chinese without a single speaker of Malay as it was then called in evidence the occasional pitji capwearing extra notwithstanding. This also results in the somewhat unlikely situation of Veitch being fluent in Chinese rather than Malay.Veitch is the most problematic character in the film. The original director Phillip Noyce left the project at least partly because he disagreed with the producers over the choice of John Phillip Law to play Veitch and bluntly he was right Law simply doesn't pull off anything resembling a credible Dutchman. It's not entirely his fault though because the writer and producers don't seem to have ever so much as met a Dutch person as is apparent from the fact that Veitch isn't even a Dutch name insofar as I can make out it's Scottish. Admittedly I am myself Dutch and my paternal grandmother's family lived in the East Indies so this is a niggle that maybe affects me more than the typical viewer but it's emblematic of what's wrong with an otherwise perfectly enjoyable film. Enough so that I can almost overlook how all the team members manage to stay clean shaven despite not having time to shave.".

One of the supporting cast members who was and arguably still is a very wellknown Australian actor of the 70's and 80's plays a character who barely has 5 minutes of screen time before suffering a probable unforeseen fate.A bonus of course is we get to see both Mel Gibson complete with Aussie accent and Sam Neill playing together in preHollywood fame roles. Gibson is the mission leader and Neill is effectively his trusty sidekick. I have to also say John Phillip Law plays the token AmericanDutch mandarinspeaking LOL character very competently.The story itself too is quite interesting with its variation on the war against the Japanese in the Pacific by this time strongly highlighting the involvement of the ethnic Chinese.I was pleasantly surprised with this film as I'm sure others will be too.".

I often wonder how people like Sam Neil and Mel Gibson started acting differently in American films. There are some Taiwanese actors in the film in fact they outnumber the Aussie ones there is some karate scenes which made me laugh as they looked a bit out of place and like they were thrown in because karate films were still big in 1981 and the Taiwanese actor seems to know how to do it. The action scenes are pretty small it makes sense that these guys wouldn't fight pitch battles against huge armies they are not Rambo's but even so they are no where near as stealthy as you would think they should be.

There are some good individual performances but the film though produced with efficiency and what looks like a decent budget is tough to say great things about this movie. It probably wasn't helped by my DVD having a poor transfer. I'd go so far as to say if Mel Gibson and Sam Neil weren't in this movie it probably would have even had a DVD released.";

I guess I have seen the dramatic selfsacrifice of a noble comrade and stealth gone awry because a twig snapped way too many times. The characters themselves aren't incredibly developed and any attempt to flesh them out feels jerky and unnatural. At one point it just gets absurd as one character stays behind to protect the love interest he had shared a room with only a few cuts ago. Granted she prevented him from being discovered but besides a common enemy they had little to really bond over.Another major problem I had was the elongated scenes involving other languages like Japanese and Cantonese. Perhaps it was just the version I saw but with no subtitles provided I was forced to guess what they were saying and only later confirm what was going on.

Acting is mixed none of it got me that engaged in this. Was Gibson not a name yet? Mad Max was out as was its first sequel. Did he not get recognition before Lethal Weapon? I am not sufficiently familiar with his career and I frankly don't care to be. Neill come on he's got talent had that not been realized at this point? Did he need a paycheck? That badly? Seriously? While I suppose I may have just watched a halfheartedly put together copy of this I gotta say... there were a lot of speeches in I guess Mandarin that seemed to be important and like they should affect the audience in spite of the fact that they were not subbed. What gives? I did follow the story however if the words were meant to evoke emotion they failed. Still this is not useless or it doesn't have to be. If so inclined you can make drinking games for it. How about every time a gun fires without making a sound? Each time the piece of music playing in this is one that belongs in a film at least one or two decades prior to the release of this. And of course whenever you spot a tired action flick clich. Make sure to stock up. I recommend this to the biggest fans of war movies. 510".

It benefits from Hoffman's perfect performance. He embodies the physical and psychological make up of a man who was the toast of the nation before and after the publication of its classic novel In Cold Blood. As a human being he appeared to be an intelligent fascinating and manipulative creature. He could have gotten away with almost anything. Then he found the two criminals behind one of the most heinous crimes of the century and might have gotten to the realization he could also be trapped by their own dark existences.It is difficult to ascertain what happened to Capote after he developed a relationship with Smith. He grows attracted to the actions and revelations behind this killer and we never really know what is exactly going on. There are displays of guilt and detachment at different parts in the film. What we do see is that something really affected the man and it changed his life for good.The film moves slowly but never loses its audience. Along with Hoffman a remarkable supporting cast keeps us interests going and enough is presented to make us want to know more. That will probably be the film's only flaw. It fails to deliver everything it promises. It is a big satisfying tease but after all we are left with an endless number of questions. Keener is wonderful as Capote's supporting friend and in his lover's role Bruce Greenwood intrigues us as well with the dubious character that never gives enough information to explain his attraction to a total opposite.Capote is a really good film and should be admire for it achieves. For those who want to explore more in depth what lies behind the protagonists of the movie there are several books that will give you a more detailed background on their nature. The truth will however remain a big mystery.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the nonfiction novel and the Richard Brooks film that was made from it In Cold Blood Capote focuses on and sympathizes with two killers at the expense of the four murdered members of the Clutter family. Once the viewer gets beyond this sticking point however all three works are outstanding unforgettable experiences. Unlike the book and the original movie Capote does explore the contradictory feelings that author Truman Capote wrestles with as he researches and writes In Cold Blood. His feelings for Perry Smith the more sensitive of the two killers are particularly problematic as Capote becomes emotionally close to Smith and helps the men with legal aide that postpones the executions while at the same time Capote cannot finish his book until Smith and Hickcock are hanged. Praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny performance as Truman Capote cannot be overstated and come awards time if he does not collect enough accolades to fill his mantel indictments for film critics and Academy voters would be in order. Hoffman not only captures the mannerisms and voice of Capote he inhabits the man's soul and expresses his feelings and emotions without histrionics or the type of caricature that mimics often have made of the notoriously fey writer in the past.Fortunately Hoffman's performance is only the jewel in a gilded crown of fine writing excellent direction and solid supporting performances. Capote will send viewers back to their bookshelves to reread the book and to their video libraries to review the 1967 film. Considering the time that Capote spent with the two convicted murderers questions arise as to why the Richard Brooks film did not have Truman Capote as a character but rather presented a bland nameless investigative writer who wanders through the proceedings without much purpose. The film is so good and so intriguing that questions such as that and what happened to the writer that Capote lived with? and did Harper Lee write anything beyond To Kill a Mockingbird? and did Capote's presence at the execution lead to his alcoholism his lack of further writing and eventually his death and other questions will send viewers to Google as soon as they get home. Capote is an outstanding film and possibly the first of the year to be assured of a place on the 10 Best lists for 2005.".

This film concentrates in the period of his life in which he got obsessed by a notorious murder case of the fifties about the murder of a family in Kansas.Dan Futterman has written the screen play based on the book by Gerald Clarke. The film is an account about the writing of the novel In Cold Blood that showed how the two young men who committed the heinous crime are caught processed and hanged for their actions.If you haven't watched the film perhaps you would like to stop here.When the film opens we get a vision of a lonely house in the distance. This being the Midwest we are given a flat expanse devoid of elevations anywhere. The camera takes us to that lonely house as a young woman comes calling for her friend that lives in there. Not getting any response she goes in to a room upstairs where she discovers her friend has been killed. The colors are dark as is the tone of the film.Truman Capote who had been connected to the New Yorker magazine sees the article in the N.Y. Times and gets interested. This case that shocked the country at the time shows a promise for the writer. The next time we meet him he is in the small town in Kansas accompanied by his good friend and steadying influence Nell Harper Lee a writer.By becoming friendly with the sheriff's wife Mr. Capote gets a privilege by having access to the two murderers. Truman is clearly deeply affected by his relationship with Perry Smith a handsome dark man who shows a lot of intensity. By gaining their trust Capote is able to put together his best selling book In Cold Blood which will revolutionize American letters in the way the two criminals are portrayed.Truman Capote while pursuing the completion of his book doesn't come clean to Perry Smith. In fact when questioned about things he has learned Capote gives evasive answers because he is not prepared to share with his main subject things that clearly should have been clarified from the start.Watching the brilliant take of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote on the screen brought to mind another great actor Meryl Streep who like Mr. Hoffman is a chameleon in the interpretation of a character. Mr. Hoffman is perfect as the writer because he has captured every mannerism and the speech inflection of Truman Capote. Catherine Keener is perfect as Nelle the true friend and companion.

Unfortunately he word his celebrity on his sleeve and was often overly harsh and full of himself. This is a great movie. The subtle methods he uses to draw out the story from the murderer shows that he would do anything to get a story even lie to a person with whom he had begun to fall in love. He pictures himself as compassionate at times but he is often unwilling to go that final mile. It's surprising he was in attendance at the hangings the events that probably contributed to his death. What a complex man. His canon of American literature is small but he was a master stylist and commentator. See this movie for Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman is just that actor for 2005. His portrayal of Truman Capote was best described by Telluride Film Festival's Galaxy Theater host as a resurrection. Like Jamie Foxx's Ray Charlize Theron's Monster and Nicole Kidman's Virginia Wolfe Hoffman's Capote is simply devastating. He stated at Telluride that after first accepting the role and watching a recording of Truman Capote he frankly thought he was in over his head. But throughout preproduction he gathered and compiled all of Capote's mannerisms and began practicing them slowly and truly becoming Truman Capote. And from the first line of Hoffman's dialogue with his squinched high voice and selfabsorbed tone we know he's succeeded. The actual film is nearly eclipsed by Hoffman's performance. But Director Bennett Miller and an impressive supporting cast manage to keep up with Hoffman's breakneck achievement. Shot in monochromatic nearly black and white starkness the film inherits a raw power that builds to its stunning climactic sequence. And although the film drags some in the middle it finishes strong and leaves us with much to discuss. It's provocative stark and powerful. Capote opens with the discovery of a family of four murdered in the small town of Hokum Kansas in 1953 don't quote me on the date please. Coming off his second novel Truman Capote Phillip Seymour Hoffman is searching for his next project. Intrigued by the murders he takes the investigation agreeing on authoring an article for The New Yorker. Meeting with the town's Sheriff Alvin Dewey Chris Cooper he's met with opposition in the town for his peculiar manner. But his companion on the investigation Harper Lee Catherine Keener offsets his homosexuality with terse homegrown professionalism.Months later the two killers Perry Smith Clifton Collins Jr. and Richard Hickcock Mark Pellegrino are apprehended by Sheriff Dewey and soon sentenced to death. Finding himself increasingly drawn to the story by the sentence Truman begins personally interviewing the murderers particularly Perry Smith at their maximum security prison. Avoiding discussion of the murders themselves Capote learns more about their lives outside of crime finding a humanity never put into print before and causing him to extend his article for The New Yorker into the fulllength novel In Cold Blood. It would be the first True Crime novel ever written. His extensive interviews with Smith lead to a strange relationship open to many terms of controversial interpretation. He feels compelled to assist the men and lead the world's opinion away from demonizing headlines. Capote even goes to lengths to find them a decent lawyer for their Supreme Court appeal. The screenplay deals with this controversy between Capote and Smith with beautiful ambiguity. Screenwriter Dan Futterman leaves it to Capote's character to interpret their relationship for the audience instead of the story doing so in a hamhanded way. And with Hoffman's performance so obsessively complete the result is magnificent. We oddly understand Capote's pain and his unique love for Perry Smith. He obviously sees the monster inside but realizes the human entirely. Some even speculated around the festival that Capote fell in love with Smith. It's incredibly profound. But at the same time Futterman's screenplay relies too much on Capote's obsession with Smith. Audience's in the 50's were terrified by Capote's humanistic realization of the murderer but now that sort of True Crime journalism is accepted and even expected from murder investigations. This reliance causes the film to linger too long on Capote's buildup interviews before the shocking twisting confession he needs to finish the novel. Also audiences have recently grown tired of the biopic probably because of the last year's heaping pile of them. This mutes the typical drama that occurs in all dramatic biopics with the character's slow deterioration. Despite these flaws Capote is still an arresting portrait of a murder. And to go along with this portrait is the complete resurrection of Truman Capote in Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The film works to succeed beyond a simple biopic. It also hits on the difficult topic of true crime delving into the imagination and conscience of a man that killed in cold blood.".

	schema:headline " very likely the best film I will see this year harrowing intense a view so cruel";
	schema:reviewBody "What PSH has pulled off here simply cannot be overpraised. First he accomplishes a perfect imitation the voice the gestures the walk. Then within this caricature he delivers a startlingly complex and subtle performance. First he's the preening bon vivant indulged by friends and lovers intimately tied to the world of the rich and famous. Then during some of his selfabsorbed monologues he becomes something else genuinely penetrating on the subject of the human condition. Then you see how cynically he uses that ability to get what he wants. So much sincere emotion demonstrated in the service of lies. His cruelty is such that one feels indignation for the murderous sociopath who becomes his muse. But at the same time his ambition to do something great is totally understandable and the cost to his psyche so visibly demonstrated that he remains a sympathetic character.Catherine Keener plays Nelle as the perfect foil warm and caring but so perceptive and cruelly honest.

	onyx:emotionText "What PSH has pulled off here simply cannot be overpraised. First he accomplishes a perfect imitation the voice the gestures the walk. Then within this caricature he delivers a startlingly complex and subtle performance. First he's the preening bon vivant indulged by friends and lovers intimately tied to the world of the rich and famous. Then during some of his selfabsorbed monologues he becomes something else genuinely penetrating on the subject of the human condition. Then you see how cynically he uses that ability to get what he wants. So much sincere emotion demonstrated in the service of lies. His cruelty is such that one feels indignation for the murderous sociopath who becomes his muse. But at the same time his ambition to do something great is totally understandable and the cost to his psyche so visibly demonstrated that he remains a sympathetic character.Catherine Keener plays Nelle as the perfect foil warm and caring but so perceptive and cruelly honest. Clifton Collins Jr.'s Perry is mesmerizing a vulnerable and sensitive and desperately yearning young man who knows he's no good. His confession is breathtaking cold devastating.

	schema:reviewBody "Philip Seymour Hoffman who we first noticed in Scent of a Woman some 13 years ago when he turned a fairly clichd character into a memorable character study finds his apotheosis  some would say his inevitable apotheosis  as Truman Capote in Bennett Miller's Capote. The writer died in 1984 and furthermore had spent the last 15 or so years of his life in relative seclusion if you disregard his addled presence at Studio 54 and the occasional Tonight Show appearance. Therefore to someone like myself reared in the Seventies and Eighties and carrying no burning memories of the fellow the exactitude of Hoffman's mimicry of Capote is neither here nor there. This is above and beyond any caviling about how precise Hoffman's impersonation is of Capote a fullbodied wellrounded character whose primary interest in serving the film is to make us consider the wages of art.Older members of the audience by which I mean those who remember the Sixties may be forgiven a degree of burnout after all there was Capote's book In Cold Blood the movie on which it was based and the writer's own selfreferential celebrity. Been there and done that? Not quite this time we view the story ABOUT the story from the writer's perspective. It is a credit to Gerald Clarke who wrote the book on which the film is based Dan Futterman who wrote the screenplay and director Miller that this wellworn material becomes urgent and interesting again. On a wider social level Capote makes a damning statement about our current fascination with true crime stories which had been reinforced by Norman Mailer's Executioner's Song in the Seventies and has finally become noxiously regnant with cable TV's endless hours of coverage of the Peterson case and others like it. I'm not suggesting that people were not interested in this tawdry material before Capote but the movie implicitly blames him for the shameless modernday intertwining of writers or TV reporters with the crimes and criminals that they're covering. The movie also has something to say about how selfcentered writers can be Capote can only say What's the fuss all about? in reference to friend and fellow novelist Harper Lee's success with To Kill a Mockingbird. After watching Smith and Hickock get hung for their crimes Capote whines I'll never get over it  to which Lee played by the great Catherine Keener replies with deadpan malice You're still ALIVE Truman. Amen! However Capote's selfpity also contains the mere truth. Capote is the tragedy of a man who scrapped his own decency in order to write one of the great American novels of the 20th century. We observe the incremental milestones along the path toward greatness and damnation Capote ingratiating himself with the Kansas locals befriending the more sensitive and intelligent of the two murderers Perry Smith helping to arrange appeals for the murderers so that they'll stay alive long enough for him to collect enough information to finish his novel smoothly lying to Smith about what he's actually writing about the case even down to the book's title and finally living with the consequences of his exploitative behavior. Art is achieved with devastating cost to the artist. Of course this theme isn't exactly new but Philip Seymour Hoffman makes it visceral with a performance containing a kaleidoscope of human behavior cocky and in his element with his highbrow drinking pals in New York smooth and charming as the funny fag stereotype modeled on characters in the Thirties' films of Ernst Lubitsch and others in Sheriff Dewey's home gentle and nurturing to and even spoonfeeding Perry Smith during the latter's attempt at suicidebystarvation in prison abruptly turning the tables on Smith when Smith continues to remain closemouthed about the night of the murders. This latter scene in which Capote lashes out at his subject in that carefully modulated castrato voice of his will go down in the annals of film history as perhaps the prime example of just how much contempt one human being can demonstrate to another. Granted Perry Smith was an abomination of a man who deserved execution . . . but Hoffman's icy contempt still stabs us. Inhumanity is not always physically violent.A difficult film. You will walk out of it feeling uncomfortable and contemplative. There's still some time remaining in the calendar as of this writing 102205 but I doubt I'll see a better American movie this year. 9 stars out of 10.".

The direction by the relatively unknown Bennett Miller is personal evocative and affecting but without being overdramatic or saccharine. This is helped immensely by Philip Seymour Hoffmann's incredible performance as Capote as well as solid acting from Catherine Keener Clifton Collins Jr. and Chris Cooper. Cooper plays K.B.I. Agent Alvin Dewey with perhaps a bit too much intensity given his relatively small amount of screen time but the portrayal nonetheless comes off as heartfelt.The cinematography by Adam Kimmel is suitably gray and moody with many evocative views of the flat Kansas plains but most of the screen time is spent with the camera focused on Hoffmann  all of it time well spent.While I haven't read the biography by Gerald Clarke on which it's based the script seems to hit enough salient details to evoke Capote's frame of mind without inundating the audience with more than would fit in a featurelength film. I suppose one of my only complaints about the film would be that at times the conversations take on a sheen of Hollywood saying things for dramatic impact that perhaps might not have been said in real life. But then again I never met Capote so who knows for sure.All in all this was a deeply engrossing film and one I would highly recommend especially if you're a fan of Truman Capote.".

	schema:reviewBody "Capote is a film with undeniable assets it's got the best performance by an American actor in the last decade and some of the wittiest dialog in an American film in recent years. Philip Seymour Hoffman's onceinalifetime performance is simply jawdropping and he's aware of it it's a triumph of vocal and body work with a huge range mentally and emotionally but above all it sparkles with supremely intelligent acting in portraying the lizard man with the 215point I.Q. and the 1000000point ego.The film focuses entirely on the circumstances concerning the genesis of Truman Capote's masterpiece In Cold Blood the title that had of course a double meaning as it described both the set of mind of the 1959 Kansas harrowing criminals and of Capote himself in his Machiavellian saga to finally complete his book. The film concentrates on Capote's transformation from lightweight literary wunderkind and jetset wit to trendsetting seriously talented writer depicting the FaustianMephistophelian process he goes through as he realizes that in order to produce his groundbreaking nonfiction novel  which helped consolidate American media's fascination with violence death and crime  he has to sink deeply in muddy waters of manipulation adulation mendacity bribery omission ultimately having to face the ugliest side of himself like a modern Dorian Gray. In Capote the horrifying Kansas crime the murderers and the circumstances that led to their execution are the background scenery allowing the filmmakers to question the author's autistic egotism gargantuan ambition and tortuous perverse morality just in case anyone forgets Capote's novel benefited who again?If Capote ultimately impacts less than it couldshould director Bennett Miller is probably to blame. Visually it's bland and unexciting it's a real shame to see such an unimaginative handling of such potentially thrilling material. Capote has some of the dullest courtroom scenes in movie history and the competition is high as we know. And what about those gigantic paralyzed closeups? And that static lifeless camera? The audience goes to see the film pretty much aware that Capote's and the screenwriter's wit and Hoffman's performance are the core of it and no one was asking for an action movie but did it have to look so bland? Maybe Miller just lacks mileage this is only his second film or maybe he's simply not visually oriented maybe he's an actors' director. Despite the fascinating subject a great performance and aboveaverage dialog Miller's Capote disappointingly looks like a TV movie.Apart from those not trifle objections Capote is recommended for all of us who thought wit subtlety and acting excellence had all but disappeared from American films. PS Richard Brooks' irregular but visually striking 1967 version of In Cold Blood is a complementary companion to this one.".

However I approached the movie with optimism I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman in movies like The Big Lebowski and was curious to see how a leading role would suit him. My feelings now having seen this movie is that he is and still remains a good supporting actor.I understand that many feel his portrayal of Truman Capote was spot on and true to every nuance of Truman himself but there is something about the movie which I feel doesn't do justice to the themes and the man who is being portrayed. The movie hinges on whether you can tolerate Truman Capote as a personality and it is my opinion that this is where the movie fails. Philip Sermour Hoffman portrays Capote as cold and career driven but has the emotional sensitivity to cry at his subjects execution. This alone is not enough to convince me that Capote is as complex and intelligent and perhaps scheming as the movie makes out.Here is the main conflict of interest in the movie at no point in the movie did the director sympathise with the murderers neither did we feel Capote truly sympathise with the two men on death row yet we are made to believe that Capote was battling with his conscience and by the end of the movie was eventually destroyed as a writer by his inability to come to terms with his actions towards these culprits. I have assumed this was the intended message of the movie but at no point is this battle of wills or guilt ever portrayed on the screen. What we have is a very physical transformation of an actor into a Capote character that acts in a way that we assume reminds us of the great writer. There is no exploration of the theme of capital punishment no reflection on the content of his novel 'In cold blood' no volley of ideas between subject and writer but only a by numbers recount of events and perhaps a feeling of irritation towards Capote as a cowardly egotistical lime light hugging snob of the New York elite.This is not award winning material this is an average account of an interesting figure during an integral time in his career. Perhaps reading In Cold Blood would add some clarity to the subject but for a movie which seemed to promise so much in premise it is disheartening that we have to go back to the source to make up our minds.".

	schema:headline " Stillborn selfimportant Oscar bait";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one dreary inert selfimportant bore. When the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging you know the venture is botched. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic ticridden selfindulgent cartoonvoiced insectlike caricature. Why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of 'In Cold Blood' and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed writer of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' Harper Lee Catherine Keener accompanies Capote in his initial inquires into the crime and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic. Unfortunately Lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of Capote bemoaning his pained existence. Watching him is like watching Dr. Smith from 'Lost in Space' complain about his delicate back to anybody who will listen for two hours. The difference however is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not. The film's precious selfimportance kills it as does director Bennett Miller's reluctance to add any kind of shading. Like the morose piano score the film is a one note wonder providing no contrast no emotional coloring and no intimate drama. If Capote really was this irritating why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it?

	onyx:emotionText "This is one dreary inert selfimportant bore. When the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging you know the venture is botched. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic ticridden selfindulgent cartoonvoiced insectlike caricature. Why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of 'In Cold Blood' and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed writer of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' Harper Lee Catherine Keener accompanies Capote in his initial inquires into the crime and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic. Unfortunately Lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of Capote bemoaning his pained existence. Watching him is like watching Dr. Smith from 'Lost in Space' complain about his delicate back to anybody who will listen for two hours. The difference however is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not. The film's precious selfimportance kills it as does director Bennett Miller's reluctance to add any kind of shading. Like the morose piano score the film is a one note wonder providing no contrast no emotional coloring and no intimate drama. If Capote really was this irritating why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it?

	schema:reviewBody "It's pretty rare to find yourself facing a screen watching a film for the first time and knowing without a single conceivable doubt that you are witnessing precious moments that are sure to define an actor's entire career. I felt this when watching Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote. It is undeniably his best performance ever and will be nearly impossible to top. He deserves an Oscar for this and his chances of winning are already more than excellent.Capote is a movie that just keeps getting better with each passing minute. Dan Futterman a friend of Hoffman's wrote the movie which is one reason why he expressed an interest in playing Capote. He has also said that another reason the main reason he wanted to do it even above the challenge of playing this eccentric and fascinating character was that the story was just so good. As a movie fan I initially saw it for Hoffman's performance and for the first half hour that's all I really needed but as the plot continued I found my self drawn in deeper and deeper. It's really an absorbing film with intriguing characters and superb acting.In a nutshell I came for the acting but I stayed for the story. Capote is one of 2005's highlights.My rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "'Capote' is an excellent film in some ways as excellent as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' in that it makes you think about how we personally and as a society attempt to brush under the rug the disturbing events that force if not indeed blast their way into our lives.Truman Capote becomes captivated by the senseless murder of four members of the Clutter family in November of 1959. He travels to Holcomb in Western Kansas with his good friend Harper Lee Truman Capote was the inspiration for the character Charles 'Dill' Harris  the overly precocious and fey  Summer friend who lives next door to Jem and Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird It is Harper who is able to allow Truman to enter into the world of Holcomb and after a time  Truman is questioning any and everyone he can about whom the murderers might be and why they would kill the Clutters. After the murderers are arrested  Truman befriends them and begins to write the book that will become 'In Cold Blood'. 'Capote' captures the strange relationship between Truman and Perry Smith  one of the two convicted murderers whose life resembles Capote's except  as Capote states He walked out the front door of their mutually dismal upbringing and Perry walked out the back. The book 'In Cold Blood' brought Capote the recognition he long sought but at what price.Beautifully filmed and written. The acting is superb and Philip Seymour Hoffman is the incarnation of Capote  which should win him an Oscar  but since Capote is a small film it may not garner the support it so deserves. One suggestion the film's final shot might have been a long shot of the broad Kansas horizon  imitated by Manitoba's vast skyline slowly closing in on the Clutter common grave where Kansas Bureau of Investigation detective Alvin Dewey coincidentally meets Laura Kinney. Dewey is there to visit a family member's grave and Laura was there to visit Nancy Clutter's grave  they were best friends and had planned on going to the University of Kansas together. Then a slow pull back capturing the wind as it blows over the high plains and events that can never be taken back. This is how the book 'In Cold Blood' ends.".

	schema:reviewBody "To begin with how you feel about Capote the movie will depend almost entirely on how you feel about Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of him. Some will find his highly mannered performance to be highly grating while others will note that that's how the real Capote looked and sounded.I fall into the former group. I just couldn't stomach Hoffmann's highpitched whine. I also didn't care for the breakneck editing or even the long tiresome shots of nothing in particular happening. I felt the movie was pretty poorly put together to be quite frank about it.Although it's a biography of the writer the film covers the time Capote spent researching and writing his magnum opus In Cold Blood from his assignment by The New Yorker to cover the legal proceedings to the final publication of his nonfiction novel several years later. The focus is on Capote's relationship with the murderers of the title particularly Perry Smith Clifton Collins Jr.. Capote figures if he gets close to Smith and Dick Hickock he'll get information he can use in his book. Is he using the killers or does he really care for him? You wouldn't know from a movie whose script has Capote constantly talking about himself no matter what the topic is. What you killed four people in their beds? Pshaw you should hear about my upbringing. And on it goes.As I said Hoffman's performance is quite mannered  some might say flamboyant  and there will no doubt be plenty of you out there who will think he was spot on quite a show and all that. And there will be plenty others who think about five minutes of hearing him talk Capote would be about four minutes too long.So on to the others in the cast. Catherine Keener who's been so great in movies like Being John Malkovich and The Interpreter acts circles around Hoffman. Yes circles. Keener plays novelist Harper Lee she of To Kill a Mockingbird fame and she absolutely disappears into the role  with two exceptions her dazzling dancing eyes. Keener is superb clearly deserving of her Oscar nomination. Lee has a pretty good idea of what Capote's all about as does his lover Jack Dunphy Bruce Greenwood. Chris Cooper is along as the sheriff in charge of the case and Bob Balaban is Capote's publisher.There's far too much focus on the Wonder That Is Truman Capote for a film that insists on covering only one period in his life. Capote is manipulative egotistical and constantly condescending. Not an appealing guy to be sure. And that's fine but we never really get a sense of what he was about just how this one event affected him.Interminable and overwrought Capote is not worthy of its many accolades.".

	schema:reviewBody "Capote opens up as a ghostly recreation. Trepidation and dread haunt the screen from the glimpses of the crime scene deep in the heartland Manitoba beautifully standing in for Kansas where we gradually become aware of violence frozen in isolation recalling that this crime helped set up the template for portrayals of horror.The sudden shift to Truman Capote's milieu in New York City is a jarring juxtaposition but is equally spooky because with Philip Seymour Hoffman's brilliantly uncanny portrayal we are literally seeing an apparition. While it is a bit frustrating at first as we get almost no insight into what attracted Capote to the story especially as we see the details of him getting organized embarking on a long train ride into his heart of darkness and being initially brushed off by the locals but the pay off eventually comes if very slowly.There's initial jokes on the puffedup dandy in antiwonderland who owes a great debt to his old Southern friend the soon to be noted novelist Harper Lee a no nonsense Catherine Keener for regularly puncturing his pretenses and briskly bridging the cultural gap so he can begin worming his way into the community's trust and getting condescended to in return about her book and the movie adaptation and dryly dismissed by his lover as more manly than he is. I didn't start to take seriously that the point of the film was In Cold Bloods effect on him until we see him sneak into the funeral home and start to psychologically absorb the murders and challenge folks to take him seriously despite his way of talking and affected mannerisms.A key transitional scene is almost bizarre when Capote's fame does help him here as the wife of Chris Cooper's solid cleareyed suspicious sheriff Amy Ryan in a very atypical for her '50's housewife role gushes over the writer in their midst even though his books had been banned from the local library and brokers credibility to get him crucial exclusive contact with the still not charmed investigators and suddenly with one of the murderers. Amidst perfect recreations of the late '50's we see Capote learn to manipulate his fame to get him further access that is a harbinger of celebrity journalists to come.The film then shifts to an extended Dead Man Walking chapter as Capote enters into a symbiotic relationship with Perry Smith seductively and captivatingly played by Clifton Collins Jr particularly in the build up to trying to understand the actual crime. We see Capote begin to develop a new kind of journalism even before he writes a word as he gets personally involved in the physical mental and legal health of the murderers  all for the benefit of his book. Key actions of his recall the cynical reporter in Billy Wilder's acerbic Ace in the Hole The Big Carnival first released eight years before these events as we see Capote intentionally lie manipulatively get involved and selectively let out bits and pieces of his own past to get others to trust and confide in him. His life itself becomes a nonfiction novel.But the last chapter of the film goes into unique territory as we see the two worlds Capote has been experiencing collide in his head and take a toll on his relationships productivity and health. The completion of the book has a relentless parallel with the cycles of justice and legal revenge with no spiritual release just a book release and selfaggrandizement even as he invents a new form of personal reportage to great acclaim. The film searingly emphasizes the internal haunting Capote experiences with his photographic recall by leaving out that he did continue the public appearance of his wild ways as 1966 was also the year of his notorious black and white masquerade ball. The atmospheric music heightens the spooky feeling that there's more happening below the surface and helps keep us thinking. The cinematography is exquisite throughout.".

I expected to be dazzled by Philip Seymour Hoffman because I was blown away by Heath Ledger and so many critics seem to have chosen Hoffman over Ledger's amazing performance in Brokeback Mountain. I think my first mistake was allowing myself to have expectations. In no way did this film move or amaze me. I have just finished a film class and every aspect I had studied shone through terribly in this movie. The cinematography was at times completely flawed and fake the music was simply awful the plot was overly presented and Hoffman annoyed me instead of capturing me. The movie is a little over 2 hours but I felt it was five. The film is supposed to take place over a period of five years they even skipped a year but it seemed to drag on and on. Less than halfway through the film I found myself bored and wondered when in the world it would end. The worst thing about the film was the extremely short scenes that would begin to offer a sparkle of good information about Capote's life but instead stopped and left the viewer wondering what in the world just happened and why the scene even existed. Yes Capote was a showoff and often a liar but this was shown extremely poorly. Hoffman's effeminate voice and lisp were annoying but I could look past it as this was Capote's real voice but also he over acted at times. Instead of being amazed I was horrified. For some reason the critics are in love with this man's performance while I saw little that qualified this as the performance of his career.Truman Capote was one of the greatest writers of the 20th century and also one of my favorites. I was so excited when this film finally entered our theaters but right now I just want my money back.

	schema:reviewBody "To say the least watching this movie was an interesting experience. For one thing The Broadway Melody predates the Hayes Code which placed strong restrictions on what could and could not be seen or heard in movies. For example we see numerous shots of Hank and Queenie in various states of undress including shots of them in their undergarments as they change clothes and even one of Queenie in the bathtub!. No nothing is revealed but in 1929 it must have been scandalous to see this.Another interesting aspect of this film is that despite the fact that it is a talkie title cards like those seen in silent films appear throughout. Apparently MGM wasn't quite sure how to progress the story of the movie as it switched to different sets.Another thing I noticed was the similarities between some of the characters' names to those of real people. Specifically Jock Warriner sounds like Jack Warner who was head of Warner Bros. Studios and Francis Zanfield is similar to Florenz Ziegfeld of Ziegfeld Follies fame. It would seem the writers didn't have far to go to create some of these characters.As for the acting Bessie Love is the best performer in the film. Her character Hank yes a man's name! is intelligent strongwilled determined and toughminded and she deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her performance in this film.The Broadway Melody is a somewhat dated movie to echo the sentiment of TV Guide but it is still worthwhile to watch. The script is a little hokey but the performances especially from the women shine through.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is NOT a bad film. It's a 1929 musical that won an Oscar for best film as well as nominations for direction Harry Beaumont and lead actress Bessie Love. It was the number ONE hit of 1929. Central to this film is Love's great performance as Hank Mahoney the older sister in a musical act trying to make it on Broadway. The plot is pretty sophisticated for 1929. Bessie Love is in love with a singer Charles King who falls for younger sister gorgeous Anita Page. Rather than hurt her sister Page starts running around with a scummy playboy Kenneth Thomson. The truth comes out and Love backs off in a heartbreaking scene giving up King and the act and clears the way for Page and King. Two great songs The Broadway Melody and You Were Meant for Me both nicely done by Charles King. Love and Page are also fun in The Boy Friend song in which Bessie Love gets to cut loose and dance in a fullfledged number. Another song The Wedding of the Painted Dolls is truly bizarre and possibly the most over produced musical number you'll EVER see! But I like the music.Yes yes you've seen all this before but remember this is a 1929 talkie. The opening number is wonderful with Charles King introducing The Broadway Melody. That's James Gleason as the music publisher. And keep your eyes on Rosie no idea who played her with her swinging beads. Blanche Payson plays the big woman in charge of the dressing room who has a terrific scene with the gay designer Drew Demorest. Mary Doran Eddie Kane Ray Cooke and Jed Prouty have roles and that's composer Nacio Herb Brown at the piano. I love this film! I love the music. Bessie Love is SO GOOD in this film you wonder why her talkie career didn't go better. Anita Page is also good and has a couple of terrific dramatic scenes. Charles King is a good singer but his acting was hammy. The three stars also appeared in Hollywood Revue of 1929. And yes Bessie Love had been in films since the teens and was already a veteran of 15 years when she made this film. Catch her in Intolerance and The Lost World.".

	schema:reviewBody "MGM's The Broadway Melody has often been criticized and lampooned but the film holds up better than its reputation would suggest and has historical social and entertainment value that merit its viewing. This musical from the early days of sound won the second Best Picture Academy award and the first that went to a sound film. While its technical accomplishments may have impressed audiences in 1929 they are important today only as they show the hurdles that faced an industry in transition. The sound is harsh which can be expected from early recording techniques and like the struggling technicians comically demonstrated in Singin' in the Rain sound created several problems for filmmakers. The camera in The Broadway Melody rarely moves most of the scenes are in longshot or midshot and occasionally characters blur when they walk out of the camera's focal range. Thus observant viewers can spot in this movie many of the real situations that faced the studios and directors during the sound transition period in the late 1920's.Another interesting aspect of The Broadway Melody is social. Like the two fliers in Wings from the prior year the two sisters who form a stage act that they are attempting to bring to Broadway openly demonstrate affection in a manner that would raise eyebrows today. The two fliers in Wings kissed on the mouth embraced and openly showed an affection that could only be interpreted as love although there was nothing sexual implied. Here too the two sisters kiss on the mouth sleep together in each other's arms and embrace more than even two sisters would be permitted to do within current social norms. Again there is apparently nothing sexual in their affection only sibling love. Another changing social norm is the shifting role of gays in film and a clip from this movie was included in The Celluloid Closet to illustrate the change over time. The male dresser in The Broadway Melody is a blatant stereotype of the sissy and the derisive remarks and put downs that he endures from other characters would or should not be tolerated today. However like the Stepin Fetchit characters that illustrate how AfricanAmericans were once treated on film the sissy depicted here is a valuable lesson in how minorities were once marginalized and derided in the movies.However The Broadway Melody is of merit not only for historical and social reasons but also for its entertainment value. While the backstage story has become familiar the plot retains a certain dated interest and is not boring. Some of the songs are familiar from Singin' in the Rain where they were sung and performed as well as they ever will be. But nevertheless hearing these familiar tunes as they were first performed is fun even if the voices and sound are lacking all around and the clumsy dance numbers that are often performed to these songs cry out for Busby Berkeley although they retain a certain clunky charm. While the film is neither the classic that it should be nor the campy dud that its detractors claim The Broadway Melody is definitely worth a look and makes an excellent double feature with Singin' in the Rain as a real example of what was spoofed in that musical classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen The Broadway Melody one has to be taken in as to what an achievement this must have been to 1929 audiences. Here is the very first original musical written for the screen. It balances the interesting storyline with musical numbers which must have seemed to be quite spectacular for 1929 especially the Wedding Of The Painted Doll number. The performances in the film are uniformly good with knockout work by Miss Bessie Love and Miss Anita Page. They bring a believability to their characters which is amazing considering the newness of the sound technology at the time. Miss Page was always a good actress as well as a beautiful woman and I find it interesting that in two of the films that I have seen with her Our Dancing Daughters and this one she has marvelous drunk scenes. The Broadway Melody opened the floodgates for musical pictures which went unabated until late 1930 when the public had had enough. If you are lucky enough to get the DVD version of this film you get an additional ninety minutes of extras consisting of some interesting early sound short subjects including The Dogway Melody which is a funny parody of The Broadway Melody starring an allcanine cast. So step back in time and put yourself in the audience of the first of the alltalking allsinging alldancing entertainments which just so happened to be the first sound film to win the best picture Oscar. If you enjoy film history as much as I do you'll love it. Thanks for reading.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the chance of watching this amazing movie when I bought the DVD version of The Broadway Melody. Although the restoration of the film wasn't that good it still brought me to a conclusion that the film itself is a landmark achievement in the invention of a new Hollywood genre the movie musical.In the strictest sense of the word musical however The Broadway Melody is still at tips. It only contains some three songs blurted out of nowhere by the actors as well as some orchestral music accompanying the movie as musical score. However this kind of musical which is still very much understood to be young in 1929's case is already a rave not only for audiences but also for the critics.Also the technical aspects of the film although are not outstanding enough to win the modern Best Picture are very much appreciated in 1929's case. If we watch the movie in 1929's style we can see that indeed it is a great movie. Long shots of dance sequences great art and set decoration and of course great costumes would fill your eyes not mentioning the kind of sporadic editing techniques and bright lighting that this movie utilized. This movie in 1929's opinion would really win the Best Picture hands down.However what's more interesting with this movie is that as a contemporary audience watching it I am so enthralled at the history it had shown me. Remember this is the transition to sound. It is much amusing to notice the fact that for the first time in my life I have seen movie title cards used for denoting various locations in the film and that it is obvious that the movie utilized the 16framesa minute handcranked camera which was common with the silent films of the 1920s because of the seemingly fast motion you'd notice it toothat actors made in the movie. Another thing is the static nature of the cameras in this movie. It is explainable since cameras are enclosed in iceboxes or camera rooms that are enclosed so as not to be heard by the then allhearing microphone that's why in 2005's opinion it did not have an imaginative screenplay. However at this focal points I can say that history has been shown in this movie and has added a great deal of weight for it to be considered as Academy Award winner for Most Outstanding Production of 1929.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK it's very simple. If you want to watch and enjoy this film you have to put yourself back into 1929. If you're not willing to do that don't waste your time. If you are willing to do that it's a pretty good film. If the sound or picture seems ancient well not in 1929! If the plot seems old hat well not in 1929! You really do have to put yourself mentally into the timeframe of the time. This was really pretty damn good for 1929.Of course part of the enjoyment today of watching such a film is indeed the timewarp you get. It really is interesting to see the movie people groping to find their way in the new era of talkies. Some have mentioned the odd silentmoviestyle storyboards that open the scenes. Or the way that the players sometimes get out of focus when they get out of range of the camera. There were some other limitations of the time that I found interesting. Very interesting to note all the silence when the characters are not speaking especially when they are just emoting. Today of course every such scene would have orchestral backup music to tell you how to feel but obviously nobody had thought of that yet. Or the way that they hadn't really invented the modern notion of a Musical where people burst into song for no reason. In the one scene here where somebody seems to spontaneously burst into a song describing his feelings to someone else... at the end of the song he explains that he wrote it just for her thus it wasn't spontaneous after all.All in all not a great film but enjoyable. I gave it six stars plus an extra one for the historic interest. My one real gripe I did think that the actress who played Queenie was just terrible. Too often she just didn't sound natural she sounded like she was reading lines.".

You can still feel the studios adjusting to the new medium since at several scene breaks they still use title cards the sound is often uneven the acting techniques antiquated and the plot older than the hills. With all that taken under advisement the picture is still worth viewing to see for the archetypes that it established and of course being a precode it has a racier content than would have been allowed even five years later. Famed songwriter Nacio Herb Brown Singin in the Rain Good Morning etc. is featured in the cast next to his future wife albeit briefly Anita Page.

	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie so much!!!! The film has a most memorable score  most of the songs now are standards.Even though Anita Page said of Charles King he was as happy as a lark I think he appeared quite stiff and a bit of a stuffed shirt. In those times when with any stage experience a mediocre actor could command more studio respect than many movie actors who had been giving their all to the camera for years Charles King was given the red carpet treatment. He had been in quite a few Broadway musicals Hit the Deck Present Arms and Mayer liked what he saw.The two sisters were based on the Duncan Sisters  they had been sought for the roles but the parts eventually went to Bessie Love and Anita Page. Hot tempered Hank was played by Bessie Love. She had been a D.W. Griffith discovery who was planning to retire in 1929. She could sing and dance and provide her own ukelele accompaniment and after this film her career was reborn for a while. Stately beautiful Queenie was played by Anita Page who had created a sensation in Our Dancing Daughters and was definitely a rising star.The film opens with a sweeping shot of Broadway taking us into Gleasons Song Publishers on Tin Pan Alley. James Gleason now known as a character actor was then connected with the theatre and cowrote The Broadway Melody. The camera takes us into various rooms and you can hear the cacophony of sound as song pluggers put over their songs. Eddie Kearns Charles King is putting over his song The Broadway Melody to rousing enthusiasm. A couple of singers beg to be given the song so they can smack it over but Eddie has a couple of girls in mind to smack his song over.Hank and Queenie come to Broadway hoping to hit the big time with Eddie's help. Almost from the start Hank's hot temper almost blows their chances. Zanfield Eddie Kane the producer is ready to send them back to the sticks but Queenie has a quiet word with him and he changes his mind. Queenie is not a dumb blonde  far from it. Hank says at the beginning God was plenty smart when he made you beautiful  Hank and Eddie spend a lot of the film looking out for Queenie but she is well able to look out for herself. Even her romance with Broadway romeo Jock Warriner is a ruse to bring Hank and Eddie closer together.The Broadway Melody song sung several times in the film features chorus girls sporting black and white wigs and an amazing toe tap dance by Joyce Murray.That orchestra is trying to drown me out Eddie complains. Are you trying to drown him out. We're doing our best Mr. Zanfield.You Were Meant for Me  Eddie sings to Queenie in her apartment. It was the first time a song was used in a film to further the narrative. Truthful Parson Brown was a minor song hit of that year. It was performed by the Biltmore Trio at Queenie's elegant birthday party. Meanwhile Hank and her friends had prepared a surprise party for her. She doesn't show up and Hank keeps a lonely vigil  she feels she has lost Queenie to Park Avenue.The Wedding of the Painted Doll was a wonderful acrobatic number originally in colour. There were a couple of close calls as dancers caught girls and twirled them above their heads. The costumes were gorgeous as the dancers dressed up as nursery rhyme characters. The Boyfriend was also originally in colour  it would have been wonderful to see Anita Page in colour. Bessie Love was fantastic who knew she could sing and dance like a veteran. The scene in the dressing room where Hank realises what Queenie and Eddie mean to each other shows her wonderful acting skills. She should have got an Academy Award for her performance. The film ends with Eddie and Queenie just back from their honeymoon the idiot married the wrong girl in my opinion and seeing Hank's new act her partner Mary Doran is the same girl Hank fought with in the Zanfield show. Going to the train in a cab Hank thinks wistfullydid she make the right decision but is soon declaring leave everything to me  I'm in charge.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "The second Best Picture Oscar winner and the very first that used the thennew advent of sound was The Broadway Melody a totally underrated and underappreciated musical that started a genre which would be dominant well into the late1960s. It is depressionera New York and two country sisters Oscarnominee Anita Page and a very young Bessie Love come to the city to make it big on Broadway. Of course the competition is stiff and success is not a sure thing by the longest of shots. Page is in love with the star Charles King of the show they want to be a part of. King believes he loves Page too but quickly falls for her younger sister instead. Now the dilemma begins. The problems escalate further as Love becomes a star and begins to run around with socialite Kenneth Thomson in an appropriately sleazy performance. Will the bright lights of the city destroy Page and Love's relationship forever and what will become of the two men in their lives? The Broadway Melody is admittedly a formuladriven film but it works so much better than most all other soap operas throughout the history of the cinema. The main reason is because of topnotch direction by Oscar nominee Harry Beaumont and the solid performances from the four leads. There is also much dazzle in the production as the sound is revolutionary with lavish dance numbers and many instrumental ensembles. Wonderful cinematography costume design set direction and editing complete the film's excellence. Not quite a perfect film but definitely a worthy Oscar winner that still stands pretty tall nearly 75 years after its initial release. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

This film is many claim the first alltalking allsinging alldancing film in Hollywood although many talkies had been created before that but apparently that didn't matter too much for the marketing agents of this film.The storyline of The Broadway Melody of 1929 follows a wellknown pattern within the musical genre namely that of the two poor girls who come to the Big Apple to try and make it to the big scene on Broadway and team up with the struggling performersongwriter who gets them a small role in a musical. Unsurprisingly the lead actress somehow manages to fall off a large pedestal in a rehearsal and injure herself and one of the girls is chosen to take her place at the last moment. This of course leads to a rift in the relationship between the girls which will have to be taken care of in an orderly Hollywood manner throughout the film. To top it off the struggling songwriter falls in love with the new star which is all fine and dandy except for the fact that is engaged to the other half of the sister act. Oops. Being a musical it all works out in the end via a number of arguably wellplotconnected musical acts.Which leads us to the singing and dancing. Having seen a Busby Berkeleychoreographed film this one does look quite amateurish at times with dancers sometimes a bit out of sync with each other and the routines perhaps a little chaotic at times. Having said that they can still be quite enjoyable.The Broadway Melody is classically defined as a revue with a series of scenes which are not necessarily interconnected. I however did not see it as a revue but rather as a flawed backstage musical. Although some scenes do come out of the blue such as a semisurreal almost comical dance scene called The Wedding of the Painted Doll and a scene at the beginning which takes place in a Tin Pan Alley studio Tin Pan Alley is a name applied to places and studios where songwriters and performers came together to make songs and musicals which they then tried to sell to Broadway theaters they can be found to serve a purpose within the main plot of the movie.The actors perform well for most of the time except perhaps for moments when they seem to have a sort of a silent hangover that is do horrifyingly extended and exaggerated impressions and gestures as done in the silent movies a few years earlier. Mind you the concept of talking in movies was only 2 years old at this time so it's no surprise that the filmmakers and actors hadn't fully got the hang of it yet.All in all this is an enjoyable if not very deep little film to see with interesting scenes and characters you even start to care about a little despite their horrendous overacting at times. 3 out of 5 for me thanks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sadly now considered by critics and modern movie fans as the worst film to ever win best picture. And I couldn't disagree more with everyone on here! People this film was made in 1929!!!!!! I agree with those who say modern movie fans shouldn't watch this film that's true. They have no appreciation for older things. This film now has been reduced to ONLY be viewed by real film lovers. And I'm sure it will be hard for some people to try and remember not to judge this film by today's awful tasteless standards but by the standards of films throughout the 20's. I don't care what anyone says this film has a charm to it that has been lost in films today. And I enjoyed it for what it is. The Broadway Melody is the story of two sisters the Mahoney sisters Queenie Anita Page and Hank Bessie Love. Who come to New York so they can make it on Broadway with the help of Hank's boyfriend Eddie Kearns Charles King. Soon a love triangle follows. I admit that the film fails as a musical but I think as a drama it works. The film doesn't have the pizazz of other films from the early 30's. The dance numbers seem stale and flat. Just watch Whoopee made one year after and see those dance numbers. They seem more splashy. Though they did try with the Wedding of the Painted Doll number. That one sort of had some glitz and glamour to it. But watch the Broadway Melody number and you'll think it's just plain. There's nothing to it. Some might find it interesting to know that Edmund Goulding came up with the film's story. He I believe directed the 1932 film Grand Hotel which happened to win the Oscar that year as well. Bottomline Though it is seen as merely an important film due to it being the first all talking all singing film it does carry more with it than that. It has a lost charm to it and I personally like hearing some of the songs The Broadway Melody and You Were Meant For Me. An entertaining film that ONLY serious film fans should see! I voted it 1010".

King's rendition of the title song is one of the great moments in musical cinema a forerunner of all the other great 30s musicals 42nd Street Dames the Golddiggers series etc. Love deserved her Oscar nomination as best actress.

	schema:reviewBody "This old musical still works all right as light entertainment although it's certainly not nearly as spectacular as it apparently seemed to be in its own time.  It has likable characters and a story with just enough to keep your attention which make up for the often creaky pace bad dialogue and routine acting.  It's also worth watching for Bessie Love who gives a good performance as an endearing older sister character which in most places still holds up pretty well.Because sound movies were still a novelty it's loaded with singing and dancing numbers that probably seemed impressive to its original audiences. Some of them are still entertaining while others really just slow things down.  For the most part the script is bad and the acting aside from Love is pretty routine both of which stand out much more now.  For example there is a stretch in the middle of the movie where the characters have essentially the same conversation several times in a row.  You still like the characters but only Love makes hers fully lifelike and sympathetic at least whenever the weak script gives her any chance to do so.  The overall effectiveness of the movie has faded just as most of today's flashy but empty movies will look dull in 75 years.  But at least Broadway Melody will probably hold up a little better over time because it has an innocent energy that most such films today lack.So while it is only going to be of interest to those of us who already enjoy older movies Broadway Melody is still decent light entertainment that is mostly pleasant to watch.  There are many better films from the era but if you like old movies and you're looking for something to do for an hour and a half you could do a lot worse too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Historically significant among other things as the first alltalking musical feature film how could anyone not appreciate this great old movie. The story isn't much. A sister act the Mahoney Sisters Queenie and Hank tries to make it big on The Great White Way. Romantic complications keep the plot moving. As a talkie the script is exactly that ... talky. The dialogue is clunky and the conflict a bit contrived. But who cares? The performers seem to enjoy what they are doing. And the two female leads Anita Page and Bessie Love are marvelous.This film really gives the viewer a good feel for 1920s style. Production design is plain and drab. I would describe the costumes as interesting with those flappers' unique hairdos and hats. And I'm constantly amazed at 1920s interiors with their high ceilings. Every room seems to lord over its human occupants especially the theater proscenium where the title song is performed.The BW cinematography isn't bad. I did notice the film's second half had visuals pleasantly high in contrast compared to the first half. The second half especially toward the end looks pretty good. A few scenes appear a bit blurry or maybe out of focus. But film editors really had a lot to learn in those days like the need to cut useless seconds when actors don't act but just stare. The film's sound quality varies. Some scenes contain a bit of background static in other scenes it's largely absent.Musical numbers are primitive but nonetheless enjoyable. I like that title song. It's played often throughout the film. And they were really big on tap dancing back in the twenties.If the viewer gives the film some slack The Broadway Melody can be an enjoyable cinematic trip back to a fun era. It was a time when filmmakers were still learning their crafts when viewers were satisfied with simpler more basic entertainment when moralistic censors had yet to intrude and especially when the world unknowingly was at the brink of economic collapse.".

	schema:headline " It's a bit dusty with age but for old movie buffs it's a must";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie hasn't aged very well but when it debuted it was a heck of a filmsparking many sequels as well as an entirely new genre of films such as 42ND STREET FOOTLIGHT PARADE and DANCING LADY. Because of this even in spite of its many shortcomings it's an important film historically speaking. The film may at times look like a bunch of clichs but you should remember that although many of the plot elements would become clichd over time here they were quite original. It was also the first all singingall talking musical winning the Oscar for Best Picture so it deserves to be remembered.Hank and Queenie are sisters who have come to Broadway to make it big. Hank knows they will become stars as a team and doesn't seem willing to consider any other option. Frankly as I watched their act I couldn't help but think that these two women had practically no chemistry as a team they couldn't sing or dance all that well together. Well despite Hank's confidence Mr. Zanfield a takeoff on Flo Ziegfeld wasn't interested in the teamjust Queenie. Queenie was not only much prettier but she also wasn't a giant pain in the neck and would take direction! Hank was too selfconfident as well as pushy and obnoxious. Her only experience had been dancing in small venues but she tried to lecture the great Zanfield on how to put on a show! Despite Hank's general unlikability to some she had pluck and determination to me she needed a rap in the mouth she was still given a small part thanks to Queenie and Eddie's intervention. Hank by the way was the show's star and Hank's fiancthat does sound a bit weird huh? The problem is that after a while Eddie starts to realize that Hank's little sister Queenie is prettier and a nicer person. It's obvious that he is falling in love with her and viceversa. However both Eddie and Queenie love Hank and can't hurt her so Queenie begins dating Jocka rich guy. Now up until the very end we really DON'T know Jock is nogood but the instant Queenie shows interest in Jock Hank interferes and tries to split them up. This isn't a good idea as Queenie is only dating Jock in order to get Eddie out of her system. However the longer the film goes the more Hank rides Queenie for dating Jock. Eventually Queenie can't take Hank's bullying any more and runs off to the arms of Jock. Fortunately at that moment Hank figures out the score and tells Eddie their engagement is over and encourages him to marry Queenie. Eddie confronts Jock and gets punched in the kisser. Queenie runs to him and pledges her undying love as he was willing to stand up and fight to protect her honor. Now at this point you assume the film is over but it goes on needlessly for about 15 more minutes.The film had a lot of energy and was uniquea truly innovative film. There were a few cute supporting characters I liked such as the extremely flamboyant costumer as well as the three yesmen. They added some nice color to the film. Oh and speaking of color while the color has vanished over time a common problem with TwoColor Technicolor many of the big production numbers were shot in a primitive form of color. Also the title song Broadway Melody was pretty good but they sang it about six times during the film and four times in a row! I chalk this up not to lousy production values but to the fact this was the first musical extravaganza. Another minor problem that for me was not really a problem was the extensive use of intertitle cards. Considering this was such an early talkie it's not surprising that they relied a bit too much on these cards to connect scenes.Let's address rest of the people in the film. The character Uncle Jed was annoying and insensitive. His schtick was stuttering like Porky Pig and this got old very quickly. Also if you haven't guessed from my above comments Hank was just too darn unlikable and you wanted Eddie to dump her. Had she been softened up a bit less pushy controlling and rude then the audience would have cared more for her plight. Also when she and Queenie have their showdown it's one of the shrillest scenes in movie history and should have been toned down a bit.Now there are also many technical problems with the film. Many of the edits are very sloppyeither being edited too soon or allowing pointless footage to remain that should have been shortened. Frankly it's editing is just awfulespecially in one very long and protracted scene where Queenie just stares off in space towards the end. Also while Melody of Broadway is pretty good the rest of the songs aren't. In fact during one song that was being sung by a guy dressed as a Roman soldier the sound and singing was so bad I couldn't understand any of the song. This wasn't just me either as the film featured excellent Closed Captioning when shown on Turner Classic Movies but when it came to this song the captioning stoppedobviously they couldn't figure it out as well! Also while for 1929 the dance numbers were big and impressive but about 1932 or 1933 these numbers looked amazingly small poorly choreographed and flatneeding a strong injection of the Busby Berkely touch.An important but flawed film.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie hasn't aged very well but when it debuted it was a heck of a filmsparking many sequels as well as an entirely new genre of films such as 42ND STREET FOOTLIGHT PARADE and DANCING LADY. Because of this even in spite of its many shortcomings it's an important film historically speaking. The film may at times look like a bunch of clichs but you should remember that although many of the plot elements would become clichd over time here they were quite original. It was also the first all singingall talking musical winning the Oscar for Best Picture so it deserves to be remembered.Hank and Queenie are sisters who have come to Broadway to make it big. Hank knows they will become stars as a team and doesn't seem willing to consider any other option. Frankly as I watched their act I couldn't help but think that these two women had practically no chemistry as a team they couldn't sing or dance all that well together. Well despite Hank's confidence Mr. Zanfield a takeoff on Flo Ziegfeld wasn't interested in the teamjust Queenie. Queenie was not only much prettier but she also wasn't a giant pain in the neck and would take direction! Hank was too selfconfident as well as pushy and obnoxious. Her only experience had been dancing in small venues but she tried to lecture the great Zanfield on how to put on a show! Despite Hank's general unlikability to some she had pluck and determination to me she needed a rap in the mouth she was still given a small part thanks to Queenie and Eddie's intervention. Hank by the way was the show's star and Hank's fiancthat does sound a bit weird huh? The problem is that after a while Eddie starts to realize that Hank's little sister Queenie is prettier and a nicer person. It's obvious that he is falling in love with her and viceversa. However both Eddie and Queenie love Hank and can't hurt her so Queenie begins dating Jocka rich guy. Now up until the very end we really DON'T know Jock is nogood but the instant Queenie shows interest in Jock Hank interferes and tries to split them up. This isn't a good idea as Queenie is only dating Jock in order to get Eddie out of her system. However the longer the film goes the more Hank rides Queenie for dating Jock. Eventually Queenie can't take Hank's bullying any more and runs off to the arms of Jock. Fortunately at that moment Hank figures out the score and tells Eddie their engagement is over and encourages him to marry Queenie. Eddie confronts Jock and gets punched in the kisser. Queenie runs to him and pledges her undying love as he was willing to stand up and fight to protect her honor. Now at this point you assume the film is over but it goes on needlessly for about 15 more minutes.The film had a lot of energy and was uniquea truly innovative film.

The Broadway Melody was the film that opened the door for musicals and was one of the first Talkies. Everyone holds their own in this own. Anita Page is so talented. I can't see why she didn't become one of MGM'S biggest star. Anita Page was more beautiful then most of the other stars of early Hollywood. Anita Page was one of the most beautiful women in the history of Hollywood. She's still alive people should be trying to interview write a book on her and get the public to know her. She's one of the few living of early Hollywood. Historians and classic movie fans should appreciate her give her recognition instead of writing 5 sometimes 10 books on the same classic star. How many books does it take to tell a person's life? Anita Page has plenty of stories about herself and other stars. In every movie Anita was in she gave her heart and soul. Anita always gave a performance. I enjoyed every movie I've seen her in. I love Bessie Love in this movie also MGM gave her worthless movies after The Broadway Melody. Bessie Love was a talented actress and dancer. it wasn't her so it must of been the studio's fault of her not making the transition to being a Talkie Star. Another one who didn't make it was Mary Doran who played Flo and the girl HankBessie Love gets in a fight with. Mary Doran was talented but she usually had bit parts but she always stole the scene. In this movie everyone gives a performance of a lifetime they give Academy Award performances they give put their heart and soul in this movie. I don't know but this movie gives you the feel of how life was back in the late 1920s early 1930s. Times weren't as innocent as people think. People back then seem to be full of life full of love full of song and danceunlike today. This movies puts you in that era. If you got a taste for good movies you'll love this.

	schema:reviewBody "My vote of 910 stars is mainly for fans of the early talkies although anyone that likes good Jazz Age music should appreciate this one at least a little. Even though it was advertised as All Talking! All Singing! All Dancing! this movie named the Best Picture of 19281929 contains certain elements that point out that sound was still unfamiliar territory to most filmmakers. For example this movie is still using title cards to announce the chapters. Also some of the actors are still using silent film acting techniques in certain scenes as though nobody can hear them. Since the silent era really wouldn't end for another year after this film was made these are understandable shortcomings. The story centers on a vaudeville sister act of Hank Harriet and Queenie Mahoney Bessie Love and Anita Page who come to Broadway where their friend Eddie Kerns Charles King needs them for his number in a show. Eddie has had a long distance romance with Hank for some time but when he meets the now grownup Queenie he begins to have second thoughts. There is also the complication of wealthy playboy Jock Warriner Jack Warner??? making a play for Queenie.The story is basically just a backdrop for the real attraction  the singing and dancing as well as one of the first sound attempts to capture backstage life often tongue in cheek. For example there is the big Broadway producer ZanfieldZiegfeld with his cadre of yes men the rather effeminate wardrobe man tangling with a masculine female dresser that is far larger and tougher than he and a prima donna actor that keeps yelling that the spotlight needs to be kept on him until finally the electrician delivers the spotlight  crashing to the floor a foot away from the selfimportant fellow. Backstage life had been shown before  in the silent part of the Jazz Singer for example  but it was really lacking without the cacophony of voices and noise that accompanies all of the hard work. The film's smashing success misled the film industry into believing that the public wanted more musicals and tales of woe from the footlights regardless of the quality. This is an idea that took two years and a multitude of inferior knockoffs to quelch. This movie originally had some twostrip Technicolor sequences  I know for sure that the original Wedding of the Painted Doll number was Technicolor  but the film now only survives in black and white. If you're familiar with The Broadway Melody number from Singin in the Rain it will be quite shocking when you see how primitive the set was for the original number and how quite unimaginative choreography was at this stage in the history of sound film.In spite of its obvious shortcomings this film is one of my favorite early talkies. I love it not because of how it plays in the 21st century. Instead I love it knowing that it really is the first true movie musical and knowing how it was made in the fall of 1928 when sound technology was so primitive. The cameras were rolled around on wheels  rolling coffins they called them  to give the film some of the fluid visual motion that was lost when sound came in because the noise of the camera had to be insulated in static booths. Also since there was no such thing as a mobile microphone at that point the microphone was manually hauled just off camera by someone in their stocking feet. These are only a few of the anecdotes dealing with how this film was made and the onthespot innovations that were developed. Give it a look I think you won't be disappointed if you can take the entire experience in context.".

He's written Broadway Melody for the new Zanfield show and means to bring in the Mahoney sisters to join him because he's engaged to Harriet better known as Hank Bessie Love a little sparky woman who can really dance and who has a talent for snappy dialogue.

It's a little odd that Hank speaks with a trace of a southern accent while her sister Queenie seems to come from Brooklyn. Oh well. Things get complicated when Eddie falls in love with Queenie he's overattentive and a little creepy in chasing after his fiance's kid sister and Queenie turns him away and allows herself to be picked up by a superrich cad. It turns out that she's trying to protect Hank which is especially touching since Hank's spent her life protecting Queenie who's not too bright. She admits to Eddie that she loves him but then says nothing can come of it and in front of Hank she pounds Eddie's chest and screams that she hates him and runs downstairs to the cad's limousine. But Hank has seen Eddie's response for the first time and she sacrifices herself telling him she never really cared for him leaving him free to go after Queenie and get socked on the jaw by the cad and ministered to by Queenie and married to her too. Hank is a trouper and hires a blonde to work on her act in Peoria declining the happy couple's invitation to come live with them. Okay so the plot is sappy. The stage set designs and the costumes and the dance routines are great and a couple of the songs are okay and two or three times something really catchy flashes by like the threeguitar plus ukulele vocal quartet singing at Queenie's birthday party. The theatrical people are interesting too the autocratic Zanfield with his comic yesmen the stuttering agent the hateful babe in the chorus line the flamboyantly gay costume designer the drunken investor they call Unconscious and so forth. But the art deco sets and interiors are the best part I think and the art deco dance routines. Somebody does a tap dance on toe shoes! Top hats clingy costumes geometric dance formations spinning leaping acrobatics Cleopatra on the Nile leg kicks the whole array of Broadway delights.".

It deserved the Oscar for Best Picture of 1929 and although Bessie Love shines it is the beautiful Anita Page who actually comes to the forefront of the film.  Her incredible beauty is the first thing one notices and really sets up the other characters who come along in the film.  For those of you who love the elegance of the Golden Age of Hollywood this film is a must for your collection. Though sound was in its infancy during the late 1920's the production crew and the director handled it quite well.".

It deserved the Oscar for Best Picture of 1929 and although Bessie Love shines it is the beautiful Anita Page who actually comes to the forefront of the film.  Her incredible beauty is the first thing one notices and really sets up the other characters who come along in the film.  For those of you who love the elegance of the Golden Age of Hollywood this film is a must for your collection. Though sound was in its infancy during the late 1920's the production crew and the director handled it quite well.";

Don Dubro the proprietor of a dusty dark innercity junk shop holds court there with his friends and makes plans probably on a daily basis for his ascendancy to the top. He does this more out of habit than hope because he's long ago surrendered his future to the daily repetition of his life as guardian of the discarded remnants of others' possessions. Disheveled Teach on the other hand is either too dumb or too stubborn to accept the lot life has dealt him. Instead he bucks like a wild horse under the saddle and refuses to be broken. Most pitiable of the trio which populates the movie is teenaged Bobby. Mistaking much of the palaver which passes between the older men as pearls of wisdom Bobby is the only one of the trio who still has a chance to make a life for himself somewhere beyond this tired toofamiliar neighborhood.

	schema:headline " Great solid acting and brilliant dialogue. A supreme pleasure!";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching this film on screen and on stage I imagine wouldn't be a hell of a lot different.  It's still a 3character film that revolves around the same settingmost of the time.  But when you see great acting like this how can you complain??  Dustin Hoffman is great at whatever he does and he's perfectly believable as the foulmouthed Teach.  He has some of the greatest lines.  My favorite is Guys like that I'd like to fk their wives.  He is rude and obnoxious with barely a sympathetic quality but he's the guy you love to hate.  I just recently started watching NYPD Blue and just from watching a few episodes I can say that Dennis Franz is one of the best actors I've ever seen.  He deserves to be on the big screen a lot more because he has abilities as an actor that only few TV actors also possess.  He delivers every line and every emotion with such power that your eyes are wide open with amazement every minute he's on screen.  Even young actor I assume he's now in his late teens Sean Nelson is perfectly cast blowing me away with a performance I'm sure very few young actors can pull off just as effectively.  He only has about 20 or 30 minutes of screen time yet he's the character you most feel sorry for at times despite the fact that he lives an unclean life dealing with thugs and earning his money via dishonest methods.  You can just sense that he didn't have any parental leadership and he wasn't sure what path in life to take so he took the most easy oneand also the most dangerous one.  In a way the two guys are like his surrogate parents.  I've never seen the play but when I see the name David Mamet under the writing credits I immediately know that I'm gonna hear some priceless dialogue.  I don't know how he does it but he just has a relentlessly quick wit when it comes to creating dialogue.  Like a play this movie is composed of 80  dialogue but the dialogue is so great that I don't really care if there's no exciting visuals.  And last but no least I loved the opening and closing theme song.  It just has that grungy quality that perfectly fits the tone of American Buffalo.  If you're a fan of superb acting this will be a real treat!  A real treat!  My score  8 out of 10".

There's no real action to speak of no pretty women to break up the squalid maleness and like Teach's dialogue the story goes round in circles.

Bob Sean Nelson of the 1994 film Fresh is Dons' teen aged protg the only one of the three who's not necessarily destined to be a loser.While you never do forget the fact that you're watching a filmed version of a play the story is still pretty riveting. Mamet sure does have a way with dialogue and profanity his Mametspeak flows quite naturally from the lips of old pros like Franz and especially Hoffman. Franz does an admirable job of being grounded and reacting to the outbursts of Teach who is admittedly the more colorful character. Hoffman just commands the screen whenever he's speaking. But young Nelson is quite good himself why didn't he become more of a star? believably portraying a kid with some naivety but some streetwise savvy as well. Mamets' script is also interesting in the way that it ruminates on the ideas of friendship loyalty and free enterprise.Director Michael Corrente never calls attention to himself by being overly stylish instead placing full trust in his actors and the material. And the music by Thomas Newman adds plenty of flavor.This is definitely one to see if you're a fan of the cast.Eight out of 10.".

The best however remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling magical panoply of top quality special effects.  Those effects still work their charm.No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief Abu John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier Jaffar played by a sinister Conrad Veidt.  The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent he and the boy Abu suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates.  Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt.  Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornadolike black swirl Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. Howard incidentally did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film.  Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind.  Still I don't think anyone under eight ought to see Thief of Bagdad.This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present.  It was great to see computerbesotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.Thief of Bagdad is a prewar Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind.910.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first discovered Alexander Korda's 1940 Fantasy THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950's on a reissue billed as The Wonder Show of the Century! Both Korda Technicolor films THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in. True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950's. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it  nice but not as it should be. NOW comes the MGM DVD 3 Dec 2002 issue. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!! It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once I watched it a second time. The only Extras are a Spanish Dubbed version SubTitles in both English  Spanish and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer. Thank you MGM for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on DVD.".

Though my four children's primary exposure to this tale the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights comes from the Disney Corporation the Thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end.  The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability.  Sabu who plays the young thief Abu also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say He's cute! In 1940 the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects.  Today of course those effects seem very dated Look it's Barbie flying through the air declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying.  Yet they fit into the story well.  The film is after all over 60 years old.  The effects fit with the script.  Furthermore what ones sees in The Thief of Bagdad remained pretty much stateoftheart for the next twentyfive years. One need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this.  In that it was quite an achievement.This qualifies as a family film though there are a few stabbings near the end.  The acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation.All in all a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects.  I recommend it.".

By the '90's my daughter and I had seen it many times on TV but still went to the pictures when it came to the local arthouse cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and Miklos Rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again.Idealistic Prince Ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out but evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne. After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for Sabu! and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything. The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940 but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later. Anyway if I'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects! Favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Hall's suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend  in fact the stunning colours throughout Sabu and Rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale. Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever this and Casablanca and then died. John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions only pure love mattered.There's a couple of mildly violent images in it but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 positive message it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer. One of my Top 10 film favourites I can't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of Time.".

This is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well. The only drawback there is is that one can not see past the bad' effects compared to the effects nowadays like one could when one was a child. I remembered nothing of those effects of course it had been about ten years since I'd seen this film when I was about eleven years old. Who then watches effects? One only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides. In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. Coming to think of it I feel like the Indiana Jones films are quite a like this film. There is comedy romance and adventure all in one which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern it succeeds in not being dusty and old. All of that is mainly due to the great story the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors. In that department Sabu as Abu and Conrad Veidt as Jaffar stand out providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. Great film and although an 'oldie' definitely a goldie'. I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD someday.8 out of 10".

I am a fan of fantasy anyway and for a film of this time 1940 I was impressed by Alexander Korda's ability to completely immerse one so completely in the story.  I believe that during the wartime period these films were especially important for a lot of people in order to distract them in a positive way and allow them a brief respite from the harsh realities and depressing aspects of the war. I think that this film had probably fit the bill at that time and even nowadays it does take you away from the everyday and allows you to indulge in a wonderful tale of fantasy romance magic throughout. June Duprez was stunning and otherworldly in her looks and performance. John Justin played a wonderfully enchanting Ahmed although I found Sabu's character a bit tedious at times the rest of the movie for it's time was topnotch.  A great escapist put your feet up and enjoy the afternoon movie.  I give it a 7.8 out of 10.".

Several years later I realized how much of the satire and wit of the script I had missed on that first viewing. I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years.  In addition to the script the production transcends the fantasy genre.  This is Korda the storyteller at his very best.  When you see Thief as a child you know that youve had a great time.  When you see Thief as an adult you know that youve seen a masterpiece.  Its as timeless as the story it treats.  An amazing work.Thomas McCarthy".

	schema:reviewBody "The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.Budget costs happen in US films too only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there. But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. Part of the way through the shoot Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon. He certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the UK. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography best artset direction for a color film and best special effects. Only Miklos Rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart both belonging to Duprez. This was Veidt's career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star. Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features. Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant. Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today. It's an eternal tale of love romance and adventure in any order you want to put it.".

Replete with swords  sorcery it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It also is a fine piece of film making featuring good acting and an intelligent script.Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boyish Thief Sabu is perfectly cast in this his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word his character is certainly heroic in deed  action.The rest of the cast do fine work. John Justin is both energetic  sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way Sabu gets a significant part of the action when he's not transformed into a dog but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the film massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra forever dithering on about his mechanical toys Malleson was also responsible for the film's screen play  dialogue. Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris later an exceptional stage actress plays the dual roles of Jaffar's accomplice and the sixarmed Silver Dancer.The film was begun in Britain but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction in vibrant Technicolor is most attractive especially the fairy tale architecture in blues whites  pinks.Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924 Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and set before the cameras. His first four films ELEPHANT BOY1937 THE DRUM1938 THE THIEF OF BAGDAD1940 JUNGLE BOOK1942 were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films BLACK NARCISSUS 1947 being the one great exception. His final movie Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS 1964 was an improvement but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 only 39 years of age.".

The casting couldn't have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in genies. And the epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high...I watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it. This film is an adventure for all ages..noone too old to enjoy it. The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time...I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.S. was just about to enter WWII. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in Casablanca. And Korda teamed upI believe with Justin and Dupree again in The Four Feathers....great filmmaking!".

The Grand Vizier Jaffar Conrad Veidt convinces Ahmad to walk through the city disguised as a subject to know his people. Then he seizes the power telling to the inhabitants that Ahmad has died while he sends his army to arrest the Sultan that is thrown into the dungeons and sentenced to death. Ahmad befriends the young thief Abu Sabu that helps him to escape from the prison. They flee to Basra and plan to travel abroad with Sinbad.

When they see each other Jaffar uses magic to blind Ahmad and turn Abu into a dog. Is their love doomed?Watching The Thief of Bagdad is a journey to the childhood of many generations when television was in black and white and this film was one of the favorite of the children. In 2016 The Thief of Bagdad is still delightful with impressive special effects for a 1940 film with magic flying carpet jinn flying horse and fantastic journeys.

Off the screen he was a violent man given to fits of temper and I can't recall anyone having a good word to say about him. Possibly for that reason Beery could lay claim to the fact he was the greatest actor in films. The crowning achievement of his career was his Oscar winning performance in The Champ.Of course Beery could not have done it without little Jackie Cooper as well. It's their scenes together that make the film as memorable as it is. Instead of splitting the Academy Award with Fredric March who was also awarded The Best Actor for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde possibly Beery should have given half of his half to Cooper.Beery is actually a former champ in this film. He's an over the hill alcoholic pug who lives a hand to mouth existence with his young son Cooper. He split from his wife Irene Rich years ago taking Cooper and she'd like to get him back. She's pretty well fixed now with a new and rich husband and a daughter by that marriage. The fly in the ointment is that Cooper is really attached to his father and blind to the faults he has. And Beery really does love his son the only really happy part about his life. He's probably way too old to be seriously in the fight game but he needs the dough for his kid.The Champ is guaranteed four handkerchief film even now almost eighty years after its debut. A remake was done in 1979 with Jon Voight and Rick Schroder in the main two roles but it wasn't a patch on this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the worst years of the depression the most popular stars were not the most glamorous or attractive. As revealed in the highly respected Quigley poll which surveyed movie theatre owners on who their audiences were most likely to come and see the biggest draws in the early 30s were friendly earthy types whom audiences could relate to at a time of poverty and desperation. These included genial comic Will Rogers middleaged frump Marie Dressler and burly pugface Wallace Beery who played his greatest role in 1931 feature The Champ.Beery's physique meant he was often cast as villainous thugs but he had demonstrated enough acting prowess to get a decent number of gentle giant lead roles. In The Champ he gets to combine the two one minute the swaggering pugilist the next a devoted father. He gives a performance full of tiny gestures expertly dancing from one expression to another. When he gets to show his character's emotional vulnerability the scene is doubly poignant coming after the macho confidence he normally displays. The knowledge that off the set Beery was reputedly a wifebeating brute who bullied everyone around him perhaps spoils the effect slightly but even with this in mind his performance is captivating believable and utterly flawless.Supporting Beery behind the camera is a director who was both a poet and a craftsman of the cinema  King Vidor. Vidor excelled at coaxing naturalism from his players at a time when theatrical hamming was the par. His camera focuses on Beery for long takes allowing the actor to potter about doing his little bits of business and developing the character. Vidor also gives the picture bite with some neat tracking shots. These are usually in the field of depth so in other words we are either backing away from the actors or following them. The former kind with the players advancing on the camera as in the shot that opens the picture gives the characters presence and show them as a force to be reckoned with. The latter kind where the camera follows the character physically pulls us into their world. Vidor used these kinds of shot a lot and they are a neat way of making the audience feel involved without drawing too much attention to the artificiality of the form.It may come as a surprise that this story of male bonding was written by a woman Frances Marion. But like Beery Marion defied expectations simply by being very good at what she did. Her plot for The Champ earned her the second of her two Oscars. It does not perhaps describe the most realistic of situations but the emotional content is very sincere and its depiction of determination and human feeling during hard times must have struck a chord with audiences of the day. The dialogue which is credited to three separate people is appropriately punchy with lines that sound believable yet are memorable and evocative.Aside from Beery the rest of the cast are a good bunch. Of all the lead players Irene Rich is the only one who doesn't stand out and she seems simply there to fill the wealthy motherly type. But having said that she is not at all bad and her presence doesn't harm the picture. The Champ also sees Roscoe Ates in one of his largest roles and for once getting to appear as a normal person rather than the stuttering fool he was usually required to play. Finally there is Jackie Cooper one of the greatest child stars of his or indeed any era. While it seems clear that fame has gone to the youngster's head he's not quite as good as he thinks he is he is certainly up to the task of carrying his end of the picture. He plays a genuine child when with Beery but when he is around others he deepens his voice and adopts mannerisms as if trying to be an adult. It's a touching and appropriate performance and very suited to the tone of the picture. And this was perhaps also the only time in which a child actor like Cooper could become a personality in his own right. As the popularity of Beery Dressler et al proves this was the age of the unconventional superstar.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS!Hard to believe it's as old as 1931 in a lot of ways. As far as production it's about what you'd see today except it's in black and white. And it could be a movie today  save that it would highlight the bums that get thrown up against title holders  unlike Stallone's Rocky who was in pretty good fighting shape and had a few moves. Beery seems out of his element as a fighter  looking at best like a beery no pun intended brawler though his character plays the exheavyweight champ. But then the athleticism of the era wasn't what it is today. On the other hand there were some great fighters in the 20s and 30s and Beery's shape and skill is out of their class entirely. Anyhow  small gripe perhaps. One might excuse Beery in the championship fight just as the bum thrown in to boost the Mexican champ's rating  as is done today. I don't see it necessarily played up that way in the film. But I might have missed something.Some things also bring home the era of this film. For ex. the effort it seems to mimic the newsreel footage from the theaters of the day by slowing down the film rate thus artificially speeding up the action. We see this sort of 'newsreel' effect at both the horse race and the concluding championship fight. There's also an interesting 2 or 3 second montage during the fight which strikes me as 60s style filmmaking or later. But it's just 2 or 3 seconds. Generally  it's a good looking film. It plays well even today.The subplot with the black boy who hangs about with the young Purcell and the other kids  an inspiration perhaps? for the 'our gang' crew that followed first in theatrical shorts a few years later?  is clearly intended to encourage racial tolerance and repel a bigotry which was openly and boldly part of the fabric of world culture in the 1930s and before. The little black boy doesn't roll his eyes or do goofy things or talk in a slow drawl or any of the rest. He just acts normally. When 'Dinkus' Purcell the Jackie Cooper character unknowingly runs into his divorced Mom whom his Dad never much mentioned and never identified for the kid she asks  who's your friend? 'Dink' replies and then comments  He's colored. And Momstrange lady replies  And what a pretty color. Again just clearly something important to the story and very out of touch and actively opposed to the ethic of the time.As for the rest of the story it's basically a child custody story about the love and affection of the child in question with the death of one of the disputants the resolution and which enables the emotional concluding scene where 'Dink' who had kept an arm's length from Mom once she told him who she was in favor of his Dad whom he knew and loved breaks down at the sudden loss of his father lying dead on the training table and for the first time tearfully cries out Mother and then rushes to her. She carries him out through a gauntlet of reporters and onlookers  bringing down the curtain. The End.There's not much to quarrel with in the story. It is a coincidence that the ex and her new husband run into The Champ Andy at the south of the border race track. But coincidence can happen and does. It is somewhat difficult to believe that an out of shape fairly weak and uncoordinated brawler as Beery is in the ring could land the lucky punch against a fighter in trim shape enough to take him out for the full count. But that's the story that's Hollywood that's Rocky and  what the hey.It might have been interesting to see brother and sister interact a little more. Cooper's oddly adult inflections and mannerisms seem to play well against the spoiled but good natured little girl  just happy to have a 'new' brother. It might have been interesting to see the game in which Andy wins so much and the horse he eventually fights to get back. Might have been interesting to see Andy and Dink out and about a little more rather than just 'in training' or in the flat. And so on so forth.It's clear why Beery got the nod for the award. He seems to have had a sort of Long John Silver sort of patronizing slowtalking 'rap'. in various films. Here save for a few instances he plays it pretty low key. He seems just like a regular guy in the Mexican prison thinking over his part in the custody dispute and thinking he's just not the father for Dink. And when Dink comes to the cell and Andy tells him to 'shove off' basically it's believable with just the right tone delay cliched delivery and choked back tears. When he takes the money from Linda's rich hubby he comments on being down on his luck and almost lapses into Long John  but just not quite. And surely he spoke for a fair number in the audience in the early first years of The Great Depression.It's a good film. The emotional manipulation is right up on the surface and may be a bit too trite and obvious particularly as the extraneous 'background' scenes I might like to see as suggested above just weren't there. The film was 'tight' and 'stayed on message' in that way. And it feels right almost. It has its flaws but remains a good film.".

It is the story of washedup and somewhat alcoholic boxer Andy Purcell Wallace Beery just known as Champ to everyone including his adoring little son Dink played by Jackie Cooper. It's as though life has really ceased to have meaning for the Champ ever since he lost his championship status. The only thing that continues to give his life meaning is his son. The Champ isn't exactly providing a wholesome environment for Dink. Dink hangs out in pool halls with his Dad isn't enrolled in school and sits up nights alone in their dingy room waiting for the Champ to come home when he is out on a drinking binge. Champ's exwife socialite Linda sees Andy and Dink at the racetrack one day and tries to convince Andy that Dink would be better off with her. At first the Champ is unpersuaded. However when he gets a hold of a good sum of money and gambles it away and winds up in the drunk tank overnight he decides that maybe it is for the best if Dink goes with Linda.Wallace Beery had some lean times after motion pictures transitioned to sound however he got a new lease on his career at MGM and it turned out that his coarse voice attracted fans rather than repelled them. He won a welldeserved Best Actor award for his role but if there had been a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1931 it would have gone to nineyear old Jackie Cooper. He is comic as the streetwise kid meeting his halfsister for the first time  The dame is goofy he remarks. He is heartrending when the Champ tells him he doesn't want him around any more that he's tired of feeding him just so he'll go with his mother.A minor point that made this film so refreshing for me is that nobody tries to lawyer up or turn Dink's fate into a courtroom battle. Everyone deals with everyone else in this film on decent human terms. In the end the Champ tries to regain the championship so he can provide a good life for his son and so that his son can respect him not so that he can win a custody fight.".

	schema:headline " a wonderful kid";
	schema:reviewBody "Jackie Cooper was the top child actor at MGM in the early 30s when it was the top studio. He started off as part of Our Gang but just a year later was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in Skippy he just lost out to Lionel Barrymore in A Free Soul. L. B. Mayer called him a wonderful kid and teamed him and Wallace Beery in the emotional and heart wrenching film The Champ. It has the most tear drenching finale of any film I have ever seen and Jackie Cooper gives an outstanding performance as Dink the little boy who has an unswerving faith in his hopelessly alcoholic father. The sets have a very gritty and real look  not at all what you would expect from MGM the dream factory.Little Dink lives with his dad a washed up fighter who can't stay off the booze. His managers try to talk him up to some promoters promising that he is the same fighter he always was  Dink's job is to sober him up but unfortunately it doesn't work. Andy The Champ has always promised Dink a race horse and when his luck changes he buys Lil' Champ  an old and beat up horse that they train up for a race. The day of the race Dink meets his mother he or she doesn't realise it Linda who has the horse Blue Boy next to Lil' Champ in the stables. Dink introduces her to his little mate  he's coloured he says yes but he's kind of a pretty colour she replies. It was interesting that you didn't see her shake hands with the little boy their hands were out of the camera range.When Lil' Champ loses the race Linda Irene Richrealises who Dink is and wants to give him everything that he has missed out on. Even though Linda seems lovely  her character is portrayed as once having been a golddigger who only married Andy when he was rich and famous and left him for a more prosperous gentleman when he was down on his luck.Andy is then paid 100 to let Dink visit his mother  while there he sings a few bars of a popular song Ruth Ettings' Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me meets his stepsister Mary Lou adorable Marcia Mae Jones a little cutie who talks to Dink about the reality of fairy tales. After his visit Linda is determined to take Dink away from the unwholesome life he is leading with his dad. Dink and Andy have a magical relationship but after a heartfelt scene Andy convinces Dink to live with his mother but with Dink away he loses the will to go on.The ending is the most emotional ever and Jackie Cooper was a genuine star. There will not be a dry eye by the film's end. In an interview I heard Jackie Cooper say he did not get on with Wallace Beery. They made a few pictures together and were considered a team adored by the public. Cooper said whenever people stopped him in the street to ask what Beery was really like he had to lie and say what a wonderful guy he was  he couldn't tell them the truth and spoil their illusion. The previous reviewer was right  Beery was not well liked.Highly Recommended.".

Just blew me away. The scene in the jail DESTROYED me as did the final scene. Just such amazing characters and you couldn't help but feel for them.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm kind of surprised actually that there are only twenty five other reviews for the film here as I write this considering it was Oscar nominated for Best Picture and it earned Wallace Beery a coBest Actor Award shared with Fredric March for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde the only time that's ever happened. I'd been waiting for this one to come around again on Turner Classics so last night I got my chance.In the commentary before the picture it was noted by hosts Robert Osborne and Drew Barrymore that actor Beery didn't really like kids much less like working with one. He carried the sentiment over to costar Jackie Cooper so it's kind of amazing to watch their on screen chemistry as father and son. They really do seem to adore each other and in an almost role reversal sort of way Cooper's character Dink seems more like a parent than his old man. That becomes particularly evident when we see Dink undress his Dad for bed after one of his drunken jags. Beery's portrayal of former Champ Andy Purcell makes it difficult for the viewer to warm up to his character he's a broken down bum and all around heel with no redeeming social qualities and constantly screws things up in the fatherson relationship with Dink.Regarding Beery's casting as The Champ I found it hard to imagine why he was considered for the role. Though it works for the story I'd be hard pressed to believe they couldn't find someone who might have fit the role better in terms of physical condition and athletic ability. There's no question the man was severely out of shape and even though he was written as an over the hill boxer in his Forties he looked like he might have been in his Sixties Beery was actually forty six at the time.On the flip side young Jackie Cooper manages to do it all here and he'll tug at your heart strings every time he takes it on the chin from his derelict father. There's an interesting scene prior to learning about his mother Irene Rich where he's clambering around on a tiled roof and any minute you expect the scene to end in disaster. Cooper blithely plays the scene like your friendly neighborhood SpiderMan before stepping off the roof onto a rail and finally down to the landing. I had to wonder how he made it look so easy.You know I also have to comment on Dink's friendship with the black youngster Jonah Jesse Scott. You really have to place yourself back in the Thirties well before the Civil Rights era to understand how rare this kind of relationship would have been in real life. As director King Vidor pushed the envelope with this kind of portrayal similar to the way producer Hal Roach approached the subject with his 'Our Gang' crew. These pioneers were really operating in brand new territory much to their credit as film makers.As for the ending well if you're prone to sentimentality you better have a box of hankies handy. In context it's not really surprising that the Champ would succumb to the stress of his final match but seeing it play out with Dink breaking down over his loss is a pretty tough experience. It's the kind of ending that delivers a knockout punch.".

Beery's portrayal of former Champ Andy Purcell makes it difficult for the viewer to warm up to his character he's a broken down bum and all around heel with no redeeming social qualities and constantly screws things up in the fatherson relationship with Dink.Regarding Beery's casting as The Champ I found it hard to imagine why he was considered for the role. Though it works for the story I'd be hard pressed to believe they couldn't find someone who might have fit the role better in terms of physical condition and athletic ability. There's no question the man was severely out of shape and even though he was written as an over the hill boxer in his Forties he looked like he might have been in his Sixties Beery was actually forty six at the time.On the flip side young Jackie Cooper manages to do it all here and he'll tug at your heart strings every time he takes it on the chin from his derelict father. There's an interesting scene prior to learning about his mother Irene Rich where he's clambering around on a tiled roof and any minute you expect the scene to end in disaster. Cooper blithely plays the scene like your friendly neighborhood SpiderMan before stepping off the roof onto a rail and finally down to the landing. I had to wonder how he made it look so easy.You know I also have to comment on Dink's friendship with the black youngster Jonah Jesse Scott. You really have to place yourself back in the Thirties well before the Civil Rights era to understand how rare this kind of relationship would have been in real life. As director King Vidor pushed the envelope with this kind of portrayal similar to the way producer Hal Roach approached the subject with his 'Our Gang' crew. These pioneers were really operating in brand new territory much to their credit as film makers.As for the ending well if you're prone to sentimentality you better have a box of hankies handy. In context it's not really surprising that the Champ would succumb to the stress of his final match but seeing it play out with Dink breaking down over his loss is a pretty tough experience. It's the kind of ending that delivers a knockout punch.";

	schema:reviewBody "Finally watched the original version of The Champ some nearly 35 years after seeing the remake that starred Jon Voight and Ricky Schroder. So I knew the ending wasn't gonna be a happy one. Wallace Beery is the title character who's fallen on hard times and Jackie Cooper is the son he got custody of after splitting from his wife who's now married to a welloff man named Tony. He drinks and gambles and that causes him trouble but Dink Cooper's character loves him no matter what. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a touching movie not unlike that remake I mentioned before though I haven't seen that again for a long time. That fact that Beery was only one vote shy of fellow Oscar winner Frederic March that's what a tie was considered then isn't surprising since he's both a little funny and touching same for Cooper. So on that note I recommend this version of The Champ. P.S. One time Our Ganger Cooper appears with Marcia Mae Jones here. She was in a couple of the series' shorts after Cooper left. Also immediately after watching this on DVD I then listened to the Lux Radio Theater version on the same disc that aired on 11131939 with Beery reprising his role though Dink was by then played by Bobby Larson who also appeared in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington that year. Larson's nearage friend of color Jonah was played on the show by Matthew Stymie Beard a fellow Our Ganger of Jackie's who first performed with him in the short Teacher's Pet. Oh and Tony there was played by Wallace's brother Noah father of his samenamed son who's best known as James Rockford's father Rocky in The Rockford Files.".

	schema:reviewBody "Champ The 1931  out of 4 Classic tearjerker won two Academy Awards including Wallace Beery the Best Actor Oscar as well as a Best Screenplay for Frances Marion. The story centers on a former boxing champ Beery and his son Jackie Cooper who find themselves on the skids but the father plans on making a comeback so that his son can live a better life. THE CHAMP has been imitated so many times over the past eightyyears that it's easy to forget that this was one of the first of its type. The film has lost some of its impact over those years but you'd have to be dead or a complete robot for its ending not to really get to you. I won't ruin what happens but its impact is incredibly strong and touching. The film isn't the greatest ever made and I was a little surprised that the screenplay won as Oscar as I felt it left a few too many questioned unanswered. At the start of the film we see the fatherson relationship and this here is tested when the child's mother Irene Rich tries to enter back in his life. I thought the screenplay really bumbled some of the scenes between the mother and the son and I found her attempt to get him back a little silly to say the least. I also thought some of the boxing stuff had a few too many clichs. The boxing drama was rich throughout the silent era and this here really doesn't offer up anything new. With all of that said the main reason to watch this film are for the performances and there's no question that Beery and Cooper were terrific together. Beery would end up splitting the Best Actor award with Fredric March in DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE but he probably should have split it with Cooper. Both give terrific performances but what makes the film so special isn't their individual performances but instead it's the work they do together. There have been thousands of examples of a fatherson relationship but I really can't recall too many that seemed as real as the one here. Beery was perfect for this type of slouch as he can pull off being a slob and make us care for him and his rather dimwitted ways. I don't think it's an insult saying this but Cooper has to be one of the greatest crying kids out there. The way he just breaks down in tears would get under anyones skin as he's so believable in these scenes that you can't help but really feel for the guy. Rich is good in her brief scenes as is Roscoe Ates as one of the champ's assistants. A lot of what happens throughout the film really won't come as a shock as the movie is rather predictable but at the same time the thing is just so entertaining that you don't mind it. Again the ending is somewhat of a legendary thing among classic movies but it still manages to hit you where it counts.".

I've known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could. In fact there is a Law and Order episode which explores the dark side of this same situation. A girl looking young enough to pull it off goes through high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret.With Drew though it's an assignment. She's a copy editor for the Chicago Sun Times who yearns to be a reporter. Publisher Garry Marshall who plays the part like Donald Trump took over the Sun Times gets this brilliant idea and just sees in Barrymore a young enough looking person to pull off the masquerade. High School the first time was bad enough. Drew was not the most popular then and she's not doing better the second time around. That is until brother David Arquette also goes back to school and helps her over the rough patches.Of course this raises a whole lot of issues for Drew peer pressure from two sources job and school. What's a girl to do?Never Been Kissed is a light and charming comedy which to its credit skips over the opportunity to be crassly exploitive and gives us some good entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into pathos. Michael Vartan as her English teacher is the kind I wish there were more of in the education field and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a pair of the empty headed cool kids that Drew tries so desperately to hook up with.Still it doesn't inspire me to return to Midwood High School.".

Drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into pathos. Michael Vartan as her English teacher is the kind I wish there were more of in the education field and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a pair of the empty headed cool kids that Drew tries so desperately to hook up with.Still it doesn't inspire me to return to Midwood High School.";

Her outfits are wacky and weird and it brings back memories of those who dressed a bit differently! The gorgeous Michael Vartan was adorable as the teacher wish there had been teachers like that when I was at high school! and Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a film you could watch again and again with a fabulous sound track! One for all those at school in the 90's to watch!".

I must say that Leelee Sobieski who plays the schools 'biggest nerd' is by far the hottest nerd I've ever seen in real life or in Hollywood film. I'd even join the math club to get next to her. I only gave this film a 5 because it was worth a watch based only on seeing Jessica Alba covered in dog food and mostly for seeing Miss.Sobieski in a one piece skin tight body suit. Leelee's body in that skin tight suit was by far the greatest highlight in this overly stupid and rarely funny force fed wreck.510".

The movie isn't exactly surprising and won't appeal to anyone who insists on teen films having acid in their veins  but then again the edgier Jawbreaker wasn't just badspirited it was BAD period.

	schema:reviewBody "Never been kissed starring Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named Josie Gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. She is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works forto go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. Only problem is Josie has never been popular. High School was in fact a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. Josie grabs this assignment as much to finally fit in as to get a scoopwhat she finds is the major premise of the story.Never been kissed is one of those movies that's so sappy and schmaltzy at times particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie. It is however very sweetly done. Drew Barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely Josieshe breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at the school.Never been kissed has some really funny moments as Josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. Examplethe reggae bar scene.I also loved the appearance of Josie's brother Rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student the way that he helps to give Josie her dream of finally fitting in is just hilarious. At the same time as Josie's woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful. You do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to Josie to be affected by her storyDrew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore Josie from the beginning.there is a lot of mean girls a 2004 release in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier. Never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together.I liked this movie. It was really beautifully done in some areas. The movie is corny in some places yes the last scenerealisticno waydoes this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious Hollywood way? Oh yeah yeah yeah baby! But it manipulates beautifully there are some lessons to be learned here. The movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. I have actually met people who have had similar experiences to JosieI've met people very much like all these charactersI think a lot of people simply don't know or can't conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school and how hurtful it can be but it's there. Not unrealistic at all. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom as she demonstrates the sheep mentality that can exist so prevalently as Hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be it was well done and very true. I'm making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture. It's engaging sweetly acted and just Rufus. I'd say check it out. 8 of 10.".

I wasn't quite as tortured as Josie was during her real high school days or like Aldys but I was never the go tothemajorparty type either. The prom scene were the three popular girls fall victim to their own prank as Josie pushes way Aldys the intended victim is my favorite scene and I clapped when I first saw it.

Wonderfully sarcastic dialogue poignant exchanges between excellently crafted characters and an overall beautiful tale of mortality and morality The Bucket List is an excellent opportunity for two of the greatest actors of our time to show off their inimitable techniques. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman have a chemistry that will have you laughing until you cry and crying at the sight of something truly majestic.Edward Cole Jack Nicholson is an incredibly wealthy hospital owner who firmly believes that he's running infirmaries instead of health spas and therefore demands that each room contain two beds and two patients. When a twist of fate lands him in his own hospital he's stuck sharing a room with Carter Chambers Morgan Freeman. Both men are dying of cancer and the doctors give each of them only a few months left to live. The two slowly but surely realize how much they enjoy each other's company so when Carter begins writing a bucket list Jack prompts him to see it through. The bucket list is a list of all the things both Edward and Carter would like to accomplish in their remaining months before they kick the bucket and with Cole's wealth the two end up touring the world skydiving and racecar driving. As their list of goals begins to come to an end they realize how much they've truly lived just in the last few months alone and how much their short friendship has impacted their lives.Jack Nicholson's performance is excellent as the curmudgeonly Ebenezer character that receives a change of heart and a change of view with Carter's friendship. Little character development is necessary as we have come to recognize Jack's style over the years. We're already familiar with his character and relate to him in much the same way we feel about all of his recent projects. He's attained a level of recognition that allows us to acknowledge him simply as Jack. Regardless of his role he's still Jack and he doesn't disappoint.The same can be said for Morgan Freeman who continues to play roles that accentuate his knack for worldly wise and goodnatured characters that can make us laugh and cry from moment to moment. Rarely do we see two actors work so well together  this odd couple appears to have been destined for these roles. The chemistry between these veterans is pleasantly refreshing and because of it The Bucket List is one of the most entertaining films of the year.Another aspect which is a great credit to screenwriter Justin Zackham is the dialogue which is continually hilarious even while it borders on heartbreaking. Sarcasm and cynicism are proudly worn by Jack and the conversations conducted between the two are never dull. Meaningful affecting and downright funny the script is amazingly well paced and flows more naturally than anything in recent memory.Nearly everything is likable about The Bucket List except the tone of the film which many awards voters and critics may feel is too repetitious of late. The film is uplifting and heartwarming and while the conclusion strives for unpredictability comparisons may be drawn to similarly crafted works. Driving Miss Daisy and As Good as it Gets are immediately brought to mind especially because these include the same actors although the morals of A Christmas Carol and It's A Wonderful Life are clearly beneath the surface of this feelgood comedy. Despite these comparisons The Bucket List is wholesome entertainment that will certainly bring director Rob Reiner back into the spotlight especially after his unpropitious previous project Rumor Has It.Mike Massie".

	schema:reviewBody "You know that feeling when you walk out of a movie and think God that was just such a great film? It takes a lot for me to think that... especially when it's a movie about two men who have cancer... but this movie really did it for me as well as everyone else in the theater. I saw the movie at its first ever screening in Pasadena and it was just wonderful... even with temp music and unfinished visual effects! Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were truly amazing together  it's a film about cancer and yet the two were able to balance the comedy and the drama of the script in such the perfect way that the audience loved every moment of the movie. The script was quite original which was such a breath of fresh air and the acting couldn't have been any better. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone  as it was such a feelgood movie that made you both laugh and cry at the same time  something you don't come across too often. Not only did the audience applaud the movie at the end but EVERY single viewer who stayed to give comments agreed that the movie was Excellent... I can't imagine how often that happens. I'd be surprised if this movie isn't up for some Oscar or another come next year.".

It takes a lot for me to think that... especially when it's a movie about two men who have cancer... but this movie really did it for me as well as everyone else in the theater. I saw the movie at its first ever screening in Pasadena and it was just wonderful... even with temp music and unfinished visual effects! Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were truly amazing together  it's a film about cancer and yet the two were able to balance the comedy and the drama of the script in such the perfect way that the audience loved every moment of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Usually I'm not into these kinds of movies but with the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman I had to see it. I'm really glad that I decided to give this a try.The story is quite predictable but I still enjoyed it. Never mind how impossible the storyline is because it is a great movie about friendship  how two men become great friends in a short time and help each other out throughout the time they are together. It moves along at a smooth pace and I never got bored so the writer gets credit for that. The acting was top notch as Nicholson and Freeman draw forth the right emotion in the audience at the right time. The emotional parts are done just right but the funny scenes are the best. I laughed throughout the movie but not as much as I would in a true comedy movie but the comic scenes in this one really work and Nicholson is the main man in them. It does have a message at the end about how you should live your life to the fullest how your family is important and how you should be happy in life and the movie delivers that message perfectly.Other than the predictable storyline and the sometimes cheesy dialog the movie is great. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a feelgood movie.810".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bucket List is certainly a sentimental favorite that as a viewer touches your emotions and has you hoping for finding a friendship in the end even though the film is funny and somewhat unrealistic. The performances from Jack and Morgan as expected are top notch and I personally like Rob Reiner's direction of showing how an unlikely and odd friendship develops between two guys on their way out of life by doing the things they've always wanted. The Bucket List in many respects is a good happy fairy tale that most ordinary folks would dream about before they die yet the character types played by Nicholson and Freeman make it so believable.Jack Nicholson is billionaire hospital CEO administrator Edward Cole who as a grumpy and aging four time divorced playboy finds he has terminal cancer. With Freeman a character that's much different a blue collar working class auto mechanic named Carter Chambers who's a loving family man with a wife and kids and on the side a beloved history buff and trivia enthusiast yet he discovers his fate of having terminal cancer. Upon meeting in the same hospital room they share at first it's a cold and tough bonding only later to grow into a friendship by journey and discovery. The concept is thought up by Chambers by making a list called The Bucket List of things to do before we die. Oddly opposites agree the journey starts. The adventures include the heart pumping sky diving auto drag racing and trips to exotic locations and foreign countries. Many scenes like the mountain tops and pyramids seem unreal yet are carried on by the witty and funny lines from Jack's character.Most important aside from the journey and discovery of friendship and caring by travel and adventure a special bond is formed. Each has learned before they meet the end they have made each a better person that cares they both found what's important in life thru one another. The Bucket List isn't really a tear jerker yet it's story of two terminal cancer patients provides the need for compassion as the viewer feels pain during the early scenes and you are certainly touched by the way the characters emotions grow by friendship you as the viewer feel your emotions have taken a good friendship journey. Finally this film is made even better by the performances of the two veteran legends Nicholson and Freeman. I highly recommend anyone view The Bucket List.".

On the other hand it can be taken as a very accessible commentary on friendship companionship and finding the joy in life. I prefer the latter. Either way it does require a certain suspension of reality. Just ask Roger Ebert who has made it his personal mission to bash the film.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are both in prime form and after a string of weak films director Rob Reiner does a masterful job of keeping Nicholson from going over the top and from having Freeman kill us with sweetness. Even more impressive is the pacing of the early hospital scenes ... nothing is forced no line of dialogue or shot seems hurried. This is two patients coming to grips with their situation. While the worldly travels are impressive my favorite parts of the film are the scenes between the two beds in the same room.On the downside will someone please tell Hollywood that Morgan Freeman in the cast does not mandate a blasted voiceover from the man? We know he has a great voice but if the narration adds nothing to the story please just let the film do its thing.There are some laugh out loud moments and oneliners but there are also some strong moments of drama ... death has a way of creating those. This is a combination of road trip buddy film and comingofage ... very unusual for two senior citizens! So while the story line surprises are few sit back and enjoy excellent acting including Sean Hayes wonderful direction and a few life lessons. Good stuff for a movie that all ages can enjoy.".

To be honest however I probably would not have enjoyed any of the films that I would have chosen more. This film is very well done. I liked the screenplay by Justin Zackham. I liked the direction by the real talented Rob Reiner. And I was very impressed by the acting. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman did a superb job playing two dying old guys who befriend each other and together have the adventure of their lives. The film is very good. The plot involves this hospital ownerEdward Colewho is dying from cancer and another cancer victimCarter Chamberswho meets Cole while getting treatment at the same hospital. After they both find out that they each have only a few months to live they agree to travel together all over the globe and follow this list of tasks. They call it the bucket list.Nicholson gives a real touching performance as Ed Cole. He plays Cole funny sad stubborn angry strong fearless and loud. Morgan gives an equally touching performance as C. Chambers. He plays Chambers smart cool romantic funny fearless and emotional. Both men are very moving in this film. They are great sharing the screen. I really enjoyed watching them play scenes together. It was for me a real treat. These guys Nicholson and Freeman are two of our finest actors. And this film is no exception.Even though The Bucket List is a small film about friendship and the meaning of truly living I do not recommend it for the preteens. There are some very adult scenes. However families with teenagers will enjoy seeing it together.Josh Weinman".

The movie reinstates the fact that there is much more than what we can actually do with our life by appreciating the world around us and realizing the beauty and significance of Human life. This movie is a light paced movie which leads ultimately to the death of protagonists but they have lived a whole different life for some time at least before they finally said adieu to the world.I would give the movie 910 Rating and a thumbs up to the movie which has presented us with an life changing experience and has given all of us a chance to stop worrying about life and start really living it.".

	schema:reviewBody "My mom and sister saw The Bucket List a couple days ago and told me that it was wonderful. So tonite my boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and see it and I'm still in tears. The Bucket List unfortunately hit home so hard for me and I'm surprised at my mom and sister since we have had quite a few family members that lost their battles with cancer. The Bucket List while is semiuplifting it just was almost torture. We have these two characters who we know are probably going to die and they're so lovable we're setting us up for a painful story. I think that's the reason why besides that it brought back so many painful memories that I didn't really like this story. These two characters got to do so much that many would do anything to do and I'm not sure how to take that.Edward Cole has it all he could possibly want in life he has tons and tons of money lots of beautiful women and the world at his feet. But all that changes when he is diagnosed with cancer he is roomed with another cancer patient Carter Chambers. They are both told that they are lucky if they have a year to live so they make a bucket list things they would like to do before they die and Edward makes it so. They travel the world skydive race cars you name it. But they end up with something more powerful a loving friendship that will last eternally.The Bucket List is incredibly made I mean it's Rob Reiner I will always give Rob the true credit he deserves. Including these amazing Alist actors Jack Nicolson and Morgan Freeman who were just beautiful together. The movie has these incredibly gorgeous scenes as Carter and Edward are traveling the world just amazing. But the film just had hit such a hard spot for me I think. It was a bit much to handle same with my boyfriend who hasn't lost anyone to cancer so while this was a charming movie about death and living life to it's fullest we loose the characters that we want to live so much. The Bucket List is more for the older crowd I think because it's a bit to handle for the younger crowd I don't mean that as insulting it's just too much and too painful to think about.810".

As much as I love Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman I wasn't very excited about this... it looked really cheesy and the reviews were not good at all not saying I believe in most critics but when I don't feel particularly curious about a movie AND the reviews are mostly negative chances are that I'm gonna skip it. It turned out pretty good actually... we've all seen movies about people who find out they only have some time left and make a list of things to do before dying Isabel Coixet's My Life Without Me with Sarah Polley is my favourite of them and The Bucket List is not original or innovative at all but Nicholson and Freeman alone make it worth seeing. It's not sappy as most movies about terminal patients and it's entertaining enough. And even though it doesn't intend to be serious or thoughtprovoking death is always a delicate issue and this movie might make you reflect about how you spend your time months ago I was discussing with this same friend how in movies people only start living to the fullest when they get to know they're about to die. That's something we should all think about to die you only need to be alive so we should all enjoy more the present instead of worrying so much about the future because unfortunately there's no such thing as life guarantee. For its humor and tenderness The Bucket List deserves a 7.510 from me.".

I think what made that happen was the idea that Albert Finney's character in Big Fish found fulfilment in his son's acceptance of his ways and in the embracing of the characters in whose lives Edward I think that was the character's name? had made such a profound impact. In the same way here that these two men found fulfilment in each other touched me profoundly. The film is in its own way so very simple. Nothing spectacular happens and in a way nothing needs to. As you can predict it doesn't take a genius to gather from the plot that Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman in not quite careersummingup breakout performances but more than adequate and moving turns here die and it's in the simple yet deep things that make their life worthy and enables them to find their joy before they finally succumb to their inevitable deaths. In the quest to complete their Bucket List they seek in a way that's only fantasy for others to wholly and completely tie up their loose end before they kick the bucket and the sheer closeness they achieve through the sharing of their combined destinies and rejoicing in both their similarities and differences. I found Morgan Freeman's character was a little more fleshed out in that he got given more nuances to work with but Jack Nicholson was on form in the same vein of more mature movies he finds himself excelling in. In all a good film certainly worth a watch and Morgan Freeman Jack Nicholson and the scriptwriter have here a movie of which to be proud and that will mean a lot to many people.".

This movie is not being aired on a major channel which is disappointing although I hope people 'channel surfing' discover this film as it is at its best a beautiful film.Initially I saw this film shortly after losing a close fried to cancer. Although I can agree with many reviews that the plot is quite predictable and that both Nicholson and Freeman do not stretch themselves. However the connection between the two men and their different perspectives on death are really fantastic. As an outsider close friend of someone with cancer this movie depicts two otherwise completely different characters who only share their terminal illness. I found the bond portrayed between both actors both believable and beautiful.There seems to be a little scepticism regarding this film  I think the rating has improved since 2007 I myself saw it many months official cinema release  and with similar scepticism. I finished the movie with a tear in my eye some of the thoughts of terminal cancer patients revealed. Beverley Todd highlights the distance of those who suffer and family members.At best this film has touching and heartfelt moments which can be understood by all. It only misses the mark by being an exclusively cancer based film  although this is not the main subject of conversation I feel some of the sensitive and most evocative scenes may lightly wash over those who have not witnessed or experienced cancer sufferers first hand.".

It's no surprise that a movie with highly talented actors like Nicholson and Freeman would be good. It's not that I'm normally attracted to movies with a deep inner meaning but this is one movie which didn't beat you over the head with it. I mean here are two guys who are facing death and decide to go out  do all the things they've ever wanted to. Some scenes are dramatic others are funny and in the end the deep inner meaning just kind of shines through without a bunch of sappy sentimentalism. And yes I did get a bit watery eyed near the end which means this is a good story that you can get into  feel part of.".

Everything is entertaining also due to Morgan Freeman's and Jack Nicholson's class and capacity to display emotions. Overall it's convincing despite not being that original and for not being a tear jerker story of course many moments are moving and touching but never honeyed and trite. Landscapes shown in the movie are wonderful though everything was shot in a studio and not on the spot.".

What a joy seeing two veteran Oscarwinning pros Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman on screen together! Their characters Ed Cole and Carter Chambers are two middleaged men who suffer cancer at approximately the same time and bond sharing a hospital room at the building Cole owns. The movie picks up when they see the world together. Also loved Sean Hayes as Nicholson's assistant Thomas actually Matthew but Jack's character thinks that's too biblical and Beverly Todd as Freeman's wife Virginia. Didn't recognize Rob Morrow as the doctor which is ironic since I watched him for years on Northern Exposure! Corny and maybe contrived in spots but for the most part this was a heartfelt and occasionally humorous movie. So on that note I recommend Rob Reiner's The Bucket List. P.S. Alfonso Freeman Morgan's son plays his son here. And the grandson of legendary director Frank Capra Frank Capra III is a coproducer and first assistant director here.".

	schema:reviewBody "I almost never bother to review films as there are always plenty of opinions out there already. But this one was so incredibly bad that for some reason I feel compelled to say something....First off there are so many terrific players in this movie that I have to imagine they never knew what they were getting themselves into. They probably all thought this was going to be another cult underground hit that they could be associated with. Maybe on Mars....I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. Michael Clark Duncan made this worth it for me to wait till the end but other than that it was so patently absurd that I cannot imagine how many decent movies didn't get made because this waste of electrons protons and neutrons wasted all that funding.The script had zero touches of brilliance which if it had might have been enough to hold it together and make it at least a mediocre mess. But then the director seemed to decide that the only way to tell this story was to make everything insane. And then finally the editor either was the worst ever or the best ever but we'll never know what they had to start with in terms of raw footage.All in all this was a colossal waste of time and effort on everyone's part especially those who burnt the 2 hours of their lives to watch it".

Was he trying to make a satire about the night of America then thought of presenting it in a comic style ? Was he trying to make a black comedy ? Was he  oh god  thinking that it's a comedy from the start ? Whatever the answer is that guy made an ugly disturbing and disturbed movie.Originally many problems in one night could produce a fine comedy black or else. But many problems in one movie could produce just a bad movie. It is made in such a poor primitive and messy way. The script thinks itself a genius while mixing the genres together in one night with many story lines and absurd spirit. But it lost being anything good or bearable. What it did win though was having a one of a kind silly sense of humor and it's very natural since it's directed by Sheffer one of the silliest actors alive !I bet that none of the movie's cast knew what the main goal was. I guess Sheffer told them that he wanted to make a satiric cross between Pulp Fiction and American Pie. So sometimes it's about bloody crimes then it's about crude comedy then it's about both then it's about the ugliness of America then it's about just ugliness ! It's let's put some of the dirtiest matters on screen for the sake of making a satire. It turned into a great satire towards stupid moviemaking mainly. Here's a movie that feeds itself and us with massive amount of dirt a monster of a comedy and low moviemaking to torture everyone sat to complete it. Thus putting the American flag at the top of the movie's presented crimes wasn't something serious about only in America it was rather a try to sell the movie's own crimes as something serious !Anyway don't be confused asking was it a comedy? A satire? A black comedy? A crime movie? A soft porn?? Because in fact it is confused. It tried to say that America has become a big toilet but ended up as a big toilet itself. Thus I won't say give it a chance and think about it instead I'll say don't forget to flush ! American Crude is a dictionary of dirtiness and bad moviemaking. It's nasty matters shown in nasty way.".

One scene a person fires a gun  the next scene another person is dead with a small red splatter so we all know where they've been shot. Done.There is very little actual sex in the movie. Again it is mostly alluded to and it's consensual sex or sexual contact between adults. Although one of the threads of the movie involves one character attempting to sell a 17 year old girl to a child pornographer there is no child nudity or sex scenes involving children and no scenes of violence against children.Another thread involves a Cuban woman who seeks revenge against the men to gang raped her as a child and left her for dead in a dumpster. She does not go into the event in any graphic detail and the flash back scene is very brief and involves the camera pointing up to two fully dressed men looking down presumably at the Cuban woman as a then child. This is as disturbing as the movie gets.Ron Schneider is his usual likable downtrodden longsuffering self and really adds the comic balance this movie needs. Jennifer Esposito is not entirely convincing as the revenge seeking Cuban Carlos. Michael Clarke Duncan is the loyal but mistreated boyfriend of Carlos and does a passable job. Ron Livingston is as always Mr. Everyman a flawed but aw shucks pretty nice guy when ya get to know him. Missi Pyle Gigi the hooker and Shannon Mathers 17 year old girl lack subtlety in their performances. The two blonde women are typical of the boring sort of wives you find on TV sitcoms  pretty but not really why you tune in.The movie is sort of everywhere and no where and you don't really get to know what makes anyone tick. Many of the plot twists are pretty predictable and some things seem to be added for shock value and don't really add to the story. Homosexuality seems to be a go to for the writers to try and keep the audience engaged. The scene with Ron Livingston in a gay bar seems to go on for a while and have no real point. Some of the writing is tired and clichd i.e. Money talks and bullshit walks. said with far more drama than a line like that warrants. The speech made at the end of the movie by the father standing under the US flag was silly and contrived.Ultimately this is decent way to kill 90 minutes and you'll grow to like most of the characters and forget them shortly after the movie is over.".

It follows the career of an American wouldbe master chef from seeing why he is dishonorably discharged from the navy to life in his family's pizza parlor to the chance to go to France and study under a French multistar chef.  The comedy comes from a good natured mockery of the various pomposities of the chefs souschefs food critics tax inspectors doctors etc.  I thought the plot was quite elaborate and I liked all the little elements of the movie that gave it the complex flavor of a good pot a feu  the fight at the market the dance lessons by the middle eastern kitchen cleaner the tantric yoga sessions etc.  Even the restaurant's little white panel truck which you see all over the place in France they even use them up in the vineyards.  I read the few reviews that this movie received and I think the film is grossly underrated.  There are only a few minor dubbing problems which I barely noticed.  The acting is uniformly good and you're left with a great feeling and the urge to go out to eat at a good French restaurant right away!  I would urge people to find the movie and watch it  even though it apparently is not available in any format except German pal videotape. Check it out on WE.".

The movie is about a young American chef named Loren who goes to France to work in the kitchen of his idol the famous Louis Boyer.  It is meant to be a fast paced romp but ends up a mess as new plot devices are thrown in every other minute.  For example Loren goes from being the slowest chef in the restaurant to taking charge of the operation when Louis Boyer goes mad.  That is another implausability  Boyer is eccentric at best but certainly not crazy enough to shut down his restaurant or tear apart his family.  No matter though. The movie's purpose was to show off the excitement of French culinary art and it does that well.  Plus the performances by Eddy Mitchell as Chef Boyer Irene Jacob as his daughter and Isabelle PetitJacques as the nervewracked partner of the restaurant was she also Boyer's wife? are very charming.  Jason Lee on the other hand seems to have been miscast. His performance was a bit amateurish.  Still the movie is worth a watch if only to see the food.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Insider is the only film I remember having seen where I walked out of the theatre with a headache because of the intensity of the story. Michael Mann is one of few directors who has such an indepth understanding of both the subject of his film and the nature of that subject that he is able to portray a realism that is nearly impossible to match.There is real skill displayed in the way in which the Insider weaves through the aspects of both Bergmann and Wigand's lives. Whereas a lesser director would have thrown the characters at each other in an artificial collision Mann introduces each character as being average professionals each living in their own respective stable lives. It is only when their chance encounter creates a subtext that could consume them both does the real chemical reaction in the story take place.Bringing life to these fantastically written characters are two of the most talented 'bigname' character actors of our time Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Surprisingly it is Crowe that drives this film forward and his portrayal of Wigand is spoton perfect. His is an honest humanity both a loving father and a flawed husband who never fully balances his life under the pressure of circumstance. Crowe nails the performance by not hammingup the character but rather by understating his personality. This works in that it is the character that is elevated while the actor disappears.That is not to ignore the excellent work by the remainder of the cast. Pacino's performance is accented and accentuated beautifully by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Most notably are several standout scenes mixing Pacino Plummer Philip Baker Hall and Stephen Tobolowsky that ground the underlying tensions of the film fantastically. And the juxtaposition between the cold hard New York settings and the organic nature of Mississippi further press this film beyond standard nonfiction works.Easily one of the best dramas of 1999 the Insider is a standout member of that elite club of great historical dramas such as All the President's Men that are few and far between. It is for that audience that appreciates skilled performances meeting skilled direction and restrained mature writing.".

In fact we've now seen it 5 times I think though I may have lost count.If you go to the movies to be entertained mindlessly do NOT see this movie you will bored. This movie is for people who like to think and who like to receive superior presentation of thought provoking material. The Insider has all that.The movie gets you thinking about mankind. The obvious problem with human nature is obvious in this movie. The Tobacco companies knowingly selling addictive product whilst claiming it is not. And then almost almost but not quite getting away with ruining an individual's life an individual who's conscience was pricked by what they had seen.But then it moves into the CBS drama where again the hopelessness of mankind in general shines through. The strength of two individuals though manages to win the day which is what makes this true story so unusual.I found that contrary to those who complained of the movies length every scene that Mann has given us has a reason. A good reason. From the opening scenes depicting an evil far from USA. To the hints as to why we didn't hear anything about the drama when it happened because the OJ murder story and media frenzy drowned out what should be to us all a much more serious matter.For me the crowning moment in the film was when Russell Crowe as Wigand was about to dig into a hamburger when behind him on TV a newscaster reported findings about him bad though unfounded findings. Crowe put his knife and fork back down in a way that told us all that he had no more appetite in fact all the will left in him had been violently thrust away thrust away by the selfish interests of the Tobacco companies.All in all this is a complete movie that deserved its 7 nominations and should have gotten some awards. The sound was great as was the camera work. If you love an artistic movie you will love this one. Crowe is thoroughly believable and has cemented himself as a first rate actor capable of playing just about any part put his way. Pacino is very well cast Plummer is a class act and a host of supporting cast did themselves proud.What we can't forget about this movie for all its drama and for the pointed view it gives us of the nature we bear its a TRUE STORY. Thats what really makes it shocking. And only those driven to the ends of despair and loneliness such as Wigand and Bergmann were can really truly realise another fact pointed out in the movie in the end of it all we are nothing anyway so what does it all matter?See it!".

	schema:headline " Michael Mann does it again!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been a huge Michael Mann fan for years but I do have to admit that I approached his latest film The Insider with just the teensiest bit of trepidation...after all Mann is the godfather of the thinking man's action flick and I've even heard it said that his action sequences are so integral to his movie that they are practically another character in the film...with which I completely agree.  So I was wondering how a movie with no chase sequence no gunfights basically no action whatsoeverwell how could that possibly qualify as an authentic Michael Mann signature film?Yes the action per se is missing but Mann still brings his signature directorial style to life with lots of wide shots intense close ups and indirect focus all bathed in cool blue light and threaded together with an inventive soundtrack including a reprise of a former track that was used so effectively in HEAT sorry I can't recall the title offhand.And what the movie lacks in action Mann more than makes up for in highwire tension.  He pulls us into the drama of an ordinary man's life by portraying the myriad humiliations both large and small that assault Wigand from the moment he is fired from his job as an RD VP for a major tobacco company.  The detoriation of his life from his finances to his marriage to his belief in himself is explored with the sort of atmospheric detail that is Mann's trademark  the play of light or lack of it the familiar sights and sounds of everyday life from the patterns of rain on a windshield to the rush of wind through the trees and camera work that ranges from tight outoffocus shots to sweeping panoramas of razorsharp clarity...all of this creates an environment of realism that puts you into the film.  You can't just observe Wigand's struggle you experience it with him.  My moviewatching partner observed as we left the theatre that he felt exhausted from the tension as if he'd just been through the corporate wringer himself.  I knew what he meant!But atmosphere isn't all Mann delivers.  Once again this genius director has placed an unexpected actor in the lead role of his film with amazing results.  Before Daniel Day Lewis was Nathaniel Poe in The Last of The Mohicans no one would have believed he could pull off a major hunkorama role...well guess what?  He ended up defining the hero of the adventureromance genre!  In The Insider Mann has opted for the opposite effect casting  young potential hunk material Russell Crowe as an older slightlypotbellied father of two.  Wigand doesn't look like anyone's hero and perhaps that's actually the message of the movie  an ordinary mana nobody reallycaught up in extraordinary circumstances.  And Crowe delivers...in a major way!  Personally I can't remember an acting performance that mesmerized me to this extent...unless it was the last time I watched Crowe in L.A. Confidential.  He evokes his character in this movie with the apparent ease of a magician doing card tricks  the illusion is complete and appears to be effortless.  Even with silver receding hair and twenty extra pounds which we are shown is not the result of costume padding but Crowe's own amplified flesh he is imminently watchable... almost hypnotically so.There are even as I post this whispers and rumors about this movie being an Oscar contender.  Best director best actor best supporting actor. Again I can only nod my head in complete and total agreement.  Russell Crowe will blow you away and Al Pacino gives his best performance in years.This film is quiet intense and ultimately extremely moving.  I literally burst into tears twice the way you do when you've recieved bad news or seen something dreadful so complete was my empathy for the character of Jeffrey Wigand . The anger helplessness and puzzled confusion at being punished for telling the truth felt all too familiar to me.In summary I was not at all disappointed in Mann's direction of this film. Even without the phenomenal action sequences he's known for this film had the same visceral effect on me that I experienced when I saw Manhunter Last of the Mohicans and HEAT.  I'm a bornagain fan!".

And Crowe delivers...in a major way!  Personally I can't remember an acting performance that mesmerized me to this extent...unless it was the last time I watched Crowe in L.A. Confidential.  He evokes his character in this movie with the apparent ease of a magician doing card tricks  the illusion is complete and appears to be effortless.  Even with silver receding hair and twenty extra pounds which we are shown is not the result of costume padding but Crowe's own amplified flesh he is imminently watchable... almost hypnotically so.There are even as I post this whispers and rumors about this movie being an Oscar contender.  Best director best actor best supporting actor. Again I can only nod my head in complete and total agreement.  Russell Crowe will blow you away and Al Pacino gives his best performance in years.This film is quiet intense and ultimately extremely moving.  I literally burst into tears twice the way you do when you've recieved bad news or seen something dreadful so complete was my empathy for the character of Jeffrey Wigand . The anger helplessness and puzzled confusion at being punished for telling the truth felt all too familiar to me.In summary I was not at all disappointed in Mann's direction of this film. Even without the phenomenal action sequences he's known for this film had the same visceral effect on me that I experienced when I saw Manhunter Last of the Mohicans and HEAT.  I'm a bornagain fan!";

He's been given a severance package but that's about to fall apart as well.Enter Lowell Bergman Pacino producer for CBS Television News' bastion of journalistic integrity 60 Minutes. Bergman's doing a report on fires that were started by careless smokers and has been given a report so huge and full of technical jargon he can't make heads or tales of it. Through a friend he is put in touch with Wigand in the hopes of finding a translator. Wigand thinks Lowell is coming after him because of what he knows about his former employers a major tobacco company.It is at this moment that director Michael Mann institutes a trick the likes of which hasn't been seen since All The President's Men. The two exchange a catandmouse conversation via fax. Bergman finally calls Wigand's bluff by daring him to meet him the next day. He does.What does Wigand know? Well its all over the papers these days about how the tobacco industry lied about manipulating the leaves to make them more habit forming. We have Wigand to thank for that. But that isn't where the story ends. This is a twofold tale on one hand you have the selfdestruction of a man who put everything on the line just so he could do the right thing. On the other you have a television producer who so believes in the integrity of himself the network and his show that he is willing to risk everything he has to fight for the protection of his source. I haven't seen this much commitment outside of Woodward and Berstein's staunch protection of Deep Throat.The trump card of this film though comes in the form of Christopher Plummer playing one of the most visible news figures of the past 25 years Mike Wallace. Wallace teeters on the edge of looking like a foulmouthed celebrity hungry media hound who's only thought is about ratings. However before its over he evokes the integrity of Edward R. Murrow a line that gave me chills and made me pray for an Oscar Nomination.Director Michael Mann is known chiefly for his ActionThrillers. This 155 minute film is slow paced but gripping for ever second it is on the screen. A lot of people have complained over the past 78 years about Pacino's staccato performances suddenly shouting at the slightest provocation. This film returns him to his prime form a style he hasn't walked in since Dog Day Afternoon ...And Justice For All and Serpico.Anybody got a light?".

The production is a masterpiece of visual style moving performances and penetrating dialogue. The story is captivating even at 157 minutes. There is more than enough unexpected plot twists to keep our attention throughoutand at a consistent pace. Many movies will have moments of inspiration and intrigue but not The Insider. This movie is one long intriguing moment a moment that is never boring or lacking. It is also believable and entirely convincing. There is a realistic look into the behavior of journalists and their desire for information. It is so intelligent about revealing the most important information little at a time always at the perfect second.Russell Crowe's character is the heart of the film one of the most active protagonists seen in a movie all year. He plays Jeffrey Wigand an exemployee at Brown  Williamson one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers. Its chairman Michael Gambon has fired Wigand for questioning some of their potentially harmful research tactics and business routinesbut not before blackmailing him into signing a strict confidentiality agreement that threatens his much needed severance package currently providing for his wife and their two young girls. When the company even further jeopardizes his existence he blows his fuse and prepares to release information on the indecisive industry of BW.He gets his opportunity when Lowell Bergman Al Pacino an ambitious and experienced reporter from the CBS news program 60 Minutes receives a package regarding product safety studies at another tobacco company. Bergman contacts Wigand aspiring towards hiring him as a transitory consultant for a potential 60 Minutes show. Bergman senses some vital information withheld in the knowledge of Wigand therefore further investigates what he is making the executives at BW so concerned.The film makes many unexpected turns in the second half it smartly switches focus from Wigand to Bergman. After losing his privacy secrets reputation and family Wigand revealing startling facts and starts a new career teaching chemistry. But Bergman faces further complications. His TV Network refuses to air the segment because they could be sued big time for helping break Wigand's confidentiality agreement.You pay me to go get guys like Wigand to draw him out. To get him to trust us to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fg confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue maybe the biggest mostexpensive corporatemalfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand who's out on a limb does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells the worse it gets explains Bergman.The dialogue is one of the brightest most thoughtprovoking material in the film. All of the little quirks in typical conversation are captured the stuttering the spontaneous explicit declaratives and the sharp remarks that add a scathing zest to the character's personalities Agent Do you have a history of emotional problems Mr. Wigand? Wigand Yes. Yes I do. I get extremely emotional when s put bullets in my mailbox!.The movie's dramatic premise is so clear so precise so uncommonly absorbing. It expresses the true stress and nature of the traumatic emotions of the characters. There is also an excellent introduction of both Wigand and Bergman giving them depth and human dimension. Despite a few members of my cinema discussion group disagree I extensively enjoyed the piercing middleeastern soundtrack consisting of awkward beats and fitting tones.Al Pacino is cautious not to steal scenes from costar Russell Crowe but when his time comes he lets out a stark and involving performance. Crowe is worthy of his Oscar nomination for best actor he delivers a performance of great subbtlness but with an intense underlying tone of innovative depth and power. He captures all of the little tensions and stresses of his character making his scenes involving subversive and taut.Michael Mann is the film's director who also directed the 1995 thriller Heat starring Val Kilmer Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Here he pays close attention to details when a character pushes numbers on a pay phone the camera captures the feelingalso hitting golf ball against a backdrop dropping glasses on a table and notably in an intense scene where two people fax each other important statements and questions. Mann also injects effective camera angles complete with slow motion photography taking the view of the character and close up shots.The Insider inhabits a strong social message dealing with the influence of television reputation honesty and so forth. The biggest ethic I think Mann is trying to get across is of modern morality always do the right thing follow you conscience no matter what the cost. Then there's the film's most provoking issue Fame has a fifteenminute halflife. Infamy lasts a little longer.".

Al Pacino as the TV show producer Lowell Bergman Russell Crowe as the whistleblower and tobacco scientist Dr. Jeffrey Wiegand and Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace all are riveting in their performances. They are intense characters as are many of the supporting characters in this involving film.There is little action in here but a ton of tension in the first hour of this long 158 min. film. The story held my interest even when the tension left thanks to the acting the great cinematography involving music score....well just about everything. It's simply a welldone movie similar to Mann's Heat except without the violence.The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias but that's not surprising being it's about 60 Minutes. I wasn't surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot for example. This film bias could have been a lot more blatant so I'm not complaining. Obviously they went a overboard in their stand against the tobacco industry repeating the same damaging scenes over and over. However I appreciated they didn't shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program.Photographer Dante Spinelli did an incredible job making this look fantastic despite the fact that there was no great scenery or exotic sets.

Michael Mann known for classics such as Heat and The Last of the Mohicans has collected immense amount of testimonies news reports and transcripts of 60 Minutes regarding the case and with some help from Eric Roth of Forest Gump and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button fame wrote a screenplay for The Insider. With its length that stretches far beyond two hours and everything said so far it is true that this is not a movie for every type of audience. But to think even for a moment that this movie is slow and boring would be an enormous mistake. Somewhat controversial and omnipresent topic about the power of corporation business and money over information and truth is masterfully crafted into an intense flick.Al Pacino and Russel Crowe are absolutely sensational in their main roles. Pacino is completely at home playing a witty persistent and passionate journalist Lowell Bergman while Crowe being 33 at the time simply dominates in his Oscar nominated role of Jeffrey Wigand an erratic chemist in his early 50's whose life is getting more and more out of hand during the whole movie. With great support from we can say an ensemble cast of supporting actors of whom even the ones who are least known to wider audiences are doing an excellent job and with the two Academy Awards winners we mentioned above the movie nails its main goal and represents the two main themes extremely well.On the one hand we have a great representation of often disregarded importance of investigative journalism in a world of capitalism. Numerous and serious obstacles faced even by an adept journalist of great reputation when dealing with a delicate story are masterfully presented as well. On the other hand we have a thorough realistic and detailed story of a scientist who has to abandon his ideals of improving the environment and life of a man in general in order to provide for his family. The magic of the whole thing is the fact that the movie does an outstanding job of showing the audience why after a hard an unfair defeat while trying to get the truth out in the open in the moments of despair we don't have the right to stop and we mustn't give up.All of this is crowned with Michael Mann's directing. He has an incredible eye for detail and the ability to hold a viewer's attention even in those seemingly slow and boring parts of the movie by making a hypnotizing atmosphere just by accenting some sound effect like rustling of leafs on a light wind for example.91100".

In 99.99 of the cases the answer is not very far not when your job your family and your life is on the line.The Insider a 1999 film directed by Michael Mann dramatizes the true story of two men who stopped at nothing to get out their story  Jeffrey Wigand Russell Crowe and Lowell Bergman Al Pacino though they are thwarted every time they turn around.Michael Mann assembled a stellar cast  besides Crowe and Pacino there is Christopher Plummer playing Mike Wallace Diane Venora as Wigand's wife Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife Colm Feore as a Mississippi attorney Gina Gershon as the CBS attorney Michael Gambon as Thomas Sandefur the head of Brown  Williamson Tobacco Philip Baker Hall as Don Hewitt and some Broadway people including Roger Bart and Lynne Thigpen.Jeffrey Wigand was a whistleblower on his former employer Brown  Williamson claiming that the company was aware that nicotine was addictive and was using a carcinogen called coumarin in their cigarettes though the seven dwarfs as Wigand called them the big seven tobacco companies all had lied in hearings about nicotine being addictive.That's only part of the story. Wigand loses everything in his attempt to tell the truth  he is fired from his job he has to sell his house his family is terrorized until his wife and children finally leave him a smear campaign is started against him he is slapped with restraining orders threatened with arrest his computer is confiscated. And then the worst cut of all  60 Minutes decides not to air the interview after pressure from the CBS Corporation. Tobacco it seems with its billions of dollars can do whatever it takes to silence someone.Lowell Bergman realizing that his source has been left out to dry goes to bat for him in order to get the interview aired and turns the tables on CBS risking his own career and relationships with people with whom he has worked for years. He finds out along the way what these people were made of  not much. In the end Wallace cares only about his career and legacy and Don Hewitt bows to CBS. Bergman wins by playing the ultimate hardball and humiliating 60 Minutes.This is a long film but a very gripping story. It takes its time to build instead of rushing the drama without fleshing out the characters. By the end of the film we know who all of these people are.I remember seeing this in the theater. It was very powerful in 1999 and it's even more powerful today. Why? Because I think there are way fewer Wigands and Bergmans in the world than there were 11 years ago and it was a dwindling population then  people whose integrity is more important than money. In The Insider at least we get to meet two.".

To give an example the scene at the driving range is one of the longest and most unneeded scenes in film history. The entire scene could have been cut in half at least. As a movie fan I am all into long shots but this was ridiculous!!! The story was indeed intriguing but the way it was presented was nothing that needed to take 2 and a half hours of my time. I believe the actors did well with  what they were presented however and I cannot state this enough it was just way too slow and long!!!!".

Even supporting characters have memorable scenes and dialogue in this movie my favorite being the courtroom deposition of Wiegand Crowe. This movie provides intensity on so many levels. There is action not shootouts or car chases... suspense heroism depression hope  you name it. There is abundant complexity in the plot especially in regard to Wiegand being pushed to the edge of sanity. Lisa Gerrard vocals is perfect as usual for adding drama and feeling.

My bias is that I kept thinking about we all already know of the movie's premise ... about the scumbucket tobacco industry.  We all know about the effect of tobacco on our lungs. Still I was hoping that the film would provide some plottwists out of an ordinary story.  But noooo .... it has to be about a depressed scientist who spends his time just trying to get away from the bad guys just because he is going to tell the world that tobacco kills. That's all there is to it. True story?  Yawn.  Al Pacino also looks like he needs to drink some coffee and freshen up  he looked so tired and uninteresting here.  Heck I never thought I would get tired of seeing Al Pacino but for the first time I did.This movie being a true story showed a lot of promise but unfortunately ended up being just too straight and simple for my tastes.  What is scary in real life doesn't mean that it's scary onscreen and vice versa.  I blame it on the director.

He is overcome by a wave of different emotions upset from different things. McLaglen handles all of this very well giving a startling realistic performance that is good enough to provide some compensation for Margot Grahame's overacting. However this is just the one character that is complex and fascinating. The supporting characters all are very thin and the romance between Foster and Angel adds nothing to the tale. Even so this is very effective filmmaking with some clever use of dissolve editing and a haunting music score by Max Steiner. It is overall quite an effective film about moral play desperation and responsibility.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gypo Nolan Victor McLaglen is as poor as anyone on Earth. Living in 1920s Ireland Gypo and his fellow Irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive Brits. One particular rebel wanted for murder by the English arrives back into town secretly. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo but the 20 reward proves too tempting. Gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile the other Irish rebels are searching for the informer. Right away Gypo with money burning a hole in his pocket is their main suspect but they who are his friends don't want to believe it. The story of The Informer is simple in its plot but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It's easily one of John Ford's most emotionally involving films. What Gypo did was wrong but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his sorry character and there's a lot of sympathy that arises for him. The script is very suspenseful as well. It's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end up so we have to grit our teeth and bear along with it. The acting is remarkable. Victor McLaglen who acted in many of Ford's films probably gave his best performance here and won an Oscar for it. Every other performer in the film deserves his or her kudos. In addition to an amazing script and acting The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionistic films. I love the darker side of Ford. In its mood as well as in its themes The Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford films The Long Voyage Home 1940 and The Fugitive 1948 it's also a bit similar to The Grapes of Wrath 1940 in these respects. 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gypo Nolan Victor McLaglen is as poor as anyone on Earth. Living in 1920s Ireland Gypo and his fellow Irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive Brits. One particular rebel wanted for murder by the English arrives back into town secretly. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo but the 20 reward proves too tempting. Gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile the other Irish rebels are searching for the informer. Right away Gypo with money burning a hole in his pocket is their main suspect but they who are his friends don't want to believe it. The story of The Informer is simple in its plot but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It's easily one of John Ford's most emotionally involving films. What Gypo did was wrong but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his sorry character and there's a lot of sympathy that arises for him. The script is very suspenseful as well. It's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end up so we have to grit our teeth and bear along with it. The acting is remarkable. Victor McLaglen who acted in many of Ford's films probably gave his best performance here and won an Oscar for it. Every other performer in the film deserves his or her kudos. In addition to an amazing script and acting The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionistic films. I love the darker side of Ford. In its mood as well as in its themes The Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford films The Long Voyage Home 1940 and The Fugitive 1948 it's also a bit similar to The Grapes of Wrath 1940 in these respects. 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "Victor McLaglen the title character of John Ford's THE INFORMER reminded me of the circus man from Fellini's LA STRADA.  Anthony Quinn played the brutish man who may have even been influenced by the pugfaced Oscarwinning performance given by McLaglen.  Povertystricken Dublin is the truelife atmospheric setting of the picture which takes place in 1922. Dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep Irish patriotism and the fight of the Irish Republican Army.  The conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes THE INFORMER tick. McLaglen's large simple character just wants to go to America and we're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently.  Two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken Irishman.  One is the previous the other a WANTED sign.  Should he do it and get the money to go?John Ford once famously said My name is Ford.  I make Westerns.  After seeing this film he obviously could do a heck of a lot more.  The serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about.  And the look of the piece is amazing consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable Ireland night.  Ford was always known for his luminescent gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters.  This is hard in color but he did it in pictures like THE SEARCHERS painting John Wayne in a sometimes vicious manner.  Victor McLaglen's performance not only benefits from the lighting but by the sheer simplicity of his acting.  He shoves a lot.  He knocks people out.  He is a brute who knows no better.  He should however know whether or not to cross the IRA.See the film to find out the gritty details.  See it also for McLaglen and Ford's patriotic portrayal of the IRA.  Max Steiner's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters placing more emphasis on them. This was usually only seen in silent films especially Chaplin.  The topic of naming names or informing is obviously still important.  Just look at how the media covered this year's Oscars giving much attention to the Elia Kazan scandal.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads of Clark Gable Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford wouldn't have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasn't. No split involved in his award.The movie and the story by Liam O'Flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in. He's down to his last pence and if he can't get back in wants enough for passage to America. There's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan constabulary and informs on McPhillip.The IRA is pretty anxious to find out who ratted McPhillip out and they're pretty certain it was McLaglen. He hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks. He does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek. He also picks up a hangeron played by J.M. Kerrigan.The whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning. Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller. Had it been done post World War II The Informer would have ranked as a great noir classic like Odd Man Out or the The Third Man which it bares a lot of resemblance to.John Ford knew this world very well. He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before having it anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan.Preston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest. He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril.The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court Meek ain't in a position to say no. The King's justice and writ does not run here. It graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary the British are indeed losing their grip on the population.Of course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect. Even as McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing.The Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time.".

This was one of the first movies that looks into the lives and organization of the IRAIrish Republic Army.  The Informer1935 is good at showing the poverty stricken Northern Ireland of the 1920's.Although John Ford has been making films since the early teens it is this movie that put his name on the map.  The Informer1935 along with The Searchers1956 are John Ford's most Catholic driven motion pictures as it deals with guilt and redemption.  John Ford was good at showing the lifestyles and values of many Irishmen in many of his work.  I Only wish that this movie was available on Home Video as it is hard to find.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe it's because I looked up the history of the Irish troubles in the 1920s and then the sad Civil War that engulfed the Free State after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie. Anyway the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes.Victor McLaglen isn't as famous today as he was back then and he should be better remembered. In this film I think he's playing himself as he would have been without his innate talent and brains. For example the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what McLaglen actually did in earlier years when he was a worldclass bareknuckles boxer. John Ford is partly responsible for that the IMDb trivia section shows how he tricked McLaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene. This director also could bring out a lot in his actors even without such tricks. Mostly though McLaglen is firmly in control especially when his character is almost totally blotto which is difficult for an actor to do believably and he also plays Gypo Nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen McLaglen later in his career in The Quiet Man. I especially like the contrast between this role as an IRA man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the IRA man Denis Hogan in Hangman's House. In The Quiet Man of course McLaglen is a country squire at odds with the local IRA. Victor McLaglen was big and bully in the oldfashioned sense of the word but he was a good actor too and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just wouldn't expect of a such a man today. It's a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices.Ford as usual packs a lot into a little bit of film. All the characters are excellent though the Commandant's mostly American accent is distracting  NOTE There be spoilers ahead!  Knowing that Gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk his way out of it instead we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing Gypo and the humanity he shows most notably when they go to take Gypo in Mary's room. John Ford really shows his genius here taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of Gypo and the other characters but of poor Ireland during that tortured time.".

The same is true for The Informer which is on occasion very dreadful indeed and yet it boasts splendid photography some fine acting a wonderful score and a good decent simple story. In the end which I won't give away politics religion and psychology come together in a church in such a way as to make the scene seem corny and over the top and yet so is life sometimes. Uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us presumably brilliant modern folks and the scene isn't so much unbelievable I buy it but I know the Irish as embarrassing. Yet people do behave that way they do say things like that. Not everyone is hip and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip.

	schema:reviewBody "One of John Ford's best films 'The Informer' doesn't feature any grand scenery of the American West. Instead the intense drama Ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglen's face. The former prizefighter who once faced Joe Louis in the ring delivers an Academy Awardwinning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life.The plot is gracefully simple In 1922 Dublin a starving and humiliated man who's been thrown out of the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood himself becomes an informant. For 20 he betrays a friend to the Tans and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt denial selfpity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions. It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the film's most impressive achievement. In most movies a burly lout of Gypo's type would be cast as the heavy he'd have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown. In 'The Informer' Gypo himself is both hero and villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience.Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929 RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar 'The Informer' also won John Ford his first along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score.".

I suppose it's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the lessthanseamless transition that was being made from the silents to the talkies  the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. Of course title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times. What dialogue there is usually has a They're always after me Lucky Charms! quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course as bad as they are the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. It feels as if with an eagle eye you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.Techniques change. Tastes change. So I won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day. But it's not one of the classics that hold up  more just fair warning about the kind of oversimplified malarkey to which Ford was going to devote his career.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Informer is a lyrical and rather artsy reimagining of Liam O'Flaherty's grim novel of betrayal set during the Irish troubles of the 1920's. Coproducer and director John Ford co producer Cliff Reid and screenwriter Dudley Nichols pared down the original considerably and brought out what they saw as its essence  the struggle of one Gypo Nolan with his conscience fought out not only within his own stunted brain but through interactions with various characters who were also simplified and sanitized the better to direct our attention to the tormented title character. This modernday Judas tale retains some of the power of the Biblical antecedent. A desperate former member of a revolutionary organization betrays a fugitive comrade to the police for what seems to him a grand sum of money. The comrade is killed the informer is paid the money is worthless the moment he acquires it. The realization of what he has done prompts him to drown his consciousness in liquor and get rid of the ill gotten gain in whatever haphazard way he can. Representing the slummy underworld of Dublin are stage sets by Van Nest Polglase that suggest drabness meanness and poverty in a movie studio way. The slum dwellers are presented as alternately rowdy and pious with little in between. Many of the characters in the original novel were so decayed and sordid that mainstream movie studios would not have been able to put them on screen intact. The politics of the organization which the title character betrays are kept nebulous and generic. In the novel it was actually a communist cell within the Irish national movement  but that might have given audiences too much to think about. The character of Dan Gallagher chief of the local revolutionary group who investigates whether Gypo is guilty is played boringly and stiffly by Robert Preston. To be fair the part is underwritten. Gallagher a diehard communist revolutionary who can't quite understand what makes himself tick is just as complex as Nolan but from page to screen loses his human nature and is reduced to the handsome romantic love interest to the sister of the betrayed man. The subsidiary members of the organization are presented in the vein of Hollywood gangster's sidekicks ciphers with interesting faces instead of fullblown conflicted individuals whose lives and traits would hold our interest. There is plenty of action all of it expertly choreographed to breathe life into what might have otherwise been stagy and static for there is a great deal of talk in the source material.The title character in the book was damaged goods ravaged by hunger bruised and beaten by cops unwashed unschooled. As embodied by Victor McLaglen he comes across more like a wellfed dock worker with bad manners. The scenarists try to make up for this whitewashing of the main character by showing him drinking whiskey as if it's Kool Aid and tossing annoying people around in the manner of the Frankenstein monster like rag dolls. Both tendencies are in the novel but here they are exaggerated. It is simply impossible to believe that someone could drink so much hard liquor in one night without becoming violently ill or passing out cold. True he does fall asleep on his girlfriend's floor toward the end but more in the way of a nap than the kind of blackedout unconsciousness that should have occurred under the circumstances. As for Katie the woman in Gypo's life Margot Grahame is far too scrubbed and attractive for this setting. Her relationship with Gypo is changed from a crude interdependence based on brute survival needs to a more conventional Hollywood loving couple arrangement which really makes no sense in the context of the narrative. Although prostitution is presented more frankly here than in most movies of the era it still had to be gauzed over. As the slain fugitive's mother Una O'Connor is on hand with her trademark howling  a waste of her talents.The Informer was considered very strong stuff back in 1935. It's more of a curiosity today.".

It's a trial to watch with some of the dialog so over the top into cornball territory that you won't know whether to laugh or cry. The script has a simplistic view of the Irish Rebellion of 1922 and their troubles and the film's ending is more laughable than poignant.McGlaglen is either tipsy or staggeringly drunk through the entire performance much as he is in many a John Ford filmexcept that here he was an awarded an Oscar for his performance. I suppose it's an Irish trait that can't be deniedbut Ford's insistence on magnifying the drinking habits of his traitorous protagonist gets a bit wearisome before the story is half told. By today's standards not the classic it once was. The soundtrack makes scant use of Max Steiner's score which won an Oscar as did John Ford's direction.".

I'm really not sure which side Ford was on because the film makes you think about both sides and what the outcome should be. For me personally I felt sorry for McLaglen and didn't want anything bad to happen to him. I understood the rebels side of things but at the same time I found that they were pretty hypocritical and I wonder if Ford was going after this as well especially since the movie ends in a Church. I haven't read any books on Ford so again I'm not sure which side he was on but the movie certainly makes you think about everything you've watched. McLaglen is downright brilliant in his role and I'd say this is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. The rage sadness and confusion he brings to this character is quite startling to watch. The supporting cast is very good as well and features strong performances by Heather Angel Preston Foster Margot Grahame Joe Sawyer and Donald Meek. Wallace Ford and Uno O'Connor both are good in their small roles. Ford's direction is top notch as he perfectly captures the mood and feeling of the story. The cinematography is also terrific and really puts you in the setting. This is a rather unique little film that works on many levels.".

Although the way their marriage ends is revealed to us in the opening sequence making the rest of the film a flashback a technique with which Bergman is already familiar with when the movie reaches its final scene one can't help but be extremely moved by the way things end up. Once again the performances are great and it is clear that these actors open up their own private world for all of us to see and they can do that simply because they feel comfortable with a director like Bergman. They know they are in safe hands. Victor Sjostrom definitely steals the show and Bergman will work with him again in Wild Strawberries but it is the face of MajBritt Nilsson Marta that will remain in your mind for a long time. Already in these early films of his the Swedish master shows his love for closeups. He likes to diminish the distance between the audience and the actors especially their faces sharing the belief that not only their eyes but also the texture of their skin can reveal to us a whole lot of things about the characters. After all close ups are one of the great advantages of cinema that have ultimately become one of the most characteristic building blocks of this art form and Bergman working simultaneously in the theatre is very much aware of that. Although the extreme close ups are easier to notice and admire Bergman has also a great arsenal of shots and camera movements that so easily uses in this film. The shots of the orchestra performing either from high above or through the musicians shows a camera that can move constantly but also in a discreet and one could say abstract way. He also proves to be very capable with miseenscene as deepfocus long takes are used in several scenes. The use of music is also notable as you will definitely see for yourselves in the remarkable montage sequence in the ending. Classical music is of course common in the director's filmography but it follows certain stages that are worth mentioning. In his first period in which To Joy is definitely included Bergman uses pieces performed by large orchestras grandiose in a way. And it's certainly no coincidence that in these films a great number of characters are used for narrative purposes surely Stig are Marta are in the foreground but there's also the conductor Sonderby the mistress and her old husband Marcel and a few others. But from early 60's on begins a period in which Bergman uses music of a smaller scale especially string quartets and in these films very few characters are introduced to us and very often in an isolated place e.g. Through a Glass Darkly Silence Persona. If you watch carefully this film you will see many signs of what Ingmar Bergman is going to evolve to. His dramatic approach in human relationships and his effort to capture those moments between two heartbeats between two lovers. But also his realistic point of view especially when it comes to marriage as Scenes From a Marriage a good 20 years after will confirm. A very good film.".

	schema:headline " to the joy of Bergman and combining drama and music";
	schema:reviewBody "Ingmar Bergman's seventh film To Joy is actually a fairly bitter film more often than not in looking at the destructiveness of a marriage between two people who somehow got stuck with each other to fall in love. And yet there are some moments that are quite joyful or at least in the terms that Bergman will allow from time to time and they help ring this as less a total work of despair than an examination of 'average' people who can't stand not having more. Stig Stig Olin and Marta MajBritt Nilsson meet as they're both musicians in an orchestra conducted by Snderby Victor Sjostrom. She's the only woman in the orchestra but it's not exactly that they have love at first sight in the slightest. Their connection grows following a party where Stig gets drunk and makes a depressing grandstanding fool of himself in front of friends and somehow his downbeat manner is charming to Marta. Soon they grow closer even fall in love perhaps though their future marriage is complicated by Marta becoming pregnant. This scene when she reveals it three months on to Stig is the first real crack in the relationship. It only cracks more with the occasional patchup and the question stands more or less as Stig is looking back on the relationship following his wife and one of his child's deaths is what could have come from all of this? Bergman deals with his characters at this stage in his career in trying to just find the simple and really not very simple truths of what Stig and Marta are together and separate. For the first half it almost looks like Stig is a bit too twodimensional particularly for a Bergman film and Olin doesn't play him extremely well even if he does deliver the beats fairly well perhaps in line with his own character's inadequacies. He can't seem to enjoy anything that he does because he always wants more to be a supreme soloist than to have what he already has gotten. Marta on the other hand after having several potential men before going with Stig tries her best to cope with having two kids that she probably wasn't totally thrilled to have in the first place. There's a great little scene where Sanderby recounts walking in on Stig and Marta after having some kind of odd tender moment as well as later on after having a quarrel without them noticing Sanderby walk in and the expression still underneath their faces when he formally walks in. In typical Bergman fashion we see the disintegration of a relationship quite a brutal argument in bed really more of emotional violence than physical even if the sort of 'patchingup' period towards the end is a little weaker than what's come before.So on the one hand there is this aspect the drama of two people having a constant pushandpull tie that binds them through Stig's delusions of grandeur and selfpity and fear manifesting in other forms notably into the arms of another woman and Marta's own semihelplessness which is very good if imperfect as classic Bergman storytelling. On the other hand it's also one of the best examples of classical music being used as incidental music there's not exact musical score like if we hear music accompanying the characters giving the emotional cues during an argument scene or when Sanderby offers advice or gets irritated at Stig but rather the music of Sanderby's orchestra and Sjostrom I might add is pitchperfect in the role of the weathered and brilliant secondbanana conductor fills in the spaces at times of the emotional context. Probably the most successful and joyful scene is when Stig finds out Marta has the baby by running out quick during a rehearsal the music going along as he's on the phone then continuing as he sits back down and as Sanderby asks quietly of one musician who asks another to another to Stig what happened as the music plays on. This plus the second greatest cinematic interpretation of Beethoven's 9th symphony 4th movement in a climax the first being Clockwork Orange make To Joy worth seeing all by itself if only for Beethoven fans.As one of the several films included on the recently released Eclipse DVD series To Joy will appeal to fans of Bergman's knack at telling of characters in shattered honest romance and to those looking for some classical music bliss and have seen The Magic Flute or Autumn Sonata too many times.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the plot of this film is rather simple  a man reflecting on the good and bad times that he had with his wife  it is handled well by Bergman who gives the film an interesting audio and visual side including creative editing changes and at least one meaningful aerial shot early on the piece. The protagonist and his wife are concert musicians and in the first few scenes and in some later on nonoriginal music is used superbly to coincide with the action on screen. There are however a few concerts scenes that may have been better had they been trimmed in length as seeing a whole concert performed is not necessary in the story. Although the film is mostly a series of memories there is also one is illjudged point in which a character other than the protagonist starts to narrate events which is not possible in the way the story is told. Also there is room to complain about the film being a bit too literal but there is hardly reason to concentrate on the drawbacks of the film when it is such a delight to watch and so well done where it is well done. Victor Sjstrm as the maestro delivers fine support and the film is an excellent example of great visual storytelling. In the years after this Bergman would go on to direct more complex films that would require more skill on his behalf but this early entry still stands up fairly well even if not up to the standard of some of his latter work. The final sequence is especially well done both in how it uses music and in the contrast that it has to the first scene in which the man's son is seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this review I want to discuss the main theme of To Joy as I see it and compare it with The Cranes are Flying 1957 of which I was vividly reminded whilst watching To Joy. To make the comparison spoilers for both films are necessary so do not read if you have not seen either film.Imagine trying to decipher this complicated secret language that two lovers develop and talk uninhibited. I think this was Sondersby's the orchestral conductor line and it seems to be the major theme of the film the secret language of lovers in a relationship. A language that can be captured in music but not by sight. Many of the reviews mention their dislike of Stig the husband and indeed he is not an especially sympathetic character who we the audience know little about to help 'explain' or 'understand' him. But it seems unfair to demonise him within his relationship and marriage to Marta. We as an audience see and hear what occurs between them yet we are outside the language of love which includes pain and hatred that envelops the two. From the outside in Stig is not intelligible to us as he is to Marta. Or vice versa.Unlike her he seems to have been ambitious and with a desire to be an artist of repute. She seems more content to be part of an orchestra and later part of a marriage. He struggles to have and retain a separate identity throughout the film. This becomes increasingly difficult with the arrival of two children in his marriage with Marta. The reality hits home that he might never be the man he dreamt of becoming and he expresses this by having an affair with a woman herself married who admires him from afar whilst Marta loves him very near. There is a grubbiness in Stig's affair as implied by the behaviour of cuckolded husband and lecherous voyeuristic tenant that is absent from his marriage to Marta. In the marriage there is a clarity and crispness of something pure in feeling even when the feeling is antagonistic.The film felt full of tension and pathos and I felt for both of them in their difficulties. The dialogue between them was great at once melancholic but with a subtle invective that served to wound each other more. The cruelest moment occurred when Marta criticised Stig after he slapped her around the face. She takes responsibility for her actions but says she will never forgive Stig whose momentary violence gives way to remorse and the painful realisation that he will not be forgiven and his wife is filled with contempt for him. Is this not a classic moment in relationships When one feels the everlasting pain they have either caused or nursed in their relationship and the residue with which it coats everything that follows? Moments like this during the film made me sit up and pay attention to the truth of a reality unfolding on the screen.Yet in spite of all this there was enough beauty and majesty in the relationship of Stig and Marta as in the music to remind me of the love story of Boris and Veronika in The Cranes are Flying. It helped that the actresses who played Marta and Veronika were darkhaired and darkeyed as seen in the many closeups of their faces. The character of Stig was no Boris by any means but the love and joy when it was just there without sorrow or recriminations was similar in both cinematic relationships. And of course both films end with a character mourning the death of the other. Each bereaved partner has an emblematic toy of the nowdead loved one For Stig it was the bear he gave Marta as his first present for Veronika it is the squirrel Boris left her when he departed for war. Ultimately Stig and Veronika reach through their mourning to a joy which is present beyond laughter or happiness as per Sonderby's closing description of joy. For Stig that joy is present in playing music for his son. For Veronika it is celebrating the end of war and the return of many who survived to be reunited with family and loved ones. In each case their love of another has given them something a type of joy that cannot be eradicated by death. Both Stig and Marta surrender to joy. In The Cranes are Flying Veronika's surrender is shown in beautiful black and white photograph with shots that pan up and down as she gives away her flowers. In To Joy Stig's surrender is played out to the music of Beethoven performed by the orchestra of which he is and Marta was a part.My second favourite Bergman film after Wild Strawberries.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Joy part by the way refers to Beethoven's Ode to Joy from the Ninth Symphony. It pops up twice once near the beginning and the other time at the end. It's hard to figure out where this film is aiming. The leading man is unpleasant in every way. He is completely selfcentered selfinvolved and pessimistic. His wife on the other hand is everything good he is not. And yet the film doesn't necessarily follow through on her character. There are some big payoffs though. It's always a joy pun intended to see Victor Sjostrom on screen. He would appear later in Bergman's Wild Strawberries again as an old man. This time he's an orchestral conductor who gets to know the two young protagonists over the years. They are both musicians. The husband is chasing after fame on stage and the film makes his lack of real talent painfully obvious. The musical excerpts are quite extraordinary. What you see is actually what you hear! Hollywood could pick up on something here  big time. Again Sjostrom's job as conductor is impeccable. A lot of work went into this. The symmetry is also wonderful with the last images matching the first. And after all the Ode to Joy doesn't arrive until the end of Beethoven's last symphonyCurtis Stotlar".

The characters are not as dimensional or compelling in their realism like in the best of Bergman's films Marta can be seen as too perfect and Stig is not an easy person to like at all. However the acting is very good. Stig Olin and MajBrit Nilsson give strong performances but Victor Sjostrom gives the best performance. As ever with Bergman To Joy is superbly directed while the script is thoughtful and the film itself is beautifully shot. The story is intriguing and paced well and there are some good themes that are well done they were written even more compellingly in Bergman's later films. The music is amazing and utilised beautifully. Overall one of the better Bergman films if not among his better overall ones. 810 Bethany Cox".

He has an incredibly inflated view of his abilities. When he gets his opportunity to solo he blows it but of course none of it is his fault. He becomes involved with Marta who is herself a complex being. He is known for his embarrassing behavior like he exhibits at her birthday party. But still she finds in him something that leads to their getting married. Her pregnancy derails things for a while but they fall back together. Meanwhile he begins to see a beautiful young woman the wife of a much older man and friend. He really is a cad and even though things are going so well he can't handle a settled situation. Eventually this involvement with a mistress becomes too much for the couple. She gets fed up and he regresses to his tight little self centered world. At some point he sees that there is more to life than wandering around in the pits and they are reunited. We already know the ending because the whole thing is done in flashback. There is stunning cinematography lovely closeups black and white images that translate emotionally. Bergman seemed to be a master from the very beginning of his career.".

Bergman seemed to revel in exploring the depressing and banal aspects of lifeand this film is swimming in it! So if you are looking for a happy film avoid this one at all cost! But if you can appreciate the masterful direction then it's well worth seeing.The film begins as a musician learns that his wife was just burned to death and his daughter burned terribly. As I said it's NOT a happygolucky film! The film then looks backwardseven years ago when the two joined the orchestra and began a relationship. It's interesting how adult all this iseven for a European film. Premarital sex cohabitation abortion and adultery are all discussed during the course of the film. Some of this is very good and I could appreciate it but some also seemed in a deliberate effort to get the viewer to dislike the leading man Stig Olin. He was a thoroughly selfabsorbed artist who seemed to think that brooding and selfishness were necessary for the artistic temperament. As for his wife MajBritt Nilsson she put up with hell from this man through much of the filmand it was hard to see why. Now I can respect the film for being this daring but it also makes the film a tough sell as most people just don't want to see films where it's so difficult to care about the characters. But on the other hand their acting and direction are so nice you cannot just dismiss the film.By the way one of Bergman's favorite actors Victor Sjstrm is in the film in a great role as a gruff old conductor. At first he's easy to dislikebut over time you see his character grown and morph into a guy who really helped give color to this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not one of Bergman's better films perhaps understandably so as he was still in the earliest stages of his career. The main problem is with the script and characters which focus on the relationship between a frustratingly subservient woman MajBritt Nilsson and her selfish scumbag for want of a better word husband Stig Olin.Judging by this film and Summer Interlude which was made the following year Bergman appears to have chosen Nilsson to play beautiful young women who deserve much better but instead fall for annoying young men especially so in the character of Stig in this film played fairly unconvincingly by Olin. Nilsson on the other hand is very good.Olin's character spends the first part of the film whining and complaining making the viewer wonder what on earth Marta Nilsson sees in him. He then spends the rest of the film mostly illtreating and disregarding her which then leaves us asking why she puts up with it all.Stig is a thoroughly selfish unpleasant character who happily lies down and accepts his wife's offer to make tea and a sandwich as she goes into labour attends an orchestra rehearsal instead of being with her as she gives birth is unfaithful to her and then beats her when she finally confronts him about it.This outdated depiction of marriage is finally complete as Marta honestly blames herself for provoking her husband into repeatedly striking her.Perhaps this was convincing stuff 60 years ago but the portrayal of a young woman who is prepared to give so much yet accept so little in return just doesn't ring true today.Their subsequent reconciliation towards the end of the film seems artificial and tacked on purely as a means of building up to an emotional but as it turned out overly sentimental climax.I found it impossible to feel any sympathy for the husband at the end of the film so Bergman's attempts to move his audience just didn't work for me. One feeling I did get as the film ended was a reminder of the very similar way Beethoven's 9th Symphony was used at the end of A Clockwork Orange. This could have even been a direct reference by Kubrick.The similarity was so strong that I was half expecting Stig's son to turn to us and say 'I was cured alright' as the camera moved in on him in the final shot.".

Inexperienced Eddie turns to the only other married one among the bunch electronics salesman and music aficionado Shrevie for advice he who may not be the best person from who to ask advice on marriage since he doesn't yet realize that he probably got married to his wife Beth for the wrong reasons. Indeed Beth who has lost her sense of identity is unhappy in their marriage and contemplates having an affair with someone who provides what she believes is a sympathetic shoulder. Hairdresser and law school student Boogie is the player of the bunch ...";

Friends are not friends by just saying nice things to each other rather because they have shared their adolescent lives with one another and the realization of adulthood sparks an indispensable fondness all of the major characters in the film mutually share!! At a glance someone may perceive this film to be a movie version of Happy Days...but the intense and poignant performances of all the characters in the film particularly Steve Guttenberg's makes anyone who sees this movie wonder if maybe it would have been nice to live in Baltimore in 1959!!!Usually there is a pejorative interpretation of the term IMMATURE but in this film it establishes a social cohesiveness that reflects the enviable naivety of the times!!!...Everybody recognizes everyone else's preventable flaws...The proverbial friendship safety net which perennially prevails throughout this entire film makes them feel very fortunate because they know that their lives are not perfect!!!..Their precociousness resonates itself to a bittersweet comedy and is advocated as such since comedy is limitless because so too is human error...Evaluating the actors in the movie it is simply incredible!! Steve Guttenberg is Police Academy King!! Tim Daley in the hit show Wings He seemed to understand that role perfectly!!

What the movie has is a very honest portrayal of a group...of guys that people relate to on a very personal level. The different generations of viewers react to film with devotion and recognition and Diner has become one of the beloved long time cult favorites. Based on its writerdirector's memories of growing up in Baltimore the film takes place during the week between Christmas and New Year in 1959 and tells of the friendship of five guys in their early twenties. During the course of the film we will get to know the young men their fears of growing up facing responsibilities and making decisions their fascination and insecurities with the girls.From his Oscarnominated script BL makes the study of young men who hesitate to grow up but rather hang out in their beloved Diner. Daniel Stern's 'Shrevie' is an owner of LP collection that he seems to value more than his young and pretty wife Ellen Barkin in her film debut. Mickey Rourke played his best role at least IMO as Boogy the cynical womanizer with the most charming smile. Steve Guttenberg's Eddie puts his fiance through the enormously difficult football quiz and the passing score is the must for the marriage because he is scared to get married. Kevin Bacon plays Fenwick a permanently drunk and lost kid the character much darker than the rest of the guys. Timothy Daly is Bill who seems to be the most successful of the bunch and know what he wants but can't make the girl he loves to love him. By making Diner Levinson actually put his native city sleepy and provincial 1959 Baltimore on the cinema map and that's just one of movie's pleasures. And there are plenty. Diner is filled with authentic and believable scenes situations and conversations that everyone can relate to. The Diner's menu has a lot to offer to the grateful viewers and fans of the insightful ironic entertaining small but bright and shiny gem. Barry Levinson does not flatter six protagonists but he understands them and loves them because he sees in them the indelible part of his own life his experiences and his own childhood friends. As another great film about childhood friendship says I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus does anyone? Barry Levinson went on to create many good and very good films after Diner. These are just a few The Natural Good Morning Vietnam Bugsy Avalon Sleepers An Everlasting Piece Disclosure Wag the Dog and his Oscar winner Rain Man but Diner will always have a very special place for me.

	schema:headline " Coming of Age in Fifties Baltimore";
	schema:reviewBody "Recent films set in the 1950s such as 'Pleasantville' 'Far from Heaven' and 'Mona Lisa Smile' have tended to portray the decade as being a repressed overly conservative period. A generation ago however the tendency was to take a more sympathetic nostalgic look at the fifties in films such as 'Grease' or television programmes such as 'Happy Days'. The postVietnam generation seemed to look back at the period immediately before that war as a lost age of innocence. 'Diner' follows a group of young men from Baltimore former school friends now in their early twenties over a week of their lives that between Christmas Eve and New Year 1959. Some of them are still living and working in the town others are now at college but are using the Christmas vacation as a chance to get back together with old friends. The title is taken from the diner that is their favourite meetingplace. There is no real coherent plot the film is very episodic in structure and concentrates on character rather than on action. As is perhaps inevitable with young men of this age many of their preoccupations are with girls and relationships. One of them Shrevie is married but seems to be discontented with married life. Another Eddie is engaged. A third Billy discovers during the course of the film that he has got his girlfriend pregnant but when he offers to do the decent thing by her he is disconcerted to realize that she would much rather he did the indecent one. A fourth Boogie seems to lead a carefree life flitting from one romance to another. The characters are not however preoccupied with love and sex to the exclusion of all else. We also learn about their other private obsessions with such matters as music sport and the cinema. Shrevie quarrels with his wife because she does not share his passion for popular music and fails to understand his complex system for cataloguing his extensive record collection. I wonder if this scene was the origin of a similarly obsessive character in 'High Fidelity'. Eddie's passion for sport is even more allconsuming than Shrevie's for music he subjects his fiance Elyse to a football quiz and threatens to break off the engagement if she cannot score a sufficiently high score. A minor character knows off by heart the entire dialogue from the film 'Sweet Smell of Success'.Many of the young actors who starred in the film have gone on to become famous names in the movie world. From my point of view the best was probably Kevin Bacon as Timothy the rebel without a cause who has dropped out of his wealthy family and lives an aimless life. The first time we see him he is smashing windows just for the hell of it. I was however also impressed by Daniel Stern as Shrevie and Mickey Rourke as Boogie. I have never been to Baltimore but it was clear from watching the film that the director was trying to capture the spirit of a particular place and time. It therefore came as no surprise to discover that Barry Levinson who both wrote and directed the film is himself a Baltimore native although slightly younger than the characters depicted in the film. He would have been seventeen in 1959. Despite this concentration on the particular however 'Diner' has a universal appeal. The film with which it has most in common is 'American Graffiti'. Although that film was actually set in the early sixties rather than the fifties it nevertheless deals quite openly with the idea of the preVietnam era as a golden age. 'Diner' does not deal with this theme so overtly but there is still nevertheless a distinct sense of an era coming to an end. It is significantly set in the final week of a decade and in the wedding scene we see a large banner saying 'Eddie and Elyse in the sixties and forever' a reminder that change is on the way both for these young men and for America as a whole. The most important change that the characters in 'Diner' have to come to terms with is neither social nor political but rather the challenge of growing up. The traditional 'Coming of Age' film has tended to concentrate on adolescence and the teenage years. For many young men however their early twenties when they are completing or have already completed their education are setting out on their careers and are starting to think about more serious relationships with women can be a time of even greater changes than their days in secondary school. All the major characters except perhaps the seriousminded Billy who is keen to accept new responsibilities want to hang on to elements of their boyhood even while moving into adulthood. For Boogie and to an even greater degree Timothy this means keeping the freedom to be irresponsible. For Shrevie and Eddie this means trying to keep hold of their youthful passions even after marriage. The discord between Shrevie and his wife slightly older than him and considerably more mature in outlook is caused as much by his fear that marriage will mean having to give up his association with his old friends as by her inability to differentiate between jazz and rockandroll. Barry Levinson's claim that Elyse's football test was based on a true incident may seem improbable but there is some psychological truth in this part of the film. It has after all been said that every man's ideal woman is himself incarnated in the body of a beautiful girl and Elyse's willingness to take this test shows that she is prepared to make sacrifices and enter into Eddie's maleoriented world. 'Diner' is a film worth seeing more than once. On my first viewing I found it dull an inferior copy of 'American Graffiti'. The second time round I started to appreciate it as a fine film in its own right. Barry Levinson has gone on to make a number of other good films 'The Natural' 'Good Morning Vietnam' 'Rain Man' and 'Sleepers' but 'Diner' his first film is perhaps his most personal and heartfelt. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Note This review has been severely chopped to comply with IMDb's word limit. Full review can be found at wiredonmovies.comThere's not that much of a story really. What do we do? We drive around. Maybe he's going to get married maybe not. It's really more about the fact that it's a very honest portrayal of a group...of guys that people relate to on a very personal level.Kevin Bacon on the Diner DVD interview reelIn the opening scene of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs a handful of characters debate the true meaning of Madonna's hit song Like a Virgin. Long before Reservoir Dogs a decade to be exact there was Barry Levinson's directorial debut Diner a comingofage tale concerning five Baltimore residents in their 20s who try to get past crucial points in their lives. In a similar scene to that in Tarantino's masterpiece four friends  played by Steve Guttenberg Mickey Rourke Daniel Stern and Paul Reiser  argue over which singer produces better makeout music Mathis or Sinatra? Presley says Rourke's character ending the conversation with blunt confidence. And that's that.The movie has plentiful rich dialogue some of it seemingly pointless most of it subtly touching and meaningful. The film has a lot to say about the difference between friendship and true love. I love you one of the characters tells the woman he wants to marry. Fixated on an object behind him her eyes cold and a grim reflection of deep contemplation she replies You're confusing a friendship with a woman and love. It's not the same. In a very different sort of way it tackles the same material as When Harry Met Sally but it doesn't stop there.The film is masterful in its ability to present us with a group of people we sincerely care for and who all seem very real  more so than the characters you'll find in most movies. The dialogue was primarily improvised especially by Paul Reiser whose debates with fellow pals are the highlights of the film. Even after the truly poignant ending there is a discussion about evolution that plays over the credits. Did you hear about this evolution stuff? Reiser asks. He starts to mock the theories which would later become widely considered as truth by scientists despite lack of actual evidence supporting the theory. Amusing how the movie has so much to say about so many different things.Diner is a film that connects with us because we can all sympathize with its characters and their inner motivations. Eddie Guttenberg is afraid of getting married Schrezie Stern is married and wishes he wasn't Boogie Rourke would like to finally find a girl he could respect Bill Timothy Daly wants to get married to the girl he loves but she doesn't want to. The whole movie appears to be focused on girls and indeed most of it is yet there's a lot of other stuff that's even deeper. Fenwick Bacon is what Bacon himself described as a permanently drunk sick kid who doesn't know what he wants out of life thrown out of his family and wandering the streets looking for a meaning to his life. He's the character who is so lost he doesn't even seem to care very much about girls.Prior to Diner Levinson was a nobody  and perhaps that is why his first project is that most in tune with its characters and their natures. The movie was very risky when the studio released it in 1982  there was talk of shelving the finished product for fear of losing money. Reluctant MGM finally released the movie into theaters but with poor advertising  it tanked. Yet it received some of the greatest reviews of the year. In an effort to convince MGM Levinson showed a screening of the movie to critic Pauline Kael who gave it an exceptional review as did the majority of critics at that time. On the surface Diner seems rather boring  it's just a movie about nothing really except growing up. Yet it captured the hearts of many becoming a cult sleeper that still entices new fans to this very day.It's a film of many integrating mixed genres each one carefully balanced and perfectly maintained throughout. Diner has some of the best dialogue of all time not to mention a handful of Oscarworthy performances. This is not Levinson's best but it's one of his most deeply touching projects. It has a lot to say about many things and it actually gets around to addressing them  which is rare to find in any movie. This is a true gem.".

We drive around. Maybe he's going to get married maybe not. It's really more about the fact that it's a very honest portrayal of a group...of guys that people relate to on a very personal level.Kevin Bacon on the Diner DVD interview reelIn the opening scene of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs a handful of characters debate the true meaning of Madonna's hit song Like a Virgin. Long before Reservoir Dogs a decade to be exact there was Barry Levinson's directorial debut Diner a comingofage tale concerning five Baltimore residents in their 20s who try to get past crucial points in their lives. In a similar scene to that in Tarantino's masterpiece four friends  played by Steve Guttenberg Mickey Rourke Daniel Stern and Paul Reiser  argue over which singer produces better makeout music Mathis or Sinatra? Presley says Rourke's character ending the conversation with blunt confidence. And that's that.The movie has plentiful rich dialogue some of it seemingly pointless most of it subtly touching and meaningful. The film has a lot to say about the difference between friendship and true love. I love you one of the characters tells the woman he wants to marry. Fixated on an object behind him her eyes cold and a grim reflection of deep contemplation she replies You're confusing a friendship with a woman and love. It's not the same. In a very different sort of way it tackles the same material as When Harry Met Sally but it doesn't stop there.The film is masterful in its ability to present us with a group of people we sincerely care for and who all seem very real  more so than the characters you'll find in most movies. The dialogue was primarily improvised especially by Paul Reiser whose debates with fellow pals are the highlights of the film. Even after the truly poignant ending there is a discussion about evolution that plays over the credits. Did you hear about this evolution stuff? Reiser asks. He starts to mock the theories which would later become widely considered as truth by scientists despite lack of actual evidence supporting the theory. Amusing how the movie has so much to say about so many different things.Diner is a film that connects with us because we can all sympathize with its characters and their inner motivations. Eddie Guttenberg is afraid of getting married Schrezie Stern is married and wishes he wasn't Boogie Rourke would like to finally find a girl he could respect Bill Timothy Daly wants to get married to the girl he loves but she doesn't want to. The whole movie appears to be focused on girls and indeed most of it is yet there's a lot of other stuff that's even deeper. Fenwick Bacon is what Bacon himself described as a permanently drunk sick kid who doesn't know what he wants out of life thrown out of his family and wandering the streets looking for a meaning to his life. He's the character who is so lost he doesn't even seem to care very much about girls.Prior to Diner Levinson was a nobody  and perhaps that is why his first project is that most in tune with its characters and their natures. The movie was very risky when the studio released it in 1982  there was talk of shelving the finished product for fear of losing money. Reluctant MGM finally released the movie into theaters but with poor advertising  it tanked. Yet it received some of the greatest reviews of the year. In an effort to convince MGM Levinson showed a screening of the movie to critic Pauline Kael who gave it an exceptional review as did the majority of critics at that time. On the surface Diner seems rather boring  it's just a movie about nothing really except growing up. Yet it captured the hearts of many becoming a cult sleeper that still entices new fans to this very day.It's a film of many integrating mixed genres each one carefully balanced and perfectly maintained throughout. Diner has some of the best dialogue of all time not to mention a handful of Oscarworthy performances. This is not Levinson's best but it's one of his most deeply touching projects. It has a lot to say about many things and it actually gets around to addressing them  which is rare to find in any movie. This is a true gem.";

	schema:headline " Just say it! 'I want the roast beef sandwich!'";
	schema:reviewBody "Diner is a funfilled perfectly inspired comedydrama which is talented director Barry Levinson's first effort.  Needless to say there's no strong plot structure but when you have solid memorable characters like these that's not necessary.  Almost every one of these characters are memorable in their own ways.  Nobody steals the show.  The cast is highly spirited as I sensed great joy in their performances. The chemistry between the characters is very genuine and not surprisingly Barry Levinson made sure the actors got wellacquainted with each other before shooting.  I can tell Levinson based many of these scenarios on reallife situations. Scenes like these cannot be developed in the mind of some phony Hollywood hack screenwriter.  The nostalgia practically bleeds out the screen in his solid attention to detail.  And that's one of the reasons why this film works.  I can actually imagine Levinson sitting back and watching the film with a big smile chuckling intermittently as he reminisces back to moments from his adolescence.  When a director is joyful about his work that joy transfers to his audience.  One of the scenes in which that joy is most evident is when Daniel Stern's character throws a fit about his girlfriend Ellen Barkin wrongly categorizing his records and never asking him what's on the flip side?  Levinson obviously has a passion for the music of his time and rightfully so because a lot of great music comes from the 50's. And lucky for me the film's soundtrack is filled with many of those great tunes.      There are many memorable moments and lines of dialogue.  The football quiz is definitely something to be remembered.  But my favorite is the famous roast beef sandwich argument.  Paul Reiser asks Steve Guttenberg if that's a roast beef sandwich he's eating and Guttenberg can sense he wants a bite from the sandwich so he yells out Just say it!  'I want the roast beef sandwich!'  It's a brilliant Seinfeldtype scene which revolves around a banal subject but you can't help but be delightfully amused because let's fact itthe things we relate most to are the simple things in life.  Movies about politics can be interesting but what if you're not a politician or someone who doesn't give a damn about politics?  Eating is someone everyone can relate to.  Friendship is something everything can relate to.  And male bonding is something all men can relate to.  If Waiting to Exhale best demonstrates the strength of female bonding I feel this film best demonstrates the strength of male bonding.  I used to feel that women had a stronger bond since they're more affectionate and in touch with their feelings.  But when jealousy enters the equation even the most longterm friendship between two women can be butchered.  I've actually talked to several women who feel more comfortable with male friends and don't very much trust other women.  However guys stick together.  We may badmouth each other left and right and bust each other's chops but the bond remains the same.  Some females may interpret this is as a misogynistic film because other than Ellen Barkin's character there are no major or supporting female characters.  And Steve Guttenberg's wouldbe wife is never revealedat least her face is never shown.  But this is simply to stress the theme of male bonding not to show that women aren't important.Diner is a film for those who enjoy funny moving characterdriven nostalgia films with fine actors.  Hell even Mickey Rourke who I'm not a big fan of gives a fine threedimensional performance.  But everyone in the cast is worth praising in equal doses  Daniel Stern Paul Reiser despite his brief screen time Kevin Bacon Steve Guttenberg Tim Daly Ellen Barkin.  My score  8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " An Oscar!! What's That?";
	schema:reviewBody "Who realized that back in 1982 a film like Diner would possess such an extraordinary wealth of talent both on and off the screen. What was emphasized by this film's director Barry Levenson was the impetuousness with which this movie's actors and actresses had to orchestrate. So often during the film's production Barry did not even say ACTION to commence a scene. So many times would Levenson omit the word CUT for a scene to conclude. All of these non conventional actions by director Barry Levensonwere for purposes of manufacturing a tertiary spontaneity from the actors in the movie. Such an auspicious lack of inhibition sparked a natural emotional realism that made the film Diner truly unique! Many scenes brought on a free spirited innocence that prevailed back in Baltimore in 1959 The city and the year that this film was suppose to take place. The Popcorn Scene with Mickey Rourke was hysterically funny as it is indicative of the sordid wiles men will engage in to get the attention of a beautiful woman especially if it for purposes of impressing his close knit buddies!! The Piano Scene was one of the best scenes in any movie I have seen whatsoever!! Tim Daly's piano playing was a mandatory form of entertainment to break up the sedentary monotony of an ossified nightclub! The type of character Steve Guttenberg played was one which was very identifiable to me. I saw myself in Steve Guttenburg's character so many times in the movie but particularly in the Piano Scene. I could envision myself dancing recklessly in dare devil fashion while wearing Shetland wool! This was so Steve Guttenberg's character and it was so much like something I might do as well!! This film focused on the bittersweet scenario pertaining to the peculiar viewpoint by some barely adult men who had a penchant for believing that an individual's sense of humor should be his single most coveted attribute in the world. Such a mindset purveys the groundrules of survival being a case of how a human being's sense of humor should be endless because his egregious flaws as an individual are endless as well!! Diner accentuated the necessary dichotomy between social cohesiveness and individuality! Ultimately the film would bridge the gap with precocious candor. This itemization of quirky concepts accomplished a successfully ambiguous cultural dissemination of adolescent ideas with all the main characters of this movie. The incongruity contained in the conversations with everybody became a capriciously acute element to this film which successfully evoked a superbly unprecedented directorial finesse!! Diner did not win the academy award for best movie in 1982. When a movie wins an Oscar for best picture during any given year it is usually a very good film. When a film manifests a fondness for individual expression by establishing a reality on how people truly are by what they find amusing with that emanates the real definition of a comedy. If a movie can accomplish such a feat then this is an undeniably great film. Without question the film Diner' is a movie that may be put into this category!! A bevy of talented people partook in this movie. This box office bonanza of stars comprises of Mickey Rourke Steve Guttenberg Tim Daly Ellen Barkin Daniel Stern Kevin Bacon and Paul Reiser. Reiser's curiosity with the term nuance in this movie later surfaced itself to reality by way of a production company which was entitled Nuance Productions that Paul Reiser was part owner of. Given the fact that so many actors actresses directors and producers have 30000 square foot domiciles in Beverly Hills and on Park Avenue it becomes rather obvious that money is not always a top priority with them. Ultimately they realize that the purpose for making a movie is to raise the bar on entertainment standards. This encapsulation concerning man's sanguine flippancy about perpetual failure which this film Diner illustrated was totally astounding! More specifically put an integral facet of movie entertainment is predicated on accurately pinpointing what human nature is truly like. Often times I have thought that if you only want to see two movies in your entire life those two films should be Glengarry Glen Ross and Diner. Both movies capture a grass roots recognition of what people's attitudes and instinctive reactions really are. I would give the nod to Diner over Glengarry Glen Ross because Diner illustrates a realism which is portrayed with a far more positive disposition! Such a reality gives Diner an enthusiastic identifiability. Attaining a stranglehold on the positive elements of human intuition in a movie like Diner is a goal that is so crucial to a film! So much so that if a director does this but he does not win an Oscar for his film his response should be SO WHAT!! The movie Diner is a one of a kind gem! Diner has achieved the ultimate accolade of being a movie which ignites a humanistic gratification to a near perfect state! This film has artistically conquered an elementary objective for making a movie! Such an accomplishment is what film making is all about to which I have only one thing to say An Oscar!! What's that?".

This film was also very funny whether it was the popcorn scenethe football quizthe jail scene or Methan quoting his favourite film it's all there.Out of the five main guys in the film two of them really showed their talent and they were Mickey Rourke and Daniel Stern. After seeing this film I decided to give it an 8 out of 10 because I think it deserves that rating.Whoever said that this is a guy flick is terribly mistaken because I am a 15 year old girl and I really enjoyed it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Basically the interaction of five guys and one girl during the Christmas season of 19591960 in Balitimore Maryland Diner is somewhat autobiographical of directorwriter Barry Levinson identified as the character Billy Tim Daly in the film. Be sure and listen to the dialog spoken over the ending credits. It cleverly encapsulates the entire film. The movie is noteworthy for making stars of six new faces to the cinema public Steven Guttenberg Daniel Stern Mickey Rourke Kevin Bacon Timothy Daly and Ellen Barkin. Had it been created before American Graffiti it would have been the definitive coming of age flick. Coming nine years later it pales in the shadow of that seminal work. Still Diner is a worthwhile piece of cinema and is much more cerebral than American Graffiti. There are a few timeline problems. I too was finishing high school and preparing for college during the same time interval. Only I was located in rural America and the protagonists of Diner lived in an urban setting. Radio was AM and dominated by the top forty play list. Seldom were older rock 'n' roll songs played. Naturally there were no oldies stations yet. Teens basked in the audio heaven of the popular tunes of the day. The Diner soundtrack appropriately contains such hits of 195960 as Beyond the Sea Theme From a Summer Place and Goodbye Baby but also contains songs that were rarely if ever played on AM radio or on diner juke boxes in 195960 such as It's All In The Game Don't Be Cruel and Fascination. This all makes for one of the best 50's soundtracks ever but distracts from the credibility of the film setting.Teens of the period throughout American had a favorite gathering place or rendezvous. For me it was a local diner called The Hickory House. Sitting in cars drinking and shooting the BS was as popular as actually going inside the diner though that took place too. Diner accurately portrays this aspect of teenage gregariousness. The courting rituals and dating challenges are also true to life for the period. A mediocre film A Summer Place was extremely popular with teens of the period in particular girls since it was basically a chick flick. By using it as a backdrop to the story Levinson enhances the scene with the popcorn box and makes it much more meaningful especially to those who have watched A Summer Place. Another aspect of reality used by Levinson in a telling way is the concept of male female relationships at the time. For example when Timothy Fenwick Bacon starts using vulgar language during the car wreck tomfoolery the other guys point to Beth Barkin and indicate by gesture that there is a lady present. Today female teens readily use vulgar talk as often as males. Changing times.Diner is one of the best of the teen angst films shot during the 70's and 80's and not to be missed. If the viewer lived through the time passage in the movie it is all that more enjoyable to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Produced written and directed by Barry Levinson. DINER has been one of my favorite movies from the first time I watched it. This comedic drama takes a look at a group of Baltimore guys in 1959. They spend most of their time at a local greasyspoon diner discussing their collective fears of growing up. Inspite of one being married the group seems ambitionless with little respect for women. It seems their goals are 'copping a feel' and 'getting laid'.These somewhat shallow characters are played by a host of future accomplished stars. Mickey Rourke plays a hairdresser by day and a law student by night. He is driven by sex and his gambling habit. Kevin Bacon's character is estranged from his wealthy family and has a warped if not sick sense of humor. Steve Guttenberg is approaching marriage only if his fiance can pass a quiz of football trivia. Daniel Stern is cast as the married friend who is having troubles with his wifeEllen Barkin. Paul Reiser is the complainer of the group. Tim Daly plays a grad student with his own problematic love life. I really enjoyed the interaction of these young men as they whittle away their time holding court in their favorite diner. Bumbling arrogant stupid and obnoxious actions of this circle of friends is played quite believably.The atmosphere is sustained by a wonderful soundtrack of the times featuring the likes of Chuck Berry Eddie Cochran Fats Domino Jerry Lee Lewis Dion  The Belmonts Howling Wolf Bobby Darin and of course Elvis.Also in the cast Kathryn Dowling Colette Blonigan John Aquino and Michael Tucker. The angst of coming of age usually proves entertaining. DINER picks up the tab and leaves a modest tip.".

Rourke is the Casanova of the gang but he's also immersed in fear of not seeing the next day with the impending pressure of having to pay off some gambling debts to a local mob. Still he might be physically near to crying but he tries his utmost not to let down his cocky faade in front of his friends. Really I can perfectly see why people would see him as a promising actor at his point in time. The soundtrack is OK and some of the banter inside the title's diner does show some chemistry.And now the bad I know this is from 82 and meant to mirror the 50's but boy is this film misogynistic. Their objectifying chats are one thing but that football test in order to get married just seems to come out of the stone age when that girl's mom calls on the phone to check out how her daughter's doing on the test as if it's perfectly normal I kinda zoned out from it. Kevin Bacon's character is supposed to be somewhat crazy but we have no idea why. Is he schizophrenic? Is he depressed and trying to get some attention? We have no idea and his craziness seems to be there only for the sake of some wacky moments. Daniel Stern plays a music geek high on trivia and low on communicating with his wife. As a music brainiac myself I felt disgusted by the way he carries himself and by the whiny childish tantrum he gets when a record is not in place literally driving his wife t tears. Geez I know it's supposed to vent his frustration about not having anything to talk about with his spouse but no one would be that insensitive telling her not to order the records herselfmaybe making her crydon't think so. It's the most denigrating music fan image I've ever seen on film.In the end we're left with a handful of amusing moments marred by lack of character development which is odd considering this is exactly the right kind of movie for thatand a dated feel to it all in more ways than one.".

	schema:headline " An intriguing look into a stage in men.";
	schema:reviewBody "Barry Levinson's directorial debut working from his own original script is one of those movies that examines a group of friends at a significant moment in their life. Diner focuses itself on several collegeaged boys in 1959 Baltimore caught in that awkward stage right on the cusp of manhood. Each prominent member of the group is stuck at a crossroads between life as a carefree teenager and having to move into the adult world Eddie Simmons Steve Guttenberg is days away from his wedding Shrevie Schreiber Daniel Stern is in a young marriage to Beth Ellen Barkin Boogie Sheftell Mickey Rourke is a playboy working at a beauty shop Timothy Fenwick Kevin Bacon is a developing alcoholic living off his trust fund and Billy Howard Tim Daly has just come home for Eddie's wedding.Levinson takes on a slightly nontraditional structure here as the film occurs almost in a series of vignettes as opposed to a typical narrative. He made the wise move to get the actors acquainted with one another before shooting began so when it came time to start rolling on the film he was able to build conversations through improvisation and the actors own relationships as opposed to forcing them to read strict lines off the page. It has a free flow to it all wisely directed by Levinson and marvelously acted by the young cast of fresh actors. You can feel that camaraderie in their chemistry together you can really feel all of those years of building relationships between them.Some of the actors do shine individually Rourke in particular steals the show coming onto the screen as if he were a born star. He has the kind of natural charisma and compelling presence that the young Paul Newman and James Dean had drawing your eyes towards him instantly whenever he comes on screen. There's a soft sincere man inside that casually flamboyant shell the kind of guy who wants you to think he's something that he really isn't and Rourke plays it with such wonderful nuance. It's an impressive performance on it's own but the real treat of the film is seeing the whole ensemble of young stars working together.Diner is a story of boys who have to finally make the decision to become men and I think this is an interesting part on the development of men. Over the years there have been hundreds and hundreds of films about adolescence about boys half the age of the ones seen here but not enough about this stage in life one that I find infinitely more interesting. I think any man who is in this stage of their life or has already passed it can find a lot to relate to in these characters and the fact that I'm currently in a similar stage surely helped me admire the film even more. It takes place in 1959 but the themes of maturity and morality speak to any generation.

	onyx:emotionText "Barry Levinson's directorial debut working from his own original script is one of those movies that examines a group of friends at a significant moment in their life. Diner focuses itself on several collegeaged boys in 1959 Baltimore caught in that awkward stage right on the cusp of manhood. Each prominent member of the group is stuck at a crossroads between life as a carefree teenager and having to move into the adult world Eddie Simmons Steve Guttenberg is days away from his wedding Shrevie Schreiber Daniel Stern is in a young marriage to Beth Ellen Barkin Boogie Sheftell Mickey Rourke is a playboy working at a beauty shop Timothy Fenwick Kevin Bacon is a developing alcoholic living off his trust fund and Billy Howard Tim Daly has just come home for Eddie's wedding.Levinson takes on a slightly nontraditional structure here as the film occurs almost in a series of vignettes as opposed to a typical narrative. He made the wise move to get the actors acquainted with one another before shooting began so when it came time to start rolling on the film he was able to build conversations through improvisation and the actors own relationships as opposed to forcing them to read strict lines off the page. It has a free flow to it all wisely directed by Levinson and marvelously acted by the young cast of fresh actors. You can feel that camaraderie in their chemistry together you can really feel all of those years of building relationships between them.Some of the actors do shine individually Rourke in particular steals the show coming onto the screen as if he were a born star. He has the kind of natural charisma and compelling presence that the young Paul Newman and James Dean had drawing your eyes towards him instantly whenever he comes on screen. There's a soft sincere man inside that casually flamboyant shell the kind of guy who wants you to think he's something that he really isn't and Rourke plays it with such wonderful nuance. It's an impressive performance on it's own but the real treat of the film is seeing the whole ensemble of young stars working together.Diner is a story of boys who have to finally make the decision to become men and I think this is an interesting part on the development of men. Over the years there have been hundreds and hundreds of films about adolescence about boys half the age of the ones seen here but not enough about this stage in life one that I find infinitely more interesting. I think any man who is in this stage of their life or has already passed it can find a lot to relate to in these characters and the fact that I'm currently in a similar stage surely helped me admire the film even more. It takes place in 1959 but the themes of maturity and morality speak to any generation. They're all caught right in this area between boy and man and it makes for several interesting contradictions within the characters.Bacon's Fenwick is developing a severe alcohol problem and spends most of his time clowning around and pissing away his life but we can see that he is an extremely intelligent guy who is wasting his potential. Rourke's Boogie is two thousand dollars in debt from gambling but he still finds time to get a girl to touch his erection through a popcorn box.

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes adult films can be very entertaining with stronger premises neat acting and laughoutloud comedy which is why we get Barry Levinson's Diner.It revolves around Christmas time in 1959 where 5 boys spend their time at the diner. When the gang realizes that they have to spend a few days without the comfort of their favorite restaurant they try to settle their lives by showing their responsibilities while sharing their details.Thinking about this movie makes me want to watch it again to keep on making me laugh my butt off. I mean it is that good there's absolutely nothing negative to say about it.The premise about spending their lives explaining their details without the diner was very interesting. The acting was pure masterpiece. Every actor you see Steve Guttenberg from the Police Academy series Daniel Stern from Home Alones 1 and 2 Mickey Rourke from Iron Man 2 Kevin Bacon from Apollo 13 Balto Mystic River you name it.The comedy was pure genius. The jokes that I like the best were Fenwick pretending to be dead from his car accident and the part where Fenwick gets drunk while goofing off near a church.The soundtrack was great and the 1959 period setting was very creative. Diner is one of the greatest films ever made from the early 80s that defines the 50s and it is in my list.5 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Unsullied wellacted and lively American movies by new directors with the audacity of their assurance are in danger of becoming extinct because they're either few in numbers or threatened by changing environmental or predation parameters. They ought to be defended and preserved not to mention valued and treasured. This naturalistically acted movie isn't extravagant or lengthy but it's the kind of minor truthful enjoyable movie that should never go out of fashion even now that the tradition of sequels and blockbusters has been thoroughly established. It's not quite seamless yet its intermittent patchiness is part of its allure. There's an exhilaration in watching a gifted hatchling filmmaker skate on thin ice.This wistful charismatic sleeper sounds initially like a genre movie in the always trendy Stand by Me While I Look Dazed and Confused at American Pie andor Graffiti at Ridgemont High pattern. Like American Graffiti or like Porky's etc. it's set in a youthdriven bygone era marked by perpetual nostalgia routinely revisits some favorite place and highlights young men moving toward maturity while talking relentlessly about sex to the jingle of a ceaseless line of hit records.Yet the similitude stops there. One of the most sensitive youth accounts about the vacuum between genders it's a lot less blithe than any of its foils. The ambiance is reverberated by the set design which is actually rather gritty and dingy. In just one crucial scene do two characters find themselves beyond Baltimore's worn boundaries and amidst a vast sunlit countryside in a wellheeled hamlet. Riding horseback past them is an advantaged beautiful girl. You ever get the feeling that there's something going on that we don't know about? one character asks the other and then they zip right back to the movie's dim daily backdrop.Barry Levinson the film's writer and director almost treads more Mean Streetsstyle water with such strokes and those are actually the few scenes that seem to slightly miscarry forthright as they are. But Levinson's sentiment for and interest in his youngatheart characters are distinctive. And his immoderation like theirs is effortlessly absolved.His tribute to the fine art of screen writing is about a cluster of highschool buddies who in 1959 are a year or two graduated and now starting to belatedly come into their own. Shrevie has already tumbled into an early marriage with a woman with whom he entrusts to a chum he cannot have a meaningful exchange. Sex is no longer a god to him but he's already melancholy for the time when it was. His wife Beth rendered very movingly in only a few scenes in Ellen Barkin's first bigscreen role knows him so little that she cannot even fathom something as essential and imperative as how he keeps his records categorized. At the end of a lingering marital clash in which he has berated Beth about the LPs Shrevie intending to express his recollection for details roars at Beth that Ain't That a Shame was playing when he first met her in 1955.Another of the boys Eddie is about to wed a girl whom we incessantly hear about though never see. Eddie's such a Baltimore Colts devotee that he's asserting that their colors be the theme for the wedding. He's such an anxious bridegroom that he's requiring Elyse score higher than 65 on a sports quiz of Eddie's own design. If Elyse fails he declares wedding's off. He's for real. What'll he do when she scores 63? The other leads are selfindulgent illmannered trustfund rebel Fenwick who in one remarkable private scene shows an uncannily encyclopedic intellect persuasive charmer Boogie who gambles on everything counting his sex life and who works as a beautician though scores better with chicks if he tells them he's studying law and Timothy Daly's smartly played polite squareshooting collegian Billy who can't convince his pregnant girlfriend to marry him. These characters are well drawn on their own individual merits and they're played stunningly. Levinson unearthed a topquality cast most of them nonames but few for long.Guttenberg and Stern had previous film experience though neither played such rich characters as Shrevie and Eddie before. Kevin Bacon who thus far had any been teen 2 and annoying jock 1 in a handful of slasher flicks and frathouse romcoms makes Fenwick a remarkable fusion of indulgence and despair. Rourke gives one of the best of his many memorable performances. Lowkey and crafty his shiftless Boogie also ends up being arguably the most goodnatured character and Rourke makes his gentleness feel engaging and genuine.Levinson fluctuates the movie's temper greatly from scene to scene. Some sequences like one at a strip club where two of the boys get the band to play lively jazz and everyone begins bopping are wholesome whimsy and don't quite feel like anything else. Others as when the group sits quarrelling over who's better between Sinatra or Mathis have a gracefully authentic ordinariness. So does a scene in which Shrevie who works in a TV shop attempts to sway one patron to buy a color set although the man claims he once saw Bonanza in color and the Ponderosa looked faked. Levinson isn't above sending his characters to see Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee at a local movie house either. The melancholy characteristic of his material is engaged to its maximum degree.However Diner has a lot more to it than that and it doesn't seem to aspire to the calculated dependability that other likewise constructed movies are after. Levinson isn't simply a fuddydud with an affectionate or comprehensive reminiscence for his own youth. He's someone trying to grasp that era not just to evoke it. Indeed Diner is ultimately a film we can all understand on a universal level.".

	schema:reviewBody "The underlying theme here is transition. Six young American guys bond with each other for security as they move out of adolescence and into adulthood. Given that the story takes place in 1959 the transition applies equally to American culture which transitions out of the dull 50s and into the chaotic 60s. These guys will never be young again and neither will America hence the appeal to nostalgia.An ensemble cast allows for the film to be a series of vignettes involving one or more of the characters. As such the plot seems jerky almost random at times. Characters seem shallow egocentric and predictably preoccupied with romance and sex. I couldn't get interested in any of them. The story is set in dreary Baltimore at Christmas. So the overall plot has the feel of a very specific place and time.The script is very talky. Not much happens. Characters stand around drive around meet at the diner for burgers ... and talk. Some of the banter is clever most is just tedious. I thought the casting was a bit weak in that the differentiation among the six guys is not as pronounced as that of American Graffiti 1973. Acting is average. Some of the chitchat is improvisational.I was disappointed with the background music. Again it is somewhat weak. There are a few good 1950s songs the ones by Bobby Darin and Fats Domino. But most of the selections are not especially nostalgic. On the other hand the color visuals do create the look of that era quite well.It's almost as if this film borrowed its underlying concept from American Graffiti which I like considerably better partly because of its more archetypal characters. Then too the two films address a slightly different American constituency. Diner is set on the East Coast American Graffiti on the West Coast. Maybe I just identify more with the West.".

Essentially Diner is a film in the same vein as American Graffiti and Dead Poets Society except the characters are a bit older and are now forced to reckon with the frightening forces of reality. While it is a hilarious and witty comedy Diner is also a powerful portrait of a group of old friends now struggling to adjust to adulthood and societal expectations. Concepts such a marriage and maturity are now at last taking their dramatic grasp upon this group of charmers who are now facing challenges they never thought were possible.Dealing frankly with relationships sexuality stress and the sometimes scary idea of settling down with a wife job and kids Diner is a brilliant peek into the lives of a group of witty and entertaining friends as their age unexpectedly increases forcing the task of adulthood to begin truly affecting their lives with storms of conflict and confusion.".

Concepts such a marriage and maturity are now at last taking their dramatic grasp upon this group of charmers who are now facing challenges they never thought were possible.Dealing frankly with relationships sexuality stress and the sometimes scary idea of settling down with a wife job and kids Diner is a brilliant peek into the lives of a group of witty and entertaining friends as their age unexpectedly increases forcing the task of adulthood to begin truly affecting their lives with storms of conflict and confusion.";

I mean the thing is that you really have to give movies a chance sometimes you never know your doubts are put behind you and you find yourself enjoying the movie. I mean I love Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan both great actors and are a lot of fun to watch on screen. So together it seemed like this movie might have stood a chance but unfortunately once again this is the exact same movie that we've seen five million times. I know that to people who haven't seen the romantic comedy genre this is new but Hollywood is just running out of idea's sadly. This story is no different from any other romantic comedy we've seen.Tom and Hannah have been best friends since college Tom is the player who has had every girl except Hannah. She has feelings for him but hides it and he doesn't notice but when she goes to Scotland for work he realizes how much she means to him out of no where. Hannah comes back but she's got a new thing going on she's engaged and Tom's plan to tell her how he feels is now ruined when she asks him to be her maid of honor. But Tom figures that he has a good chance to point out that she doesn't know her fiance that well and that her and Tom truely belong together.The thing is you can predict every moment before you know it's going to happen it's sad when you could write a similar script and just put different actors in it there is a good chance that people will fall for it at least it's good to have that kind of chance at making money. Made of Honor isn't the most horrible movie by any means it had good intentions but I would recommend if you really want to see it just wait for the rental. As cute as Patrick and Michelle are the chemistry is off and the script is just amateur. You've seen this movie five million times believe me if you're into the romantic comedy genre.310".

The problem with this movie is that the two twits are the leads and the only actually romantic character is the other guy. This really kills its aspirations of being a romantic comedy since the fundamental premise of this genre is that the viewers root for the leading pair to get together while all I was thinking as this flick drew to its inevitable conclusion was that the other guy was by far the better catch in every imaginable way far more deserving of love and affection and infinitely more graceful in handling himself and the situation than the leading man and that not seeing that in itself really disqualified the leading woman.As a consequence this flick may be credited as spawning a new genre  the romantic tragedy.The whole point of DarcyWickham or DarcyCleaver type of romcom setups is that one of the leads and ideally the readerviewer is initially misguided in their views of the prospective mates and the story is then about the bumpy road to enlightenment at the end of which the more worthy mate wins. In Austen terms apologies to those unfamiliar with them this story is that after Lydia has been after Wickham for some time and without success she gets to know and falls for Darcy and decides to marry him whereupon Wickham true to form concludes that he wants Lydia after all does his very best to torpedo their impending happiness and as a result of Lydia's profound airheadedness succeeds. Darcy is left alone and the final shot shows Lydia and Wickham bonking.The audience supposedly should feel happy about those two getting together and in a way it's probably a comfort to think that a guy like Colin should have no difficulty finding a much more worthy woman to make happy.There isn't much to make up for the silly plot and its absurd conclusion either. The comedy is mostly unsubtle some slapstick a few rather crude jokes about a fat girl the acting is okay but not great to be fair there is not much opportunity for greatness in the script  even as guilty pleasure a category I would put most romcoms into there just isn't enough pleasure for the considerable amount of guilt involved in watching this. There are probably many better ways of spending one's time.".

I wasn't expecting much from it it just looked like another rip off of a hundred other romantic comedies. I was very surprised that that I liked it the entire way through and it kept my interest the whole time! Although I enjoyed the movie it was not an original idea. The one thing I did really enjoy about it was that this wasn't a sad girl trying to get the guy like many other movies like this are it was shown through the guy's perspective which isn't quite as over done.I won't give out any details you don't already see in the trailer for the movie Patrick Dempsy's character is great with women and his best friend is a successful intelligent woman. She goes to Scotland on business and Patrick's character realizes he has actually fallen in love with her now that shes gone. She comes back and he is ready to profess his love but there's one problem she met someone else and is getting married! So now he is her maid of honor and has to try and stop the wedding. Like I said not really an original idea but it is MUCH funnier and more interesting than most of the romantic comedies I have seen. Especially with him being maid of honor its really hilarious.If you are looking for an original movie that hasn't been done before then this is not for you. But if you enjoy romantic comedies and want a good laugh this one is definitely worth seeing. I watched it in a group of about half and half for men and woman and 90 of the people I talked to enjoyed it. I would see it again and I would definitely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like chick flicks!".

	schema:reviewBody "So just why is it that we are meant to side with this ridiculous American jerk? This is the guy who apparently has the looks and charisma to have a neverending stream of the kind of gorgeous women most of us can only dream of yet he treats them like dirt. Just what his lifelong pal Hannah is doing wasting her time hanging out with him heaven only knows and finally she meets a decent Scottish man Colin and they're going to get married. Good on her is what you should think yet this film steers you around into thinking that the womaniser jerk is the one she should have been with. He may shag around but hey he strokes dogs. Off they go to Scotland but not the real Scotland but the stereotypical one in which the people speak Scots toss cabers live in castles and generally everything is a bit scary and weird. A couple of cheap shots suddenly make us feel that perhaps Colin isn't quite the Mr Right we were led to believe the cake bit was just plain corny and though I am no fan of hunting at least Colin's meat is won naturally and not factory farmed and along comes our womanising pal to walk straight into their wedding and declare his undying love for Hannah. I mean what is it with these romantic movies and people walking in on other people's weddings and declaring their love for one of the supposedly happy couple. Is that the kind of thing we should be encouraging? Coz I know I wouldn't appreciate it too much if it was my weddding. Yer man had his chance and he blew it tough st and should never go ruining a supposed friend's wedding with his fit of jealousy.

The guy is a complete and utter pillock and basically this film is an insult to all of us guys in the world who actually do know how to care about the women we are with and who don't just bed as many as we can for the sake of... well for the sake of what I'm not really sure. I'm not sure what kind of values this film is trying to portray but it's got it all wrong. The only thing I can see is that regardless how much of a scumbag you are if you are American you are still going to be a better partner for anybody than a Scot. I just found it irritating sadly the girlfriend thought it was hilarious and immediately made us sit through it all over again.".

	onyx:emotionText "So just why is it that we are meant to side with this ridiculous American jerk? This is the guy who apparently has the looks and charisma to have a neverending stream of the kind of gorgeous women most of us can only dream of yet he treats them like dirt. Just what his lifelong pal Hannah is doing wasting her time hanging out with him heaven only knows and finally she meets a decent Scottish man Colin and they're going to get married. Good on her is what you should think yet this film steers you around into thinking that the womaniser jerk is the one she should have been with. He may shag around but hey he strokes dogs. Off they go to Scotland but not the real Scotland but the stereotypical one in which the people speak Scots toss cabers live in castles and generally everything is a bit scary and weird. A couple of cheap shots suddenly make us feel that perhaps Colin isn't quite the Mr Right we were led to believe the cake bit was just plain corny and though I am no fan of hunting at least Colin's meat is won naturally and not factory farmed and along comes our womanising pal to walk straight into their wedding and declare his undying love for Hannah. I mean what is it with these romantic movies and people walking in on other people's weddings and declaring their love for one of the supposedly happy couple. Is that the kind of thing we should be encouraging? Coz I know I wouldn't appreciate it too much if it was my weddding. Yer man had his chance and he blew it tough st and should never go ruining a supposed friend's wedding with his fit of jealousy. I was so much hoping that Hannah would tell him to pss off there and then but sadly that's not the kind of ending Americans can deal with and so we get the clichd happily ever after nonsense.

It misses the mark completely every time. Every time they have a chance for a joke or good romance they end up screwing it up. Dempsey and Monaghan are both terrible they're both actors who can be really good actors but here they seem like they'r either trying too hard or not trying at all. Something about the movie not just the formulaic jokes or stupid predictable jokes and plot rubs me the wrong way. It's probably the fact that it's actually extremely mean hearted. The movie ultimately completely dissaspoints. Not only Monagan and Dempsey are terrible but so is McKidd. A truly bad movie for which I will not wed a film of such utter disgrace that you think how much did someone actually spend on making this.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay after 10 minutes of Made of Honor it is crystal clear that best friends Tom Patrick Dempsey and Hannah Michelle Monaghan are madly in love with each other and should be together. Tom and Hannah are beautiful and good people but apparently not smart enough to figure this out now. So we have to wait it out for the next couple hours. Yes this is formulaic romantic comedy and taxing one's patience. Further complicating our pain the fleet of writersAdam Sztykiel Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont depict Tom and Hannah literally on paper as smart charming and engaging except for this glaring blind spot. However despite the narrative devices and clumsy direction from Paul Weiland I was enrolled by a scene with Michelle Monaghan. As Hannah Monaghan looks wistfully at photos of her and Tom on her cell phone. She resonates with a sense of sadness and regret. Later Dempsey as the clued in Tom implores Hannah Please don't marry him A lot of Made of Honor is over wrought and contrived however Dempsey and Monaghan's charm make you wait it out. Dempsey is the handsome engaging player lughead who underneath it all has a good heart. Michelle Monaghan is radiantly beautiful funny and smart. She is a younger Sandra Bullock. Monaghan is humorously vulnerable as Hannah who is smart in settling for a relationship because she fears she can't have what she really deserves. Monaghan is amazing.We find that Tom and Hannah Dempsey and Monaghan became best friends as a result of Tom's college high jinx. Today Tom is very wealthy as a result of an idea he had for a cup holder sleeve. Hannah is the passionate art curator for the museum. Tom and Hannah are best friends with killer chemistry. Hannah is Tom's go to date for his father Thomas Sr.'s funny Sydney Pollack numerous weddings. The count is up to 6. Even Thomas jokes to Tom if Tom doesn't marry Hannah he'll make her number 7. Hannah being Tom's tolerant and patient best bud accepts Tom's one night stands with hot women. She is even versed in his rules for sleeping with the same woman on consecutive nights. Tom also has his buddies including solid Felix Kadeem Hardison with whom he plays basketball. Tom seems to have the perfect life. Then following Tom's father's wedding reception Hannah tells Tom that she has to go to Scotland for 6 weeks on business. Tom facetiously says What am I going to do without you? During her absence Tom starts to get a clue about Hannah being the one. So he decides to tell Hannah that they should be together when she returns. However Hannah returns with great news She has fallen in love and is getting married in 2 weeks in Scotland. The guy is Colin dashing and charming Kevin McKidd who is a Scottish Duke and apparently the perfect guy. Really. Tom and his crew later get a glimpse of this at a ridiculous pick up basketball game experience. Anyway Hannah asks Tom to be her Maid of Honor. Tom accepts. His bud Felix reminds him that he can steal the bride from inside the wedding. Predictably the rest of the Brides Maids are annoyed with Tom particularly Maid of Honor runnerup cousin Melissa angry Busy Philipps who Tom slept with once.For the most part Made of Honor is by the numbers romantic comedy. It does manage a touching turn because we really want to know why Hannah ends up choosing Colin. It is transparent to us that Colin is the perfect guy but he is not the perfect guy for Hannah. Fortunately Dempsey and Monaghan's charm and chemistry for the most part wins over Maid of Honor. Sydney Pollack provides welcome comic relief and staid fatherly advice. Kathleen Quilan is great in the supporting role of Hannah's mother Joan. Too bad she doesn't have a bigger role. But she has a moving moment with Monaghan as Mom talks about Hannah's late father.Made of Honor is enjoyable for what it is cookie cutter romantic comedy. We can suspend our disbelief because Dempsey and Monaghan are great together.".

When it comes down to it she asks him to be her made of honor.Now the plot is not really new just a gender reversal of My Best Friend's Wedding but it's charming. The chemistry between the film's two leads is great and is the saving grace as you really do see why Dempsey's character is fighting for. Not much else about the movie is that new the direction is on par with the given genre the acting is on par with the genre and most of the jokes are that of the genre. That being said the movie isn't bad but you certainly aren't going to walk away with the feeling you'd get from classics like When Harry met Sally.Not bad but a charming On Par addition to the Romantic Comedy genre.a modest 5 out of 10".

That being said the movie isn't bad but you certainly aren't going to walk away with the feeling you'd get from classics like When Harry met Sally.Not bad but a charming On Par addition to the Romantic Comedy genre.a modest 5 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "The cinemas haven't brought out the expected hot summer films yet so I went to this one. Yes it's a girlie film but sometimes those can be enjoyable. This one had its bright spots. The female lead Michelle Monaghan was terrific. It's not just that she's pretty but she has a nice solid vibe that makes her appealing too. A man could imagine that character as someone good to know. Jack Dempsey has his abilities too but his character here was less than attractive.Either the plot was so implausible that it was hard to buy into it and take it seriously or the Dempsey character himself was written as such a jerk that I had no patience for him and no sympathy. I was cheering for his romantic rival the Scotsman! He seemed to be of better character nicer more interesting and NOT a complete jackass.I was disappointed toward the end when the film makers turned the Scottish family lovely people and much more interesting than the Dempsey character and his family into a mild sort of bad guy. It felt ohsocontrived and unnecessary. It rang a false note.So Made of Honor swings and misses. Maybe such wedding movies and romantic shaggy dog stories can never be better than this. But I swear I have seen some that not only worked better but were actually very entertaining. This one tried and wasn't awful but again I really disliked the male lead and the film makers obviously wanted us to feel the opposite way. But they failed.".

Made of Honor is nice picture to watch but somehow the whole exercise seems forced and one can only think of what could of been if the script was just a bit stronger...and the direction too. The movie takes way too long to get moving and doesn't know where to end....the final scene is tacked on.It's hard not to give away plot points since this film seems glued together from bits and pieces of 1960's comedies as well as things you've watching on the Lifetime Network. Still it is fun. And Made of Honor is a lot more enjoyable than Baby Mama which is just a long...very long...skit from Saturday Night Live.Patrick Dempsey looks good on the big screen but seems a bit lifeless. Do we really need scenes where characters discuss how pretty Dempsey is? He also looks a bit long in the tooth for the age he is supposed to be playing. But looks real good in a minikilt. On the other hand Michelle Monaghan is enchanting and lights up the screen every time she appears. The audience falls in love with her. Other characters come and go as the plot line dictates. The three bride maids seem like a missed opportunity for comedy. The mother of the bride suddenly pops in...and out just as fast.Made of Honor tries too hard to be something that is not in its DNA an adult comedy. Attn Columbia there is nothing wrong with making a nice movie. Why junk it up? Several bits are quite vulgar and add nothing to the plot. An example Grandma Pearl wearing a necklace of thunder beads and several tacky references to Dempsey's character being gay.In many places the cinematography is incredible  especially shots of the Scotish countryside. Almost too good for this film it gives the film the look of a fairy tale come true. A big negative is the pop rock soundtrack that is overbearing and I would imagine exists only to have a soundtrack album.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made of Honor spells chick flick all over it the perennial formulaic romantic comedy that tells its entire story in the trailer but that's not going to stop couples from hitting the cinemas for their date movie flick does it? What I thought was peculiar was that the original US rating for this was R meaning a lot more sexual material thrown in versus the now released PG13 version which was reedited and over here the rating of PG that allows for everyone to make a beeline if they want to escape from the week's blockbuster.The plot's nothing new as well with movies like My Best Friend's Wedding and even from as far back as Three Men and a Little Lady where the best friend tries hisher very best to convince the bridegroom that their choice for eternal companionship is of the wrong one and of course to make away with their respective selves to live happily ever after. And if you think the premise is a ludicrous one where a man will take up the duties of a maid of honor then Singapore perhaps just legitimized it with a wedding in a cinema last Tuesday where indeed a male did grace the occasion of his best friend's wedding as her MOH.For a man who doesn't seem to have a job and have a huge trust fund behind him Patrick Dempsey shed his uptight role as a dad from his debut big screen outing with Enchanted for a playboy called Tom who lives by certain rules in his dating game and amongst them no back to back sex with the same girl no dates with the same girl unless it's a week apart and never to call someone new in the next 24 hours never bring them to weddings and family events and the likes. Women find him irresistible either for his looks or for that bank account and he spares no time in getting to know them inside out. The ideal bachelor lifestyle I'd bet with a constant flow of money women and good pals to shoot hoops with none of them seemingly poor enough to hold down regular jobs.However he has his best friend and confidante in Hannah Michelle Monaghan with whom he spends his weekends with and just when he discovers that he truly loves the girl she drops the bombshell that she's going to marry a Scot whom she met during her business trip and talking about whirlwind romances will be getting married in 14 days. So the clock starts to tick in order for Tom to prove himself to be better than the groomtobe Colin McMurray Kevin McKidd which is an uphill task as richesforriches they could be on par but you just can't inject blue blood into you. While at the same time juggle his role as the maid of honor and going through the many girlie things that they're supposed to do for the bride.While it is a formulaic story what works and so long as it does this type of movies will forever be made is the chemistry between the leads. You just can't deny that both Dempsey and Monaghan look good together on screen as a couple and you can't help but find yourself rooting for them past their characters' stupidity to realize that they're made for each other after 10 years of being together with little clues left unanswered with questions such as why do you like him going unanswered. If only of course it were that easy in real life that a romance can be wrapped up with Eurekalike moments of enlightenment within two hours.Of course I must admit though with formula it doesn't require anything cerebral from you as you sit through and try to enjoy the story in fantasy land. The eclectic soundtrack helped as well with contemporary tunes taking centerstage and played at the right moments from Smash Mouth's opening to Oasis' Stop Crying Your Heart Out when last I heard of it in a movie was in The Butterfly Effect. Supporting characters like Kathleen Quinlan and Sydney Pollack goes wasted of course.".

	schema:reviewBody "A good idea gone horribly wrong. Patrick Dempsey is a good actor but he was miscast in this movie. It just wasn't a good fit for him. And who talked Sydney Pollack into being in this mess? Did he read the script? It seems like there must have been too many writers stirring the pot on this screenplay. The prologue with the college scenes could easily have been cut. Many scenes were too short they should have been combined. For instance when Tom and Hannah are outside of a restaurant and then inside. Or when Tom is talking to Hannah on the roof then talks to his buddy on the phone then talks to his buddy in person. Just combine the buddy scenes. Also when Hannah goes to Scotland and meets her beau then goes back to NY and talks to her girlfriend about how she met the man of her dreams. Well you shoulda showed us instead of telling us! There wouldn't have had to be any dialog. Overall the film is way too dialog heavy. The tone of the film was inconsistent. Yes comedies have dramatic moments...but with such short choppy scenes it's hard to build and maintain momentum or emotion. The scene length did get better for the Scotland sequence.

	onyx:emotionText "A good idea gone horribly wrong. Patrick Dempsey is a good actor but he was miscast in this movie. It just wasn't a good fit for him. And who talked Sydney Pollack into being in this mess? Did he read the script? It seems like there must have been too many writers stirring the pot on this screenplay. The prologue with the college scenes could easily have been cut. Many scenes were too short they should have been combined. For instance when Tom and Hannah are outside of a restaurant and then inside. Or when Tom is talking to Hannah on the roof then talks to his buddy on the phone then talks to his buddy in person. Just combine the buddy scenes. Also when Hannah goes to Scotland and meets her beau then goes back to NY and talks to her girlfriend about how she met the man of her dreams. Well you shoulda showed us instead of telling us! There wouldn't have had to be any dialog. Overall the film is way too dialog heavy. The tone of the film was inconsistent. Yes comedies have dramatic moments...but with such short choppy scenes it's hard to build and maintain momentum or emotion. The scene length did get better for the Scotland sequence. Sydney Pollack had the best lines when he's counseling his son. I almost want to believe that Pollack might have directed that scene himself. To summarize the premise was good the execution of it was not.";

And I had exactly the same perception even before seeing the movie. Another major problem is that the characters are not sympathetic or likable in the slightest the lead character especially is a complete sleazeball. Also the characters here are little more than clich after clich and bland stereotypes.A lot of plots in romantic comedies are predictable here is no exception. But this plot is also unrealistic and clichd and in terms of the pace and direction the film is a slog. I also disliked the ending not only was it as predictable as the rest of story but it was also pure fantasy of the highest order.The acting is not very good unfortunately like I couldn't connect to any of the characters I don't think a vast majority of the actors could connect with them either. There is one good performance and that comes from Sydney Pollack but Patrick Dempsey while dashing is too earnest for the lead and Michelle Monaghan comes across as rather limited. Hardly surprising with the dialogue being as terrible as it was.All in all a daft predictable and clichd romantic comedy with a few good points. 310 Bethany Cox".

It's all pretty juvenile and silly but infamous schlock master Jess Franco injects enough nastiness and TA to keep things interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "The last time I saw this was almost 7 years ago and all I could remember was that Nayland Smith goes blind and that it was very boring. Having been initiating myself into the Franco cult though I actually enjoyed this quite a bit on my second viewing. It's impossible to accept Christopher Lee as an Asian man but he still makes for an imposing villain. I also liked the supporting character of Carl Jansen even though he makes some pretty boneheaded decisions. Unfortunately the character of Sancho Lopez really hinders my enjoyment of certain scenes. I think he was supposed to be a likable jerk in the Tuco tradition but Ricardo Palacios lacks the charisma to remain sympathetic even while doing bad things. Franco milks the budget for all it's worth and there are only a few telltale signs of how meager his means were such as a little cave being shot from many angles to suggest a huge fortress. I was also surprised at how well he did with the action scenes.My favorite thing about Blood of Fu Manchu were some of the oddball touches throughout. There's a Mayor who detains Carl Jansen for three days simply because good chess players are hard to come by and the delightfully whiny Dr. Petrie. To give you an idea of what a sod this guy is he actually whines about not being able to reach his thermos full of tea when stuck in Fu Manchu's dungeon. And at one point he complains about the South American climate berating himself for having gone there in the first place. This despite the fact that his reason for coming along is the impending death of his friend Nayland Smith! This film may have a lot of haters but I really enjoyed it.I also noticed a major connection with another Franco film. Both this and The Demons feature women dealing out kisses of death though The Demons deals with it in a darker manner. I wonder if this pops up in any other Franco films. In this case it could just be an incidental connection since this film was written by Harry Alan Towers.".

In hindsight Towers and Franco were destined for each other.  Both were specialists in speedy international productions and each usually juggled more than one project at a time.Fu Manchu's Kiss of Death the shooting title was filmed backtoback or perhaps simultaneously with the next film in the series The Castle of Fu Manchu and shows evidence of having been written on the fly. The script is loosely constructed and constantly sidetracks itself with multiple subplots and far too many characters.  The most intrusive involves the a South American bandit chief whose protracted exploits take up so much screen time that viewers just walking in would think they were in the wrong theater. Probably designed to show off the Brazilian exteriors it is tempting to say that these sequences look like rejected scenes from The Wild Bunch but that would be giving Franco's footage too much credit.As evidence that Towers was not above ripping off himself the film opens with a sequence that is a remake of the opening of Brides of Fu Manchu with women chained to pillars in an underground hideaway.  As in Brides one is led to a snake pit but instead of being lowered in she is gingerly bitten in the throat by one thereby becoming the carrier of the title's kiss of death.  The contrast between the lighting staging and sets in these two sequences gives ample testimony of how low the series had fallen in just two years.The everpresent Maria Rohm AKA Mrs. Harry Alan Towers shows up as a jungle missionary wearing a gaucho hat and red leotards. She gets involved in yet another subplot about a protoIndiana Jones leading a medical expedition.  Apparently this plotline exists only to provide the hero afflicted with the death kiss with a miraculous cure at the last minute.While the rest of the cast was having fun in the Brazilian jungles stars Christopher Lee and Richard Greene never leave the studio in Madrid Spain that was home to all the film's interiors.  Guest star Shirley Eaton appears in one brief scene that appears to be an outtake from one of the two SuMuru films she was making for Towers at the time.  The second was also directed by Franco.It's hard to believe that this film retitled Kiss and Kill got major USA playdates in 1968 as a solo feature.".

No matter how you consider the series to work there's very little doubt as to how bad this film actually is. FuManchu Lee and his daughter Lin Tang Tsai Chin are hiding out in the Amazon jungle. FuManchu comes up with a new idea to take over the world and it's to send out ten beautiful women with poison on their lips to kill various world leaders. THE BLOOD OF FUMANCHU was released under countless titles including KISS AND KILL but no matter what you call it there's no doubt it's a horrible little picture that doesn't have a single thing going for it. Jess Franco has made a lot of bad films in his career but there's no question this here is the worst of the decade which for the most part had some decent films that even nonfans thought were at least good. The biggest problem is that the entire story is a complete mess as you never really know if this film is trying to be serious or some sort of spoof. Lee pretty much sleepwalks through his role and it really doesn't appear that he's having any fun. Tsai Chin is about the only decent thing in the film but she isn't given too much to do and the rest of the supporting cast appear to have some sort of poison in their system as well. The film has a comic book vibe to it but there's not an ounce of energy to be found anywhere and what fun adventure there should be isn't anywhere to be found either. This production might have had a bigger than normal budget but nothing was done with it and in the end this is just a worthless film without anything going for it.".

I can't profess to know a great deal about this series having only seen one film in it though I am familiar with the character Fu Manchu after having seen the 1932 Boris Karloff film. Christopher Lee is a great actor but here he looks like he couldn't really be bothered for a start Fu Manchu is meant to be an oriental character and Lee doesn't even try to put on an oriental accent! The plot follows Fu Manchu's quest for world domination and focuses on his bright idea of filling up a load of women with poison and using them to seduce ten of the most powerful men in the world. It actually doesn't sound like that bad a springboard for a decent film adding in the jungle setting and a super villain you'd really be forgiven for thinking that this film is going to be a lot better. Jess Franco takes the directors chair and it seems as is often the case he cared more about his paycheck than the film as it lacks suspense and excitement the characters are mostly dull and the situation is not made the best of. Overall this film may do something for fans of the series but personally it hasn't made me want to see more of these films!".

Christopher Lee is a great actor but here he looks like he couldn't really be bothered for a start Fu Manchu is meant to be an oriental character and Lee doesn't even try to put on an oriental accent! The plot follows Fu Manchu's quest for world domination and focuses on his bright idea of filling up a load of women with poison and using them to seduce ten of the most powerful men in the world. It actually doesn't sound like that bad a springboard for a decent film adding in the jungle setting and a super villain you'd really be forgiven for thinking that this film is going to be a lot better. Jess Franco takes the directors chair and it seems as is often the case he cared more about his paycheck than the film as it lacks suspense and excitement the characters are mostly dull and the situation is not made the best of. Overall this film may do something for fans of the series but personally it hasn't made me want to see more of these films!";

	schema:headline " Every bit as rotten as THE CASTLE OF FU MANCHU";
	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Lee made several Fu Manchu films in the 1960s and I've seen them in no particular order. In my review after having seen THE BLOOD OF FU MANCHU I wrote that I'd seen the absolute worst FU MANCHU film ever made. Well perhaps I spoke too soon as this terrible movie is every bit as craptastic. Both films manage to take a somewhat interesting character FU Manchu and make him about as interesting as an avocado a mushy one at that. Christopher Lee has all the charisma and charm of a block of wood as he says and does practically nothing! Despite being an excellent horror actor here dressed as a Chinese man a very tall and Caucasian looking one he appears as if no one has written him any dialog and he occupies very little screen time. When he does appear he just stands there expressionlesslike a somewhat Chinese version of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.Now if this were all perhaps the film would still be worth watching. Don't assume this please as the rest of the film is even worse. Rarely have I seen a plot so hopelessly convoluted contradictory and nonsensical. Here are some of the many problems Although the film is supposed to be set in Brazil it switches between there and nearby Southern Mexico. Did anyone involved with the film look at a map? The two locations however are probably at least 3000 miles apartyet they can walk to or take a horse to the other place in what seems like a few hours tops! Fu Manchu has put poison in 10 ladies' system so when they kiss a man he dies almost instantly. You see this happen at the beginning and end of the film. However when Nayland Smith is kissed full on the lips by one of these hypnotized killers he goes blind only because he's the hero in these godawful flicks. And this is later cured in a way that is sure to make you laugh.When one guy dies from poison and falls down a waterfall when he's bobbing around in the water you can see him blinking his eyes.When the ladies go on assignments to kill they travel around the globe and are accompanied by Manchu's henchmenmaking it a pretty complicated affair. Why not just have the henchmen shoot the intended victims in the face?! It's much easier and more costeffective. Even a cinder block dropped on their heads or electric lamp tossed into their tub would be easier and make more sense.How do they make a comic booklike film and yet have almost no energy expended whatsoever? The fights are in slowmotion there is no suspense and it all just limps alongmaking it a very boring movie.Why do Manchu's henchmen NEVER make a sound when they are attacked by surprise? In one scene the German dude does this again and again to pick off the baddies and not once do the dummkopfs call out for help!!How does a small tussle at the end of the film result in Manchu's complex exploding? It just looks like they ran out of film and decided to stage a very very small pyrotechnic explosion and say hurray we won! and end it.How does Manchu get so many willing henchmen? He never treats them well disposes of them right and left and brings them halfway around the globe to the South American jungle...and WHY the South American jungle?! Why were there so many naked women in this film? Again and again there seemed to be little reason to rip off ladies' blouses other than to give the audience a cheap thrill. And if you are going to make a nudie film why not get attractive women?! The confusing aspects of the film aboundwith many many more examples. Frankly this film appears to have been written by lemurs. I can't decide which of the two final Christopher Lee films about Fu Manchu is worse and frankly you'd have to pay me a lot to see them again so that I could definitively decide.These films suck and aren't even fun to watch. If the film makers didn't care enough to work out the plot or produce a watchable film why should people both as well?".

	schema:reviewBody "The evil Fu Manchu continues his endless quest for world domination but first he has developed a plan to eliminate his archenemies of which Scotland Yard's Nayland Smith is top priority. So our oriental mastercriminal has kidnapped 10 of the most beautiful women on the planet and stuffed their bodies with the world's deadliest poison. Their orders are to seduce the enemies and kill them with the kiss of death. His fiendish plan almost succeeds but Smith survives the assault and goes after Fu Manchu who shelters in the jungles of South America. The premise of this sequel sounds promising enough but don't be fooled it's a terribly boring and unexciting film. There are so many things wrong with this production I don't even properly know where to start. For starters the screenplay introduces way too many characters and actually none of them are worth mentioning. There's no tension and there's a total lack of gore and sleaze as well considering Jess Franco signed for the direction I was at least hoping for this. There are a lot of battle sequences but they're painfully tame and tedious. Franco makes no use of the great junglelocation at all and the editing is lousy. Judging by his emotionless performance Christopher Lee wasn't interesting in repeating the Fu Manchu role for the fourth time at all. Jess Franco also directs on automatic pilot meaning without the slightest bit of passion or motivation. For him this was just another easymoney job in between some eurotrash cinema highlights like 99 Women and Marquis de Sade Justine. The absolute best Fu Manchu film remains the 1932 Mask of Fu Manchu starring Boris Karloff although Don Sharp's efforts the Face of. and The Brides of  are pretty good as well. There's absolutely nothing to recommend about this one so avoid unless you're a perfectionist...or really REALLY bored.".

He responds with a wonderfully spirited performance that is a joy to behold. Conversely ostensible hero Nayland Smith played by a wooden Richard Green is reduced to blind impotence and sidekick Dr. Petrie comes across as a sputtering buffoon. The usually exciting climax is here rushed and perfunctory as if Franco could not bear to kill off his villains. Franco never comes to grips with producer Harry Alan Towers' dreadfully wordy and convoluted screenplay and the film bogs down for long periods of time in pointless sub plots and banal 'action' sequences. Fortunately in the next and last film in the series The Castle of Fu Manchu a more confident Franco throws all caution to the wind and focuses almost entirely on Fu and Lin Tang ironically in the process killing off the series forever.".

	schema:headline " Just dire  even for Franco fans";
	schema:reviewBody "The twodozen or so existing reviews for this movie neglect to specifically address its most likely audience the committed Jess Franco fan.Yes I suppose there may be some fans of the late great Christopher Lee so dedicated as to want to watch it too for whom this review will hopefully suffice.So what does a Jess Franco fan look for in a movie? Simple. Gore sex and nudity terrible acting threadbare plot ludicrous dialogue and generally inept filmmaking in every department pretty much in that order. Okay so the acting is embarrassingly bad. I believe it's testament to what a good bloke Christopher Lee was that he continued making awful films with Franco because they were friends but even he is woeful here. This is obviously not helped by the poor attempt on the part of the makeup department to make him look Chinese. If you've ever seen the early seasons of the original Hawaii FiveO you'll know what I mean.The plot beyond being simply terrible is utterly confusing. There's some scheme by the titular miscreant to use women as a means of killing his enemies whose status as such is never actually established by having them bitten by a snake whose poison bizarrely doesn't affect them but will kill anyone they kiss. Of course. But it doesn't stop there. There's some baffling subplot involving some preIndiana Jones archaeologist  adventurer  good guy which I honestly cannot explain.The dialogue while not exactly Shakespeare is not nearly as wince inducing as it needs to be in order to actually be amusing unlike many Franco films She sucked the semen and the life right out of him from Erotikill being one of my alltime favourite bits of dialogue and the filmmaking here is far less offensively poor than most later Jess Franco efforts. Sadly this actually serves as a disappointment to those of us who came to the show hoping for wobbly outoffocus shots of pubic triangles and bad dubbing.

Given how bafflingly stupid the err story is here nobody would have questioned the random curtly inserted sex of later Franco movies and he'd have replaced the multiple PG deaths in this movie with some needlessly excessive and gory ones.Unless you're an obsessive completest andor a die hard fan of Franco or Lee give a miss.Scratch that  I AM an obsessive completest AND a die hard fan of Franco and I still can't find anything to recommend in this mess.Skip it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The twodozen or so existing reviews for this movie neglect to specifically address its most likely audience the committed Jess Franco fan.Yes I suppose there may be some fans of the late great Christopher Lee so dedicated as to want to watch it too for whom this review will hopefully suffice.So what does a Jess Franco fan look for in a movie? Simple. Gore sex and nudity terrible acting threadbare plot ludicrous dialogue and generally inept filmmaking in every department pretty much in that order. Okay so the acting is embarrassingly bad. I believe it's testament to what a good bloke Christopher Lee was that he continued making awful films with Franco because they were friends but even he is woeful here. This is obviously not helped by the poor attempt on the part of the makeup department to make him look Chinese. If you've ever seen the early seasons of the original Hawaii FiveO you'll know what I mean.The plot beyond being simply terrible is utterly confusing. There's some scheme by the titular miscreant to use women as a means of killing his enemies whose status as such is never actually established by having them bitten by a snake whose poison bizarrely doesn't affect them but will kill anyone they kiss. Of course. But it doesn't stop there. There's some baffling subplot involving some preIndiana Jones archaeologist  adventurer  good guy which I honestly cannot explain.The dialogue while not exactly Shakespeare is not nearly as wince inducing as it needs to be in order to actually be amusing unlike many Franco films She sucked the semen and the life right out of him from Erotikill being one of my alltime favourite bits of dialogue and the filmmaking here is far less offensively poor than most later Jess Franco efforts. Sadly this actually serves as a disappointment to those of us who came to the show hoping for wobbly outoffocus shots of pubic triangles and bad dubbing. That's always been part of the fun.The real con here though is the near total absence of any titillation. The snake poison  kiss of death plot would've been a perfect excuse for Franco to stuff the film with boobs and crass sexy bits but there's only one instance I caught of partial nudity though by the end I was barely watching and a wholly unsatisfying one at that.

	schema:reviewBody "By now on a steady downward spiral this fourth instalment of the FU MANCHU series lacks the spirit that made its predecessors entertaining. A further diminishing budget and some lazy execution from Spanish director Jess Franco make this film very hard to sit through let alone enjoy. The problem is that the cameras are all static throughout the film and the plot is basically a remake of the previous films in the series thus losing points for originality. Yet again Fu Manchu develops a deadly virus to destroy the world and yet again Nayland Smith and his friends must stop him.The plot in this film sidetracks so much that for much of the film Fu Manchu and Nayland Smith aren't actually involved. Instead there is some jungle intrigue involving a sweaty Indiana Joneswannabe and a huge greasy bandit who causes trouble for the local peasants. Suffice to say that the acting in these parts is alternatively stilted and over the top. As a plus at least the sweaty realism of the jungle is exploited in the full here.Christopher Lee returns as Fu Manchu but is given very very little to do here apart from providing the odd bit of menace in a scene or two. Tsai Chin does her thing as the cruel daughter while Richard Greene TALES FROM THE CRYPT takes over the role of Nayland Smith from previous contenders Nigel Green and Douglas Wilmer. Greene looks a bit out of place here and hardly registers but he does get to do the fun stereotypical stuffy Briton bit. The studio sets look cheap and tacky and the lighting is poor which has the bonus of making the jungle scenes look better.The violence level is about the same in the other films with a few bloody throats and faces all very cheaplooking. Manchu's redscarved servants have a pretty poor success ratio here for every one who commits a violent act another four are killed off by the good guys. As it's a Jess Franco film there's the added sleaze quotient with chained naked women and various Asian women getting their tops torn off. This isn't exactly a classic film but it passes the time if you're stuck for something to watch and at least it has that sleazy Franco atmosphere to it even if there isn't much going on.".

Now in the hands of the infamously prolific director Jess Franco. The next two Fu Manchu entries would be the death of the series which was started up by producer  writer Harry Alan Towers. Most people would label the 1969 The Castle of Fu Manchu as the worst but for me it was easily Blood. Both were sloppy ramshackle and messily plotted but Blood was downright flat and terribly dull for it. The uneventful side distractions South American bandits and overall padding just stalled the pacing and even magnifying the daftness of it all. The action was laboured and there was a real lack of adventure to this serial. Plenty of groping though but not much else. For most part it's uninspired in its direction. We would see Christopher Lee and Tsai Chin reprising their roles with malevolent glee. Lee going about things in the usual diabolical manner and Chin as glassy as ever. Outside of these two performances there's not much to it. Surprisingly the exotic jungle backdrop is made to good use by Franco. It looks lowrent but while some of the previous films had that cheap quality they were better handled than this project. Its limitations really do show it up. Franco tries to bring his trademark no not the zoom. But there's plenty of it use of sleaze and torture but it just feels forced and becomes a tired method sapping out any real sense of fun. In other words it's dreary and unpleasant but not effective in its execution to have any sort of impact. A wooden Richard Greene plays Fu Manchu's number one nemesis Nayland Smith but the story doesn't really give his character all that much to do mainly keeping him rather secondary. So it's not much of a battle between the two and the characters the plot seems to follow Gotz George  Ricardo Palacios don't leave much of an impression.

	schema:reviewBody "The fourth entry in the Fu Manchu series with Sir Christopher Lee is a very mild diversion at best. Lee playing the dastardly arch villain appears to be just going through the motions. This time his fiendish plan is to abduct a dozen sexy young women and use them as assassins. Their blood is filled with poison and they are dispatched to various major world cities to murder Fu Manchus' enemies. On the side of good are Fu Manchus' chief nemesis Nayland Smith Richard Greene Carl Jansen a socalled archaeologist Gotz George Dr. Petrie Howard MarionCrawford and Ursula Wagner Maria Rohm a nurse.Another collaboration between screenwriter  producer Harry Alan Towers and the extremely prolific director Jess Franco this is going to be awfully disappointing for those people that love Francos' ultrasleazy 1970s output. Titillation is minimal. As a jungle adventure  pulp nonsense bit of entertainment it's okay but it falls short of any potential. Overall it lacks style and energy and some viewers may even find it boring. Even the action scenes aren't very exciting. The location shooting in Spain and Brazil is adequate and there are some very fine looking ladies also including Shirley Eaton of Goldfinger fame as The Black Widow to add to the scenic value.Lee is just okay unfortunately although there is pleasure in watching Tsai Chin You Only Live Twice as Fu Manchus' sadist daughter Lin Tang and the lively MarionCrawford. Ricardo Palacios is amusing as a bandit leader but the film simply spends too much time with his uninteresting gang. Greene credited as a guest star doesn't get all that much to do.If you're a fan of Lee and  or Franco you could definitely do better than this.Five out of 10.".

On the side of good are Fu Manchus' chief nemesis Nayland Smith Richard Greene Carl Jansen a socalled archaeologist Gotz George Dr. Petrie Howard MarionCrawford and Ursula Wagner Maria Rohm a nurse.Another collaboration between screenwriter  producer Harry Alan Towers and the extremely prolific director Jess Franco this is going to be awfully disappointing for those people that love Francos' ultrasleazy 1970s output. Titillation is minimal. As a jungle adventure  pulp nonsense bit of entertainment it's okay but it falls short of any potential. Overall it lacks style and energy and some viewers may even find it boring. Even the action scenes aren't very exciting. The location shooting in Spain and Brazil is adequate and there are some very fine looking ladies also including Shirley Eaton of Goldfinger fame as The Black Widow to add to the scenic value.Lee is just okay unfortunately although there is pleasure in watching Tsai Chin You Only Live Twice as Fu Manchus' sadist daughter Lin Tang and the lively MarionCrawford. Ricardo Palacios is amusing as a bandit leader but the film simply spends too much time with his uninteresting gang. Greene credited as a guest star doesn't get all that much to do.If you're a fan of Lee and  or Franco you could definitely do better than this.Five out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Not so good. Christopher Lee's fourth outing as the world's most evil man is pretty tired. It's also decidedly OVER directed by shlockmeister Jess Franco. Endless zooms camera swirls and a lot of smoke abound. This time Lee attempts to kill off his enemies by having ten beautiful women infected with the venom of a snake give them a kiss of death. First up of course is Nayland Smith played by Richard Green. Set primarily in a South American jungle this film suffers greatly from some poor production values. Sped up fight scenes music when there shouldn't be and more often NO music when clearly there should be. It's not suspenseful in the least. The acting is soso with Lee giving it his all and Tsai Chin back as his equally nasty daughter. Maria Rohm and briefly Shirley Eaton also appear.".
