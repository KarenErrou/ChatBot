No doubt that this movie has good filmmakers behind the camera. Getting Naomi Watts starring was a great deal I know this was before she became a Hollywood star but she has a very charming and likable character and it fits her perfectly. Not only Naomi Watts but the whole cast is great and that's nothing usual in a CotC movie. Storywise is The Gathering a little different it is like crossing a virus film with Children of the Corn it kind of works i guess some might not like it I can see that. The Gathering has also a more serious tone and is much darker than previous movies. The Gathering is a different kind of CotC movie but almost all of them are different that's one of the things i like best about this series unlike Friday the 13th where every movie is exactly the same you know what they say Children of the Corn movies is like a box of chocolates.

	schema:reviewBody "Children of the Corn IV The Gathering is the fourth installment in the Children of the Corn series and was surprisingly a decent sequel. After the horrible monster effects in Part III's finale which almost completely ruined the movie for me I was hoping The Gathering would head in a new direction which it did. This sequel concerns a small town in the midwest. Naomi Watts plays Grace a medical student who returns to care for her mother and in turn her young siblings who begin to display a strange illness manifesting in all the town's children. Turns out that the cult of children are back trying to recruit more young'ns after killing their parents into their organization for he who walks behind the rows.No doubt one of the most memorable things about this film is Naomi Watts' performance who showed chops even her in her first lead role. I'm sure most people who see this will recognize her from the hit Japanese remake The Ring. Even still Children of the Corn IV The Gathering is one of the standout films of the series for a variety of other reasons. It is wellshot for one while it is a directtovideo picture it surprisingly doesn't really look like one. There is an unnerving sleepiness to the film that plays off of the bucolic midwestern set pieces and some phenomenally creepy sequences featuring Karen Black as Watts' agoraphobic mother. The film makes ample use of its dusty farmhouses and the sinister images of children lurking across the road.Granted the film does show its Bmovie teeth in some of the murder sequences which are far fetched and at times absurd but the splatter factor here is strong and the gore effects are rather convincing overall. Another obvious but vital element to this film working as well is it does is the strength of the performances. Watts again is great in her first lead here and Karen Black is phenomenal as she always is the role leaves her plenty of room to act out the eccentricities she does so well. Even the performances from the children are aboveaverage for a film like this.Overall if you're a fan of the series this is one of the better and perhaps maybe the best sequel. It's a Children of the Corn sequel so obviously it is not a flawless film but it is wellshot and there are a handful of genuinely effective moments to be had and the film paces itself well without devolving into schlock. Enjoy your straighttovideo splat with a side of Watts and Karen Black how can you go wrong? 710.".

An attempt at a cheap thrill these films are usually more laughable than scary.  But the Children of the Corn franchise is probably the most interesting of this genre.I remember renting this particular installment of Children of the Corn at the fresh young age of 14 for a slumber party with some friends.  We had all seen COTC 1 2 3 so what the heck why not check out 4?  There was nothing particularly different about the plot  again the children of a midwestern town all mysteriously turn evil killing their parents in interesting grotesque ways.  There were the same laughable moments in which writers contrive clever new ways for a child to kill an adult and the same lame horror film dialogue.  It was all the same.  Except one thing.The performance of the lead heroine was stunning!  Not your typical STV calibar performance but instead WOWcomplex understated and intense I was very impressed with the noname lead actress.Fast forward to seven years later in which I am reading an interview with my favorite new actress Naomi Watts and she mentions I was in Children of the Corn IV and ohmygosh the planets have aligned it all makes sense! This stellar actress was giving stellar performances long before she was cast into stellar movies.So the short of it if you are at all a fan of Naomi Watts this is not a bad one to get a glimpse of her preMulholland Dr. work.  Yeah it's campy and lame and gratuitously violent but with Naomi it's not so bad.Rating  4 out of 10 on the whole Naomi's Performance  7 out of 10".

I liked the fact that there was no mention whatsoever of He who walks behind the rows. That was the most annoying thing in the first two movies for me especially when it turns out it is in fact a god of the corn... that's just too far out. Instead we here have a preacher child who controls the children. I think that's a very good twist since now the enemy is personified. No black clouds no lightning and no moving corn. Much better. It does still have some of the cornyno pun intended stuff especially in some of the death scenes. It does have a better plot than both the first movies in my opinion but it's somewhat ruined by a few things bad acting by some of the actors a few ridiculous death scenes and at some points it is slow. I personally think the whole influenza thing was better than the lightning from the first two movies but some fans of the original might hate it. 710".

Not good enough to include anymore eh?!9 These Children Of The Corn movies except the first one aren't that good.

Undemanding horror fans will be pleased with the savagery of the killings one poor chump farmer REALLY gets it bad near the beginning and the areas' atmosphere.Plus there's a chance here to see a future Hollywood star paying her dues in this sort of thing and Watts does a solid job as the kind of tough intelligent ass kicking heroine certain to win audience favour. Veteran character actor Brent Jennings is likewise good in a rare major supporting role as the area resident who helps Grace save the day. Jamie Renee Smith is an appealing child actress as Graces' much younger sister. And Black  Windom are always good value in anything.All the necessary exposition  back story is dumped into one key scene and the attempt by the filmmakers to throw us for a loop with a supposed big twist doesn't really work.

	schema:reviewBody "Moving back to her small Nebraska hometown a medical student finds that the sudden series of child illnesses plaguing the town are caused by the rebirth of a dark figure attempting to corrupt the children to eliminate the adults and races to stop his plans.This one was far better than it should've been. One of the best aspect about this film was it's very high gore quotient as while there isn't all that huge of a body count what's there is some of the more imaginative kills in the genre. These are particularly brutal and are even more impressive in that they are all involved in some big action scenes. The main attack on the family sets this off nicely while the other attacks on the doctor in the hospital wing or the later scene of the nurse investigating the incident for herself and meets a similarly gruesome and brutal fate there all gives this a pretty enjoyable aspect and with some hallucinations thrown in it's quite a surprisingly gory effort. Aside from the fine gore it's also quite fun when it goes for the interweaving of it all through the action and story lines found in this. The opening half's dealing with the strange virus and the mystery is pretty well handled giving a glimpse of what's to come while even throwing a surprise into it as well with the resurrection being quite chilling and bringing about the attack on the family that makes for an overall fun time. The last good part here is that the ending confrontation is full of action and suspense as well with the big confrontations at the farm and out in the cornfields for the big firefilled approach which sends it out on a perfectly appropriate spectacle ending makes this one all quite fun. There really isn't a whole lot that really didn't work in this one and it's got to deal with the fact that it rarely has anything to do with the other films. It discards the cornfields and the psychobabble that the others dealt with and instead concentrates on a mysterious disease and the race to discover what it is. That is a wrong move for two reasons. It's already quite clear very early on what's going on as an early murder and resurrection is dealt with in this manner that goes undiscovered for quite a long time to be truly believable. By the time it's been discovered it's been so long coming that it's merely old hat by then which is very rare when a film is that far behind the audience as this one is. The other major problem is that it never once really put anyone that was supposed to survive in any danger of them possibly not making it. There's always a very easy way out of the suspenseful parts where they're supposed to be tortured and it's always a shame when it's all over so quickly and easily. It's decent enough but it's by no means all that spectacular entry in the series.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and several scenes of childrenindanger.".

	schema:reviewBody "Children of the Corn 4 is much more thought out than the rest of the sequels. The cut version that I have on DVD separates itself from the original story of he who walks behind the rows giving a fresh look to the franchise. A lot of question marks are raised throughout the beginning but nothing is really answered until the later half of the film.Grace Rhodes comes to her hometown of Grand Island Nebraska to take care of her mother June who is having nightmares of sick children. June has also become to paranoid to leave her front yard. In addition to looking after her mother she has to take care of her younger siblings. June's nightmares also include a young boy dressed in a preacher like outfit and we later find out his name is Josiah. Anyways June's visions of sick children comes true. All of the kids in Grand Island start becoming ill with high fevers and pretty soon their teeth begin to fall out. And that's when some of the adults in town begin dying off in gruesome ways.The big plot reveal told to viewers near the end of the film is that Josiah was taken in by some travelling preachers as a child and eventually became a very gifted preacher. Over the years Josiah never grew out of boyhood and stopped aging. The travelling preachers gave him over to darkness to stunt his growth but when word got out they abandoned him. Josiah killed the preachers and then the townspeople burned him alive and sealed his remains in a well. Grace also finds out that Josiah can control all of the children in the town by finding a child like himself a lie child. That child is Grace's sister Margaret. The lie surrounding Margaret is that she is actually Grace's daughter whom Grace abandoned years ago. It's up to Grace to destroy Josiah and save the children. Children of the Corn IV is a step up from part III. The films itself looked a lot cleaner and sophisticated then it's predecessor and I liked the franchise returning to the rural setting. There were some gory moments and genuinely scary scenes which was missing from the third film. I recommend it. Acting was great Naomi Watts had a good story...definitely one of the better sequels in the franchise.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah giant bug movies. If you're like me you fondly remember films like Them Tarantula and maybe even EightLegged Freaks. Insecticidal aims for that same genre...sort of. The premise is simple a sorority house gets attacked by giant bugs. You know how this movie will go. People will be hacked apart by the merciless arthropods the house will be turned into a battleground and yes there will be lesbians.In all truth there are decent parts to this film. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously acknowledging at points its own cheesiness. The actors and actresses who play our main characters pull off their lessthanShakespearean lines pretty well. And of course there is eye candy to be found here.Unfortunately the film suffers from painful amounts of stupidity when it comes to the bugs and pretty much anything involving them. For instance Cammy the nerd we know she's a nerd because she wears glasses creates the monsters by accident. That would work for this setting except for the REASON behind it. She states that she was mocked by her professors for her outlandish theory that insects used to be the dominant species and that she was experimenting on them to prove that they had dormant genes. A combination of these experiments and some pesticide exposure activated these genes and made the bugs grow huge.First the claims that bugs were once dominant on Earth No  Sherlock! Back in the Carboniferous period 300 million years ago arthropods DID rule the world. There were dragonflies with 3foot wingspans centipedemillipede relatives from 5 to 10 feet long and scorpions 3 feet long. The idea that any modern scientist would mock Cammy for stating what's already true is just idiotic.Second the whole dormant genes idea It's possible although REALLY unlikely that modern arthropods do hold dormant genes from their Carboniferous ancestors but how the heck did Cammy manage to turn those genes on? It remains a mystery.Insecticidal also suffers from what I like to call pseudointelligence. When the filmmakers want you to think that a character is smart they have him or her use really long words even if those words make no sense. When the giant praying mantis appears Cammy classifies it with a long Latinsounding name. The problem is that the praying mantis's REAL scientific name is simply Mantis religiosa The final thing that hurts this film is that the special effects aren't so special. If brought to life effectively and accurately the giant insects arachnids and other invertebrates in Insecticidal could be terrifying. The praying mantis a major enemy in the movie has a ridiculous Kermitthefrog mouth and the annoying habit of knocking people to the ground and apparently whacking them repeatedly with its forelegs. A real praying mantis attack is far more disturbing it's spiny forelegs snatch prey in the blink of an eye and simply hold it there while the insect's bladelike mouthparts methodically chew through the living victim. That would have been far more frightening than being slapped to death by Kermit the bug.There are so many things wrong with this movie herbivorous stag and rhinoceros beetles are shown eating people as well as everything I already mentioned that I can't rank it highly. That said I'm actually recommending this film. It's so incredibly bad that you can have your own Mystery Science Theatre night with it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ah giant bug movies. If you're like me you fondly remember films like Them Tarantula and maybe even EightLegged Freaks. Insecticidal aims for that same genre...sort of. The premise is simple a sorority house gets attacked by giant bugs. You know how this movie will go. People will be hacked apart by the merciless arthropods the house will be turned into a battleground and yes there will be lesbians.In all truth there are decent parts to this film. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously acknowledging at points its own cheesiness. The actors and actresses who play our main characters pull off their lessthanShakespearean lines pretty well. And of course there is eye candy to be found here.Unfortunately the film suffers from painful amounts of stupidity when it comes to the bugs and pretty much anything involving them.

That's basically what this movie is about  hot babes getting attacked by hilarious looking CGI bugs. Lots of sexual situations and a very light hearted sense of Bmovie fun. If you liked stuff like Sorority House Massacre II  Nighty Nightmare or Sorority Babes in the Slimeball BowloRama you'll love this. Several topless babes almost everyone else in bikini's an Asian babe getting all sweaty doing her martial arts workout and one other girl in a seethrough Tshirt with a black bra and truly magnificent amounts of cleavage. I though it was going to explode or something! The whole movie is spent with the giant bugs chasing everyone around while the nerdy girl tries to figure out how to undo what she's created. A good time was had by all! Highly recommended for horny adolescents or anyone else with a love for Bmovies and a sense of humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Insecticidal is an enjoyable but flawed giant insect movie.SPOILERSCollege student Cami Meghan Heffern is excited about her growing bug collection much to the annoyance of her sorority housemates Josi Rhonda Dent Sophi Samantha McLeod and Fumi Vicky Huang as well as her boyfriend Martin Shawn Bachynski and the other students there. After the failure of an experiment she desperately wanted to try she gives up and calls it a failure. As soon as it's finished the members of the sorority and their friends start disappearing. When strange slime and insect body parts are found at each place Cami decides to investigate and thinks that her bugs have survived and grown to gigantic size. Not believing her soon several attacks occur in front of them they finally believe her and have to find a way to survive the attacks.The Good News As far as giant insect movies go this one wasn't as bad as it could've been. The film has a quirky sense of humor that is quite nice. It needs it as the tone fits the subject matter perfectly with the goofy tone since a serious tone with the way it's presented would never work at all. It needed a goofy tone and the film benefits for it greatly. A lot of the jokes and situations work and it makes the film a lot more entertaining to. The film is also pretty gory for its type and makes good use of it's splatter effects and some are pretty realistic. The blood is freely strewn about resulting in some nice kills in this. There's a bloody dismembering a neverending stream of body parts flying around. We also get a very fast paced plot to this ensuring that everything is rapidly coming up on each other allowing for a continuous stream of scenes to keep on coming down the pike. That was greatly appreciated.The Bad News It simply has to be said that these are some of the worst looking creatures ever in these kinds of films. Calling them worse than video game designs is an insult to video game creations. These are simply atrocious and under no circumstance are they worthy of inducing fear of them. They don't match the scenery they've been inserted into they hardly match their surroundings and at times can hardly move realistically. There are naturally many scenes that go on that don't make much sense or aren't really explained adequately. The reason for the bugs becoming big is hinted at but never officially explained. A couple of big scenes are also kinda confusing when thought about afterward and really didn't need to be included. The cheese factor is also very high on this one and it can be a turnoff for those that don't like it. It's not that subtle and can be found pretty easily.The Final Verdict While it's not the worst creature feature to come along it's not one of the best ones either. It has a sense of fun and energy but it's hurt by several factors. For fans of the style this is definitely worthy of a look but those that are put off by the weaker parts are advised to seek caution or avoid all together.Rated  Nudity Graphic Violence some Language and several varying sex scenes".

	schema:reviewBody "A sorority house is besieged by genetically mutated bugs that have been inadvertently bred by an ambitious yet reclusive science student vying for PhD honours. Cheerful light and mostly entertaining horrorcomedy made on a shoestring budget merges house party slasher themes and the more conventional giant bug movie to pleasing effect. The bookish Cinderella scientist taunted by her arguably more attractive sorority sisters certainly more sexually active proves to be the only person capable of defeating the nemeses after most of the party are dismembered. Nudity abounds with the resident hussy bouncing from one bone head to the next before ignorantly ingesting larvae that transforms her into a queen vessel for the mutant spawn. Not being the sharpest tool in the shed she misdiagnoses the metamorphosis as an STD and attempts to treat accordingly with antibacterial scrub with comical results. She in turn proves to be as much a threat as the bugs themselves even attempting to cannibalise her companions while appearing to drift in and out of lucidity.It's essentially American Pie meets Friday the 13th with a few man or in this case womaneating bugs added for seasoning. All the college house party motifs are on display hot tubs beauty queens Asian students lesbian encounters jocks and good old fashioned SM  no theme is considered taboo. Despite the student film quality to this flick the photography and sound departments are competent the CGI effects on the other hand are the key liability to success. There's little interaction between the characters and the CGI monsters just an occasional severed mandible or inanimate roach casing to fuse the two layers. Still it is quite amusing watching the guy wrestle a giant roach from his face while attempting to satisfy his Gothic girlfriend's demand for cunnilingus.And while there's a whole second hand store full of dismembered limbs buckets of gravy and plenty of goo and slime it's all quite tame and unrealistic. The R rating surely is reserved for the endless procession of nudity and sex that seems to be a precursor to each climax so to speak. The production designer Sean Whale appears to have been so instrumental to the production that he's allowed to indulge in a meaningless walkon in the closing scene as the characters lament the potential for repetition and a nod to the prospect of an as yet unrealised sequel. Entertaining but perhaps for all the wrong reasons.".

The other girls aren't too happy with Cammi  her bugs running around the place so Josi Rhonda Dent takes it upon herself to spray all of Cami's experiments with insect killer problem sorted. Well that's what Josi thought but it turns out that by spraying the bugs with insect killer actually made them all grow bigger  make them more intelligent again I really don't know why. Now with large killer bugs on the loose Cami  the surviving girls must find a way to escape before they become bug food...This Canadian made Ceature Feature was produced  directed by Jeffery Scott Lando  if you think the ScFi Channel made Creature Features such as Boa vs. Python 2004 or Komodo vs. Cobra 2005 were bad then think again because Insecticidal plunders new depths. The script by Jeff O'Brien could have been quite fun I mean the basic premise surrounding a bunch of pretty young teenage girls being killed off by a variety of large bugs is a simple one but had potential. Unfortunately the whole film is so badly plotted  made that Insecticidal makes Mega Snake 2007 look like a masterpiece. There are scenes which don't make any logical sense for a start how did that bug get inside the pizza box  then close the lid? There is a scene when two of the character's are attacked by a large scorpion  they hide inside the basement closing the door behind them but when we see those two girls again they are in the living room so what happened to the scorpion  how did they get out of the basement? There is a scene early on where we see giant slugs but they are never shown again  why does noone in the street not notice an eight foot tall Mantis in the girls garden? Why do the girls not try to call anyone? I know they call the police who think they are playing a joke but do they not know any other people they could phone  ask for help? The whole film is poorly paced it's as dull as dishwater it's predictable  there are many scenes that just don't work on any logical sense.Director Lando was probably working on a low budget but one has to say that Insecticidal is reasonably well filmed I say reasonably because I don't want to make it sound like it's amazing or anything but at least it doesn't look like it was shot on a camcorder. There's no shaky photography no quick cut editing  no post production annoying editing techniques either which is nice. However the scenes when the girls are attacked by the bugs are terrible they are so static  it's so obvious that the girls are fighting thin air. Now I suppose I have to talk about the special effects. Firstly the bugs aren't that big there's a scorpion for instance which is about the same size as your average dog. Then there's the CGI computer effects surely Insecticidal has the worst CGI bug effects of any film ever made. They are simply terrible they look like they were rendered on a really low end home PC. I don't think I would be exaggerating if I claimed that with the PC I currently have I could have animated better looking bugs. They look truly awful  wouldn't even get into a children's cartoon series.Technically the film overall is a complete mess despite the photography looking alright the CGI computer effects as already mentioned are simply embarrassing. Filmed in British Columbia in Canada. The acting isn't particularly good although the girls are all pretty good looking which helps.Insecticidal may have a clever title but as a Creature Feature it blows the CGI computer effect bugs are truly the worst of their kind that I have seen. The story is full of holes  predictable as well even die hard Creature Feature fans should avoid this one.".

I originally thought at least prepubescent boys might like this movie for the female eye candy but looking at the laughable CGI I think they would hate this movie also. The plot is lame acting is so bad where the reality shows are Oscar material compared to this. Did I mentioned the special effects or lack of? The CGI looks like it were done not on a Commodore 64 like the above commenter mentioned but on a Tandy TRS80. Especially the Praying Mantis it looks like someone did not even bothered to look at an insect book an Animal Planet documentary or even the old bw scifi movie THE DEADLY MANTIS to get an accurate rendition of the a praying mantis. Imagine a crudely drawn bug ala 5 yo kid with a Kermit the Frog head and you pretty much get the idea how bad the mantis was created. I think everyone involved made this movie for some film class they are taking at the college they maybe attending. I can not believe they took themselves seriously when they made this barf bag of a film. I just want to say to future film students watch this as a lesson IN NOT WHAT MAKE and you will live a long happy life.".

	schema:reviewBody "I see I've given this movie a higher rating than most. I freely admit this a bad bad movie. Yet as horrible as this movie is it's still entertaining to watch which is why my overall rating pulls the film up. For starters Insecticidal is like the female eye candy version of Leeches! In other words it's a bad giant invertebrate movie except nearly all the characters are hot girls as opposed to Leeches! where they're nearly all male models. Otherwise the similarities are so striking I was surprised to learn the two movies weren't done by the same director. Basically girls live in a sorority house where one Cami has an affinity for bugs and is doing a thesis on them for class. The most popular girls in the sorority gets so enraged at bugs crawling around the house one of them startles her while she's banging some guy that she sprays insecticide all over Cami's room and kills the bugs. OR SO SHE THINKS!!!... In fact the insecticide somehow causes the bugs to mutate to prehistoric proportions and they start killing off sorority sisters the night of a wild party. Anyway this movie is clearly not going to win any awards. The creature effects may be the worst since the old 1950s Bmovies. They look like they could have been done on a Commodore64 home computer. At times the killer insects even look like cartoon characters. The whole premise if you spray insecticide on your pests they will actually mutate into monsters is just silly although I give them credit for not dwelling on it. There's no interestkilling 15minutesofscientificexplanation scene that most other scifi movies feel obliged to feature to justify their existence. And for all the carnage it's disappointing how effortlessly Cami  Co. kill the insects. Yet if you're willing to sit through a sobadit'sgood movie Inseciticidal does have some redeeming qualities. It's actionpacked almost two straight hours of kills with virtually no down time in the movie. It's interesting to note that according to the opening scene and credits this entire movie takes place in the span of about six hours. There's a lot of eye candy here and to be honest though they try to stereotype Cami in the glasseswearinggirlnerd role she is the hottest of the bunch. And if you're paying attention the writers are having some fun here. For example if you look at the house from the outside you notice the girls are members of the Beta Upsilon Gamma sorority whose abbreviation would be BUG. Clearly Insecticidal will never be considered mentioned in the same sentence such classics as Alien or The Thing but it's a good take if you're in the mood for a mindless flick. I give it a 4.".

The bugs try to kill everyone in the house. The stereotypes that pass for characters have to fight back.I'm hesitant to complain at how bad the special effects are since it doesn't make much difference when a movie is this lame. Bottom Line it looked like it was a sure thing. I didn't like it at all.SIDE NOTE It's surprising how many giant monster movies just aren't that much fun. You'd think all the filmmakers would have to do is make a few miniature sets and let the destruction happen. I guess it's harder than that because along with this movie the monsters have been disappointing in a number of recent cheesefests I was disappointed with Kraa the Sea Monster GodzillaFinal Wars and MegaShark Vs. Giant Octopus. In the case of MegaShark I enjoyed the movie they just didn't show much of the monsters.".

If it was to be a comedy I would go buy that kind of acting but here sorry no can do.

The rest all disappeared into bad flicks or stopped acting.But I guess they all knew that it wasn't what it was to be so there is a shower scene were we have gratuitous nudity full shaved frontal. Further we have some kinky chick getting into SM but naturally they all got attacked by the bugs. Maybe the best ones were the slugs if they all could have looked like them then it could have been great. But the SyFy look of the bugs teared this flick really into a turkey. There's almost no blood in it and if it does it isn't scary or gory on any part.

The insects are also given strange names such as Evander Holyfield Louis Joe.Amateurish acting stupid dialogue and almost no gore make this movie unwatchable.

Later a nerdy guy come salong to visit his lady friends only to see here she is again only a few scratches and pounced by the mutant Kermit the frog.The amount of times people walked into a room or up to the sorority house WITHOUT noticing the giant mantis and other enormous creatures. Suddenly the look to their right and it was there the whole time. How did they not notice that?? The one thing I found just great was the girl who can't act at all but has a huge rack kills a giant beetle with a blender.

This was a West German coproduction nominally set In England and very loosely based on an Edgar Wallace novel which connects it to the West German krimi series a more obscure series than the Italian gialli but a clear influence on the latter. Stylistically this colorful and garish film is much more of a giallo than a krimi but influence is there and it features Joachim Fuchsberger and Karin Bal who were both popular actors in the earlier krimis in supporting roles .Perhaps even more interesting is the connection between this movie and the AmericanCanadian slasher films. Along with Bay of Blood Schoolgirl Killer Torso the Spanish film La Residencia and the British film Assault this was one of the European films that received the widest release stateside and probably had the greatest influence on the early slasher genre. This movie kicked off what could be called the schoolgirl gialli. Unlike the other gialli which focused on decadent adult European jetsetters but like the slasher films the schoolgirl giallo had seemingly innocent adolescent protagonists being picked off by a deviant but often moralistic killer. But while the slasher movie victims were merely guilty of promiscuity and other typically irresponsible teen behavior their schoolgirl gialli peers were engaged in behavior that one hopes even in Europe at the time wasn't typicalie. teen prostitution sex orgies backalley abortions.Even though it was made years earlier this movie is actually a lot sleazier but also much better made than the vast majority of slasher films. The hero is a gym teacher at a private girl's college who witnesses one of the murders. The problem is he was schtupping one of his students in a rowboat at the time! It greatly helps though that this character is played by the very likable Fabio Testi. It also helps that none of the girls is especially believable as a sixth formerthe victims who are dispatched in very unpleasant and fullfrontal fashion are too voluptuous to be believable as teenagers while the two female leadsSpaniard Cristina Galbo and American Camille Keaton were actually both in their early twenties at the time and at the very height of their very considerable beauty. Most importantly however this movie is very wellmade and stylistic with an excellent musical score. Director Massimo Dallamano ranks right up there with Mario Bava Dario Argento Lucio Fulci and Sergio Torso Martino as one of the true masters of the Italian giallo thrillers.For what it's worth I personally own over 120 Italian gialli and though I would be loath to rank all of them I would certainly put this one in the top five.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a remarkable film! In spite of high expectations and entirely praising comments by fellow Horror fans Massimo Dallamano's Cosa Avete Fatto A Solange aka. What Have You Done To Solange of 1972 was still capable of astonishing me with its brilliance. This complex and mesmerizing film delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect and stands out as one of the most ingenious Gialli ever made. I am an avid fan of Gialli and this is an absolute mustsee for every fan of this great subgenre. What Have You Done To Solange is not only essential to those who share my enthusiasm for Italian Horror cinema however. Be it the convoluted plot the ingenious camera work the brilliant score by Maestro Ennio Morricone or the constant tantalizing suspense  there is not a single aspect that is not brilliant about this stunning film that I highly recommend to any suspenselover in general.Henry Rossini Fabio Testi a married Italian teacher at a Catholic London private school for girls has an affair with one of his students Christina Galb. When they are having a romantic boatride on the Thames the girl suddenly yells that she has just seen a knife. Henry first laughs her claims off as hysteria until the body of another girl also one of his students is found right at the exact same spot the following day. It is not long until other murders of girls occur all carried out in the same horrid manner...The film is not as gory as many other brilliant Gialli such as Dario Argento's films but the manner in which the murders are carried out is more than a bit nasty. The film has one of the most compelling plots ever in Horror cinema and is stunningly suspenseful from the very beginning. The eerie atmosphere is even intensified by a brilliant and mesmerizing score by none other than the great Ennio Morricone. The brilliant cinematography was done by Joe D'Amato the infamous 'king of sleaze' himself who shocked audiences in the 80s when he directed gruesome productions such as Antropophagus and Buio Omega. The performances are also excellent. Fabio Testi who is famous among fans of Italian genrecinema mainly for starring in crime and police flicks stars in his most memorable role here. Karin Baal is excellent as his German wife and Joachim Fuchsberger delivers a solid performance as the investigating police detective. Great performances also come from the sexy female cast most memorably from Camille Keaton who is best known for the infamous Exploitation shocker I Spit On Your Grave of 1978.Like two other excellent Gialli Argento's Bird With The Crystal Plumage and Lenzi's Seven BloodStained Orchids this was heavily cut and sold as an Edgar Wallace film in Germany. People in German speaking countries Avoid the mutilated German version and get uncut international versions instead. This is brilliant suspense cinema at its finest and an uncut version is absolutely essential! I could go on praising this film forever but instead I will end my review with a recommendation Get What Have You Done To Solange as soon as you possibly can! It is easily one of the most compelling Gialli ever made and absolutely essential for every Horrorlover to see! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? 1972 Enrico Rossini Fabio Testi is a married teacher involved in an affair with one of his students Elizabeth Christine Galb. One afternoon in a park while enjoying one of their amorous trysts Elizabeth witnesses the murder of a young woman a crime that her lover does not see. When the corpse of a student is found at the park the teacher finally believes Elizabeth and decides to revisit the scene of the murder. More girls are killed and the police begin to suspect that Enrico is the murderer. In a desperate attempt to clear his name Enrico turns detective and eventually discovers the secret of a young woman named Solange Camille Keaton whose shocking past is linked to both the killer's choice of victims and the gruesome manner in which he dispatches them. This solidly plotted and engrossing murder thriller is easily among the finest galls ever made. The conventional storyline is enlivened with genuinely surprising twists strong characters and a shocking unexpected ending. Slickly directed by Massimo Dallamano and featuring striking cinematography by Aristide Massachessi who as Joe D'Amato had a subsequent career as one of the most incompetent directors of all time SOLANGE is an unusually well made and restrained Italian thriller. Excellent performances from Fabio Testi Joachin Fuchsberger Karin Baal and the beautiful Christine Galbo raise the movie's quality level even higher. A fine moody Ennio Morricone score provides some necessary tension enhancement. If you've never seen a Gilli before the film is a great starting point for anyone interested in taking an initial plunge into this fascinating genre. The Shriek Show DVD is one of this small company's finest releases yet. The widescreen 1.851 transfer features gorgeous colors and sharp detailing with only a few speckles hair marks and some modest print damage. The movie itself is the real prize here as the extras are fairly skimpy A poster and lobby card gallery is scored to the movie's main title theme and a nice 12 page booklet is provided with liner notes and quite a few stills. Finally five trailers are included for SOLANGE itself and some other related Shriek Show releases. Despite the lack of enticing extras this is a worthy addition to any horrorsuspense enthusiast's DVD library.".

If you are reading this review then the likelihood is that you already know firsthand or have a very good idea of what a great giallo thriller this film is. I don't want to say too much because as anyone who has seen this film already knows divulging even the most minor details can potentially spoil everything. This much I CAN say Elizabeth is a young woman having an affair with her married Catholic high school teacher Henry. One one rendezvous she witnesses what she believes to be a murder committed by a man dressed like a priest. Sure enough the body of one of Elizabeth's classmates turns up and not long after more of her classmates show up dead. The only apparent link is that all of them are attending the same Catholic high school and all of them are killed in the same shocking manner I won't divulge the vital MO used by the killer but I will say that you'll be glad it's not explicitly shown!. But as sophisticated giallo fans know there is indeed a connection between this string of dead girls. It's up to Elizabeth Henry and Herta to uncover the dark secret of exactly what has been done to Solange... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? gets off to a rather slow start and I have to admit that for the first 30 min or so I thought that the film was going to be a vastly overrated disappointment. However much to my satisfaction I was quite wrong. Although it takes a while to get there once this movie gets going it simply does not let up. That's not to say that it has a particularly fast pace but the story unfolds with so many twists and turns and new characters that mystery fans will be tingling with glee. As if the intriguing title were not enough the slowly but surely unfolding technique of the screenplay will leave your mouth watering for a big pay off. And unlike 99 of otherwise good thrillers this movie has an extraordinary denouement. The final minutes of the film will shock you stun you and have you starting the film all over again. Furthermore the killer's identity in the film is not only a surprise but it also makes perfect sense in the context of the story...a rare feat achieved in thrillers but one which caps off the film quite nicely to say the least!. I would not go so far as to say that I could see this film being writtendirected by Dario Argento because it is not quite as exciting or edgy or offbeat as his works. However unlike many of the giallo thrillers that have managed to make it to the US dozens and dozens were produced in Italy during the early 70s only a fraction of which were distributed in the US one way or another Solange is a film which can certainly be ranked on the same level as some of Argento's classics. I might not put it up there with Deep Red or Tenebre but I'd certainly place it on the same ranks as The Animal Trilogy. Even if you have never seen this film before I can assure you that it will be worth owning for any fans of thrillersgialliItalian horror. It's simply stunning and speaking as an avid fan of Hitchcock Bava and Argento I cannot recommend it enough. My Grade A".

The camera closes in on Elizabeth's eyes as she finally succumbs to the older man's advances when images flash suddenly across the screen  a girl running an outstretched hand the flash of a blade  courtesy of some seamless editing. It's an exercise in how unsettling something can be when occurring on a bright sunny day. It also employs Argento's recurrent motif of skewed perception. Elizabeth Cristina Galb is unsure of what she's actually seen and Enrico Fabio Testi exasperated by what he assumes are delay tactics brings the boat to shore.The following morning a body has been found on the same stretch of the Thames. A girl from Elizabeth's school has been knifed to death in a manner that will have you crossing your legs for the duration. Having left behind a piece of evidence which places him near the scene of the crime and later caught on camera among a throng of onlookers by a TV crew covering the story Enrico the girls' tutor finds himself with some explaining to do. It's not long before others fall victim to the maniac and as pieces of the puzzle are uncovered little by little the mystery seems tied to a particular clique of students and their association with the enigmatic girl in the title who left the school suddenly the year before.Right from the start we're in very assured hands. This is a giallo which pretty much has it all balancing the stranger in a strange land figure Enrico compelled by circumstance to find out his own answers to a series of brutal murders by a blackgloved killer with a police procedural element which for once is treated with absolute seriousness and a deft touch. Joachim Fuchsberger Inspector Barth gives arguably the best portrayal in the genre of an investigator in charge being neither bumbling comic relief nor bullish misogynist caricature. Everything is treated with care and reverence relying on solid fingerprint policing rather than outlandish pseudoscience which in itself raises the film a few notches above average. Every clue every red herring every motive is duly noted and accounted for and used to drive the story along a series of ever darker revelations.Along the way Dallamano is careful to anticipate our anticipation and gives little twists throughout to narrative and character. Enrico's wife Herta Karin Baal starts life almost as a parody of both the wronged wife and the Teutonic blonde think Helga from 'allo 'allo with her blouse buttoned up gradually becoming a more nuanced genuinely sympathetic individual. Enrico as the tutor engaged in an affair with one of his students is painted in shades of grey rather than as the complete louse we might expect and when the illusive Solange whose presence here is something akin to Hitchcock's smoking gun makes her entrance via a quirk of serendipity shared with the viewer alone she resembles a pallid version of Botticelli's Venus the subtlety of which only becomes clear with time. Even perfectly innocent London street names Evelyn Gardens take on more sinister connotations.What impresses most is how Dallamano  mindful of his choice of victim  manages to foster a feeling of genuine shock in everyone right down to the minor players and makes some effort to deal with the aftereffects of the killings. A scene where Barth interviews the shellshocked parents of the first girl is sensitively handled and admirably underplayed. In a neat piece of editing the father's reaction to the facts of his daughter's demise is transported into the following scene at the girl's funeral. The sleazier aspects of this schoolgirl slasher are on the face of it at least mitigated somewhat by the fact the schoolgirls are actually eighteen and everyone looks about five years older than they are. The requisite nudity is largely confined to the girls' shower room and beyond mere titillation these scenes epitomise the film's undercurrents of secrecy and confession as the girls share whispered confidences while we are led by the camera into collusion with the local peeping tom POVstyle through a hole in the wall.In doing so the film points to the viewer and to itself via a form of oblique morality play. It's no coincidence that the river bank murder and Elizabeth's further recall occur during the film's two seduction scenes symbolically the threat being as much to Elizabeth's virtue from Enrico's ardent wedding tackle intent on a little death of its own as much as from the killer's knife. Placed in context Solange? is set in a period when society was still coming to grips with all the swinging that began a decade before. On the surface it's a gripping Italian thriller with all the key elements in place and where the killer's true motive holds water but at its core it can be viewed as a subversion of the giallo genre lamenting on innocence lost and the accelerated haste with which child becomes adult often stumbling in the process both then and now leaving its audience to ponder some uncomfortable truths. This is an outstanding entry in the genre and an affecting slice of cinema with quality dubbing and a widescreen presentation that makes the most of its outdoor settings creating a nostalgia for a London long gone.".

	schema:headline " A seriously good giallo";
	schema:reviewBody "What Have They Done to Solange? puts all of it's efforts into the mystery that it is uncovering. Unlike a lot of giallo this one doesn't put the focus on overly gory death scenes and use the mystery as an excuse to string them together it's focus is the mystery and the murders are secondary to it. Due to the graphic and sexual nature of the death scenes however this is probably a good thing. The plot of the movie follows an investigation of the death of a schoolgirl. After the death a teacher at the school Enrico becomes the main suspect because of his close affiliation to several of the girls in his class. When more schoolgirls turn up dead Enrico and his wife decide to try and solve the murder themselves.The mystery pans out very intricately and small clues as to who is the murder and their motive are given out slowly as the film goes along thus keeping your interest but not giving you enough to chew on so that you will be able to solve the mystery but it does give you enough to chew so that you will be able to develop theories as to who the murderer is. This is a very good thing as it makes sure that the film is interesting throughout and it is guaranteed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Trust me you'll be begging to know who and why after the amount of suspense this movie builds up. That's not to say that this movie is all build up either it pays off the viewer's patience at the end with a conclusion that is satisfyingly tragic and also one that makes sense and thereby gives the murderer and his intent a definite degree of potency and we can even feel a little bit for him. A lot of Italian horror movies seem to fall down at the end as their conclusion doesn't make perfect sense but that is not true of this movie and that is a definite plus point.This movie is given another edge over a lot of other giallo thanks to a great score by the king of great scores Ennio Morricone. As usual Morricone's score fits the film and gives it more reason to be memorable. The acting in What Have They Done to Solange? is not one of its main plus points but it's not bad either. The screenplay is great though mostly due to the fact that it doesn't feature anything that's needless and it keeps developing for the entire duration of the movie and this therefore makes sure that the viewer has to pay absolute attention to the film as missing two minutes of it could result in missing something important to the mystery and it therefore ties the viewer to the movie in that way. This movie isn't as heavy on style as other giallos as previously mentioned there's no overly gory death sequences but it more than makes up for this loss in style with an abundance of substance and that is better for this kind of intricate mystery.Overall What They Done to Solange? is an absolute highlight of the giallo style and is therefore recommended to anyone that likes this kind of movie. Unfortunately What Have They Done to Solange is not readily available and that therefore means that people that want it will have to dig for it but trust me it's worth it.".

	onyx:emotionText "What Have They Done to Solange? puts all of it's efforts into the mystery that it is uncovering. Unlike a lot of giallo this one doesn't put the focus on overly gory death scenes and use the mystery as an excuse to string them together it's focus is the mystery and the murders are secondary to it. Due to the graphic and sexual nature of the death scenes however this is probably a good thing. The plot of the movie follows an investigation of the death of a schoolgirl. After the death a teacher at the school Enrico becomes the main suspect because of his close affiliation to several of the girls in his class. When more schoolgirls turn up dead Enrico and his wife decide to try and solve the murder themselves.The mystery pans out very intricately and small clues as to who is the murder and their motive are given out slowly as the film goes along thus keeping your interest but not giving you enough to chew on so that you will be able to solve the mystery but it does give you enough to chew so that you will be able to develop theories as to who the murderer is. This is a very good thing as it makes sure that the film is interesting throughout and it is guaranteed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

While the less said about its twistyturny story the better I can mention that the plot here concerns a string of brutal murders that have been plaguing an allgirls' Catholic school in London and the hunky Italian gym teacher well played by Fabio Testi who is having an affair with one of the young women the gorgeous Spanish actress Christine Galbo. But things get a bit complicated when this student witnesses one of the murders during a Thames pleasure outing... Regarding those murders perhaps brutal isn't a strong enough word to describe them as this giallo nutjob has a tendency to stick his knife...well this is a family Web site so perhaps I shouldn't say. Mercifully these slayings are not at all graphicthe picture would have been rated XXX if they were and would have been too terrible to watch. Indeed this film features hardly any gore at all the suggested acts are quite bad enough. Still this is an excellent example of the giallo genre with a meaty involving story numerous shiftyeyed suspects loads of pretty women and the requisite murder set pieces. Massimo Dallamano has directed his film impeccably eliciting fine performances from every player the legendary Ennio Morricone has supplied an alternately lovelycreepy score and cameraman Aristide Massacasi has nicely captured the beauty of London and its countryside. The film has been superbly dubbedindeed it looks as if the actors were originally speaking in English!but the image on the Shriek Show DVD that I just saw looks cropped at the edges as the opening and closing credits reveal. Also I couldn't get the extras to work for some reason. Still the film looks clean and bright and is not to be missed. It was even better the second time I watched it!".

A good bit of sleazy violence and titsandass should also make this enjoyable to exploit fans out there.Girls are being murdered at an allgirls school by a crotch stabbing weirdo. One of the teachers who was involved with a student is initially suspected  but turns out it wasn't him after all. After the student that he was seeing gets the ol' knifeinthevag treatment he takes it upon himself to aid the police in the investigation to find out who might be the killer...The subject matter of SOLANGE is suitably sleazy without going overboard so giallo fans who aren't so into the harder material should still be able to dig this one while still appealing to the rougher exploit fans out there. A good storyline good performances and some suitable twists make this one a solid entry. Definitely recommended to giallo and exploit fans. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "An authentic and purely storydriven Giallo. That's how to describe this film best. Solange' easily is one of the most compelling films I ever saw and the plot is pure gold! Several girls from a strict Catholic school are brutally murdered by a priest or someone who's disguised as a priest. Police and teachers are unable to locate the killer and prevent further deaths. Enrico the handsome young teacher who has a romantic interest in one of the student becomes the main suspect pretty quick. After he's proven innocent he teams up with his estranged wife and decides to unmask the murderer himself. You really have to be careful when promoting this film to potential viewers. The film actually is one giant mystery that never stops developing itself. The synopsis I described above may sound dreadfully typical and djvu but you don't know half of it I swear. That's what I appreciated so much about this film. The plot never stops thickening and the entire background of the killings isn't revealed until the very last minute! For example...I was closely paying attention to all the girls who get killed but not once the name Solange' is mentioned until the police and other amateur detectives are already on a dead end with their guesses and investigations. I think the whole premise is terrifically kept secret to the viewer and the clues are only given one by one. Let me tell you this film digs real deep! You can't but respect the writing talent that features in this film. Unfortunately Solange isn't a visual masterpiece like other specialists like Dario Argento make them. The budget clearly is limited and the film doesn't contain as much stylish gruesomeness as Profondo Rosso' for example. But the substance is there and in cases like this it's more than enough to keep you entertained. Another praise goes out to the musical guidance. Ennio Morricone supplied this film with a wondrous and memorable score that lifts up the film to an even higher dimension. The opening sequence is burnt on my retina forever thanks to the music which surely is Morricone's most effective nonwestern scores I heard till now. The acting performances are in conformity with the Italian standardsnot highly impressive but bearable. Camille Keaton plays the mysterious Solange' character. This name might ring a bell if you're a trained horror lover as she played the leading role in the notorious film I spit on your Grave'. In the rather exclusive culthorror universe this film stands as a masterpiece in my opinion. Admirers of rare undiscovered gems will truly appreciate this film and regard it as highly as I do. Solange' comes with my highest possible recommendation.".

However unlike Argento's work many of these subsequent Giallo films lacked the style and confidence of the master's grand vision making up for the often limited grasp of cinematic expertise with a more lurid subject matter and an exploitative reliance on shock scenes and depravity. Though 'What Have They Done to Solange?' 1972 certainly has elements of this it remains a success regardless mixing an interesting story that reveals itself gradually as the film progresses whilst simultaneously establishing a largely satisfying approach to the depiction of the characters in which almost anyone could be a seen as potential victim or indeed a potential suspect.The atmosphere created in the film grabs our attention from the first scene on juxtaposing the pastoral serenity of the uncharacteristically British locations  and the traditional bourgeois even middleclass environment of boarding schools and trendy London flats against which the story plays out  alongside a typically perverse sense of immorality murder and worse. The girls school setting is obviously used for the purposes of pure exploitation as famed cinematographer turned film director Massimo Dallamano treats us to an early scene in the girls' changing room as the young ladies wander around full frontal in an early precursor to Brian De Palma's much more iconic realisation of Stephen King's Carrie 1976 whilst the emphasis on young girls as the principal focus of the narrative allows the writers to engineer an illicit relationship between student and teacher in a way that is actually beneficial to the plot.If you can overlook the more exploitative sensationalist moments of the film which including the depictions of lesbianism rape and implied vaginal impalement then the stark theatrics of stalkandslash brutality and the Argentolike preoccupations with sight and perception make this a more than worthwhile experience especially for those of us with a real taste for this particular style of filmmaking. 'What Have They Done to Solange?' might not be on a par with the work of Argento or Mario Bava or indeed a film like Torso  aka Bodies Bear Traces of Carnal Violence 1972  however it is definitely an entertaining and engaging work and one that should be of interest to anyone with a predetermined fondness for the Giallo subgenre of storytelling and the work of the filmmakers aforementioned.".

The whole torrid love affair between the teacher the blond and the student was really embarrassing. What planet are they living on? The music? Boring. Skip it.";

	schema:reviewBody "For the first time both Mazinger Z and Devilman two of Gou Nagai's most famous comicbook creations explode into the big screen and the result is a fun fastpaced actionpacked anime masterpiece!  Similar to GODZILLA VS. MEGALON my personal favorite Godzilla film released the same year it's got a monster and robot teaming up to beat up other monsters and robots evil ones of course!With both characters' shows released the previous year MAZINGER Z is a classic while DEVILMAN remains unliked by most of the diehard fans of the original comicbook although still mostly appreciated by superhero fans. In the TV show and this movie Devilman like Godzilla was more slimmeddown and playful than his original scarier comicbook counterpart but even then both the 70s Godzilla and animated 70s Devilman were still down n' dirty fighters!  Nevertheless this film is a dreamteam come true! The animation is colorful and energetic the voice acting by the voice casts of both shows is just as good as fans remember and the show uses music and songs from both shows by Michiaki Watanabe and Gou Misawa with the official introduction of the rocking SkyFlying Mazinger Z song at the closing credits sung by Japanese pop king Ichirou Mizuki!  Fans who don't like repetition should beware that whether it was already done in the MAZINGER Z show or not this movie again introduces the Jet Scrander Mazinger Z's winged jetpack attachment as though we've never seen it before so expect fans to say Aw man they're introducing it for the first time AGAIN?  Actually the movies are connected loosely from the shows but then the movies are sometimes more fun to watch than the shows later episodes of MAZINGER Z have recycling cheat episodes much like the later Ralph Bakshi SPIDERMAN cartoons which I still like!  Hell MAZINGER Z VS. DEVILMAN and the 1974 followup MAZINGER Z VS. THE GREAT DARK GENERAL which introduced Great Mazinger make great introductions to the genre!The plot At the movie's opening our heroic braggart Kouji Kabuto and his girlfriend Sayaka Yumi pilot Mazinger Z and Aphrodite A to beat up two of Doctor Hell's stock MachineBeasts which were about to attack Professor Yumi's Sayaka's father and former assistant to Kouji's late grandfather who invented Mazinger Z labheadquarters but suddenly a giant winged woman creature arrives in a gust of wind and trashes Aphrodite A in no time flat And remember that ALWAYS happens in the show!  Poor Aphrodite always kept getting trashed by the MachineBeast of the week but after all I guess that's because it's a GIRLY machine!!!.  You guessed it it's Devilman's popular archnemesis Silene only she's colored bluepurple and her privates are covered with feathers!  Doctor Hell and his androgynous cohort Baron Ashura take notice and so does Akira Fudou who transforms into Devilman You have to admit his transformation is really cool He literally rips out of his entire Akira Fudou guise before growing to giant size! and eavesdrops on Doctor Hell's paying a visit to the leader of Devilman's monster foes the Demon Clan's King Zannin Doctor Hell takes control of the entire clan!.  Akira warns Kouji and his friends about this but first by making fun of him and Mazinger Z leading to a motorcycle race in which Akira insists to Kouji that Mazinger Z MUST have the ability to fly or he'll be easily destroyed by his enemies.  Later Kouji discovers that Professor Yumi and his scientists are constructing a pair of wing attachments for Mazinger Z called the Jet Scrander yes again! but once our funloving Doctor Hell gets wind of this he sends Silene to wreck the Jet Scrander and kidnap Sayaka and Kouji's kid brother Shirou who are then rescued by Devilman who along with Mazinger Z have a first encounter with both the DemonBeasts AND Machine Beasts courtesy of their respective adversaries!  Our two heroes have decided to join forces to defeat their allied enemies but can the Jet Scrander be repaired in time while they prepare for the big showdown?Interesting to note that this film as well as the other Gou Nagai Super Robot movies was divided into TV episodes but blown up into fullscreen from their original 2.351 aspect ratio.  This movie should be seen in widescreen to be fully appreciated!In short MAZINGER Z VS. DEVILMAN is one of my favorite anime films! Definitely a mustsee!".

Which this movie was out a few weeks earlier before Spielberg's take on Dinosaur. Which oddly enough Ladd's daughter is the lead actress in JP. For all it's cheapness the dinosaur sequences are well done despite some funny unintentionally moments of the FX sequences. Which it will recalls films of the special effects era from the 1950's. It is quite gory as well which it's delivers the good often in a schlock way. Simon's film is surprisingly bleak with some moments of playful black comedy but it is not quite fun as we would expect from a Roger Corman production. A cast of familiar B cast tries to keep it lively. The third act of this thriller is extremely unsatisfying and the quite dark looking cinematography of this film could have better filmed. If u want to see Simon's better work watch The American Nightmare. Which it's a documentary on the horror movies of the 1970's. Carnosaur is more of a curio movie than someone might actually enjoying. I always find it funny on the VHS Cover of this effort since the late Gene Siskel enjoyed it very much. If u enjoy this it's followed by two directtovideo efforts! Based on a novel by the late Harry Adam Knight Who's real name is John Brosnan. Simon wrote the adaptation of this depressing movie.  .".

It's very dark and brooding and you watch it and you feel like the world is about to end. The plot is unique and different from the typical dinosaurrunsamok movie. But a couple of things really hold this movie back. First the special effects are awful. Since the movie didn't have a Jurassic Park budget I don't expect Jurassic Park effects. But I also don't want to see a Velociraptor that looks like Kermit the Frog's big brother either. The thumbnail says this movie was released in 1993 but the special effects give it the feel of a movie that was made 10 years earlier and kept locked in a safe somewhere until the right moment for release presumably to capitalize on the Jurassic Park craze. There are also a few silly moments that will have you scratching your head. I mean it's a dinosaur movie so you do have to suspend realism to a certain extent but Dr. Tiptree laying an egg is just a little much. It does have an ending that's as dark as the rest of the movie which I like here. If they had refined the plot a little and worked on the special effects I'd give it a much higher rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carnosaur tells the tale of ex loony biowarfare scientist Dr. Jane Tiptree Diane Ladd who is working on behalf of the 'Eunice Food Service Division' where she gets to conduct as many unethical experiments as she likes Dr. Tiptree has genetically recreated a Dinosaur egg which hatches  means a vicious Dinosaur is on the loose much to the annoyance of alcoholic night watchman Doc Raphael Sbarge who encounters it when it slaughters a bunch of protesters  he gets the finger of suspicion pointed at him by Sheriff Fowler Harrison Page. In an effort to clear his name he traces Dr. Tiptree down  discovers that she has engineered a virus hidden within apparently harmless Chicken eggs which cause woman to become pregnant with a baby Dinosaur in an attempt to wipe out mankind  let the Dinosaurs rule the Earth once more! Can her plans be halted or is it too late already...Written  directed by Adam Simon Carnosaur is a Jurassic Park 1993 ripoff from beginning to end  was obviously made to cash in on Spielberg's monster sized hit by executive producer Roger Corman who else?. In no way are Jurassic Park  Carnosaur comparable in terms of size scale scope or entertainment value although I thought Carnosaur was at least quite fun to watch. It moves along at a nice pace  never became boring  it was pretty funny at times. All the usual Dinosaur  mad scientist clichs are here but what the hell sometimes you just manage to enjoy a film for what it is for me Carnosaur is one of those films. It's by no means a good film it's very silly it's tries to do far too much considering it's meagre budget  you can't help but keep thinking about Jurassic Park as you watch it. Basically Carnosaur is a cheap  gory Jurassic Park imitator which I found quite watchable it's far from the best film ever made but I also think it's far from the worst.Director Simon was working with a low budget  it shows there's no real style  the Dinosaur effects are plain embarrassing. They are truly some of the worst special effects you will ever see most of the Dinosaur shots are out of scale  use poor rubber puppet effects while the climactic fight between a TRex  Doc in a Bulldozer looks like a hand puppet fighting a toy truck the special effects are a million miles behind those that Spielberg had at his disposal that were so impressive over a decade ago. One surprising thing about Carnosaur is how gory it is there is footage from inside a Chicken slaughter house people have limbs bitten off guts  bodily organs are torn out people have their faces ripped off people are impaled  there's even time for a messy Dinosaur birth that ripsoff Alien 1979. Carnosaur doesn't shy away from showing the red stuff which helps.With a supposed budget of about 1000000 I sort of feel sorry for Simon who had literally no chance whatsoever to compete with Spielberg's millions. The special effects are among the worst I've seen the sets cheap it's not that well made or put together  the acting could have been better but at least he tried to get as much money as possible on screen even if the film falls short on several occasions.Carnosaur is a terrible film if you look at it from a normal filmgoers perspective however never let it be said that I'm not an individual because crazy as it may sound I actually quite liked Carnosaur. There I've said it so sue me. Large chunks of Carnosaur was edited into Raptor 2001  it spawned two sequels Carnosaur 2 1995  Carnosaur 3 Primal Species 1996.".

In an effort to clear his name he traces Dr. Tiptree down  discovers that she has engineered a virus hidden within apparently harmless Chicken eggs which cause woman to become pregnant with a baby Dinosaur in an attempt to wipe out mankind  let the Dinosaurs rule the Earth once more! Can her plans be halted or is it too late already...Written  directed by Adam Simon Carnosaur is a Jurassic Park 1993 ripoff from beginning to end  was obviously made to cash in on Spielberg's monster sized hit by executive producer Roger Corman who else?. In no way are Jurassic Park  Carnosaur comparable in terms of size scale scope or entertainment value although I thought Carnosaur was at least quite fun to watch. It moves along at a nice pace  never became boring  it was pretty funny at times. All the usual Dinosaur  mad scientist clichs are here but what the hell sometimes you just manage to enjoy a film for what it is for me Carnosaur is one of those films.

With the shower of blood on display we also get plenty of limbs ripped off dismemberments and decapitations which is found in the movie's highlight sequence where it attacks a group of protesters chained to a series of trees and it swoops down to chomp on them in quite vicious manners leading to a big action chase but with all the gore on display even coming up with a realistic manner of doing so with muscle and tissue visibly shown to be pulled away from the victim makes for an impressive visual. While this does have a slew of problems with regards to its special effects being obviously a man's hand in a puppet being whisked through the scenery to simulate it's advancement through the area these moments of utter cheese work to create a sense of charm with the film that's almost impossible to top even though the story has a ton of continuity problems a downer of an ending and several other problems.

	schema:reviewBody "When I bought payed for and viewed Carnosaur I took into account its budget limitations it was after all made possible by legendary 'B' movie producer Roger Corman. I also tried my hardest not to make too many comparisons between this film and the megabudget Jurassic Park despite more than a few nods made to the movie in the script It would make a great theme park! Diane Ladd being the mother of Laura Dern a main cast member in Jurassic Park and a coolacting black cop who seemed to be modelling himself on Samuel L Jacksons role.In 'B' movie standards this film should rate quite highly I'm sure its Oscar material compared to the later 'B' flick 'Dinosaur Island' and at least this film generates a bit of an effort some of the supposed 'great' films out there have a far higher budget and still fare worse than Carnosaur.The narrative is simple a mad scientist develops mutant chicken eggs that hatch deadly dinosaurs that grow big! Small dinosaurs escape multiply and kill whilst a suspicious virus takes its toll on a quiet town. Much of the plot is interspersed with boring confusing and sometimes irrelevant badly scripted dialogue between secondrate characters. Diane Ladd who plays the crazy scientist brings the movie up a few pegs and one wishes her part was a little larger. Her acting capabilities are so much greater than the other uninteresting cast members Jennifer Runyon Ned Bellamy etcThe actual dinosaurs render the whole film comedic as they resemble plastic models one plays with as a child. I couldn't help thinking that a dinosaur toy was being filmed in closeup! The dreary Nevada setting doesn't add any interest to the movie and the blatant CocaCola sponsorship just gets annoying! For comedy there is a giant T Rex kept amongst lasers in a basement and a scene showing Diane Ladd trying to lay an egg before attempting Cesarean section and encountering her own 'Alien' style John Hurt moment!Overall this film has a good idea but fails to develop it. Diane Ladd's attempt to recover a lush earthly environment seems admirable and is far away from her counterpart Richard Attenborough's vision in Jurassic Park. If the film was made with a better script a larger collection of good actors' and a better setting it could do a lot better. If however you enjoy watching opulent expensive and technically excellent filmsthis movie will only serve to put you off your food...especially eggs!I'll give it 410..Could have been better Now where do I get a copy of the sequel!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Carnosaur' is one of the few films that is so cheesy that you enjoy it more than the film probably should.SPOILERSA scientist Diane Ladd is under government contract to find a new vaccine to fight the common cold. She uses a serum derived from chicken cells and manages to successfully test it on the residents in a small town in the desert. That same town is experiencing a small crisis as several activists are terrorizing a construction company for their abuse of the environment by their digging up dinosaur territory to build houses. The town is also beset by a wild animal running around and ripping people to shreds. After several murders the police start to question what is going on around the town. A security guard Harrison Page for the company finds out that a dinosaur was inside a shipment of chicken eggs that left his company and has now gotten loose. He confronts the scientist as well as an activist Jennifer Runyon that survived a dinosaur attack earlier in the laboratory and forces her to reveal the truth about her plan the serum actually made women become pregnant with dinosaurs who will then attack the rest of the people. She lets a TRex loose and after an attack on the town the TRex is finally stopped at the construction site.The Good News The main reason why this series of films were made is the gore and with this one that holds true. Not as gory as part two but this one is still pretty gruesome. Several people get limbs bit off one gets his head ripped off and others get pulled to pieces in a shower of blood. The limbs and head getting ripped off is the more realistic of the gore as they are pulled off in one piece with a lot of tissue and muscle pulled off with them. It was very well done and is the most realistic thing done in the film. The rest of the special effects aren't that well done but it is still nice to watch them attempt to make realistic dinosaurs. The best part of the movie is the obvious cheeziness of the movie and how it revels in it. There are so many scenes where the dinosaur is so obvious a man's hand in a puppet walking along the scenery or the puppet used for the dinosaur is so different from the other puppets used that it adds to the charm of the movie. Some people may hate that but I find it to be the charm of the movie. I like those kinds of movies where it's so obviously bad that it doesn't try to hide how low the budget for it was. Those are a nice break from the films that are done with a big FX budget and try to wow you with that big budget. I'm also slightly embarrassed to say this but this film did make me jump a few times. Strangely not one was a scene involving a dinosaur. It was usually something that happened that I wasn't expecting to happen like a pair of headlights coming on suddenly or a guy walking into frame that you didn't know was there. It does deliver some scares just not the ones you expect would come from in a horror movie. It also has a more ingenious way of bringing the dinosaurs around than Jurassic Park' which came out the same year. The Bad News I don't know why people are saying that Diane Ladd did a good job in this movie. I thought she did a really awful job in her role. She never really made that big of an impression on me. In fact the whole cast was really terrible. It wasn't a huge cast as most of Roger Corman's films are but not one was really all that memorable. It was also very short. I thought they could've squeezed at least ten more minutes into it. I also kind of hated the confusing ending. It was totally dark and it fit the tone of the movie but it was a bit of a downer. I don't want to ruin it but it will leave you speechless as it was confusing and brought up some important questions.The Final Verdict If you thought Jurassic Park' was a weak movie this one may be for you. The better one is the individual preference. Those that like gore will prefer this one story and realistic dino lovers will want Jurassic.' It does have a lot more redeeming factors that you would expect and it deserves at least a look or a rental as it isn't a cult classic for nothing.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I believe it is excellent in almost every way.  The only reason everyone on this page hates this movie was because the special effects couldn't compete with Jurrasic Park.  They may say they disliked it for other reasons but in reality they are just kidding themselves and trying to find flaws that aren't there so they look like they aren't effectshungry morons who can't enjoy a film unless it has at least 10 minutes worth of CGI.  Also this movie asks its audience to suspend its disbelief due to the fact the plot isn't very realistic but as usual the American people aren't willing to do that and just want to be mindlessly entertained.  First off the plot while unrealistic is very creative and inteligent.  The style is very creepy and depressing.  The fact that this movie is filled with black humor and delights in vulgar nastiness makes this a very strange film indeed but this is very refreshing due to the fact that it's a dinosaur movie how many other dinosaur movies do you know about that are like this one? and the style never detracts from the funfactor.  The acting is excellent and the characters are much more interesting than any that were in Jurrasic Park.  Also the special effects are not bad.  While not excellent by any standard they are still fun creepy and convincing.  You never see any zippers strings holes or other such flaws and the dinosaurs never appear to be floating or anything like that.  And lastly A despite popular belief a raptor never laughs at any point.  There is one scene where one grunts and breathes hard and it does sound a bit like laughter but it was obviously not intended to sound that way and B this is not a Jurrasic Park ripoff.  Ripoffs steal ideas and stories.  Carnosaur doesn't do this.  It was definitely made to cash in on the success of Jurrasic Park but is a very different movie overall.  So in conclusion I think Carnosaur simply RULES!!!!!!!!!!  To all you people badmouthing it I hope a green and mean raptor visits you tonight...".

Also this movie asks its audience to suspend its disbelief due to the fact the plot isn't very realistic but as usual the American people aren't willing to do that and just want to be mindlessly entertained.  First off the plot while unrealistic is very creative and inteligent.  The style is very creepy and depressing.  The fact that this movie is filled with black humor and delights in vulgar nastiness makes this a very strange film indeed but this is very refreshing due to the fact that it's a dinosaur movie how many other dinosaur movies do you know about that are like this one? and the style never detracts from the funfactor.  The acting is excellent and the characters are much more interesting than any that were in Jurrasic Park.  Also the special effects are not bad.  While not excellent by any standard they are still fun creepy and convincing.  You never see any zippers strings holes or other such flaws and the dinosaurs never appear to be floating or anything like that.  And lastly A despite popular belief a raptor never laughs at any point.  There is one scene where one grunts and breathes hard and it does sound a bit like laughter but it was obviously not intended to sound that way and B this is not a Jurrasic Park ripoff.  Ripoffs steal ideas and stories.  Carnosaur doesn't do this.  It was definitely made to cash in on the success of Jurrasic Park but is a very different movie overall.  So in conclusion I think Carnosaur simply RULES!!!!!!!!!!  To all you people badmouthing it I hope a green and mean raptor visits you tonight...";

From beginning to end it's a true cultclassic for a those few die hard fans that are out there. But let's hope they don't go extinct. The 1 complaint has been that the special effects suck. Okay the TRex was too fake for me but the little green raptor really rocks. Like when it takes down those idiotic kids in their jeep to when it takes down those chained environmentalists. And I loved how the writer named all the major characters after birds. What an irony! And for the novel every dino fan should read Harry Adam Knight's Carnosaur! I own the novel on paperback and it is no longer in print from what I've heard so run and find a copy from a used shop or the web. And I really thought it was funny how some of the characters would be eating chicken like Clint Howard and then get taken down by the dinosaur. How ironic! I would have given this movie a perfect 10 if it only if they had dropped the concept about women giving birth to dinosaurs! But a movie like this is so rare to find and so fun to watch.

The picture on the box should tell you that it was made on the cheap so if you don't have enough imagination to live with that then go watch JP again and leave us horror fans alone.  They weren't as bad as some things I've seen in my day that's for sure.  I didn't come to make Bambi eyes in joyous rapture at the wonder of the largest beasts ever to walk the planet.  I wanted to see the kind of gore that you expect when you unleash a 20 foot tall ravenous carnivore on the modern world and this movie delivers.  JP and Godzilla had to skimp over that aspect of these critters.  A dinosaur attack involves rending of flesh buckets of blood and crunching of bone.  Here you get all of that.  Well to tell the truth I've seen better butchery effects too but I am glad they made this anyway.Having rented it solely for the ultraviolence I was elated to find a decent plot that kept me on the edge of my seat and characters that made me anxious to see them survive.After watching it one thought came right to mind which was  Man! i haven't enjoyed a movie that much in a long time!  I loved it.  The plot was very original.  It was so much more than the typical Mutated monster goes bananas theme.  It had a twisted enough slant that it really got to me.  The music and atmosphere were dark and haunting.  I watch movies at night with all the lights off so I appreciate the proper use of shadow like you can't do when it's daytime.  The characters were human enough that I felt genuine empathy for them which is so rare in this genre!".

Well flash forward to 15 years later I kinda get curious and decide to give it another watch. And man I can't believe I was scared by it! Well Airplane and the evil toilet scene from Look Who's Talking Too kinda scared me too so it ain't saying much now is it? First of all forgot how faked the little raptor thing looked! And of course the humor in it as well Seriously was that hippie stoned when he said Peace Green Brother to the Raptor? Personally I would have said Ah crap but maybe that's just me. And the hero does deliver a good action movie one liner with I hate wildlife before killing the TRex. Very repeatable line there. Oh and this movie was my first exposure to Alfred E. Neuman as well. But the movie does have it's dark moments such as Diane Ladd whose daughter starred in the other dinosaur flick that came out around the time this did. Can you guess who she is and what movie it is? as the evil bioengineer who thinks humans don't deserve the planet and dinosaurs do. Wow did she wake up on the wrong side of the bed or what? And wait till you find out what the fever is.My only beef with this movie is the middle or maybe it's not the middle I can never keep track with 80 minute movies sometimes where our hero confronts Ladd about what she's doing. It seems she took a little too long to explain her side of the story. I mean he gets inside holds her at gunpoint. Next scene it's morning Sheriff is preparing breakfast then the next it's night when B Movie king Clint Not Ron Howard has his head bitten off then cut back to the hero still holding Ladd at gunpoint. Dude you have a gun. Make her give you answers immediately no matter how cold hearted she is! Seems he was a little too patient.So while it's not the scariest movie ever that I thought it was at 8 years old it's still a fun campy horror movie just not meant to be taken seriously.".

I noticed that other reviewers have pounced on the shoddy special effects but...come on!  It's a low budget cheapie made before CGI became affordable...for what they are they work well.  At no time was I taken out of the movie by a poor effect.It begs comparison to Jurassic Park of course.  And well it should. Jurassic park is mostly a better movie.  But Carnosaur makes for a good fun monster movie.  Not ideal for a night out but a mustsee when you're in a Bmovie mood.  Rent it alongside a Romero film or an Evil Dead flick and enjoy the fun!".

Dispensing with an original plot this plays more like a generic monster movie with lots of people getting eaten and a sinister government conspiracy acting as the catalyst for all the evil. The only way to actually enjoy this movie is to laugh at it just like I did. Take it seriously and you'll be in for a rough time. A cast of nobodies and a couple of Bmovie oldtimers are picked off one by one by some vicious raptorlike dinosaur. The explanation for all this is some kind of silly confused rubbish about genetically modifying chickens or something.Throughout this film we see women giving birth to dinosaur eggs...Excuse me while credibility flies out of the window. Towards the end of the film the chief scientist gets to talk for 20 WHOLE MINUTES about why she's doing what she is and it gets boring very quickly. I can't emphasise how totally dumb and mindless this film is. The leads act in stupid ways people hang around and wait to be killed and nobody has a very plausible death scene  instead they all sit or stand around waiting for the dinosaurs to show up and munch on them. Some silly dialogue it carved him up like a Christmas turkey! and some really annoying subtitles also help to spoil things.The male lead played by some nonentity going by the name of Raphael Sbarge is totally wooden and far too young to have any authority. Diane Ladd who plays the misguided scientist is usually far too superior to appear in rubbish like this and looks mightily out of place. Clint Howard is wasted in a tiny role which fails to make use of his creepy talents while only Harrison Page A.W.O.L. lends any credibility to the proceedings as the oldtime sheriff. The best part of this film has to be the unexpected outofnowhere ending which had me in stitches. Oh and the excessive violence.The producers obviously saw fit to add in as much unpleasant comic book gore as they possibly could here and the results are splashed often vividly across the screen. Countless nonactors and actresses are eaten by the dinosaurs having their chests and stomachs torn open. Faces and legs are also chewed off. Other hapless souls lose their hands and arms to the monsters.Don't watch this movie expecting any fun special effects. The dinosaurs are extremely poorly animated some of the worst I have ever seen in fact. Forget CGI forget stopmotion even forget the men in rubber suits these clunky models beat everything in terms of sheer nerve and hopelessness when it comes down to the special effects. When standing still they look fine but as soon as they move the film loses it. Sometimes they're obviously being carried along just off camera. This is bad enough but then a giant TRex goes on the rampage and things get worse. I'm speechless as to how poor these effects were  they have to be seen for yourself. Things made more sense as the credits rolled and I saw that half of the actors were also crew members and it all begins to fall into place when you see that Roger Corman's production company were responsible for this outrage. It only gets an extra star for the bloody violence. This is bad bad bad so please don't bother watching it!".

The dinosaur effects are laughable at best but overall it's better scripted than the average Roger Corman slaughterama and Dianne Ladd gives an overthetop performance that alone makes this one worth watching. You get the feeling that there was probably a decent movie here if only they'd had a big enough budget. It may not be saying much but at least it's better than the two sequels that followed. If you're in the mood for a good goofy gory Bmovie CARNOSAUR shouldn't disappoint. Besides you can buy it on DVD for only 5.99 like I did. Can't beat that with a stick!".

I can say for sure that the attacks were pretty realistic and dinos never looked fake at any point. This movie even had a full size animatronic Trex. Now Jurassic Park was a classic which is eons ahead and this movie had the misfortune of being released in the same year. People just love to compare both and make fun of the poorer attempt. If it were released a few years before Carnosaur would have been more appreciated no doubt. It is really unfair to put this movie in the standard Bmovie list.".

Possibly even before that but my memory of being one goes back to when I was 3 Yes I actually remember this and I saw my very first look at a dinosaur  a rubber and I've since been told a very annoyingly squeaky toy Triceratops. My parents bought it for me and from that moment on my life's biggest passion was born  Dinosaurs. Growing up and still to this day I have to see anything that has dinosaurs in it no matter how good or bad. As a kid that wasn't really a problem  until 1993 when my 8yearold eyes befell a little VHS tape on the video store shelf called Carnosaur. The dinosaur on the cover looked just awesome again at the time and to my kid eyes as I had never before seen a liveaction dinosaur beyond old black and white movies side note When I saw Jurassic Park for the first time later that very same year it blew my little mind. I looked at the pictures on the back of the box and instantly knew I just had to see this movie. However when I went to go bring it to my parents to rent it for me they had forbidden it because it had the dreaded R Rating that has a long and evil history of stopping many young kids in their tracks. Now to my young mind I couldn't understand why a dinosaur movie  something I had thought was a topic that was always kidfriendly  was R Rated. Over the years I kept seeing not only Carnosaur but it's growing number of sequels  first Carnosaur 2 and then Carnosaur 3 Primal Species always checking out the pictures on the back and thinking how awesome these movies must be. Then in 2001 once I entered Grade 10 in High School and I was able to go out and rent what I wanted the next time I saw the Carnosaur VHS tape sitting in that video store I snatched it up and watched it. And yes...it was bad. Very bad. Horrible. Dreadful even. And I loved every minute of it.".

Granted Women giving birth to dinosaurs is a tad hard to swallow but it is at least partially explained and it is interesting if you are willing to suspend your disbelief for a while.  Pretty darned scary as well.  The dinosaurs in this movie LOOK good even though their movements are WAY too stiff and awkward even for a lowbudget movie.  I do like the way the dinosaurs were portrayed in Carnosaur though.  Most Dino movies try to evoke two things out of the audience with the dinosaurs fear and wonder.  This movie couldn't give a lump of dinocrap for any wonder surrounding the dinos.  The slimy drooling and grotesque dinosaurs of Carnosaur are very frightening if you can get over the way they stiffly move around.  I think people just hate the critters of Carnosaur because they were spoiled by the special effects of Jurrasic Park.  The acting in this movie is very good and anyone complaining about it is clutching at straws.  The characters were also not nearly as stereotypical as the ones in Jurrasic Park.  Oh and lastly this is NOT a ripoff of Jurrasic Park.  It was undoubtedly made to cash in on the popularity of that film and both movies do feature dinosaurs but that is it.  Carnosaur and Jurrasic Park are two very different movies.  I give Carnosaur  out of .".

What follows is her tale her coming to age too quickly and her intense loneliness. It is filmed in a slow way with many long shots and a handful of light moments to make sure it doesn't become a tearjerker altogether. The film rolls on with a steady pace and is completely carried by the appearance of the little girl who despite of her age manages to be the character she is supposed to be. It's not like the adult actors are doing badly it's just that she is doing better or at least far better than what might expect from a kid.All in all an amazing and depressing piece of film which can only make one want to beat some common sense into some people  in this case the aunt of the child.Amazingly good stuff 8 out of 10 kids damaged".

I've never seen anyone do it better even breaking the 180 rule several times in the service of underscoring the girl's increasingly disoriented drift from reality.It is not an entirely original story. There are many of the creepy elements from Tideland 2005 and some from The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane 1976 but The Girl is much more naturalistic and gentle than those two films.

She throws a pair of panties on her horse's head admonishes him harshly for eating sugar which she encourages him to do and brutally traps Mr. Nilsson under an overturned laundry basket furiously telling him If you're going to act like an ape you belong on a cage!In Pippi Goes on Board there's actually three different children doing voices for Pippi Tommy and Annika  as opposed to that one old lady who did everything in the first movie.

	schema:headline " The weaker of the Pippi films on one level a major improvement on another!";
	schema:reviewBody "PIPPI GOES ON BOARD known in Germany as DIE NEUESTEN ABENTEUER VON PIPPI LANGSTRUMPF PIPPI GEHT VON BORDTHE NEWEST ADVENTURES OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKING PIPPI GOES ON BOARD the second German compilation film of the 1969 Swedish PIPPI LONGSTOCKING TV series which I reviewed elsewhere here on IMDb is admittedly a mixed bag on one level. If you remember the first PIPPI LONGSTOCKING compilation film is basically a cut  paste pastiche of most of the best parts of the TV series on the intent of making that the ultimate Pippi film right? Well PIPPI GOES ON BOARD further capitalizes on its success by taking the leftover best parts from the series! If you're used to the series and its solid structure the result is somewhat of a mess.On the other hand this film is a major improvement over the first film on another level as the English dubbing uses real kids to do the dubbing voices of Pippi Inger Nilsson and her pals Tommy Pr Sundberg and Annika Maria Persson! Despite their obvious New York accents all of the films from this point on were dubbed in NY I think the first was dubbed in California either way the distribution for all four was handled by the Bostonbased film distribution company G.G. Communications the children voice actors did a great job and lent much needed charm to the characters they performed. Fred Ladd best known for bringing classic anime shows ASTRO BOY GIGANTOR etc. to the US takes over the dubbing for the series from this point forward and you'll recognize some of the adult voice actors here too! Some are veterans at Titra Studios on the dubbing for various Japanese scifi film classics. The funny thing is the US dub got the policemen Kling Ulf G. Johnsson and Klang Gthe Grefbo's names mixed up! Despite that veterans Gil Mack and Ray Owens Klang and Kling er Kling and Klang respectively did a great job dubbing their voices. And from this point onwards Captain Longstocking Beppe Wolgers has the voice of a classic Italian movie Hercules than the well Italian accent he got in the first film!This film's music score is done by German composers Konrad Elfers who scored the previous film and Christian Bruhn who turns up very good music and songs that compare quite well with the works of original Swedish composer Georg Riedel. While the German version uses Elfers' same arrangement of Jan Johansson's Here Comes Pippi Longstocking AKA Hey Pippi Longstocking! in the opening credits the US version uses a whole new rearrangement which I like even better! This new arrangement of the theme song with lyrics by E. Jonny Graff and Lenny Whitcup recalls the tune for the classic Tootsie Roll animated commercials and is sung by little kids. It's really cute!Now let's consider this film's title. The climaxending of the last film which really should've been the climaxending of this film as in the book of the same title is put at the beginning as a flashback so the extracted material from the series used in this film is totally retconned! In a way that's actually funny. Probably so much so that the movie was retitled HERE COMES PIPPI LONGSTOCKING HR KOMMER PIPPI LNGSTRUMP when released in Sweden! I gather that it must've been Astrid Lindgren's decision as it would have been rather a deviation of the book it was based on.But I'll admit it despite this film being the weaker of the films it's definitely not unwatchable. We still get great Pippi fun in this film! You'll see a lot of great moments you never got to see in the first film. And as I said with much better dubbing! It's very entertaining even very touching.The first half of the film uses Episodes 13 3 4 5 11 and 2 in that order which are practically cut and pasted all over the place but we get a far more consistent flow with the usage of Episodes 6 7 and 8 in the second half.In summary I still recommend this film very highly! It is best seen as a doublefeature with the first PIPPI LONGSTOCKING film. Of course this movie would be followed by the two featurelength movie sequels to the TV series PIPPI IN THE SOUTH SEAS and PIPPI ON THE RUN!".

If you remember the first PIPPI LONGSTOCKING compilation film is basically a cut  paste pastiche of most of the best parts of the TV series on the intent of making that the ultimate Pippi film right? Well PIPPI GOES ON BOARD further capitalizes on its success by taking the leftover best parts from the series! If you're used to the series and its solid structure the result is somewhat of a mess.On the other hand this film is a major improvement over the first film on another level as the English dubbing uses real kids to do the dubbing voices of Pippi Inger Nilsson and her pals Tommy Pr Sundberg and Annika Maria Persson! Despite their obvious New York accents all of the films from this point on were dubbed in NY I think the first was dubbed in California either way the distribution for all four was handled by the Bostonbased film distribution company G.G. Communications the children voice actors did a great job and lent much needed charm to the characters they performed. Fred Ladd best known for bringing classic anime shows ASTRO BOY GIGANTOR etc. to the US takes over the dubbing for the series from this point forward and you'll recognize some of the adult voice actors here too! Some are veterans at Titra Studios on the dubbing for various Japanese scifi film classics. The funny thing is the US dub got the policemen Kling Ulf G. Johnsson and Klang Gthe Grefbo's names mixed up! Despite that veterans Gil Mack and Ray Owens Klang and Kling er Kling and Klang respectively did a great job dubbing their voices. And from this point onwards Captain Longstocking Beppe Wolgers has the voice of a classic Italian movie Hercules than the well Italian accent he got in the first film!This film's music score is done by German composers Konrad Elfers who scored the previous film and Christian Bruhn who turns up very good music and songs that compare quite well with the works of original Swedish composer Georg Riedel. While the German version uses Elfers' same arrangement of Jan Johansson's Here Comes Pippi Longstocking AKA Hey Pippi Longstocking! in the opening credits the US version uses a whole new rearrangement which I like even better! This new arrangement of the theme song with lyrics by E. Jonny Graff and Lenny Whitcup recalls the tune for the classic Tootsie Roll animated commercials and is sung by little kids. It's really cute!Now let's consider this film's title. The climaxending of the last film which really should've been the climaxending of this film as in the book of the same title is put at the beginning as a flashback so the extracted material from the series used in this film is totally retconned! In a way that's actually funny. Probably so much so that the movie was retitled HERE COMES PIPPI LONGSTOCKING HR KOMMER PIPPI LNGSTRUMP when released in Sweden! I gather that it must've been Astrid Lindgren's decision as it would have been rather a deviation of the book it was based on.But I'll admit it despite this film being the weaker of the films it's definitely not unwatchable. We still get great Pippi fun in this film! You'll see a lot of great moments you never got to see in the first film. And as I said with much better dubbing! It's very entertaining even very touching.The first half of the film uses Episodes 13 3 4 5 11 and 2 in that order which are practically cut and pasted all over the place but we get a far more consistent flow with the usage of Episodes 6 7 and 8 in the second half.In summary I still recommend this film very highly! It is best seen as a doublefeature with the first PIPPI LONGSTOCKING film. Of course this movie would be followed by the two featurelength movie sequels to the TV series PIPPI IN THE SOUTH SEAS and PIPPI ON THE RUN!";

	schema:headline " The unforgettable Mammo immortalised by Farida Jalal";
	schema:reviewBody "Shyam Benegal's Mammo is an account of a certain period in the life of Riyaz a teenager who lives a poor lifestyle with his grandmother Fayyazi as they get a visit from his grandma's sister Mehmooda Begum Anwar Ali commonly known as 'Mammo'. Mammo was born in Panipat during the British Raj but she was one of those many Muslims who left for Pakistan after partition automatically becoming Pakistani citizens. After the death of her beloved husband Mammo is thrown out of the house by her relatives and having nowhere else to go comes to live with her widowed sister in Bombay on a temporary visa. Lots of things change while she is there Mammo is loud vivacious opinionated and funny and she keeps everyone on their toes. Initially unhappy with her presence Riyaz learns to love the old lady and ultimately gets very close to her.Mammo is a brilliant film superbly written directed and acted. It is both entertaining and touching. Shyam Benegal is as already known a true master of his craft. He keeps everything so real and authentic. The film's dialogues and script are exceptional. The relationships are portrayed wonderfully and Benegal must be applauded for his simple and natural presentation of the three characters and their everyday struggles through which we get to know of their stories and life experiences. Benegal skillfully captures the atmosphere of those times the music the streets the films everything is so realistically depicted. At times it felt like a real documentation of a period of time in the lives of these three people. The movie has drama comedy and many moments of joy happiness and rage we all are familiar with. The story unfolds as seen through the eyes of the young Riyaz. Benegal shows us in minute detail who Mammo was and clarifies why Mammo occupied such a special place in Riyaz's heart. She was not only a mother figure to him she could be a friend a confidant a spiritual teacher and generally just a person who could be counted on anytime. Everyone would want to have an aunt like Mammo an openminded honest and straightforward person who is both funny and likable. I cannot forget the scenes in which she caught Riyaz smoking and promised him to keep it between them or the scene in which she herself asks him to light a cigarette for her and starts smoking. Another memorable scene is the one where Fayyazi gets mad as she finds out porn magazines in Riyaz's closet while Mammo reacts naturally to this with complete understanding that the boy is now grown. This is such an amazing character.I can really see why Khalid Mohammed wanted to immortalise Mammo by making her the central character of a feature film. It is partly a comic partly a dramatic character and it is just a very inspiring one. She was not only a caring and unselfish person who was always willing to help she was evidently a strong woman who knew how to take things as they come live with what God had given her and thank him and she also had the ability to call a spade a spade and frankly tell her opinion about a person directly in his face. This can be seen in several scenes such as the one in which she attacks her sister Anwari for stealing her and Fayyazi's property. One more scene is the one in which she preaches housemaid Shantabai's husband for drinking and abusing his wife.But the main reason Mammo will always be remembered is Farida Jalal. This is not only one of her finest performances this is according to me one of the greatest performances by an actress in a leading role in Hindi cinema. Jalal's portrayal of Mammo is marvelous from start to finish. She is amazingly natural and plays her role with soul depth and humour making Mammo so easy to relate to and so easy to like. One can really see the pain in her eyes as she reminisces past incidents and yet her way to accept what she has and move on is admirable. I cannot see anyone but Jalal in this role. This is an unforgettable performance. Surekha Sikri as the worried and caring Fayyazi is nothing short of excellent and she too manages to move you in many of her scenes. Amit Phalke plays the young Riyaz exceedingly well and so does Rajit Kapoor playing the older version of this role.Mammo is not only an impressive piece of art it is also a fantastic entertainer which would be certainly enjoyed by the entire family. One has to note Jagjit Singh's wonderful Ghazal which can be heard from time to time. In a few words Mammo is another masterwork by the great Shyam Benegal  a haunting moving involving and riveting tale of one little family. This is a true cinematic experience one gem of a movie.".

The atmosphere is made rich by references to Beethoven Faiz Gibran and movies like Psycho Bobby and Garm Hawa.Farida Jalal and Surekha Sikri turn in great performances. There is a beautiful ghazal sung by Jagjit Sing and written by Gulzar that adds depth and poignancy to the film each time it plays. Gulzar fans will value the use of his jolting story 'Ravi Paar'.";

	schema:reviewBody "Within few minutes after Farida Jalal enters into the screen memories of 'Sound of Music' surfaced in my mind. The character of Farida Jalal in the movie is one of a kind that people look forward to as their ideals. They are free spirited and invoke a sense of hope every time they come on screen. With them I can really think that nothing wrong will go in the story. Characters of these sorts are likely to exhibit powers of a silent hero who control the emotions in the film. The character of Julie Andrews in the sound of music had struck the same feeling in me like this one. I will also go on saying that having these characters I feel assured of a happy ending. It is an entirely a different feeling when you never fear even when something is going bad in the story. These characters are so Angel types that it is highly likely that we try and imitate the same. With Mammo Farida Jalal has given me that feeling. Shyam Benegal is truly one of the best filmmakers India has. The movie went on to winning the National Film award for Best Feature in Hindi.The story of the film is based on the maternal grandmother's sister Mammo who just comes into the house of the protagonist uninvited. At first you tend to feel against the character but that is what is intended because it is needed to show how naturally her character blends into the family. How the initial reluctance turns into love and belief is blended with a powerhouse performance from Farida Jalal. Another opportunity that the director had in the film was to exploit the absence of a male in a family. There is always a visible and emotional absence of a male in their family. There is the life of a middle class family which tries to avoid a lot of problems just by any means. They struggle for simple things. They take small issues big. They manage and compromise a lot of times. Mammo is a character who smokes with a 13 year old grandson and does not make it an issue when he watches porn. She is hugely broadminded. The character of Riyaz is stubborn and irritating. Gradually his nature also changes partly because of the influence of Mammo and some other when certain instances get raised during the course of the movie. Another beautiful character was of Surekha Sikri as Fayyazi the grandmother of Riyaz. She brings up an oversensitive and fearful lady on the screen. She is older than her sister but then also she always has this unintentional habit of looking up to Mammo for certain big decisions. Her winning of National film award for Best Supporting Actress is well justified.The chemistry that these three share on the screen is something that is rarely brought up on Indian Cinema. Though the film suffers from a little loop holes in plot and characters sometimes it is one of those films which make you forget about aesthetics and technicalities of filmmaking and just indulge with its lovable characters. Looking forward for more films like this.MESSAGE 'Life is Beautiful'VERDICT 'A recommended watch.'".

	schema:headline " George Gershwin American Composer";
	schema:reviewBody "RHAPSODY IN BLUE Warner Brothers 1945 directed by Irving Rapper subtitled The Story of George Gershwin is a tribute to America's most original composer of the twentieth century. It's an entertaining musical biography if one could overlook its faults. Made at the time when movies of this type dominated the screen beginning with YANKEE DOODLE DANDY 1942 with James Cagney as actor and songwriter George M. Cohan Warners later contributed another using a song title to personify the subject matter Cole Porter in NIGHT AND DAY 1946 as portrayed by Cary Grant. Obviously YANKEE DOODLE DANDY is the best of the three however while NIGHT AND DAY offers an added plus with Technicolor it makes RHAPSODY IN BLUE better than what it is. Unlike the two mentioned biopics RHAPSODY IN BLUE is not headlined by a major name but a newcomer named Robert Alda who unlike Cagney and Grant never became a top rank star. One thing going for Alda is his resemblance to George Gershwin and how acceptable he is in what has become his best known film role. Unfortunately that's where the Gershwin legend ends. Hoping for another YANKEE DOODLE DANDY Warners reused its costars Joan Leslie as the fictitious girlfriend and Rosemary DeCamp as the mother the sort of roles they've done before. The result the music that outscores an episodic story.The story of George Gershwin according to an original story by Sonya Levien opens on the lower East side of Manhattan with brothers George and Ira Gershwin as boys Darryl Hickman and Mickey Roth watching men delivering a piano to their apartment. The piano was ordered for Ira to take lessons but their mother Rose Rosemary DeCamp can't help but notice George's natural talent for the piano without a single lesson. Years pass the now adult George Robert Alda develops a new method in piano playing lands a job playing songs for customers getting himself fired for going against management by demonstrating his own songs. In time he gets his big break when publisher Max Dreyfus Charles Coburn introduces Gershwin's latest composition Swanee to Broadway entertainer Al Jolson who likes the song so much that he introduces it in his next Broadway show SINBAD. Jolson's delivery to Swanee elevates Gershwin into an exceptional and most original composer. Collaborating his songs with Ira Herbert Rudley Broadway shows featuring one hit song after another along with George's on and off romances with Julie Adams Joan Leslie a singer who loves him and Christine Gilbert Alexis Smith a socialite divorce who knows she'll be nothing more than a backdrop to his life. In spite of fame and fortune especially with his masterpiece Rhapsody in Blue George is not a happy man and strives to improve himself doing everything in such quick pace as if he has some premonition of an untimely death.The supporting players feature Julie Bishop as Lee Gershwin Albert Basserman as Professor Frank Morris Conovsky as Morris Gershwin Johnny Downs as a tapdancer with Paul Whiteman George White Tom Patricola Hazel Scott guest starring as themselves. A pity that Fred Astaire whose best known for introducing some classic Gershwin tunes didn't appear. The highlight of the program is Al Jolson singing Swanee. This became Jolson's final contribution to the motion picture by which he takes part in the plot but this would not be the last time his voice would be heard on screen. Jolson appears in two key scenes each in his blackface trademark first from his dressing room on the telephone and later on opening night. While age has caught up with Jolson physically his delivery to Swanee proves he still has that old magic. A pity he didn't contribute more to the story. Oscar Levant playing his usual droll self provides some amusing moments as Gershwin's close friend as well as his piano solos.Of the many songs composed by George Gershwin the ones selected for the soundtrack include Smiles not by Gershwin Swanee S' Wonderful S' Marvelous Somebody Loves Me I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise Lady Be Good Blue Monday Blues followed by My Joe and Mother Mine Rhapsody in Blue conducted by Paul Whiteman Braham's Lullaby background score Hazel Scott's piano playing and vocalization of The Man I Love in French Clap Yo Hands Fascinatin' Rhythm I Got Rhythm and Yankee Doodle Blues Liza Bidin' My Time Embraceable You An American in Paris instrumental Cuban Rhapsody Our Love is Here to Stay Delicious Summertime from PORGY AND BESS Concerto in F 135th Street Blues Love Walked In Concerto in F reprise and Rhapsody in Bluereprisefinale.Not historically accurate as one would like it to be although the costumes and hair styles do fit into the time frames RHAPSODY IN BLUE should be a delight for Gershwin fans considering how it concentrates more on his songs than on his personal life. Running more than two hours the narrative includes several scenes that drag on but as long as there's enough Gershwin music to fill in the void it shouldn't appear endless.RHAPSODY IN BLUE may not be the success in the tradition of YANKEE DOODLE DANDY nor Robert Alda as legendary as James Cagney but George Gershwin's contribution to American music jazz blues andor folk opera remains legendary. RHAPSODY IN BLUE formerly available on video cassette is shown on Turner Classic Movies. Running time 142 minutes  a very important piece. 12".

	schema:headline " An American original";
	schema:reviewBody "George Gershwin was perhaps America's greatest composer. Judging by his output of popular songs as well as some of the serious music he left behind. George Gershwin was a man that got his inspiration by a lot of the popular and black music he heard when he was growing up and mixed it with some of the classical music that he learned as a young piano student. The result is a body of work that is not easy equaled by any of his contemporaries.In Rhapsody in Blue his biographical picture director Irving Rapper has recreated that period in the young composer's life with the help of the screen play writers Howard Koch Sonya Levien and the uncredited Clifford Odets as he takes us along to witness a account on this original music man.We get to see the ambitious George who could play anything on the piano his parents intended for his brother Ira to study music. It was clear from the start George was a natural who had no problem composing some of the best melodies that became standards during the 20th century and continue to delight us after so many years.Along the way there is the story of the man who falls in love with the lovely and sophisticated Christine Gilbert who he met in France. Julie Adams the girl who was to become the star in many of his shows loved George in silence. Of course these two women are a product of the writers imagination or a composite for the real women in his life.We are also shown the world in which George lived. There is Prof. Frank who taught the young man the best of the classical piano repertoire. His parents Morris and Rose who adored their sons. We also meet some of the men that shaped his life like Max Dreyfus his manager Oscar Levant his friend and best interpreter along with some real figures like Paul Whiteman George White Al Jolson Hazel Scott among others.Robert Alda resembled the real George Gershwin his take on the man rings true. Joan Leslie is Julie Adams and Alexis Smith is Christine Gilbert the women in George life. Charles Coburn plays Max Dreyfus. Morris Carnovsky and Rosemary DeCamp are seen as the parents.The best excuse to watch the film is the glorious music one hears in it. The movie is easy on the eye and while it might not be accurate it still makes for a pleasant view of this genius of some of the best American popular music of all times.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all our famous Tin Pan Alley composers George Gershwin alone managed to bridge that gap between the old masters of Europe and our own American musical traditions. I've always had a particular affinity for his music maybe because he and I share the same birthday 49 years apart though. He did so much in his life of 38 years and left so much unwritten and unsung it's impossible to comprehend all this beauty could have come from the mind of one man.Rhapsody In Blue is no better or worse than some of the other Hollywood biographies of our composers. The idea was to make a musical picture and story is always sacrificed especially in the accuracy department. Joan Leslie and Alexis Smith play a compilation of characters of many women involved in George Gershwin's life. It is true however that Gershwin sacrificed all for his art. He wanted to attain heights that no American composer ever did and he succeeded.There is also the problem of contracts and copyrights in making these kind of films. Certain Gershwin standards you won't hear because either Warner Brothers didn't have the rights or Jack Warner was spending way too much money for the Gershwin songs to begin with. Al Jolson Paul Whiteman and Oscar Levant all appear as themselves in this the story of Gershwin could not be told without them. Jolson introduced Gershwin's first hit song of Swanee he interpolated it in one of his shows which he always did. Paul Whiteman the King of Jazz took that crown with his concert at Aeolian Hall of Rhapsody In Blue from whence this film gets its title. It maybe the most well known instrumental piece of music by an American composer ever.And certainly no life of Gershwin could have even been filmed without Oscar Levant whose friendship and abiding affection for George Gershwin was well known. Levant's wit was devastating even upon himself and his friend George. But he worshiped at the altar of that music.But a real treat for me was Anne Brown the original Bess from Porgy and Bess singing Summertime. That alone is worth seeing this film.Hazel Scott singer jazz pianist and outspoken civil rights advocate plays a Josephine Baker type role and does several Gershwin numbers while he's in Paris. The film sadly makes no mention of Fred Astaire or Gertrude Lawrence both of whom are very important in George Gershwin's career. And it would have been nice to see Victor Moore playing Throttlebottom from Of Thee I Sing which got a one line mention about it winning a Pulitzer Prize and that was it.Robert Alda plays the title role and he did get good reviews and to the limited extent the script gave the character he does capture the essence of the driven Gershwin. Stardom in Hollywood would elude Alda however he'd have to wait for Broadway and Guys And Dolls.I was sorry to see the role of Ira Gershwin by Herbert Rudley given such a short shrift. Ira was an interesting man in his own right. He wrote lyrics with several other name composers both before and after his brother's demise. In fact he wrote with others specifically to establish his own credentials so no one would think he was just riding on brother George's coattails.Gershwin's one man who could use a new biographical film. Maybe we can get a better idea of his life have his songs done in proper chronological order and see him from another century's perspective.Until then Rhapsody In Blue will give you a general idea.".

Paul Whiteman the King of Jazz took that crown with his concert at Aeolian Hall of Rhapsody In Blue from whence this film gets its title. It maybe the most well known instrumental piece of music by an American composer ever.And certainly no life of Gershwin could have even been filmed without Oscar Levant whose friendship and abiding affection for George Gershwin was well known. Levant's wit was devastating even upon himself and his friend George. But he worshiped at the altar of that music.But a real treat for me was Anne Brown the original Bess from Porgy and Bess singing Summertime. That alone is worth seeing this film.Hazel Scott singer jazz pianist and outspoken civil rights advocate plays a Josephine Baker type role and does several Gershwin numbers while he's in Paris. The film sadly makes no mention of Fred Astaire or Gertrude Lawrence both of whom are very important in George Gershwin's career. And it would have been nice to see Victor Moore playing Throttlebottom from Of Thee I Sing which got a one line mention about it winning a Pulitzer Prize and that was it.Robert Alda plays the title role and he did get good reviews and to the limited extent the script gave the character he does capture the essence of the driven Gershwin. Stardom in Hollywood would elude Alda however he'd have to wait for Broadway and Guys And Dolls.I was sorry to see the role of Ira Gershwin by Herbert Rudley given such a short shrift. Ira was an interesting man in his own right. He wrote lyrics with several other name composers both before and after his brother's demise. In fact he wrote with others specifically to establish his own credentials so no one would think he was just riding on brother George's coattails.Gershwin's one man who could use a new biographical film. Maybe we can get a better idea of his life have his songs done in proper chronological order and see him from another century's perspective.Until then Rhapsody In Blue will give you a general idea.";

	schema:reviewBody "this biopic is pretty typical. A lot of it was of course fictionalized. The Joan Leslie Character was in fact a composite of many loves of Gershwin's life. These included the composer Kay Swift and the actress Paulette Goddard. Swannee was not in fact Gershwin's first published tune as implied nor did Ira Gershwin write the words to that song as further implied. By the time Swanee appeared Gershwin had already contributed to or written the scores for several Broadway productions. And in fact Swanee was not heard for the first time in Jolson's Sinbad but had an inauspicious debut in a New York bordello where Jolson heard it.Ira was not the only lyricist Gershwin worked with. He also wrote songs with Buddy DeSylva who is mostly seen as a Broadway producer in this film. In fact the one act opera blue Monday featured in this film was written by Gershwin with DeSylva doing the libretto. Whiteman had nothing to do with the orchestration as implied in this film. Rhapsody in Blue was originally scored for a much smaller jazz orchestra rather than the symphonic size orchestra seen in the movie. More over it was Ferde Grofe and NOT Paul Whiteman who did the scoring for symphonic orchestra.Other than these snipes one can get a glimpse into the actual personality of Oscar Levant who appears as his normal sour self with his own dialog for good measure. Tell me George if you had it to do all over again would you still fall in love with yourself?... An evening with George Gershwin is a George Gershwin evening. Actually Levant and Gershwin did not meet until the 1930s..later in fact than implied in this film.Still Rhapsody in Blue offers a unique glimpse into the music of one of America's most beloved composers.".

Just like he signs his name in the movie. The movie starts with his and his brother Ira's  childhood when they get the piano for Ira to play. Turned out that George became the pianist and Ira the lyricist. George never married but the movie is a love story between George and singer Julie Adams Joan Leslie Yankee Doodle Dandy  who truly loved him. He was also romantically involved with Alexis Smith Christine Gilbert The Age of Innocence. She was a socialite painter who lived in Paris. George would have married Julie but he somehow was married to his music and ended up never marrying Julie due to his early death. Each scene of the movie has the rhythm of Gershwin's music and the music played is a piece which corresponds that period of his life. To my surprise Al Jolson plays himself where he sings and dances. Remember him the guy that Warner Brothers decided to star him in their first partlytalkingpicture The Jazz Singer in 1927. The two Gershwin's had a wonderful relationship with their parents and Ira became their parent's caretaker because George traveled a lot.  I love the fact that George Gershwin is played by Robert Alda Imitation of Life a great actor and singer and also father one of my favorite actors Alan Alda M.A.S.H. Same Time Next Year.

I will have to read further to determine who did the keyboard when Robert Alda was playing.One interesting exchange for me was when Gershwin and Levant meet in the movie. The exchange suggests that George Gershwin is the real name. One of the sites I just visited indicate that his name was Jacob Gershvitz. Not earth shattering.

He seems extremely talented and is still alive apparently! Hazel Scott who appears in the film as a black singer in Paris is not exactly playing herself per se since she is too young to have been a Gershwin contemporary is SOOOOOO excellent though. I remember her on other TV shows of the 1960s and I guess must have seen her on Julia as well. But she was a question on a TV game show I sawI think it was that show Cash Cab so there is a trivia question for you. She ought to have a biopic of her own.I am sick of people insulting Al Jolson! Shut up idiots! He helped make the success of many songwriters and artists such as Gershwin and Irving Berlin. So it is OK that this song Blue Monday Blues is done with white actors in brown blackface makeup? and bad for Jolson to be in burnt cork? Get over this PC Police attitude! Jolson ends up losing his place in history because the PC police moan and groan and make themselves into sanctimonious critics of Jolson. THEY have no talent of their own. I am insulted for Jolson that in a recent documentary of Jewish Broadway musicians they cut down Jolson by referring to this scene in this film as a now shameful episode of entertainment history yadda yadda how bad it is to be in blackface ignoring Irving Berlin's past in minstrel shows.

Many episodes in this complex artist's life are presented in a way that is overly sentimental has no bearing on facts or reality and don't even make particularly good film.  But the main problem here is that people who in fact had very little bearing on Gershwin's development like King of Jazz Paul Whiteman and Jolson are emphasized simply because at this faded point in their careers WB could afford them while others who profoundly influenced or were affected by him are simply left out like the previously mentioned Astaires or Gertrude Lawrence or DuBose Heyward or any number of other important people simply not mentioned.  This makes it seem like G lived in the teens and the early 20s since they wouldn't pay for any of his associates from the 30s  a very lopsided picture of the composer's life and his work that does not impress.".

There's even a melodramatic scene where Alexis nobly gives up her love for Gershwin because she knows she's only the other woman in his life.Then there's the best friend played by Oscar LEVANT who did indeed know George Gershwin well the devoted brother Ira Gershwin and the loving parents including tearyeyed mother ROSEMARY DeCAMP.But while the plot is standard formula bio stuff the kind that Warner Bros. did throughout the '40s not much can be said for the performances which are also pretty standard including ROBERT ALDA as Gershwin. He's Alan's dad you know. Highlights are Gershwin's works performed before concert audiences including Rhapsody in Blue and Porgy and Bess. There's even a familiar face popping up now and then before stardom camefor example MARK STEVENS who is uncredited in the billing as a singer.Just as NIGHT AND DAY was a complete fabrication so is RHAPSODY IN BLUE. Music lovers will find plenty to listen to but don't expect to learn more about Gershwin's real life as a composer.This is one case where the BW photography looks drab. The studio should have gone all out for colorat least then the film would have been worth watching as well as listening to.".

	schema:headline " A very mixed bag";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems hard to believe that the same studio that made Yankee Doodle Dandy just a year before Warner Brothers could then have made this very disappointing picture. The script for YDD was sometimes hackneyed yes but it was still often a great film in large part because of the brilliant direction of Michael Curtiz one of Hollywood's great directors someone who could do so many things so well from The Adventures of Robin Hood and the Seahawk to Casablanca to YDD and the electric performance of James Cagney.Both those elements or their equivalent are lacking here. Irving Rapper's direction goes nowhere and Robert Alda in his first featurelength motion picture proves to be a very poor actor. The supporting cast is of no help.Part of that problem lies in the script which is full of biopic clichs. Still Cagney rose above similar clichs to create a truly living character in YDD. After watching this movie and Alda's performance in it I have no sense of what Gershwin was like. Yes I know the script has a lot of invention and goes wide of the unromantic reality of Gershwin's real life. But so as I recall does the script of YDD and still Cagney created a living character out of the results. Alda with evidently no real support from his director does not.Yet this movie is not a total failure by any means. If the script and acting are strictly second rate below Warner Brothers' best some of the musical numbers are pure magic. Al Jolson was 25 years older in this picture than when he first performed Swanee on Broadway but he still makes the number come alive with his voice in an astounding fashion putting Joan Leslie's performance of the number a little earlier in the movie to shame. Similarly the performance of Blue Monday Blues is pure magic. Watching Paul Whiteman conducting the first smaller version of Rhapsody in Blue is also fascinating there is a LOT of playing with the tempo markings which must have been how he performed it with Gershwin back in 1924 when they premiered it at Aeolian Hall. It would have been great had they allowed Anne Brown the original Bess to perform some of Bess's music but they give her Summertime which she would not have sung in the original production of Porgy and Bess. Whiteman and Oscar Levant are interesting doing the Concerto in F but we don't get to hear a lot of it.It is strange to see Levant in the final scenes of the movie when Gershwin is in his last days. If Levant was actually in the real life equivalent of those scenes it must have been very strange for him to reenact the last days of the composer's life especially the last day when he leaves to go back to New York to perform the Concerto in F with Damrosch just hours before the composer's death.In short you can skip all the dialogue scenes as they are poorly acted poorly written and not necessarily reliable. On the other hand some of the musical numbers should be preserved forever as they are both historical and remarkable.Some of what I wrote above was unnecessarily harsh. Yes by far the most important parts of this movie as in Yankee Doodle Dandy are the musical numbers especially those performed by those who were connected with the original performances.But it is also interesting to see how this movie repeatedly tries to present Gershwin as Warner Brothers had presented Cohan the year before as not just a great composer but as someone who was trying to give voice to the nation. I don't think anyone today would dare to try that with a modern musician but neither do I think Warner's was wrong in making the attempt.On a second viewing Robert Alda is not so bad as Gershwin. It remains true however that neither he nor the script ever really makes us understand what made Gershwin tick. There are strands that are introduced along those lines that could have been developed an attempt to erase the boundaries between classical and popular music the importance of Black music and culture in American music etc. but they are never carried out. This movie is way too long it would have been better had all the scenes with Joan Leslie and Alexis Smith been cut as beautiful as Smith is in this movie. Still there is a lot of value here. It merits an attentive viewing.".

Thank you Miss Leslie for the luminous beautiful tears. The emotional content was lovely and certainly matched the mood even if you were a lovely composite. I was left hoping that some one like your Julie was there for him.";

Gershwin's writings were magnificent and had he lived longer the world would have been a much richer place.His scoring of Porgy and Bess was terrific.Alda was so convincing as Gershwin a man who literally had to write music as fast as he could as his destiny was an early demise. This film was greatly underrated. It sports a magnificent cast led by Robert Alda Joan Leslie Alexis Smith and others. Gershwin gave us such a list of memorable music he was driven as it stated in the film Got to make time got to make time! A totally memorable line was stated by Alexis Smith in the film. She knew that marriage with him would not work because he had to give so much of himself to the world. Nostalgic a wonderful testament to the life and works of the great George Gershwin.".

The insurers  Lloyds of London  call in the eccentric Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes and his highly trained team to bring an end to the situation.   First off this is not a great film and makes no pretension to be one. It is however quite enjoyable on its level which is that of a fairly straightforward and formulaic thriller with some dashes of humour. Roger Moore gives a pleasing performance as the woman hating arrogant and irascible Ffolkes who is the complete antithesis of his version of Bond. Much of the gentle humour of the film arises from his constant put downs to all around him. Anthony Perkins is the head of the gang and plays him with typical cold blooded menace. Also James Mason turns in a nice portrayal of an exasperated Admiral.   Director Andrew V.McLaglen keeps things moving along and the setting is at least a bit different from the usual scenarios. The finale does seem something of a let down after the build up but it doesn't ruin the film.   I hadn't seen this for a few years so I enjoyed watching it again last week when it got a screening on TV. I recorded it and watched it a couple of days later while laid low with the 'flu. Its tongue in cheek nature cheered me up and surely that's the whole point of these types of films.".

One of the best was this 1979 adventure it was released in 1980 in the US under the title Ffolkes in which Moore stars as an eccentric British adventurer with a disdain for women and a fondness for cats. Moore leads a small underwater commando group that does the occasional favor for Lloyds of London. The British government has a problem. Two oil rigs in the North Sea and a Norwegian Cargo Freighter are being held to ransom. A terrorist group has overrun the freighter and has both it and the two rigs fitted with booby trapped bombs. The economic environmental and human cost if the British refuse the ransom could be astronomical. Unwilling to negotiate with hostages the government decides to contact Lloyds with a view to using their private specialized methods for dealing with problems. This is where Moore's character Ffolkes comes in. With a truly exceptional cast including James Mason Anthony Perkins and David Hedison North Sea Hijack aka Ffolkes is an enjoyable romp that is high on action and good humor.

He has an uncharacteristic beard and follows a series of bizarre daily routines to the letter. His savage side especially towards women whom he seems to hate more than terrorists provides some amusement. This is an under rated gem.

Anthony Perkins also gives an excellent performance as the head of a group of terrorist who forcibly takes control of a supply ship and threaten to blow up some oil platforms in the North Sea.Moore's character is what make the entire film worth watching. He's an eccentric tough guy who loves cats and a good shot of whiskey he's also highly opinionated. To the point that drives some to dislike him.Watch this film It's nonstop action and excellent dialoge.";

So it's no wonder that his role as Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes is miles away from 007 but it's still Moore. After a bunch of hightech terrorists has taken over three oil rigs and threaten to blow them up if the British government won't pay a few million pounds it is Moore's turn to save the western world. Leading a squad of professional antiterrorist submarine fighters they are planning to storm the rigs running out of time and fighting against thunderstorms and the cleverness of the gangsters.The cast is superb with Anthony Perkins as gang leader playing some kind of crossover between Norman Bates and the Bond villains. Supporting roles are played by James Mason and David Hedison who played Bond's American CIA sidekick Felix Leiter two times. The plot is influenced by the rise of modern terrorism and the energy crisis in the seventies but also by the Bond films and the fashionable disaster movies of its time.The best about the film is Roger Moore's Ffolks  a catloving alcoholdrinking womenhating bearded Englishmen without a sense of humor and gentleness. The pacing is alright and the story keeps the film thrilling until is toofast ending. And while James Bond is rewarded with the most beautiful girl after having saved the world Ffolkes receives a completely different gift at the end of the film... All in all North Sea Hijack is the perfect action thriller for a stormy and rainy autumn evening in front of your TV set.".

Of course the real world isn't so structured but it's nice to relax once in a while and allow our heads a playful descent into the vulgate. Why not? Freud called it regression in the service of the ego. The plot of an action movie usually provides a good example as this one does.The story involves the extortion of a monstrous amount of money from the British government primary shareholder in a North Sea oil production platform. The bad guys led by Anthony Perkins have hijacked a service ship planted mines around the bases of two oil rigs and threaten to blow both of the megaexpensive things up unless they are given the money in 24 hours. Something like that anyway.Roger Moore is Ffolks head of a dozen or so specialists in a private army. The PM hires him to take out the hijacking extortionists. Moore and his team do so with the help of an Admiral James Mason who is there primarily to provide a stiff upper lip and smoldering resentment of Moore's quirky personality. And man is it quirky.Moore is curmudgeonly but in a cute way. His nononsense egotism and prejudices make you smile instead of wince. Moore drinks scotch neat four hours after breakfast sometimes out of the bottle. If his men are slow he threatens to have your bs for breakfast. He does petit point or whatever it is. He loves cats and dislikes women in no uncertain terms. His analyses are wind swift. Mason's admiral grumbles I'll bet you're the type who does the Times crossword in ten minutes. Moore is offended  I never take TEN minutes. Nota bene The London Times crossword puzzle is designed by sadistic geniuses for consumption by big league masochists. It must be the toughest in the English language. Example A major seaport in the middle of Czechoslovakia. Answer Oslo. Michael Burns wearing a pair of glasses as thick as coke bottle bottoms is one of the heavies. I have always admired Michael Burns' work. I like the way he looks. The sole reason for this is that someone once said I resembled him or rather the other way round. But come to think of it that observation was made by a young lady with whom I'd just had a tiff and now I'm not sure it was meant as a compliment. Ex girl friends can be pretty subtle in inserting the syringe. Hmmm. I don't think I like him so much now.A couple of other things. The director was a protg and imitator of John Ford. He's a nice enough guy but like Ford tended to use his stock company and he made a couple of poor choices. Some of the supporting players will make you wince. And of course he carries on Ford's least attractive values while missing any of the poetry.There's also the question of the crew on that supply ship. I spent some time as a seaman on a Coast Guard cutter and it was nothing like this. The crew wear hard hats and international orange vests and they hustle 50gallon drums across rusty wet decks. There is no seamanship on display. They might as well be working in a warehouse in Queens. However the action scenes are suspenseful and exciting without bathing the viewer in gore. The locations are colorful and evocative from Castle Urquhart to a heaving ship in a gale. A few inconsequential good guys die while ALL of the bad guys bite the dust. Perkins' last words to Moore as Perkins is dying pinioned to a chair by a harpoon I still don't like your face. Don't take it seriously. Just relax and regress in the service of your ego. If you're in a shape that is in any way similar to mine your ego needs it badly.".

Anthony Perkins is convincing as the hijack leader and also fittingly comical. James Mason is a bonus and charming as usual.The story centers around Rufus Excalibur Moore a heavy drinking confident cocky and intelligent specialist. He is like the equivalent of an exNavy seal of some sort. He leads a team that focuses on water dives stealth and ship recovery tactics. Rufus is the best of course and expects a lot from his Men. He is never satisfied but that is some of the humor as well. Rufus also dislikes Women is crazy for Cats and has a lot of money.Basically a hijack team overtakes a boat and its crew and holds 2 large oil rigs Ruth and Jennifer for ransom via bombs attached to them.  Rufus is called in to lead the recovery and the story fluctuates between the hijackers and the crew and Rufus' life preparation and style. The rest is primarily climactic and the adventure action and humor all fall into place the last hour of the movie.If you are a Roger Moore fan see this movie solely for that. You will be pleasantly surprised. Also see it because it is still a solid movie after 22 years and I still am entertained after 20 viewings.Unfortunately there is no DVD version but it is for sale and possibly for rent. Give it a shot!10 of 10 mainly because of Roger Moore but can still stand on its own.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Britishproduced Andrew V. McLaglen actioneer Ffolkes based on Jack Davis' novel Esther Ruth and Jennifer gives Roger Moore a refreshingly different changeofpace role. As Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes Moore is both illtempered and egotistical. He despises women adores cats and prefers to drink his Scotch neat. If Ffolkes claims that he can do something he willby the Lord God Harrydo it! Everything about Ffolkes goes against the grain of the typical wellmannered saintly Moore image. First the James Bond star sports a thick beard knits when thinking and refuse to be proved wrong. Evidently Roger Moore had a grand time playing Ffolkes because this qualifies as his most robust forceful portrayal in years. His face and his eyes are wildly expressive throughout all 99 minutes of this adrenalinlaced nailbiting thriller.Davis scripted the action from his own adventure novel. Esther is the name of the transfer ship that supplies Ruth the oil drilling rig and Jennifer is the gargantuan production rig.

	onyx:emotionText "The Britishproduced Andrew V. McLaglen actioneer Ffolkes based on Jack Davis' novel Esther Ruth and Jennifer gives Roger Moore a refreshingly different changeofpace role. As Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes Moore is both illtempered and egotistical. He despises women adores cats and prefers to drink his Scotch neat. If Ffolkes claims that he can do something he willby the Lord God Harrydo it! Everything about Ffolkes goes against the grain of the typical wellmannered saintly Moore image. First the James Bond star sports a thick beard knits when thinking and refuse to be proved wrong. Evidently Roger Moore had a grand time playing Ffolkes because this qualifies as his most robust forceful portrayal in years. His face and his eyes are wildly expressive throughout all 99 minutes of this adrenalinlaced nailbiting thriller.Davis scripted the action from his own adventure novel. Esther is the name of the transfer ship that supplies Ruth the oil drilling rig and Jennifer is the gargantuan production rig. Masquerading as journalists the villainous Lou Kramer Anthony Perkins of Psycho and henchmen Harold Shulman Michael Parks board Esther brandish this hardware and hijack it. Kramer's secondincommand sets explosives throughout the ship and connects them to a detonator box that can signal the destruction of not only Esther but also the charges set on Ruth and Jennifer.

This picture and its source Jack Davies 'Esther Ruth and Jennifer' novel were both first released in the same 1979 year  the meaning and relevance of this movie's source novel is that the three names refer to the three seabased entities that are threatened to be blownup in the story in both the book and the film. Roger Moore's likable performance playing a misogynistic character including pet obsession with his pussy cats and having an effeminate needlework hobby. The definition and relevance of this movie's ffolkes title is that it refers to the surname of the central character played by Roger Moore  the full name is actually Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes and has been interpreted as being sexist. Though the character is supposed to be very much a polar opposite to his James Bond character paradoxically the character was arguably just as sexist just in a different way.

Rufus Excalibur ffolkes Roger Moore is an eccentric misanthropic exBritish Army officer who has his own team of highly trained underwater commandos ffolkes' fusiliers.

The bearded curmudgeonly ffolkes favors Edwardian suits does petit point and loves Scotch and cats. He's on a North Sea oil platform where Lou Kramer a clever criminal Anthony Perkins who has hijacked the supply boat Esther which is moored below has demanded 25 million British pounds or he'll blow the rig sky high. ffolkes got there because the British government could think of no one else who had a chance of thwarting Kramer's plan. If Jennifer the production platform and Ruth a nearby drilling platform which Kramer has mined are destroyed a good deal of British North Sea oil production will go up in smoke with them. The plot is ingenious. But then so is ffolkes. And he's prepared to be just as ruthless as the criminals. folkes has one advantage. His plans never go wrong. Almost never. But back to ffolkes and women. I do not! ffolkes answers. You see I together with my five elder sisters was raised by my maiden aunt. Both my parents died tragically in childbirth. Until the age of ten I was forced to wear my sisters' handmedowns. Then when I married I discovered to my horror that my wife also had five sisters all unmarried and all expecting my support. I find cats a far superior breed. This clever exciting adventure did only modest business when it was released and was quickly forgotten by most. Too bad because it's a wellmade film which generates tension has an unusual setting in the cold stormy waters of the North Sea and has some fine actors. Among the standouts are Anthony Perkins as the vicious confident and of course unstable Lou Kramer James Mason as Admiral Sir Francis Brindsen a stock figure at first but who thanks to Mason's skill turns into a character of barely noticed wry humor and Michael Parks as Kramer's key henchman possible lover and explosives expert. Most of all the movie depends on Roger Moore and he delivers a dynamic and amusing performance of a man of action who'd be much happier in an earlier age. His complete self confidence in his planning and his talents would be irritating if it weren't so well acted and expressed in lines so well written. I suppose you're one of those fellows who does the Times' crossword puzzle in 10 minutes says an irritated Admiral Brindsen after ffolkes offhandedly explained the meaning of a coded message the Admiral had just received from London. I have never taken 10 minutes! says ffolkes indignantly. Moore is perhaps underrated nowadays but I think he was expert in light comedy and in amusing adventures. In my opinion he is the second best by far of the James Bonds. I haven't seen Daniel Craig. Even aging a bit in the last couple be brought style and insouciance to a franchise that was slowly going off the tracks. And yes I'm a fan of A View to a Kill. Moore made this picture between Bond films and he plays against type. The movie ends as it began with ffolkes clearly happy with his favorite companions. We had earlier met Mary his tortoiseshell tabby. We leave ffolkes with an award from the British government delivered to him in Scotland by the Prime Minister herself...three white kittens named Esther Ruth and Jennifer. For those unsure how to pronounce ffolkes we may have to dig deep into Hitchcock. I don't get the double 'F' says American reporter Johnny Jones to Scott ffolliot a man he's just met as they speed down a Dutch lane after an assassin. They're at the beginning says ffolliot. Both small 'F's. They can't be at the beginning says Johnny. Says ffolliot One of my ancestors was beheaded by Henry VIII. His wife dropped the capital letter to commemorate it. How do you say it like a stutter? asks Johnny. Just a straight 'fuh'. Fuholkes is a well made amusing adventure.".

The film on the whole is tailor made for Roger Moore and he fits into the quirky character like a glove and it is also very ironic that he buddies up with the American Mr. King who plays the production platform offshore installation manager as Moore also stars with the same actor in many of his James Bond movies. I think the part of Cramer Anthony Perkins was played brilliantly with special focus on the flip outs that he performs when he begins to realise that his master plan isn't exactly going to plan. All in all a top movie despite what most of my friends say!".

It might be called North Sea Hijack ffolkes or apparently even Assault Force. Whatever you may call it it's a interesting film for fans of the thriller genre.One of the film's greatest strengths is Roger Moore who actually gets to play against type here. Rufus Excalibur ffolkes couldn't be more different from Moore's typical characters such as James Bond a bearded moody misogynist cat loving needlework hobbyist who is nevertheless a strategist and man of action. Moore seems much more at home with this character than he ever did playing Bond and as a result he's much more believable here. In fact his performance here may frankly be better than any of his seven outings as 007.The film's cast is strong as well. There's Anthony Perkins as the terrorist leader Kramer a role in which he is well cast and at times quite menacing. There's also a nice if subdued performance from James Mason as Royal Navy Admiral Admiral Sir Francis Brindsen. The cast includes good performances from character actors such as Michael Parks as one of the terrorists David Hedison as King George Baker as a Lloyd's of London representative and Faith Brook as the Prime Minister.The film also features some strong production values. The filming done on an actual ship helps to give an air of authenticity to the film and its events the same can very much be said of both the model work which is excellent minus one or two brief shots and some good underwater photography as well. Director Andrew V. McLaglen as was the case with his previous films The Wild Geese and The Sea Wolves both of which also featured Roger Moore incidentally proved adept at this genre as the film flows nicely along from the initial hijacking to its conclusion with plenty of tension along the way. Of course the backbone of the entire film is the script which allows for McLaglen's direction to do that. Jack Davies script is nicely crafted and even has one or two surprises up its sleeves. Indeed given the film's premise I'm surprised it hasn't been given the typical remake treatment that has become so common place in recent years.ffolkes or whatever you may wish to call it is a good old fashioned thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "Accattone is a NeoRealist examination of slovenly irresponsibility tastelessness and selfpity  you know the fun stuff. Its principal characters a group of young upwardlyimmobile Roman males are almost uniformly repulsive a lot of chestbaring halfsavages whose idea of fun is luring a whore to a deserted spot and beating her to within an inch of her life. Its hero Accattone is played by one of the more unpleasant actors in the history of film a fellow named Franco Citti who manages to singlehandedly set the entire nation of Italy back about twohundred years. It is a film of almost relentless despair depicting a Rome so desolate and squalid so bereft of hope that it seems almost medieval. In the hands of almost any director the movie would be unbearable  either unbearably sentimental or unbearably grim  but with Pasolini at the helm it is merely honest.It isn't Pasolini's best film by a long way but it may be the clearest example of what made the director so special  his ability to probe around the most revolting recesses of the human condition without seeming sensationalistic exploitive or crass. It would be easy to go one of two directions with a character like Accattone a lazy twobit pimp with a son by a woman who wants nothing to do with him the sentimental route or the grotesque. One could easily imagine De Sica the softheart of NeoRealism turning Accattone into a sympathetic misunderstood Everyman. And one could just as easily imagine Fellini the most uptight director maybe in history transforming the character into a universal symbol of societal decay. Pasolini neither a sentimentalist nor a moralist sees Accattone not as a sympathetic character nor as a symbol. The least judgmental director maybe ever Pasolini conceives his characters entirely in terms of their outward behavior and not in moral terms. He neither psychoanalyzes nor seeks to understand his characters. He simply presents them as they are warts and all.It was always the purpose of NeoRealism to present life as it was lived not life as it was imagined by screenwriters directors and actors and there are few more successful ventures in this regard than Accattone. The film's main triumph is in its atmosphere. The Roman days have never seemed so sunbleached so arid and oppressive its nights never so mysterious so full of inexpressible longing not even in Henry James. The characters seem bound to this world in a palpable way their faces shot by expert cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli mirroring the desolation the hopelessness the strangeness of their surroundings. The movie's physicality as always with Pasolini is striking. But pure physical vigor pure atmosphere isn't enough. Where Pasolini comes up short is in assembling the parts of his film into something with real emotional breadth. His first feature shows him already on his way to being a master of the image but also shows that he had a lot to learn about being a master of cinematic rhythm. The strange blend of primitivism and modernism is already there but the command is not. It's a film that works well in the moment but feels thin as a whole. It's a triumph of NeoRealist technique but it only halfsucceeds as a film.Halfsuccessful Pasolini is still better than the best most directors have to give. If you can portray a character as repulsive as boorish and egomaniacal as Accattone  a character with few if any redeeming features  for two hours without alienating your audience...well chalk one up for the director who can do that. Especially one who manages the trick without resorting to sentimental contrivance or the kind of false significance people like Fellini always tried to drum up by filling their movies with obvious symbols the sorts of things artfilm zombies love because it gives them a chance to show their alleged smarts. Pasolini never flatters his audience but he never sneers at them either. He attempts to neither ingratiate himself with the public nor antagonize it in the manner of certain selfimportant avantgardists. The best artists look for what interests them in a piece of material not worrying whether their ideas their approach their style is accessible to the public at large or critics or scholars or their grandmothers or anyone else. Accattone shows Pasolini on the road that would make him one of cinema's best directors  a road traveled by precisely one person Pasolini himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is still a masterpiece of a film you can not afford not to see if you like Pasolini. Accattone is the directorial debut of the Italian neorealist Pier Paolo Pasolini but by a strange coincidence it ended up being the very last of all his movies that I saw. I had seen everything he ever did including short films by the time I got to Accatone and still found it masterful. Franco Citti stars as the title character he is a handsome pimp in Rome's postwar lower depths with an endearing face that speaks volumes of his streetwise upbringing in the slums. To those unaccustomed with Southern Italian culture the way he spends his days with the other local pimps playing cards and being lazy may seem vile but it is actually a well grounded tradition as is also his support of the entire family of his imprisoned friend Ciccio who depend on him for survival. He is obviously a fellow mobster and their code of honor is at stake when Accatone discovers that he is in prison as a result of his whore Maddalena played by Silvana Corsini who denounced Ciccio to the authorities. Even though she is recovering from a broken leg Accatone forces her to go on the streets where she is used beaten and abandoned by Accatone's pals after he tells them the story then she is found by the police and arrested. Accattone nearly starves to death from the total lack of income he even sells all his jewelry to get by. He tries to reunite with his wife with whom he has fathered at least one child but she sees through his seduction act and her virile beautiful brother beats up Accatone in an intense eroticallycharged scene that seems to simulate sexual assault as much as violence between the men. After meeting the innocent and beautiful Stella Franca Pasut he is smitten and tries to get a job so he can support her and his family but he is not accustomed to hardship and has the lack of patience that is typical of spoilt types that have never been trained to work does not make the job last for very long. Never have I seen a more humane direct and simple depiction of the tragic life of these undesirables of society. Pasolini is a master painter narrating with a few gestures all their hardship and suffering. Even getting a plate of food in this world is a memorable accomplishment. We see the whole setting as a sideline of modern society's inability to function properly. The 'corrections' by the police seem to be the most unjust of all and Pasolini presents this panorama of human failing as an allegory of human struggle and spiritual redemption.".

Accattone nearly starves to death from the total lack of income he even sells all his jewelry to get by. He tries to reunite with his wife with whom he has fathered at least one child but she sees through his seduction act and her virile beautiful brother beats up Accatone in an intense eroticallycharged scene that seems to simulate sexual assault as much as violence between the men. After meeting the innocent and beautiful Stella Franca Pasut he is smitten and tries to get a job so he can support her and his family but he is not accustomed to hardship and has the lack of patience that is typical of spoilt types that have never been trained to work does not make the job last for very long. Never have I seen a more humane direct and simple depiction of the tragic life of these undesirables of society. Pasolini is a master painter narrating with a few gestures all their hardship and suffering. Even getting a plate of food in this world is a memorable accomplishment. We see the whole setting as a sideline of modern society's inability to function properly. The 'corrections' by the police seem to be the most unjust of all and Pasolini presents this panorama of human failing as an allegory of human struggle and spiritual redemption.";

	schema:reviewBody "Accattone is a relentless study of the suffering that accompanies poverty. Pasolini utilises the well worn techniques of the Italian neorealist moment to represent the depressing and oppressive life of a pimp  Accattone played by the astonishing Franco Citti  in the slums of postwar Rome. His life is beleaguered by guilt and selfdisgust his occupation which is ostensibly the exploitation of women causes the titular character untold despair. Ultimately he is unable to rationalise his need to eat with the suffering he causes to the women who work for him they are after all also his lovers. Yet Pasolini is careful to maintain the humanity of his protagonist by representing his hopeless situation as equally a result of his own doings as that of the social environment. Pasolini's Accattone is a masterful debut which expertly calls into service the devices of the cinema to convey a depressing but also compassionate narrative. His style is equal parts poetry and melodrama a tough combo for any director. Some moments of this film are as tragically lyrical as those to be found in a film by Robert Bresson or Roberto Rossellini. Accattone is a commendable combination of style and substance which will leave few viewers unaffected.".

	schema:reviewBody "Accattone announces a director Pier Paolo Pasolini who is a hauntinghaunted poet from his surroundings and realist someone who wants to put his eye on the world without flinching on the details of how 'ordinary' of the street people speak and interact how raw and uninhibited they can be these being the guys on the streets who are vulgar and coarse at best and at worst are abusers of women. But at the same time what one comes away with is poetry in documentary form  it's another level of neorealism a little more like an urban story than a postwar treatise that still throbs with the importance of those in poverty. Anytime I hear the song Matthaus Passion I'll immediately contemplate those harsh images of Vittorio Accattone being cast aside by his family for being a pimp or that poor girl being beaten at night by that gang of men which is something that elevates such hard scenes into art.Vittorio Accattone is the main character charming and attractive and also a perpetual scoundrel who also is a total outcast. He has a wife and kids but is estranged from them by choice  her choice most likely  and he finds himself in big trouble once his main prostitute Maddalena is sent to prison for a bad informing job. It's after this we see Accatone on his potential path to redemption when he meets a supremely sweet and average girl from out of town Stella who he may eye as a new girl on the street... or perhaps not as his attachment to her grows more and stronger in spite of what and who are around him every day and night in the dirty province.He's someone we want to root for in being a better person or perhaps even better at what he does. He's a tragic antihero in a NewWave sort of sense cool looking and aspiring to be modern and cool and maybe he is up to a point but also poor and uneducated so much so that being on the fringe and being called PIMP! is what he's been reduced to by default. The performance from Franco Citti is one thing that keeps the viewer locked in he's so good here because he looks plucked right off the street by Pasolini as would turn to be his method with choosing most of his 'actors' on camera. There's a reality to his interactions with his friends so called or his business associates. Some of their dialog and tones of speech aren't refined or look trained. At one point when Citti's Vittorio breaks down in tears a sudden turn from a previous scene showing more attitude is authentic even as another actor could have possibly played it better.It is what Pasolini wants and he gets it much in the same way he also gets a view of this side of Rome in a way that hasn't been seen before up until this time. His DP Tonino Delli Colli shoots simply often and sometimes not so much  there's complexity say to a tracking shot in front of Accatone talking to a girl who is on a bicycle or when we see the horrorshow of the men taking Maddalena at night in the middle of nowhere the only lights starkly coming from the car. The effect is nothing short of a slowburn. While a few of the actors do fall a bit too flat and some scenes come close to lagging around the editing might be the most significant flaw here the raw emotion and fire in the subject matter keeps things fascinating. You want to see what happens with this young guy and it's his tragedy that gets us absorbed even as the Bach music abstracts the sorrow and agonizing poetry of the streets and it's this that makes it a classic.Only downside I must mention  if you live in the US or happen to watch it on a DVD or online from Walter Bearer films the print is just not very good. It's the sort where the white subtitles drop in and out of view depending on who's standing where in a frame. It's not totally detrimental but some scenes become hard to follow due to the poor quality of the subtitles with the print. This if for no other reason demands the film receive the Criteron treatment.".

Franco Citti the character of Accattone perfectly embodies the roman lumpenproletariat of the time idle fatalistic and desperate. Pasolini met Franco's brother Sergio a plasterer hanging around Cinecitt in 1951. He introduced him to his brother Franco that became Pasolini's dialectical adviser for Accattone Mamma Roma and his book Ragazzi di vita his living vocabulary as he called him. Indeed Pasolini interests for dialects and slangs Roman is not really a dialect anymore but a slang was not disappointed. The dialogues between the characters are full of fantasy rude and in some way reminiscent of their peasant past. A must see if you're interested in Neorealism and in the ways of the underworld lumpenproletariat. Someone connected this movie with Bunuel's Los Olvidados. I definitely agree.".

	schema:headline " Free radical";
	schema:reviewBody "Accattone is a Roman pimp who lives off his girlfriend Maddalena's earnings. Pasolini's cheeky aim is to put forward this young man as a modern saint. To this end he lathers Bach's St Matthew's Passion inspired by the Apostle's experience of the crucifixion of Christ over scenes of Accattone's life. Indeed in one of Accattone's first scenes he's shown devouring a slice of tomato displayed horizontally as if a cardinal's galero whilst an sculpture of perhaps a guardian angel can be seen over his shoulder in the distance an anticlerical proChrist stance seems to be a consistent theme for Pasolini. Later a prophecy regarding Accattone's descent is eerily similar to Christ's pronunciation of Peter's forthcoming triple renunciation.The film reminded me of a DH Lawrence poem elliptically titled DemocracyI love the sun in any man  when I see it between his brows  clear and fearless even if tiny  But when I see these grey successful men  so hideous and corpselike utterly sunless  like gross successful slaves mechanically waddling  then I am more than radical I want to work a guillotine...I feel that when people have gone utterly sunless  they shouldn't exist. Whatever Accattone is he's not sunless when he tries out the world of work legitimate work involving labour he becomes Vittorio his Christian name and the light goes out. The film reminds me very much of Fassbinder's Gods of the Plague in that sense young men with brio but no skills or education who given the choice between drudgery or crime choose crime. Both films polemicise against urban postindustrial capitalist societies which have become increasingly removed from the milieu in which humanity evolved and is designed to cope with. When Accattone compares the chore of lifting rolls of iron with the horrors of Buchenwald the film goes a little over the top.Of course someone viewing Accattone and his friends through less of a haze of desire than the director might think that they were just a bunch of jerks. Undeniably though Pasolini is a great poet and there's evidence of things to come here the film whilst looking largely Bertoluccian he was the assistant director has the occasional master shot for example the rolling hills and valley in the dream sequence par with Leonardo in quality of composition and symbolism the countryside here representing an idealised rural precursor to Accattone's slum existence.I also applaud Pasolini for taking his arguments beyond class Accattone's group of spongers contains educated men as well as dunces and they are equally disdainful of the ruling class as they are of proletarians.".

	schema:headline " Incredibly bleak tale told without sentiment or moral preaching";
	schema:reviewBody "The term 'accattone' is an old Italian phrase intended to brand a character with an aura of absolute repulsiveness. Thieves and lowlives would usually coin the term when referring to a character that is so despicable so without moral or social decency that even the criminals would look down upon them. In Pier Paolo Pasolini's incredibly assured debut 'Accattone' is Vittorio Franco Citti a lowlife pimp who when he is not sitting around squeezing money out of people with wagers and tricks is abusing his lone prostitute who cannot work after breaking her leg in a motorcycle accident. It's a tale of a despicable scumbag set during a dark period in Rome where men viewed working as slave labour and enjoyed themselves by beating prostitutes to within an inch of their life.It's an incredibly bleak tale told without sentiment and moral preaching. Pasolini's doesn't seem to want to dictate a larger social message or make Accattone a sympathetic character who is the victim of political or social oppression but to simply tell a tale a real tale of a group of lowlives who are the way they are because they want to be. After all the true soul of neorealism is to portray life the way actual people experience it not to romanticise or sentimentalise it with the kind of scripts Hollywood are responsible for. Of course many neorealist directors would almost betray the genres roots the kind of way only auteurs can manage and Pasolini would go on to make more surrealistic and interpretive movies but this is true neorealism without any kind of magical reward for the audience or a moment of redemptive enlightenment for its protagonist. It's a story of grit one that is thrilling and fascinating in equal measures and with the stamp of a great director.The film I felt it more akin to is Luis Bunuel's Los Olvidados 1950 a film of equal disregard for cinematic wonder and one that is also punctured by an impressive dream sequence. Whilst Bunuel's sequence came around the middle section and was a burst of absolute surrealistic beauty amongst social depravity Accattone's comes during its climax a strange moody setpiece in which Accattone witnesses his own funeral amongst other things. At first I felt like it was almost betraying what came before but then I realised it was Pasolini's way to try and get into its characters head and the outcome is as confusing and as futile as Accattone himself. Though I haven't seen much of Pasolini's work this is the best I've seen beating even the distressing brilliance of his final film Salo 1975. Though he would move away from neorealism Pasolini achieves more with his debut than some of the greats of the genre would manage to achieve.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

It is about the periphery of Rome during the postwar years and the better life that capitalism created for the masses yet fundamentally forgot about these denizens of the borgate. If you like contradictions dichotomies and are a film of uberneorealism read this film. The protagonist Accattone is yes a pimp but he is a pimp because that is how he is rendered through society. Pasolini gives a weird sort of dignity to the slummy atmosphere and seedy characters that reside in it. Christological imagery is prevalent!!! If you are mildly cognizant of Renaissance and Baroque art you will see what I am talking about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Accatone is an interesting film because Pasolini exposes to his audience a particular lifestyle and social class which would not be accurately touched on in an American picture. If Hollywood had ever discussed Accatone's subject matter they would display it with all its stereotypical adornments and falsities which most US moviegoers are accustomed to. Pasolini is not afraid to present the grittier side of the subproletariat as is epitomized in the film's main character Accatone who struggles with his profession of pimping and becoming more sensitive to his women and to the world. Pasolini's debut is delicately permeated with political concepts and allegories yet we can see that he is experimenting newly with the technique of film and developing a filmic narrative structure more of his fullfledged sociopolitical  allegories would be pursued in films like The Gospel and Hawks and Sparrows. The film stars Franco Citti who at the time of making of the film was a nonprofessional. However his performance is substantial considering him being a novice and having his voice overdubbed by another actor. Citti would soon become a Pasolini regular starring in Oedipus Rex Arabian Nights and other supporting roles. However as the film progresses the attention is centered on the female lead who plays the naive soontobe callous farm worker who is duped by Accatone into prostitution. Before Pasolini ventured into the cinema he had a knack for writing. In his first two novels Pasolini had utilized the language of his mother's homeland Friuli for colloquial discourse amongst his characters who lived in subproletariat communities. It is not surprising that the subject of these novels would be the focal point of Accatone. In addition I believe Pasolini had rendered his ideas from his literature appropriately for his film yet not becoming to carried away with fidelity and technical aspects which are profuse in films today. To this day there are apparently no film directors as consciously aware of his country and government as Pasolini was and that would transcend these beliefs into his art with controversy yet at the same time subtlety.".

Accatone is at its best a chunk of life which Pasolini managed to extract not as it initially was but dramatically filtered through his own personal lyrical gaze. Gangs prostitutes lies and deceit lie in this film's core. A sense of irresponsible opportunism is seen in this film almost no regrets for the past and no fears for the future. In fact the movie's tragic hero Vittorio Accatone is a dark alterego of yet another favored Italian movie character embodied only a year before by Marcello Mastroianni in La Dolce Vita. Perhaps in this case Accatone was not a party animal journalist who sought ephemeral pleasure in social middleclass gatherings and women but the spirit is by itself maintained astonishingly faithfully Accatone is no longer a protagonist in Pasolini's movie doomed to descend lower and lower in social class losing both his dignity his social acceptability and his profound style but a symbol a metaphor for Pasolini's own political beliefs. Under this figure of a brute behind the otherwise repelling image of a short dirty man with a sly smile and a peculiar walk lies the failure of post war Italian government a government which according to this movie's subtext strove so hopelessly to attain social and economical success for Rome's population and somehow neglected or marginalized Rome's peripheries causing people like Accatone and his girlfriends to result in prostitution and theft. A kind of pretension and makebelief well being which was also visible at the time in America. Yes Accatone is the result of this American Dream's pastische.".

Prostitution and unemployment were characteristics in Rome of those days. Accatone is a young lazy guy living of what he can earn in a day but not working i.e. stealing anything he finds and using illegally nice ladies as prostitutes. One day he decided to start working but it was too hard for him so he came back doing the same as in the past stealing and smuggling anywhere. The film is spoken in Romanacio dialect so I suspect that even for some Italians in the North this film has to be dubbed to the Italian Toscana dialect language otherwise they would not understand it properly. It is also a possibility to see poor parts of the city and new built areas. The river Tevere was not as polluted as it is now because the Romans used to swim in it.".

Sorry but having a broken leg doesn't work that way.This first prostitute is shown getting badly beaten yet then is shown in the police station without a bruise on her. Now that NeoUnRealism if I ever saw it.That the protagonist is shown almost starving after his only hooker is jailed is just STUPID. Pimps are street savvy guys who have more than one girl in their stable and are street smart enough to make money in a variety of ways besides pimping.I could go on and on but what's the point? The costumes the characters and dialogue is nothing close to appropriate for the social situation that this film is supposedly portraying. This filmmaker obviously never entered the slums of a big city and never met real pimps and prostitutes. He was making a supposedly realistic account of a social scene of which he was obviously ignorant.This is the first Pasollini film that I've viewed and it's his first film that he made.

He begrudges one who is playing in the dirt for not acknowledging him  even as he lifts a chain from the toddler's neck.

We watch him transform from wishing to feed off and then be the one who feeds this compelling woman. It's a very hard life and Accatone doesn't have it in him to continue for long so it's his suicidal depression that liberates him in the end.I found the film's abrupt ending a little too facile and wished for a more profound conclusion. Yet maybe part of the message here is that life is harsh and then it stops  no dress rehearsal no warning. Accatone was my introduction to the work of Pasolini and I'm definitely eager to see more.".

It is a more than tragic fact that while Pasolini in his real life even went so far as to have lectures in the slums in the front of an audience that could not understand him he finally got a victim from exactly the same people who did accept him as he accepted them.Accattone is the story about a wasted senseless and hopeless life.

He does not mind to send back to streetwalking his severely hurt primewhore Maddalena. In the night he dreams that he is dead and forbidden to attend his own funeral.

Out of all directors Pasolini can certainly be described as one of the most compassionate and spiritual if I can use this term for an atheist. No other director has shown such brotherly love and understanding towards those on the very lowest rung of society as he has Those society skives like the prostitutes pimps and thieves. The film's character is neither a saint nor complete sinner. He may exploit women for his wellbeing due to the economic system we live in that both encourages and sometimes forces us to be parasitic upon others. However at the same time he also capable of great selfsacrifice and love as shown by his desire to takes care of a homeless woman with 4 small children. The film is a metaphor about our current classbased capitalist world. The system is an infernal machine. We on this earth live in a Hell created by our social system. Pasolini was a dedicated socialist. The film begins with a quote from Dante's Purgatorio implying that the best we the lower class as symbolized by the main character Accatone can hope for is to die and go to Purgatory to atone for our sins.".

Pasolini captures their aimless existence with his artless cinematography. Most of the dialogue is shot close up and the cast deliver their lines with character and simplicity. It is perhaps their authenticity that makes them charming. Even Accatone is charming despite his selfishness idleness resentment and occasional misogyny. They all need to be charming. In the bleak world of this movie irony is the only defence against madness. There are moments of happiness that break through and prevent the film from becoming monotonous or unrealistic. The beach scene near the start and the later conversations between the tough and selfconfident prostitutes are scenes in which irony breaks out into humour and defiance momentarily turns to content.The world will kill me or I'll kill it! exclaims Accatone.

There are some lovely unexpected moments. Without giving too much away... it's a relief to see a script dispense with the old lie piled upon lie clich and instead have characters who decide to live up to their responsibilities. If you thought you would never get to see a New York intellectuals film in which grownups behave like grownups for once  well here's your chance.There are also some great lines. It's impossible not to smile at Ian Holm's vaguely monomaniacal therapist intoning in his Argentinian accent once you start driving assbackward through life it can be very hard to stop. And you realise too late that the major decisions in your life are lying in the road like so many crushed squirrels. This is possibly my favourite therapist quote since Ingrid Bergman was told in Spellbound to have sweet dreams  and tomorrow we will analyse them over breakfast. Ian Holm makes the part work perfectly because he doesn't overdo it.You end up feeling affection for both the therapist and his client even though they are at odds. This is one of the film's best qualities. Secondary characters get a chance to develop so for instance the father is not just an old tartar and the motherinlaw not just a disapproving snoop. What's most evident in this film is the writer's sympathy for almost every character so that whether or not they are redeemed you find yourself seeing their point of view if just in momentary flashes. I loved this.Meanwhile Famke Janssen gets a rare chance to act and lives up to it.The sweet thing about this film is that it isn't slavishly Woody Allen or pointedly antiWoody Allen either. It plays as if Woody Allen never existed. This means that there are no weary inevitabilities. Anything might happen and frequently doesn't because something else intriguing happens instead.It doesn't all work but I've only got minor gripes. Overall it could have done with being just a little longer to make some of the secondary relationships more convincing. But erring on the side of keeping it short was probably the smarter mistake to make.If you get a chance to see this go. Decide for yourself which review gets it right.".

After a bad breakup is there any other kind? he runs into his ex Julia March of NBC's Law  Order SVU and opens his fresh wounds to the fact she has moved on and gotten engaged.

On top of that he is jockeying for a summer sabbatical to London for the school by making good with the headmaster Rees at a gettogether dinner held at a trustees' widow's home.The recent widow Allegra Marshall the gorgeous Janssen best known as Jane Grey from the XMEN film franchise in one of her best performances to date is also in a state of flux dealing with her grief at the loss of her husband the victim of a sudden heart attack leaving her to care for their young impressionable son and a toddler they were in line for adopting she has failed to report his death to the agency negotiating the legalities.Jake is smitten with the hostess  at first unknowing she is a widow  and begins to take interest in her and her family.

	schema:reviewBody "I grabbed this off the shelf without much thought but was generally pleased with it as a selection. It is the story of a single Manhattan high school teacher who is in psychotherapy. The film makes good use of fantasy by startling us with imaginary interventions by his extraordinarily aggressive and ribald therapist at dramatic junctures during his day. While the leading character Jake has experienced a romantic disappointment in an earlier relationship the main thrust of his therapy seems directed at a battle against mediocrity. Apparently acareer as a high school teacher does not count as success. Apparently also the elderly therapist considers a year without sex a major red flag. Apart from these shortcomings Jake seems to conduct himself cautiously but extremely well leaving me wondering about the correctness of his mediocrity.This film does a good job of representing older people for example the therapist and Jake's father as well as others as something else besides useless. Here they are accepted enough to assert themselves their intelligence is respected and occasionally heeded.The plot held my attention through its twists and turns. Two points I felt were a lapse into hackneyed stereotypes involved the feminism of his lover Allegra. To begin with she initiates the first sex even though things seemed to be proceeding along nicely and routinely assumes the aggressive role after that as well. I questioned whether this would really be cool in real life. I suppose this could be taken as the otherwise lacking evidence of his neurosis by accepting it except that it is all her actions.Secondly after they have had frequent and mutually gratifying sex get along great he well on his way to being accepted by her two children and to cap it all off she is about to lose custody of her young daughter because the adoption stipulated a twoparent household with all this in play she rejects his heartfelt proposal of marriage because she is 'not ready' just a year after becoming a widow. These two facts might suggest that she a rich woman was using him as a convenience. However the rest of her character as portrayed does not support that at all. Instead the flick is merely waving a PC flag of liberated woman even when it is absurd to garner brownie points. Ultimately however all such complexity of living is suddenly swept away in a traditional happilyeverafter romantic endingbut one so hasty that I definitely felt they were running out of film. I don't want to sound like I would entirely reengineer the film but I definitely felt it was going somewhere else. But these are lapses in authenticity in a film notable for authenticity. It is an engaging and often quite funny flick.".

	schema:headline " a romantic comedy that doesn't insult its audience";
	schema:reviewBody "Commitmentphobic characters are a dime a dozen in romantic comedies. Yet no one can deny that they serve a valid function  for without all the tension they bring to the story how would writers ever get us to that inevitable happy ending? In The Treatment which director Oren Rudavsky coadapted with Daniel Saul Housman from the novel by Daniel Menaker Jake Singer is an English teacher at a Manhattan prep school who falls in love with a wealthy widow whose son is a pupil there. The problem is that Jake like many men of his generation seems utterly paralyzed when it comes to taking the fullon plunge into commitment and marriage. In an attempt to overcome this weakness he regularly sees a shrink who is clearly an advocate of the nononsense tough love school of psychotherapy and who keeps insisting that Jake stop whining and making excuses for himself and simply get with the program.On the surface The Treatment doesn't appear to be much different from dozens of other romantic comedies that have come our way over the years but the scenario plays out with so much charm and wit that it makes the situation itself seem new and fresh. We really get caught up in the lives of these characters mainly because the filmmakers go to great lengths to avoid the superficialities and clichs that render so many romantic comedies phony and unreal. The film is helped immeasurably in this regard by the superb performances by Chris Eigeman and Famke Janssen who have an amazing chemistry on screen and thus are able to convince us that these two quite different people could indeed be genuinely drawn to one another. Ian Holm steals every scene he's in as the hilariously deadpan therapist who isn't afraid to say what he thinks even at those times when he's only appearing as a figment of Jake's guiltridden imagination. Harris Yulin is also wonderful as Jake's pragmatic father who still harbors resentment towards his son for not following in his footsteps and becoming a doctor.Given its low budget the movie may be a trifle rough around the edges at times but that lack of polish actually turns out to be a key ingredient in the movie's overall success. For once a romantic comedy that actually works.".

The main characters are Jake Singer an anxious young schoolteacher who has broken up with his girlfriend and seems resigned to a life of mediocrity his shrink Dr Ernesto Morales Ian Holm who describes himself as the last great Freudian  'in a line stretching from Moses to Aristotle' and Allegra Marshall a beautiful young socialite that takes a fancy to him.The film aims at a serious note with the unrelenting intrusive and almost sadistic treatment meted out by Dr Morales. Jake's baggage is all too obvious and although there must be easier routes the 'treatment' does show signs of working even when Jake starts wondering if he has maybe just 'hallucinated' the encounters. A subplot about adoption tries to bring in some emotional ballast to fill the chasm left by Jake and Allegra's lack of onscreen chemistry.The Treatment meanders along like an episode of Sex and the City or Frasier  only where nothing much happens. At first captivating the endless litany of inconsequential detail and forced humour soon begins to wear. I thought he was supposed to make you feel more comfortable in your own skin says Allegra about Jake's analyst. No he's more the exfoliating type. In discussing one of Jake's favourite books Allegra quotes a comment about the author redrawing the landscape to place equal emphasis on what's not said. Sadly this film has too much that is said and that which is not said has too little substance to justify the barely relevant meanderings of school sports halls or Dr Morales' questions about sexual positions. Ian Holm delivers a fine performance but the script while not completely without merit has too little to for such a great actor to get his teeth into. We are told that the lover in Jake is undernourished and the selfpitying side overfed much the same could be said of this bloated drawnout and not particularly engaging film.".

Holm was the one actor who garnered a laugh. But they both seem out of place heavy hitters in a smaller film. It could be that a bigger star was set to play Chris but dropped out leaving the film with less studio support while Famke and Ian stayed on.

If you want to see the Christie books presented accurately on screen view the versions with Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. They work perfectly with the characters settings and time period of the orginals.However authenticity is not one of the reasons for seeing this series of films. Margaret Rutherford is a screen gem...working with her real life husband Stringer Davis as cosleuth his character never appeared in any of the Christie novels they form a wonderful partnership. I only wish they had continued this series. 'Gallop' features some excellent supporting actors  Flora Robson Finlay Curie and especially Robert Morley. It's filmed in beautiful black and white which captures the early 1960's quite well.For an entertaining evening of pure delight this is a mystery to cherish!".

	schema:reviewBody "Having admired lovable Miss Marple and Mr Stringer in MURDER SHE SAID dealing with a very special case of murders at the Ackenthorpe Hall it seemed that hardly can they pursue a trail on their own more effectively. Nevertheless she is daring enough to state in MURDER AT THE GALLOP powerfully We have us and our methods and this bursts out in riveting thrill and entertainment. MURDER AT THE GALLOP with magnificent Dame Margaret Rutherford in the lead provides yet new sensations thrills secrets to unveil and goose skin to experience. Along with its obvious echoes of the first part MURDER AT THE GALLOP is an altogether haunting mysterious and absorbing experience. In what way?A BIT OF ITS STORYLINE An old mansion of the Enderby family...a shocking thing happens as Miss Marple and Mr Stringer open the front door of the mansion. The old Enderby played by iconic MGM actor Finlay Currie hauntingly falls dead on the staircase. Heart attack or murder? Presumably frightened to death of cats the former reason seems more likely to be adequate even for the police inspector Craddock Charles Tingwell. But for Miss Marple falsely perceived by the Inspector as a 'busybody' who merely has 'tittle tattle to convey' that will never be a satisfactory conclusion. She is frightened to death of nothing. Having 'snooped' the family gathering of the Enderbys she overhears a significant statement when Mr Stringer again gives her a 'leg up' and proceeds in order to trap the killer. Travelling by bikes is enough to do more than best investigators in limousines. With a little bit of cooking skills note this aspect and a little bit of determination events unexpectedly prove that the law might sometimes have a long arm but unfortunately to the great surprise of those who doubt her that never resembles Miss Marple's proceedings...MADAME RUTHERFORD AND OTHER MAINSTAYS Echoing the previous part aids seeing Madame Rutherford in this film because her already familiar style constitutes the very core of entertainment and thrill. Again with some witty moments and cutting remarks that add the spicy aspect to the whole movie MURDER AT THE GALLOP is a sole entertainment. Margaret Rutherford is outstanding in the role and her moments include some of the quintessential parts of the entire success of the movie. She proves again that Marple is her name but marble her nature... As a creative and gifted performer from the very start she proves to dominate our attention considerably. Thanks to her well crafted performance again thrill is combined with humor and cutting tongue with the most honest intentions. Among many of the brilliant scenes a mention must be made of her dance with Mr Stringer when she deliberately falls ill and he in a disguised manner 'hots it up' as well as hilarious horseriding with Mr Hector Eckerby Robert Morley. As for other mainstays like Stringer Davis and Charles Tingwell the memorable performances clearly echo MURDER SHE SAID and there is no need to outline their contribution again. Let me however highlight some important merits of the supporting cast here.TWO SUPPORTING CAST Within the peculiar dynasty of the Enderbys truly sophisticated characters emerge. As a matter of fact the supporting cast who appear to be outstanding in their parts are Flora Robson and Robert Morley. While Ms Robson portrays the strangely calm oddly suspicious type who catches our attention finally Mr Morley handles the very essence of the film's psychological and humorous aspect. As a serious buff of the old furniture a man 'saddled' in old manners and strict in human relations a funny horserider who is a rather sympathetic comedian type provides wit brilliantly. The scene with pulling of the boots for instance is hilarious. As he was a friend of Dame Margaret Rutherford in real life their scenes are played with ease and humor. When the events turn more intense and murder at the gallop becomes reality he changes into a decent observer. THE FILM'S EFFECT The unique atmosphere of the MGM sets makebelieve tricks of the genre the undertones of images growing tensions and Ron Goodwin's catchy music score are just some of the aspects that contribute clearly to its good reputation as a silver screen product of the time.If you liked MURDER SHE SAID you will surely enjoy MURDER AT THE GALLOP and follow the wonderful investigation of the Agatha Christie's character so memorably portrayed by Madame Rutherford. The law might have a long arm indeed but Miss Marple...never! As she does not agree to keep her saddle at the Enderbys when their case is complete she leaves with Mr Stringer and makes us look forward to more thrill of the genre. A must see for Agatha Christie's fans who are less strict with the screen adaptations than the author herself.".

	schema:reviewBody "As is well known by now Dame Agatha Christie was not enamoured of Dame Margaret Rutherford's take on her Jane Marple creation. Fair enough as Dame Agatha had lovingly constructed a plain Jane spinstereverywoman who underneath the quiet demeanour and placid knitting possessed a mind sharper than the point of any of her knitting needles. And like television's Columbo she was always underestimated to the eventual chagrin of the guilty party in the crime under investigation. As a fan of the BBCPBS Masterpiece Mystery series I have probably seen most if not all of Dame Agatha's books dramatized my favourites being those with Joan Hickson whom I find to be the very embodiment of the Jane Marple Dame Agatha originally had in mind. That said I am not so much of a purist that I cannot enjoy Dame Margaret Rutherford's decidedly non Dame Agatha approach to super sleuth Jane Marple. In short all four films in the MGM produced series are a pure delight with MURDER AT THE GALLOP just barely edging out MURDER SHE SAID as my personal favourite.Others have more than adequately provided a synopsis of this and the other trio of Marple movies in the series so I won't retill that ground. Suffice to say if you haven't seen any of them or you just want a good light engaging Brit whodunit then don't miss any of these wonderful confections. I've seen them all many times and yet every repeat showing finds me totally entertained by Dame Margaret real life hubby Stringer Davis Charles Tingwell the excellent casts of supporting players and Ron Goodwin's superb scores. Indeed they are still as much fun today as when first viewed in their initial theatrical runs back in the sixties.".

As a fan of the BBCPBS Masterpiece Mystery series I have probably seen most if not all of Dame Agatha's books dramatized my favourites being those with Joan Hickson whom I find to be the very embodiment of the Jane Marple Dame Agatha originally had in mind. That said I am not so much of a purist that I cannot enjoy Dame Margaret Rutherford's decidedly non Dame Agatha approach to super sleuth Jane Marple. In short all four films in the MGM produced series are a pure delight with MURDER AT THE GALLOP just barely edging out MURDER SHE SAID as my personal favourite.Others have more than adequately provided a synopsis of this and the other trio of Marple movies in the series so I won't retill that ground. Suffice to say if you haven't seen any of them or you just want a good light engaging Brit whodunit then don't miss any of these wonderful confections. I've seen them all many times and yet every repeat showing finds me totally entertained by Dame Margaret real life hubby Stringer Davis Charles Tingwell the excellent casts of supporting players and Ron Goodwin's superb scores. Indeed they are still as much fun today as when first viewed in their initial theatrical runs back in the sixties.";

	schema:reviewBody "Miss Marple MARGARET RUTHERFORD and her loyal friend the local librarian Mr Stringer STRINGER DAVIS are out collecting funds for the reformed criminals league. They call upon the house of the elderly but wealthy recluse Mr Enderby and he collapses and falls down the stairs dead. It was well known that old Enderby had suffered from a chronic heart condition for many years and the coroner duly records the death as natural causes. However it was also well known that he was terrified of cats and Miss Marple was the only one who noticed the cat that was prowling around his home. This brings her to the conclusion that he was murdered and she approaches Chief Inspector Craddock CHARLES TINGWELL with her theory. However as with the last time that Miss Marple approached him about someone being murdered he dismisses her and refuses to look into it. Miss Marple realises that she and Mr Stringer must conduct their own investigation. They eavesdrop on the reading of old Enderby's will. Present at the reading are Enderby's nephew Hector ROBERT MORLEY his niece Rosamund Shane KATYA DOUGLAS and her husband Michael JAMES VILLIERS. His second cousin George Crossfield ROBERT URQUHART and his sister Cora Lansquenet. The motive of the crime becomes seemingly clear  25000 to be divided up among Enderby's relatives. However things turn out not to be as simple as they first appear when Cora says Well he was murdered wasn't he? In order to try and press Cora about what she meant Miss Marple pays a call at her cottage and finds Cora dead stabbed through the back with a hat pin. Inspector Craddock has to take Miss Marple seriously now but can't stand her butting in and solving his cases for him. The Enderby family are staying at Hector's riding establishment The Gallop Hotel and Miss Marple checks in for a week in order to investigate the family members and find the killer.The success of MURDER SHE SAID 1962 see my review lead to three sequels which were very much in the same dated but engagingly tongue in cheek vein. The cast is exemplary with Robert Morley shining as the eccentric Hector Flora Robson as Cora's seemingly timid companion Miss Milcrest while Robert Urquhart Frankenstein's teacher Paul Krempe in Hammer's CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN also scores in his part as the suave but shifty artdealer George Crossfield. However as always it is Margaret Rutherford who steals the picture as Miss Marple. Even though she's nothing like Agatha Christie's creation she manages to make the role so convincingly her own as the sharp and eccentric spinster that it hardly mattered at all. Rutherford is both funny and a great character at the same time. This is the one that contains that classic scene in which Miss Marple does the twist in order to fake a heart attack so that she can lure the killer into a trap. George Pollock's direction is smooth and effortlessly meshes comedy with mystery and he is most ably assisted by the gorgeous black and white photography of Arthur Ibbetson which gives the picture a touch of class while its genuinely sinister at the same time with its subtle use of shadow and composition. The film is based on the novel AFTER THE FUNERAL in which the case was originally solved by Hercule Poirot! It looks as if soon that David Suchet will be filming a version of this book and it will be interesting to see how it differs from this production.All in all MURDER AT THE GALLOP emerges as one of the best films in MGM's quintet of Miss Marple whodunits.".

Although maybe not quite as fresh as the first entry in the series 'Murder She Said' this film clearly delivers what every Agatha Christie loving citizen expects from a movie version of one of her many books. In my opinion Rutherford was able to bring more pep into Miss Marple than any other actress since or how I have seen her in my mind while reading the stories. In general the four Marple films made in the 1960's with Rutherford have clearly a more entertaining mood in them which is not always so with many other adaptations.The scriptwriter has even jokingly made Marple to specifically mention how great and useful Agatha Christie's books are when you are trying to solve a puzzling murder case by yourself. And what is she doing in the first shots during the title sequence? She goes around around collecting money for a reforming criminals assistance fund. A fine way to set the mood and the tongue in the right place for the rest of the movie. Later on she does twist on the dancing ball in order to fake a heart attack.

It makes the movie a fun one to watch also thanks to the perfectly suiting musical score by Ron Goodwin. Due to the way the story is told the whole plot line of who is the murderer becomes a bit muddled in and isn't the most interesting thing about the movie. It's way more interesting to think of WHY the murders were committed rather then by who and how. This movie therefor isn't perhaps the best example of a good British whodunit movie but it's a fun and lighthearted one to watch nevertheless. So there are still plenty of reasons why one should watch this movie.Margaret Rutherford is in her element as the old nosy and clever lady Miss Marple. The movie is supported by a cast that perhaps is not the best example of the best actors around but it sorts of suits the movie fine. After all the actors serve their purpose and play the characters well enough without claiming too much attention or straining of the main story. After all this is a Miss Marple movie.

Fascinating because she can do so many things that are so unexpected such as climbing the top of a pile of barrels on a draughtsman's cart to snoop overhear and eavesdrop in order to know what is being said in a private meeting in some notary public's office. But she reveals herself again as an exchampion this time in horse riding in some kind of competition some decades ago. She even reveals herself as a Charleston dancer in the old days turned a twist dancer in the early 1960s. Persistent little booger who cannot be stopped even by a criminal and a nasty criminal there is in the surrounding vicinity. Everyone expects a man and it is not. Everyone expects a family person and it is not. Everyone expects the criminal to hit and strike again and that is the real truth. It happens in no time over and over and over again. Marvelous. But she declines a proposal that would have been charming business for her but she is too keen on snooping and meddling and investigating that she cannot accept to become a businesswoman behind a counter even if it is a luxury counter. And I must admit Margaret Rutherford is a prodigious actress that can turn any simple situation into some kind of dark deep mysterious menacing trap for criminals of course but also for the audience. And her films have such a wonderful level of humor that it becomes hilarious at times like when she pretends she is suffering a severe heart attack. We wonder how gullible people can be criminals can be to fall into such a shady but threadbare trap. It is true this second level reading or watching is also one essential element in these simple films.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

But she reveals herself again as an exchampion this time in horse riding in some kind of competition some decades ago. She even reveals herself as a Charleston dancer in the old days turned a twist dancer in the early 1960s. Persistent little booger who cannot be stopped even by a criminal and a nasty criminal there is in the surrounding vicinity. Everyone expects a man and it is not. Everyone expects a family person and it is not. Everyone expects the criminal to hit and strike again and that is the real truth. It happens in no time over and over and over again. Marvelous. But she declines a proposal that would have been charming business for her but she is too keen on snooping and meddling and investigating that she cannot accept to become a businesswoman behind a counter even if it is a luxury counter. And I must admit Margaret Rutherford is a prodigious actress that can turn any simple situation into some kind of dark deep mysterious menacing trap for criminals of course but also for the audience. And her films have such a wonderful level of humor that it becomes hilarious at times like when she pretends she is suffering a severe heart attack. We wonder how gullible people can be criminals can be to fall into such a shady but threadbare trap. It is true this second level reading or watching is also one essential element in these simple films.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines";

Apart from the thinning out of the large and complicated family and the introduction of the riding element the basic plot of the novel is pretty much intact although nothing like as intricate  the whole 'painting' thing really seems to come out of nowhere and delightful though Flora Robson is I wish her character had been better developed.

Robert Morley is a delight and wonderfully balances comic timing with a stiff upper lip. It took me a while to finger Miss Milchrest Flora Robson as the murderer my only clue being that she wasn't a family member that might have cashed in on the Enderby death. Nice twist there as well.But for a real mystery consider these  all that business about the plaster cast matching the boot stirrup mark really didn't have anything to do with solving the crime. So how did it show up in the first place at the Enderby house? As for the valuable painting at the center of the intrigue when first introduced it appeared that the picture wasn't very large.

In memory of his fine contribution to the performing arts I decided to continue watching George Pollock's series of Miss Marple films in which Tingwell portrayed Inspector Craddock. Next on the list was 'Murder at the Gallop 1962' the second of four films to star Margaret Rutherford as Agatha Christie's Miss Jane Marple. Though of course the film truly belongs to its amateur spinster sleuth Tingwell nonetheless brings a remarkable warmth and sincerity to the role of the goodnatured but exasperated Craddock who's constantly torn between his affection for Marple and his frustration that she's always one step ahead of him. Unlike Sherlock Holmes' Inspector Lestrade he is not an object of ridicule  representative of incompetent police force  but one of openmindedness and practicality. Inspector Craddock seems to accept Miss Marple's crimesolving talents with a quietlyamused resignation however much her conclusions may show up his own investigative proficiency.The central mystery was loosely adapted from Agatha Christie's novel After the Funeral notably a Poirot story but the bulk of the plot came from James P. Cavanagh a writer of television thrillers. In this instalment Miss Marple determines to investigate the suspicious passing of wealthy Scrooge Mr. Endeby Finlay Currie whom she believes was literally frightened to death by an impatient heir. With the loyal assistance of Mr. Stringer Stringer Davis and the occasional compliance of the increasinglyupstaged Inspector Craddock Marple attempts to scrutinise everybody who stands to gain from Endeby's will and conveniently they're all temporarily residing at the same place the Gallows hotel owned by Endeby's bumbling horseobsessed nephew Robert Morley. The clues are all there for both Marple and the audience to decipher but multiple red herrings are also thrown into the mix. Our suspicions are only further confused by the fact that that all the potential murderers appear to hate each other and none are at all surprised nor saddened by the untimely deaths of their relatives.".

It tells the story of Nick Chapman Kevin Bacon a young film director who gets put through the Hollywood wringer.  Studio executives agents and starlets all prey on Nick's naivete and he eventually sells out neglecting his girlfriend and best friend in the process.What's interesting about THE BIG PICTURE is its grassroots portrayal of how Nick finally launches his Hollywood career  by starting small doing his own thing and involving his friends.  Those are basically the tenets of independent film which boomed in the decade following THE BIG PICTURE.Nowadays many of those indie directors  among them Steven Soderbergh Robert Rodriguez and Christopher Nolan  are getting hired to do bigbudget studio pictures.

	onyx:emotionText "THE BIG PICTURE is a breezy satire of the movie business from the mind of writerdirector Christopher Guest BEST IN SHOW A MIGHTY WIND.  It tells the story of Nick Chapman Kevin Bacon a young film director who gets put through the Hollywood wringer.  Studio executives agents and starlets all prey on Nick's naivete and he eventually sells out neglecting his girlfriend and best friend in the process.What's interesting about THE BIG PICTURE is its grassroots portrayal of how Nick finally launches his Hollywood career  by starting small doing his own thing and involving his friends.  Those are basically the tenets of independent film which boomed in the decade following THE BIG PICTURE.Nowadays many of those indie directors  among them Steven Soderbergh Robert Rodriguez and Christopher Nolan  are getting hired to do bigbudget studio pictures.  In fact Soderbergh's sex lies and videotape was released the same year as this movie.Was Nick Chapman's Pez People video responsible for the indie film movement? Not likely but THE BIG PICTURE was certainly an advocate of its principles.";

	schema:reviewBody "Los Angeles is a city where one can find almost at every turn a director a starlet a producer or a cinematographer if one happen to be in the right places. Nick Chapman a young man from Ohio is trying his hand at directing. We meet him as he is going to an award ceremony at an event where the best new short film directors are competing for a prize and a chance to make it in the business. Nick is not prepared for what happens after his film becomes the talk of the town.Nick Chapman is in a relationship with Susan an architect just starting her career. His good friend is Emmet Sumner a cinematographer struggling to make it in the industry. Nick is being courted to sign in with different people so he can go to his next project. He has written a screenplay for a film that he wants to direct. Never in his wildest dreams he never imagined the strange world he is getting into and the weird people he will have to deal with while getting his picture produced! For starters Nick's agent Neil Sussman whom we meet during a luncheon at one of those trendy restaurants is a creature from another planet.The next person Nick gets involved with is Allen Habel a producer that sees potential in Chapman. As Nick pitches the film Allen is already changing the way he feels will attract viewers which has nothing to do with the original concept. Allen wants to set the picture on a beach not in a cabin in the woods while it is snowing as Nick has conceived it. To make matters worse Allen invites the young man to a party at his house that turns out to be a disaster as Nick gets to meet the film capital's fauna and flora and ends up losing Susan.Nick gets dazzled at first but when Allen Habel's business goes bad he is left on his own. Added to all that he doesn't have any money so he has to look for any kind of job in order to survive. All his big shot friends drop him like a hot potato. No one will take his calls. Nick having broke with Susan and having betrayed Emmet finds himself alone in the middle of all that phony world until he meets a rock band and he makes a video of a song that becomes a hit. It is at this point Nick gets his creative powers back and as we leave him he is directing his picture the way he wanted.Christopher Guest a witty genius in his own right directed this movie his first full length film. The Big Picture shows a great talented director that knows well that strange world of glitter and heartaches that is Hollywood. Christopher Guest has been involved in the movie industry for most of his life and it shows.Kevin Bacon is an asset in any picture where he appears. His take on Nick Chapman is dead on. Mr. Bacon is an excellent actor as he shows here. It is unfortunate Martin Short who steals every scene he is in didn't get credit for being in the film. His agent must be a composite on the many characters the director and him must have met at one time or another.Christopher Guest has a group of actors that are featured in his films. Michael McKean and Mr. Guest have a long history of collaboration. The late J.T. Walsh gives one of his best performances as Allen Habel. The rest of the ensemble cast is also notable Teri Hatcher Fran Dresher and a goofy Jennifer Jason Leigh among others.Never having seen this film we were lucky to catch it recently and it was worth the wait.".

The other characters were done well with an outstanding cameo by Martin Short as the aspiring director's agent  the three scenes with Short would make the movie worthwhile by themselves in my opinion. J. T.

Not the most nurturing environment for youthful talent.Bacon's Nick Chapman gets the full treatment as a guy on the fast track after winning his school's big prize for his project. And things don't go wonderfully well after he starts meeting the movers and shakers in his new world. The late great J.T.

Michael McKean is Chapman's friend a cinematographer who isn't necessarily the first choice to shoot his debut. And John Cleese Martin Short and Jennifer Jason Leigh have great turns as Chapman's different associates that can't really stop the grimly funny runaway train he's on until his self respect finally returns and he sees everything for what it really is.Most films about filmmaking are not that good.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a strange movie about a young film student Nick Chambers Kevin Bacon who wins an award and is picked up by a producer Alan Hale. Nick has some good friends and a loving girlfriend and a great idea for a simple movie. He is also very innocent and naive and basically is chewed up by the Hollywood machine and spat out.The movie reveals how the Hollywood dream is not that great and it is only through luck that Nick actually makes it. In the film there is another guy who did not win a trophy but he seemed to have made it big. Nick believes that he has made it as well and quickly leaves his old friends for his new ones. It also seems that Alan is prying Nick away from his friends and setting him up with Hollywood friends such as the actress Gertrude.Suddenly Alan Hale is axed and all of his projects are canceled. Nick finds that he is now untouchable and left in the streets with not money and no friends. He slowly watches how everything is taken away from him and reminded out how big a dream he really had. His former landlord claims that he was a director that was spat out as if making it harbringer of things to come and then reminded when he is applying for a job as a waiter that everybody wants to make it big in Hollywood.It is only fortune and a bit of vision that brings Nick back. He runs into an old school college that introduces him to a band that wants to make a video and he does. At that time he is trying to rebuild his relationships. It is interesting to see how pessimistic Nick is because he is always expecting the worse and getting the best. His exgirlfriend threw him out yet when he came to her again she welcomed him and even visited him again. His old Cameraman friend whom he had let down was still welcoming to him and said I was always your friend. This contrasted the people he had met at Hollywood who were his friends when he was big and dumped him when he had lost it all.This movie is good and has a fantasy feel to it. The cinematography creates a more dreamlike world but it is a dream where the good becomes bad and is only restored through some fortuitous move. What this movie shows me though is who one's friends really are. His true friends remained his friends while his Hollywood friends only spoke to him when they wanted something.".

This contrasted the people he had met at Hollywood who were his friends when he was big and dumped him when he had lost it all.This movie is good and has a fantasy feel to it. The cinematography creates a more dreamlike world but it is a dream where the good becomes bad and is only restored through some fortuitous move. What this movie shows me though is who one's friends really are. His true friends remained his friends while his Hollywood friends only spoke to him when they wanted something.";

It's a testimony too about surrendering to this foundation in return for losing the innocent self its dreams and friends as well. At one dark point the lead becomes as hungry and so cold as his producer. Not Hollywood but all the big foundations can make you like this turning you into a machine with no special dream. Now the message is exceedingly true. It's about holding on to your innocence. So regardless of how many Coffins From Hell you'll going to make just don't lose yourself in one. And don't forget the big picture your big picture because it's more important than anything. It takes a lot of time and troubles to win the ability of making your dreams true but then don't forget what were them in the first place. The secret of this movie's power and immortality is being so simple and accurate. No doubts it's some pieces of its maker's experience and the movie is soft and sweet at delivering them. Let alone being optimistic too since the lead at the end managed to win a big chance his friends back and his self. So according to this movie dreaming and fulfilling can't be an impossible thing. Otherwise look how it was made without a lesbian sex scene! Despite looking small among other flashy and huge Hollywood moneymakers this is really a big picture. Here innocence is that true defended and winner. P.S  I'm writing about this movie after 12 years of watching it for the only time I did yet and without having a paper of previous notices.

The first requested change is to make it a man and two women and the women have an affair changes that make it a totally different story.Of course Guest is his own guy a truly independent filmmaker known for shooting 5X or 10X or more film than is needed and building a movie in the editing room. So this is his parody on the corporate Hollywood machine and how a young filmmaker needs to stick to his principles.I found it mildly interesting it was also fun to see some of today's veteran actors in younger roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before he perfected and honed his satirical style Christopher Guest gave us The Big Picture. It was his first real directorial assignment and it demonstrated that he had plenty of talent and a sharp biting sense of humor. For some reason however the film never saw the light of day upon its initial release and it's only now being reconsidered and reappraised after twenty years in the video store basement. The plot revolves around Nick Chapman Kevin Bacon a recent film school graduate who has won a prestigious award. Hollywood comes calling in the form of major studio producer Allen Habel a great J.T. Walsh who has definite ideas about young Chapman's career path and first feature film subject matter much to the young director's chagrin. All goes well at first and Chapman is soon hyped up as Hollywood's next great film director and it goes to his head fast than you can say cut. Along the way Chapman sells out his best friend Michael McKean and livein lover Emily Longstreth and practically everyone else. He flips over beautiful Gretchen Teri Hatcher in goddess mode but he soon discovers that he's not even in her top ten list. His fall from grace is brutal and fast and his comeuppance is as welldeserved as his subsequent redemption is hardearned. A succession of menial jobs to help pay his rent brings the luckless Mr. Chapman down to earth quickly. The scenes of poor Nick working as a telemarketer on the late shift are priceless.If there's a problem with The Big Picture it's that the film varies wildly between seriousness and light comedy literally from scene to scene and from reality to fantasy kind of like Hollywood itself. It certainly hits its marks when revealing the shallowness of the system and the phonies who inhabit the big offices as they make their nonsensical decisions. Unfortunately there's a lot of insider jokes that many viewers won't understand or merely just shrug off. Martin Short unbilled is the best of the supporting cast as Chapman's effeminate and bumbling agent he couldn't close a deal if it landed in his lap. Other notable actors John Cleese June Lockhart Eddie Albert to name a few make cameo appearances and have fun livening up the atmosphere. One point director Guest does makes crystal clear however. No one in Hollywood has a clue as to what kind of movie will be a hit with the general public. It's always been a guessing game and nothing more. In the end The Big Picture will probably be best remembered as Mr. Guest's first feature film and a prelude for better things to come. For true film buffs it'll also remind them of the talent of Emily Longstreth. Her sudden disappearance from the film industry has been muchdiscussed and remains a total mystery.".

Although the circumstances that lead the main character to change his life for something that he should have done years ago were quite shocking it resonated with me and I am sure so many others. How many of us have not pursued what we were really good at and traded ourselves in to the banal life of the office security of the pension and benefits etc. etc. The list goes on. If you can watch this film twice then do as you will appreciate it even more. The acting is very good. The ending may confuse some and I have not ticked the spoiler box so will not give anything away. After leaving the auditorium you will piece it together though. Overall an excellent film. The main actor was great in Heartbreaker and the same here with THE BIG PICTURE.".

	schema:headline " On the nature of identity";
	schema:reviewBody "Eric Lartigau's film 'The Big Picture' begins as a thriller but ends more as an existential meditation on life the literal translation of its French title 'The Man Who Wanted to Live his Life' is much more apt than its dull replacement. A man ends up living first in the shoes of another man and ultimately as an anonymous nobody he initial decision to give up his identity is a choice albeit in straightened circumstances but its consequences have to be experienced to be understood.

	onyx:emotionText "Eric Lartigau's film 'The Big Picture' begins as a thriller but ends more as an existential meditation on life the literal translation of its French title 'The Man Who Wanted to Live his Life' is much more apt than its dull replacement. A man ends up living first in the shoes of another man and ultimately as an anonymous nobody he initial decision to give up his identity is a choice albeit in straightened circumstances but its consequences have to be experienced to be understood.

	schema:reviewBody "The Big Picture 2010Terrific vibes here and a euphoric basic idea of a man getting out of a troubled situation and going for broke for happiness. Literally and spiritually.First there is the setup a happy charming positive Paul Exben played by the cheerful French actor Romain Duris. He's got an unhappy negative wife and a kid who loves him and an infant who doesn't know what he wants except to cry a lot. He's a photographer in the new manner using high tech computers and high end printers. He loves being who he is and is very successful financially. But the wife is bitter and unyielding. Things are going to go wrong and they do. Exactly how involving another photographer a man who is very old school with a darkroom and enlarger is partly what the movie is about and the surprise is one of its peaks. Then the movie takes some amazing turns.I say amazing but really there is a lot of incredulity built in. Would Paul Exben really go so far? Wasn't there a simpler solution many of them? If the end goal really was to start over in a manner of speaking wouldn't there be ways of doing that and not sabotaging everything else? Maybe not but then we should have been set up better for all the implications.The movie's original title is L'homme Qui Voulait Vivre Sa Vie or The Man Who Wanted to Live His Life. That's sooooo much better and more compelling. And that's what the movie is about. But the English title reminds us that photography and this photographer are central to it all and I'm a photographer. I've been that old school type by necessity for decades and still have an enlarger and a university darkroom at my fingertips. But I have also moved almost completely into new school photography with inkjet printing and such.I have to say this movie made me want to get back in the darkroom. Not that there are scenes that romanticize that. More that there are lots of flaws and mistakes in pointing out the differences. Our man Exben ends up ditching his fancy Canon gear and getting an old Nikon film camera and a couple of lenses. Then he starts to print rediscovering his roots. And then on his darkroom wall are some color printsabsolutely impossible with some trays as shown. And pretty much not possible period these days. Yet his new direction in color is what takes his career new places. I found the photography stuff annoying and enchanting both. If you're not into the field you'll probably just like the enchantment part. Never mind the far too easy gallery luck near the end.But the movie is about what the French title suggestsand here it falters too. Is this a man who is really living his life? In some obvious ways yes. But the existential drama could have and should have? taken this far deeper. By the final scenes where our man is photographing a horrifying event from a distance and then sells some illogically closeup photos of the event to a publisher we get a sense that he is truly dedicated. But also a bit lost. An opportunist. A man who accepts being trapped by circumstance.In a way this is a movie waiting to be remade. It wouldn't take much to make it a classic look at the human condition with some attractive hooks along the way. What we have isn't so bad but it offers more than it delivers.".

He has it all  a comfortable life a wife and two kids he lives in a villa in the province and works in Paris as a successful lawyer on the brink of becoming lead of a lawyer office inherited from a terminally sick woman played by Catherine Deneuve who has only three short scenes but so great to see her still beautiful and in good acting form. At the end he has nothing is a fugitive with no identity. And yet the story is the one of fulfillment as the hero while losing his status and family will find himself a new profession and passion.It's a very well written story and script based on a novel by Douglas Kennedy. It also is a more than satisfying crime story albeit it's about an accidental murder which as some point in time plays with the theme of the first book in the Bounty Identity series with the murderer taking over the identity of the victim and finding refuge in the least policed place in Europe at least according to the script. It so happens that the victim was a photographer and while trying to mimic his way of life the hero develops a passion and discovers a talent in the profession actually a stronger talent than of the one of the true owner of the name. Succeeding means however acquiring fame and this puts under risk his second identity. I will stop here in order to not disclose too much of the rest of the story but I will just say that the mixture of crime story stolen identity and selfdiscovery works quite well in 'L'homme qui voulait vivre sa vie' the English title is 'The Big Picture'.Much of the film rests on the shoulders of Romain Duris and he is doing a fine job. I do not know too much about director Eric Lartigau but he is telling the story and leading his team with a good professional hand. 'L'homme qui voulait vivre sa vie' is a god thriller and a compelling drama about a man who breaks twice the frames of his life finding himself when he seems to have lost everything.".

When i started watching i realized how right i was about the film and how correctly i wasn't expecting much from the film. For about 50 minutes of the film i started counting the films i had seen based on wife cheating her husband getting charged with infidelity and then good husband getting upset and finally taking care of the problem.I shouldn't have watched this film i thought...It was after the first 50 minutes of the film when i was taken aback by the jolting surprise and a bizarre movie experience which remained with me after few days even. THIS FILM MUST BE SEEN.It explores that side of a character that is commonly not paid attention by the filmmakers. The movie takes a sharp turn and gets lost into infinity where everything gets stagnant slow and becomes endless. It can go on and on like this for hours. To me it felt very unusual experience something both poetic and strange beautiful and scary at the same time.Eric Lartigau the writer and the director did a fabulous job in both of his departments. Although a little more character development of the supporting roles in the second half would have been beneficial making the narrative more deep.Romain Duris comes up with a startling performance his character transitions from one mode to another and the actor just goes freely along with it. His deep influential performance is another fact why the movie haunts you after it ends. I was moved to tears by the intensity of his approach towards the character. This one role should transcend his career as an actor to higher level.The movie was adorned with lilting musical score and gorgeous cinematography enhancing the impact of the film on the viewer. By the end i was thankful to myself that i saw the movie truly relying on my instincts i was so glad i came across such a warm movie and I'm sure others who watch will feel the same.".

It not only shows the psychological effects the main character goes through once he flees France but also brings the soundtrack forward. That is one other strong point of the movie as the soundtrack that was composed for it is absolutely splendid the music actually does wonders about sticking us in front of the film until the very end as it is a perfect match for what's happening before our very eyes. It can also be said that the way the actors play their characters is convincing to say the less. Romain Duris even without talking much actually says a lot just by the way he plays his character. The movie nearly missed a perfect note because of two elements. First it starts too fast we barely know the characters what they do and what are the relationships between them when Kremer gets killed. A more developed introduction could have helped. The second thing is the way the movie ends. The film still feels incomplete by the end and while that lets room for your imagination to fill it would have been nice if they ended the movie in a more decisive way than by just letting Exben go walking the streets of yet another country. Nonetheless The Big Picture or if we use its most appropriate title translated from French  The Men That Wanted To Live His Life  is definitely a film any thriller andor drama fan will want and have to see someday.".

He becomes a sought after talented photographerunlike the bad one his wife took off with.There are a lot of subtle things..He begins to look at his kid and he resembles his infidel unhappy wife's lover.No this movie is fantastic on so many levels. The photography of the Croatian coast all of it.Happily he is not caught by the police but it ends as he starts a new life of some sort in Italy.I like movies that switch gears suddenly rather than some plodding predictable formula. This movie moves fast has memorable believable characters the 62 boozy French journalist and Ivana are great characters all around good. Boy this director knows how to type cast!

	schema:reviewBody "When a movie reunites the greatest and most iconic French actor Jean Gabin and the funniest and most popular of the day Louis de Funs you expect fireworks of laughs resulting from the interactions between these two messieurs but in the case of The Tattoo it's almost on the level of an armadillo's fart. There are a few funny moments popping up here and there the film had a great visual look and a jazzy score but its drought of gags makes it one of the least rewatchable De Funs movies again there are some good scenes but hey you can find them on Youtube and life is too precious to endure this even for the sake of nostalgia.That a film joining two monuments of cinema get so embarrassingly bad has at least one merit it shows that a good premise doesn't make a good movie success is never written in advance and neither was the script actually which I was surprised to learn was canceled because neither Gabin and De Funs liked it so it was written on the job with the shooting. Actually it's almost a miracle that the film could be made by the standards of its nonexisting script it is decent. It is even decent by the numbers the film attracted more than three millions of viewers which is not the best score from Gabin or De Funs but it was still enough to belong to the Top 10 of 1968 it's like the top billing was already a guarantee of success.So it's a case of emptyfull glass induced by a few guilty pleasures. As a matter of fact the film gets slightly better near the end as you can feel the chemistry growing between the two characters and you enjoy the interactions rather than their importance to the plot the restaurant scene doesn't add much but it happens to be the most memorable part along with the ice skating but just when you end the film with the illusion that there was something between Gabin and De Funs you learn that both didn't get along. Whatever it was it might explain why this was their last collaboration and why in the crucial scene where Gabin's character said he started to like De Funs' I couldn't buy it.Gabin wasn't without a comical nature of his own and by overplaying the angry patriarch he could even be a match for De Funs but the actor who was known for his tantrums was actually the cooler one and it was difficult to see De Funs playing the supporting role and it says a lot when his best scenes are without Gabin one involving the two foreign businessmen and that inspired the IMDb picture of the actor and a few interesting moments with his wife who's not Claude Gensac anyway. The rest of the time De Funs is begging Gabin to give him the tattoo and Gabin spends his time shouting and yelling and screaming you could tell the pains the screenwriters had to fill the moments. There is a reason why this is not the first title to come to mind when you think of De Funes and Gabin's movies.I'm just into a Gabin's phase and the more I appreciate the actor the more I see how he and De Funs couldn't match and I appreciate De Funs too. They just have too largerthanlife personalities to share the screen in a complementary way a lite version De Funs doesn't work not when it's mixed with a redbull version of Gabin. Other scenes are really awkward and according to director Denys de La Pattelire it's only during the editing that they realized they weren't as good some bizarre moments involving the African butler made me cringe because they were offensive without being funny and even what could have been a funny little suspenseful moment was ruined by a ripoff of the Pink Panther theme that was so outrageous I hope it was meant as a homage.There's no other thing to say this is a film to watch on the basis that there are two great actors for pure historical value but that's all both actors made better films so don't waste your time with this one the best scenes are on Youtube and if the director the writer and the two main concerned ones didn't enjoy it why should you?".

	schema:headline " One of the most idiotic comedies...";
	schema:reviewBody "...But come on it has Mr Funes in it. And as far as this comedian is engaged it can't get wrong. I can't recall any movie with Mr Louis de Funes which was not enjoyable. At least to my taste.What is the place of this comedian in cinema? I am sure that he occupies a skyrocketing place near Mr Charles Chaplin Mr Buster Keaton Mr Norman Wisdom and Mr Benny Hill. He is the master of slapstick intelligent humour with a shade of theatrical quality.Where am I? Oh yes the film. It is a feast of stupidity. There are a few childish scenes involving kickboxing and judo. Mr Funes character is running about as he usually does for idiotic purposes. Some Englishspeaking guys are hunting a myth i.e. a tattoo on human skin and ready to pay huge amounts of dollars for that. The movie ends abruptly and incoherently.

At least to my taste.What is the place of this comedian in cinema? I am sure that he occupies a skyrocketing place near Mr Charles Chaplin Mr Buster Keaton Mr Norman Wisdom and Mr Benny Hill. He is the master of slapstick intelligent humour with a shade of theatrical quality.Where am I? Oh yes the film. It is a feast of stupidity. There are a few childish scenes involving kickboxing and judo. Mr Funes character is running about as he usually does for idiotic purposes. Some Englishspeaking guys are hunting a myth i.e. a tattoo on human skin and ready to pay huge amounts of dollars for that. The movie ends abruptly and incoherently.

Maybe it's because the contrast is so huge that here Fufu really shines with his fallacious deals and really human defects.

The story then moves backwards in objective and dispassionate detail that first brings them and others together before the climax returns you with a group of facts to assess your own feelings about each character as the film plays itself out. Accident is one cold and remote study of human behavior even for English academia. Director Joseph Losey and writer Harold Pinter erase any hints of compassion and understanding while ironically rendering men of vast knowledge non communicative to intimates as they try to come to terms with their own repressed desires. Bogarde is tailor maid to play Stephen. Defrosting little from his character in The Servant created by the same team he remains in a perpetual dark night of the soul even during moments of bliss. Fellow prof Charley  Stanley Baker is more nuanced and well played against type by Baker even more deluded in his mid life crisis. The two have some excellent scenes together as Pinter's script and Losey's long takes build suspense fully but sometimes misleadingly. Vivien Merchant provides her usual laid back style of deceptive power while Michael York exudes youth and life with Jaquelline Sassard beautiful and comatose. There's also an excellent cameo by Harold Knox as a senior provost foreshadowing Stephen's future who has to be reminded of his daughter's name. It's an almost soul less existence with all emotion cut off. Accident reflects its title perfectly and in doing so makes it impossible for you not to look away.

Perhaps there was an subtle undercurrent which I missed. Filmmakers were not quite so obvious in 1966.

	schema:reviewBody "I can't agree with one reviewer here who states that Accident is the best of the LoseyPinter collaborations. I much prefer The Servant. Accident is about just that  the film begins with a dreadful car crash and Stephen Dirk Bogarde an Oxford don coming to the site and rescuing the young woman Anna Jacqueline Sussard and taking her back to his house. The other occupant is dead.The story unfolds from there going back to what led up to this event. Stephen is going through a midlife crisis. He has two children a pregnant wife and not quite the success of his friend Charley Stanley Baker who has a television show. Stephen finds himself attracted to one of the students he tutors Anna but can't quite muster up the courage to approach her. Another student William Michael York is a friend of hers Stephen can't quite figure out the relationship even after a night of boozing it up a la Virginia Woolf. Then he finds out something very interesting.This has to be one of the slowestmoving films on record filled with those famous Pinter pauses and emotions underneath the surface. And here they're really underneath. Buried. John Coldstream quotes Michael York in Dirk Bogarde about being told you can't underact that film is so subtle a medium the less you do the better it is. Well in Accident that's been taken to a new art form. York was impressed that while doing the scenes it didn't come off like they were doing anything until you saw it on film. I don't know what film he saw.The other problem with this film and maybe it was just me going into an advanced stage of blindness which I wasn't aware of is that the night shots were black. I really couldn't see what was going on.That all being said the basic story is certainly a compelling one of people leading normal outwardly successful lives with turgid emotions and unhappiness churning underneath. The scenes after the accident between Sussard and Bogarde are very striking and disturbing as is the final moment of the film. We are reminded that what's on the surface has nothing to do with what really is in the heart.Accident was a terrible emotional drain on Dirk Bogarde unfortunately because of the direction we don't get to see why. He was a remarkable actor but like any actor he's a victim of the director's pacing and concept not to mention the script he's handed. This could have been much better right up there with the searing drama of The Servant. Alas it isn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not a lot happens but we were glued to The Accident.  The script is wonderfully understated.  Pinter as screenplay writer is a different style from Pinter the playwright.  Pinter teases us though with a small cameo performance of his own using almost mockPinter dialogue for that one short scene.  Also of note scriptwise is the scene soon after Pinter's scene when Dirk Bogarde visits his old flame in London and the dialogue is almost thoughts almost dialogue  you don't see either of them actually speaking.The cinematography on this movie is superb.  Oxford in the summer is a soft target for beautiful shots but this film fills its boots with that beauty. Yet the dark mood never leaves you despite the beauty  partly because 90 of the movie is a flashback so you have already seen most of the tragedy unfold.  Also the behaviour of the two professors is just so awful.  Dirk Bogarde comes across somewhat sympathetically because he is Dirk Bogarde but the character is a more or less unmitigated toad.  The Stanley Baker character is also horrible.  The acting of all the main characters is superb.This is high class stuff  seek it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the very first shot Losey lets us know that to get the most from this film it's not what you see but what you perceive that matters. The opening shot of a country house is held steady for our eyes whilst the sound of an approaching speeding car and inevitably the grinding of metal on gravel as the accident happens dominates our hearing. And so it is for the rest of the film. What is important is not necessarily what we see but what we discern. The complexities of the relationships between the main characters the effect on all of them brought by the simple presence of Anna Sassard their infidelities and insecurities all contribute to make this a spellbinding 100 minutes or so of classic cinema. The spare Pinteresque dialogue inspires the viewer to attempt to untangle the dynamics between the characters. Some poignant photography for instance the symmetry of Anna and Stephen Bogarde as they gaze out over picturesque English countryside whilst leaning on a gate but at the same time teasing us as to whether or not they will draw closer adds to our desire for a better understanding of these people and their relationships.The photography of rooms shot from odd angles indeed some of these shots seem designed to accentuate the angles of the characters every bit as much as the rooms themselves all contribute to a complex web of relationships. Some sexy sixties sax from John Dankworth adds an appropriate musical blend to the whole. And how many times does Stephen say to others What are you doing?' as he strives to come to terms with his own infidelities and insecurities let alone those of all those around him?It's an intense but approachable movie with little concession to humour save perhaps for a couple of comments from Stanley Baker's picaresque character Charley. But don't let that put you off this is intelligent challenging cinema a welcome refuge from the shoot em up stream of movies we've become used to over the years.".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Accident was a somewhat ripe little novel by Nicholas Mosley about the sex lives of dons of the Oxbridge type rather than the Juan or Giovanni kind. It was a good book but hardly memorable. The film that Joseph Losey made of it however was a different kettle of rancid fish altogether. Harold Pinter wrote the script and it's a brilliant piece of work as acerbic as nasty and by God as intelligent as any of his celebrated theatre work and Losey's direction is pitchperfect. Perhaps no writer and director were ever quite as in simpatico as Pinter and Losey. The film is told in flashback. It opens stunningly with the accident of the title that introduces us to three of the central characters the driver of the car the young woman with him and the don who finds them. The driver is a young Michael York the girl is Jacqueline Sassard and the don is Dirk Bogarde magnificent here in a performance as fine as his work in The Servant or Death in Venice. The film then jumps back in time as we meet the other characters caught up in the sexual shenanigans Stanley Baker as another don raffish and full of bluster where Bogarde is introverted and ineffectual and Vivien Merchant as Bogarde's pregnant wife. They too are superb but then everyone no matter how small their part is superb everyone is there for a reason. Primarily this is a film about sexual tension and unfulfilled desires about petty jealousies and how all this sublimated sexual longing can lead to disaster. It is a film made up of long virtuoso passages a drunken Sunday lunch that turns into a drunken evening of recrimination and which brings all the main characters together Bogarde's visit to an old flame Delphine Seyrig a cricket match and of course the crash itself and it's aftermath which is naturally sexual. This is great filmmaking quite rare in British cinema. Paradoxically the film is among the most English and at the same time among the least English of pictures. Superbly photographed too by Gerry Fisher and with another great Johnny Dankworth score this is a masterpiece.".

In place of his trademark directorial stylistics a more formal but equally assured approach to filmmaking  signaled perhaps by being his last outing with frequent collaborators Dirk Bogarde with whom he made 5 films Stanley Baker 4 Alexander Knox 4 and composer Johnny Dankworth 4  is in evidence here. The only concessions to 'style' are some temporal flourishes a' la Resnais and a superbly enigmatic interlude with Bogarde where the dialogue between him and former lover Delphine Seyrig is heard as voiceover while the characters are seen interacting in different surroundings! Still the film's flashback structure is perhaps famed playwright Harold Pinter's doing who contributes a fine nuanced script.The characters say very little to one another indeed the film as a whole may be too lowkey for most viewers but the real emotions lust contempt pity hypocrisy they feel for each other come to the fore regardless through fleeting glances hesitant remarks etc. Bogarde even gets into a stammering fit in especially stressful moments and only gets to concede to his repressed desires i.e make love to his pupil Jacqueline Sassard when she is at her most vulnerable  immediately after her boyfriend's tragic death even though his own wife is pregnant with their third child! The film features an excellent ensemble cast led by a vulnerable Bogarde and a particularly despicable Baker. This was also Michael York's first major role in fact he flew to Cannes specifically to talk with Losey  who was presenting MODESTY BLAISE 1966 see review above  about getting the part! On the contrary Sassard would go on to make just one more film  Claude Chabrol's masterly LES BICHES 1968 where again she was the 'prize' in a mnagea'trois that also comprised JeanLouis Trintignant and lesbian Stephane Audran!  before disappearing from cinema screens altogether!! Freddie Jones Pinter himself and Nicholas Mosley the author of the source novel appear in small roles while Gerry Fisher's beautiful cinematography and Dankworth's jazzy score effectively complement the film's pervasive brooding mood.ACCIDENT was nominated for 4 BAFTAs and won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival but again Losey was criminally neglected at the Oscars.".

So does Slime3 Tense measured actors piece which now shows it age Slime3 from Gloucester England 13 November 2012.The Accident 1967 Joseph Losey a sexual foursome is challenging but rewarding. It is written by Nicholas Mosley adapted by Harold Pinter and directed by Joseph Losey. This third LoseyPinter collaboration has a smoldering intensity even though there are many scenes concerning the everyday details of a comfortable University of Oxford society. Accident is intensely visual and austere. Casual filmgoers are not its intended audience. Still it has great emotional depth and is memorable.It starts with a fatal car crash in the UK countryside. Stephen Dick Bogarde an Oxford professor of philosophy rescues Anna Jacqueline Sassard an attractive young student from the wrecked car. Stephen leaves behind the corpse of William Michael York whose frozen face becomes a recurring image. Flashbacks take us back to when Anna and William first become Stephen's pupils. Stephen is a repressed husband going through a middlelife crisis with a variety of frustrated ambitions. He has two kids a wife Rosalind Vivien Merchant who is pregnant with a third and the growing family resides in an elegant rural home. Too bad philosophy professors are not as well compensated today. As Stephen first meets and begins to tutor Anna he is attracted to her but restrains from making a move. The chief instigator of most of the mischief that follows is another Oxford professor and TV personality Charley Stanley Baker. Stephen and Charlie have an adversarial friendship which resembles a war they are typically hostile to each other and openly competitive. Young William an aristocrat is athletic and vital. He never learns the Awful Truth about his new circle of friends. The Accident seems to be portraying several pairs of dopplegangers with the struggle between Stephen and Charley the featured one. Stephen is intensely jealous of Charlie but is stymied from catching up. Stephen mimics his rival by having his own extramarital affair as well as attempting to appear on television. Rosalind and Anna are also two of a kind they both facilitate Stephen's infidelity. Rosalind's lack of concern to her husband over whether he is cheating seems dreamlike. William who is often in motion has no human counterpart but sort of reminds us of the family dog who we see fetch a ball once or twice. Stephen's two children have matching speech etc.Watching Stephen vs. Charley is mesmerizing. Dick Bogarde is an amazing actor. He reminds me of a less physical more everymanversion of Marlon Brando. Brando merged with Al Pacino? There is often a primal quality with Bogarde's delivery that is stunning. Stanley Baker who possessed a muchreviewed face i.e. the consensus seems to be that he is as frightening as he is handsome is another teapot that is always about to boil over. As with The Servant 1963 LoseyPinter there is a role reversal coming between two evenly matched perpetually competing males.The cinematography employs muted colors contributing to a sense of gloom. Losey has a visual leitmotiv. He often frames points of interest between verticals and horizontals which reduce the effective frame size. When he does this we immediately recall William's deceased face which is also restricted in the frame by the car wreckage. At the very minimum Losey is doing this to remind us what is coming. By the way I really love the sequence where Stephen has an affair with Francesca. The lovers are filmed silently with their conversation overdubbed. It creates a uniquely dreamlike experience.This Losey and Pinter collaboration takes patience but will be enjoyed by cinemaphiles. However please don't drive over to The revival theater showing this after having guzzled whiskey like a 1960sera Oxford philosophy professor.".

Stephen is intensely jealous of Charlie but is stymied from catching up. Stephen mimics his rival by having his own extramarital affair as well as attempting to appear on television. Rosalind and Anna are also two of a kind they both facilitate Stephen's infidelity. Rosalind's lack of concern to her husband over whether he is cheating seems dreamlike. William who is often in motion has no human counterpart but sort of reminds us of the family dog who we see fetch a ball once or twice. Stephen's two children have matching speech etc.Watching Stephen vs. Charley is mesmerizing. Dick Bogarde is an amazing actor. He reminds me of a less physical more everymanversion of Marlon Brando. Brando merged with Al Pacino? There is often a primal quality with Bogarde's delivery that is stunning. Stanley Baker who possessed a muchreviewed face i.e. the consensus seems to be that he is as frightening as he is handsome is another teapot that is always about to boil over. As with The Servant 1963 LoseyPinter there is a role reversal coming between two evenly matched perpetually competing males.The cinematography employs muted colors contributing to a sense of gloom. Losey has a visual leitmotiv. He often frames points of interest between verticals and horizontals which reduce the effective frame size. When he does this we immediately recall William's deceased face which is also restricted in the frame by the car wreckage. At the very minimum Losey is doing this to remind us what is coming. By the way I really love the sequence where Stephen has an affair with Francesca. The lovers are filmed silently with their conversation overdubbed. It creates a uniquely dreamlike experience.This Losey and Pinter collaboration takes patience but will be enjoyed by cinemaphiles. However please don't drive over to The revival theater showing this after having guzzled whiskey like a 1960sera Oxford philosophy professor.";

Dirk Bogarde is in top form as the professor whose midlife crisis antics have tragic effects on those around him. The film has enough drama to keep your attention. The ensemble acting and editing create a sense of tension and impending doom in the banal country setting and bright weather. Ultimately though the film fails to tell a fully rounded story. At the end the fatal 'accident' loses it's impact rather than gaining any extra meaning. This is also a film with a very male perspective. The main female characters are very much stereotypes the wife is a quiet long suffering housewife the professor's young and beautiful student an impenetrable femme fatale. Both characters act very much as symbols of the professor's inner struggles without very much character development.

	schema:reviewBody "If you like Harold Pinter then you will find this film appealing. His influence in the screenplay and dialogue is strongly evident with typically long pauses and an emphasis on suggestion. When you team these up with Losey's gritty unconventional direction you end up with an interesting yarn about an insecure University Professor who gets himself into a complicated web of adulterous affairs which indirectly lead to tragedy. Bogarde as the professor essentially plays a womanising chauvinistic toad. However because he plays the character with the unforgettable Bogarde charm you can't help but feel sorry for him and almost forget that he has had an affair with a  student rekindled a romance with an old flame and appears unconcerned that his pregnant wife has prematurely given birth.The film is wonderfully picturesque being almost entirely set in Oxford during the height of a hot summer. Losey captures both the oppressiveness of the heat and the uncomfortable situation brilliantly especially during the scene of the drunken Sunday lunch that Bogarde's character hosts some way into the film. There are some very good supporting roles in the form of Stanley Baker and Michael York and even a cameo appearance by Pinter himself. It's a film that you have to think about and make your own mind up about the characters and their importance to the plot.".

Nearly the entire film is shown in flashback after a car accident leaves Oxford professor Bogarde's studentfriend dead.The film is based on a quadrangle of lovelust by two professors and one student for the same Austrian student. As we gradually learn its not so hard to get her into bed  but she comes out as the only relatively sympathetic character. Neither of the professors comes out looking good  Stanley Baker being especially sleazy. Neither does Michael York as a student elicit any sympathy because of his cocky manner.Bogarde is perhaps the only reason for continued interest in Accident. He gives another good understated performance. He continues to show the kind of reserved character we see in The Servant with something more sinister brewing under the surface.".

But there is no embellishment that makes it into a good story simply coincidence and misfortune most of which happens because of the actions of the characters  who contrary to what the movie states are largely responsible. I mean the kid throws a bowling ball down the street in the middle of the night and has the balls to say It wasn't anyone's fault when a car gets run off the road. Misguided adolescence maybe. Good filmmaking and relatable themes? Not a chance.I will concede that the climax of the film where Davis finally visits her son is very well done and probably renders any audience speechless.

	schema:reviewBody "Accidents Happen  Sydney Film Festival June 2009 I was sold on this film by a description of Geena Davis who shines as the screwball mother. The SFF program seemed to promise a screwball family comedy with Davis' fearlessness in performance carrying the required bravado. So I was surprised when the opening sequence a slowmotion shot of a playing child interrupted by an elderly neighbour accidentally barbecuing himself suggested another tone was in the offing a comingofage black comedy. That combination works well here.To labour the labeling a little ladling on a portmanteau ACCIDENTS HAPPEN is a 'dramedy'. It's a realistic story of an early 80s suburban family unit fractured by an auto accident. The emotional weight of their tragedy squeezes absurdity out of the cracks in their stasis. Gloria Conway Davis turns her rapidfire wit to lashing her 'useless' exhusband but that is clearly a losing game for her as she is not much more on top of her grief for their lost children than he is.The relationship between surviving but bereft younger son Billy and his ballsy mother is the meat of the film. They present a remarkably compelling take on an interdependent relationship. They made me really care that they would work it out and a refreshing change from the common film stereotype of merely alienated teens.The film overall is a showcase of great characterization through screen writing and performances not just from the poised teenaged leads but also minor characters like the barbecueinduced widow Mrs Smolensky. She steps startlingly out of being a background character in the payoff scene at the film's end.That final sequence also left me backpedaling on conclusions I leapt to earlier about the film's symbolism. Up until that point the crucial role of a bowling ball in the plot lent itself to symbolism of emotional baggage a crushing burden to carry and destructively out of control when neglected. That ball's ultimate destination revealed over the endcredits indicates the authors either didn't have that in mind or were pointing us to some other significance entirely. Comments here suggesting what that significance might be are very welcome.Originally posted at httpmoviebookchats.posterous.commoviereviewaccidentshappen".

They made me really care that they would work it out and a refreshing change from the common film stereotype of merely alienated teens.The film overall is a showcase of great characterization through screen writing and performances not just from the poised teenaged leads but also minor characters like the barbecueinduced widow Mrs Smolensky. She steps startlingly out of being a background character in the payoff scene at the film's end.That final sequence also left me backpedaling on conclusions I leapt to earlier about the film's symbolism. Up until that point the crucial role of a bowling ball in the plot lent itself to symbolism of emotional baggage a crushing burden to carry and destructively out of control when neglected. That ball's ultimate destination revealed over the endcredits indicates the authors either didn't have that in mind or were pointing us to some other significance entirely. Comments here suggesting what that significance might be are very welcome.Originally posted at httpmoviebookchats.posterous.commoviereviewaccidentshappen";

At the other end of the age scale the young Gilbertson also seen in the recent Beneath Hill 60 is one to watch out for in the future.

Mrs Conway lies to the police forces one of her sons to lie and compels the complicity of her other son his friend and his family. So Mrs Post mouths Thank you to Mrs Conway during the bingo game. Why exactly? Her son didn't steal the bowling ball or fire it off down the road to cause her husband to swerve and die so he's not going to jail. All that Mrs Conway's lie has done is rob her of her husband's insurance money. And she's saying Thank You? But the grossest scene of irresponsibility and outrageous stupidity is yet to come. Billy decides with the encouragement of his frail neighbour who has hidden the bowling ball although she looks as though she could barely lift it to once more send it on its way down a public thoroughfare. So off it goes winding its way till it ends up in a culvert from where it comes crashing like a cannonball out onto a public road to cause whatever unpredictable mayhem. Perhaps this time it could have smashed into a car containing a family returning from a day at the beach and killed them all. Crikey that would have been hilarious. Instead it crashes into the police car which is presumably meant to be funny. What are Billy and his mother going to do when the police come calling? Lie again? Hopefully the cops will dust it for finger prints and put Billy and the rest of his family in jail where they all belong. Now THAT would be funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Monumental' was the word that flashed through my mind during the emotional climax. The film itself or the emotional place it had taken me to I don't know but that was the word. Mostly I laughed my way through the film but when I stopped laughing I cried great buckets. I also had to keep relaxing the tension in my face and body as I found it a very stressful journey. Right from the beginning we learn that there will be no easy outs anything and everything can happen. Like all good films this one let me leave my inner critic at the door and completely surrender to the unfolding twisting tale of searing black comedy and bitter soulful tragedy.Geena Davis has always been brilliant but has she ever had such a brilliantly written role? Has any female actor? What starts as a dragon that breathes caustic wit unravels to reveal a woman that despite all odds continues to be the foundation mortar and soulful centre for everyone. I found her character so utterly real and so refreshing for a female lead. She had balls vulnerability sex appeal intelligence and of course great wit.It must be hard for any nationality to see themselves played by others. One character is one thing but a whole neighbourhood and era could seem presumptuous. I couldn't comment on US reaction accents or historical correctness however I did find it interesting to apply Australian storytelling to a universal tale and then set it in North America. What you get is an almost unbearably tragic but ultimately stoic tale told through an unrelenting disposable wit and a brevity of emotion which never once falls into sentimentality or over indulgence.It is sumptuous to watch in its cinematography and art direction and the young cast is deftly directed to deal with some of life's cruelest blows. What matters most is the story and there is so much meat to chew on in terms of character plot and themes. It moves so swiftly from one cataclysmic event to the next proving not only that in life the only constant is change but also that it is bloody hard to keep up with that change that life is uncontrollable and we are at its mercy to make sense of its absurdity. This film has a great future for a hip audience. From a viewer's entertainment perspective this film is monumental.".

	schema:reviewBody "Accidents Happen is a chronicle of the dysfunctional Conway family. I managed to catch it at the Tribeca Film Festival. It begins as a flashback to 1974 7 year old Billy Conway is watering the front lawn when their unsavory nextdoorneighbor Mr. Smolensky we're told that he was a nogood philanderer by a narrator accidentally sets himself afire and dies while barbecuing. The scene is done in super slowmotion and is photographed impressively. Nonetheless the director makes the mistake of relying on a narrator to explain the back story for the first ten minutes of the film the narrator is quite annoying.The second accident is also described through the narrator. The Conways are driving home after attending a drivein movie when they're all involved in a car accident. The daughter is killed and another son Gene is left a vegetable in an irreversible coma.We then flash forward to 1982 where we're introduced to the present day Conway family. Billy doesn't get along with his brother Larry who has a drinking problem. Their mother Gloria played by Geena Davis constantly relies on foulmouthed epithets to berate her children and is on the verge of divorce from Ray the emotionally distant father.Billy ends up befriending Doug Post a teenager who lives next door. Together they shoplift items from a convenience store while wearing nothing more than ski masks. When Billy rolls a bowling ball down the street Doug's father swerves his car to avoid it and ends up dying in the ensuing car wreck. The police conclude that the father committed suicide because there were no skid marks. Billy and Doug finally confess that they were responsible for the accident but Gloria convinces the police that the teenagers had made up the story in order for the Post family to collect the insurance money.The film ends with the death of comatose brother Gene. His death leads to a catharsis for the two living brothers and both parents embrace them at the end signaling a new beginning for the family.The film's scenarist can't decide whether we should laugh or cry for the victims of all the accidents that happen in first half of the film. Are we watching a black comedy as the narrator cheerfully chronicles the demise of the hapless Smolensky? And what about the unfunny scene where the Post family friend pays an overly emotional overthetop condolence call to the family following Mr. Post's death in the car accident? While Gloria still pines away for her dead daughter and bemoans the fate of her comatose son she's more the stuff of black comedy with her foul language and odd behavior. The same goes for Ray's ditsy fianc who is depicted as completely lamebrained.I had even more trouble with the second half of Accidents Happen. Now we're asked to have sympathy for all these quirky characters who we've grown to dislike in the first half. We now understand why the teenagers were acting outthey were unable to connect with their emotions due to earlier traumas where either family members were killed or severely injured. Everything is forgiven when Billy and Larry are able to 'emote' after Gene's death. If only adolescent angst was so easily resolved in real life! In the end 'Accidents Happen' wants to have it both ways. As a black comedy it seeks to laugh at the dysfunctional characters who inhabit a dysfunctional universe. But then the film's scenarists reverse themselvesthe loonies are not loonies after all in fact they're all a bunch of sensitive souls! If you believe in such transformations then perhaps I can also convince you to buy a share of the Brooklyn Bridge.".

I could see in her eyes how talented he was and standing in front of Geena Davis in such complex yet humorous story was wonderful. I surely can bet he will be a huge once he grows up a little more. Overall a great movie with great ensemble cast. Everyone did a great job making this movie memorable for me. Watch it!";

Sure accidents happen... but not like this.The acting is fairly good with Gina Davis playing a dysfunctional mom who has a talent for creative word nastiness. Too bad the other members lacked her verbal flagrancy if they talked at all. And some of the more interesting characters the overly sorry girl at the wake... the addicted aunt are left woefully unexplored.A few times I also thought it was going to turn towards a teen comingofage storyline but those moments quickly passed in what must've been an attempt to show us that teenage Billy is going through normal stuff for his age?

All I can think of is the fact that the movie is Australian might have held it back. There was nothing else that could have done so.

	schema:reviewBody "Yes there is some irony in the tragedies that the Conway family undergoes and I can understand Geena Davis's dark character of Gloria Conway amusement at finding out that her onetime date Bob's wife was electrocuted while using the dishwasher. It's tragedy upon tragedy that makes this odd demise of a character we never meet a bit humorous in an offbeat sort of way. But this is a family that is really hard to watch at times because they just don't seem all that real to me. Gloria isn't the most likable mom out there even Kathleen Turner's Beverly in Serial Mom was surpringly likable even knowing that she was a psychopathic killer and the breakup of her marriage to husband Ray Joel Tobeck isn't explored enough to be believable. I actually understood the kids more than the parents identified with their childish pranks the scene at the drivein theatre was quite amusing and really felt bad for the poor son Gene who ends up in a nursing home after a car accident that killed his sister Linda. As for son Billy outstandingly portrayed by Harrison Gilbertson I felt his pain as well feeling that he knew that everybody wished it was him not his twin Gene who ended up basically a vegetable. Even the drunken brother Larry I could identify with knowing how deep the pain of loss and not understanding why everything so bad keeps happening. This is a family that needed major therapy and unfortunately the poor kids minus Gene and their late sister Linda had to deal with parents that were too selfish to see how their behaviors were destroying the entire family.This was a courageous role for Geena Davis to take on much more challenging dramatically than even her role in Thelma and Louise and she is excellent. The problem is that from the beginning when we see the Conway's neighbor killed in a fire caused by an exploding BBQ there is such a negativity surrounding this family and the mother is at the forefront of it. Their interaction with the Post family their other nextdoor neighbors is deeply explored and when tragedy strikes that family thanks to an intended harmless prank the two are drawn together. I would have liked to have seen more development of the relationship between the two mothers as they struggled to deal with their grief anger and subsequent forgiveness. A powerful moment comes when Mrs. Post Sarah Woods in a very good understated performance whispers thank you to Gloria after the truth comes out about her husband's death.I found this hard to give a high rating to but since I obviously found myself drawn in emotionally and was extremely touched by the ending concerning the widow of the elderly man killed at the beginning I ranked this higher than I originally intended. I can only suggest watching this movie with an open mind and open heart because it really is difficult to embrace this family unless you try and understand each character for their own individual pains which are many.".

Where we supposed to egg him on when he was more interested in looking for a bowling ball that incriminated him than worrying that his friend's father was dead? Were we supposed to cheer when he got out of it and his friend's family had to live without the life insurance and their father was labeled as someone who killed himself? Were we supposed to celebrate when he was smoking dope with a girl and laugh when he robbed a store naked?

	schema:reviewBody "It is so good to finally see Geena Davis back on the big screen! Davis has always been one of my favorite actresses showing a quick wit and a calm demeanor that has led to some tremendous films. In the new directtovideo dramedy Accidents Happen she proves that she may have been on vacation for a while but she hasn't lost a thing. In this film Davis plays the mother of sixteen year old Billy Conway Harrison Gilbertson who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film starts with a childhood accident that destroys his family and really defines just who Billy is. After a chilling but hilarious opening the film jumps to a sixteen year old Billy and what's left of his family. His mother is crazy his brother's a drunk and his father just isn't around anymore so it's up to Billy to deal with the trials and tribulations of a boy who is growing into a man. Davis is listed as the star and she has some amazingly funny lines but the story is really centered around newcomer Harrison Gilbertson who gives one the best performances by a teen actor that I've seen all year. Gilbertson very clearly shows us how Billy is seeming unaffected by what happens to him he's strong and seemingly ready to deal with anything but on the inside Billy is much different than he appears. The character was a deep one with many levels and Gilbertson takes us through them all with ease. I loved this film because while it's dark and depressing at times they also joke about these things that you're not supposed to joke about. Just when things seemingly become to much that humor creeps back in and makes you love how wickedly fun this film is. If you want to see something different that will have you going back and fourth between laughter and tears then this is the film for you. I went into this film expecting nothing just looking forward to seeing Geena Davis again and what I got instead was one of the best movies I've seen all year.".

In one superb scene she almost saves the movie all by herself. She's really the only thing to watch this movie for.";

First I feel I should mention that I have never read any of the Astrid Lindgren Pippi Longstocking books so I have no idea how closely this film adaptation follows the original text. However I can say that the story as told by this movie unfolds in a truly clumsy fashion. There is a plot but the way it unfolds is in a real meandering way almost as if it were being made up as it was going along. As for the other parts of the movie well they are clumsy and shoddy as well with frequently poor production values and misguided direction. The awkward English dubbing certainly doesn't help. Sounds like a bad movie lover's dream right? Well although the clumsy and shoddy nature of the movie does sometimes provoke some giggles it isn't aggressive enough to be so bad it's funny. Adults will just find it awkward and incompetent. As for kids YOUNG kids they may not mind the poor quality of the entire enterprise but I suspect they won't be clamouring their parents to watch it a second time.".

The description is not too difficult Extremely cruel and sadistic italowestern with cynicism brought on film length. George Hilton in one of his best performances. His role sways between a drunken ruffian an aggressive revolver hero and a complete bastard. He plays Kitosch a quite unusual name for a gunman a cattle guardian at Don Jaimes Eduardo Fajardo ranch. When Kitosch is discovered with Don Jaimes wife Pamela Tudor he gets brand like an animal. But he succeeds in escaping. With the arrival in the next small town he tries to ask the sheriff for protection because Don Jaime has put his men on Kitosch. However instead of getting help he is arrested and locked up to be delivered to Don Jaimes men. At this moment the hangdog Joshua Tracy Frank Wolff who is searched with the warrant of apprehension appears. He kills the sheriff and his assistant and releases Kitosch. Together they are an unbeatable team. What do 2 criminals do? Clear they commit crime. However soon it turns out that Tracy isn't that cool like he appeared at the beginning. One could say he is the perfect example of the devil. His preoccupation is to take revenge at his exwife and her new lover Big John. After Tracy has burned his former girlfriend he is keen on killing Big John. Kitosch tries to repair the ill aggressive impulses of his friend however only with little success. Finally they want to visit Don Jaime and settle accounts with him however among them it comes more and more to differences...  The time of vultures  is a film with very good theatrical achievements of the principal characters and acts from the problems of human beings and morally questionable traits. George Hilton is convincing. In fact Frank Wolff plays an unusual unsympathetic role. But he is the one who gives us a wonderful showstealing performance.".

Here Hilton plays Kitosch who his mocked and abused by his ranch hand workmates when he his discovered with Don Jaime's Eduardo Fajardo wife Pamela Tudor . But he succeeds in getaway  though Don Jaime has put his henchmen on Kitosch in a relentless pursuit . With the arrival in the next small town he tries to ask the sheriff John Bartha for protection but Kitosch is charged with a crime he did not commit . However instead of getting help he is arrested and locked up to be delivered to Don Jaime's hoodlums . At this moment a cruel pistolero called Joshua Tracy Frank Wolff who steal the show  who is searched with the warrant frees him from jail . Then he joins up with Joshua  a brutal gunslinger who suffers epilepsy . Later on  he kidnaps and blackmails Don Jaime' s spouse . Kitosch redeems himself by saving his former employer and wife .Offbeat Spaghetti Western that follows the Sergio Leone wake  but it is also proceeded in American models . It's a stirring western with breathtaking gunfight between the protagonist George Hilton against the heartless Eduardo Fajardo and his hoodlums . George Hilton and Frank Wolff as starring couple are fine they ravage the screen shoot  hit and run and kill . This movie is a lot of fun to watch . It's an acceptable story with a touch of peculiarity some likable characters and an amazing music score and at the final happens a surprising denouement . Hilton delivers a decent acting as a cowboy who is mistreated and gets brand like an animal  but not long time after he turns the tables carrying out a vendetta . The Uruguayborn George Hilton was a Spaghetti firststar such as  Sartana no perdone  Go kill and come back  Kitosch  They call me Alleluja  Ruthless four  Alleluja for Django  and also played successful Giallio as The strange vice of Mrs Wardh  The scorpion's tale All colors of the dark  My deal Killer . He teams up  as coprotagonist  with Frank Wolff as the vicious and epileptic outlaw  he started his career by acting in several Roger Corman films. However Wolff had to travel to Europe to be successful. He was finally able to become a well known actor in Italy and Europe with his performance in Salvatore Giuliano 1962 and had roles in many European film productions. Moreover Wolff became a major star in Spaghetti Westerns. His most famous but briefest performances was as Brett McBain the friendly farmer in Sergio Leone's One upon a time in the West 1968. He also brought much needed light relief as the sheriff in Sergio Corbucci's The great silence 1968. When the time of SpaghettiWesterns was ending Wolff had several roles in Italian crime movies. Other memorable performances were in Duccio Tessari's Giallo Death started last night 1970 or in one of Wolffs last performances as a police commissioner in Fernando Di Leo's Miln caliber 9 1972. Sadly the great actor suffered from depression and killed himself in the Hilton  comitting sucide at early age .Evocative and atmospheric cinematography Fausto Rossi  shot on location in Spain  Almeria  desert Tabernas  as usual . Adequate and thrilling musical score by Piero Umiliani . Twisted and complex screenplay by Fulvio Gicca Palli  being efficiently produced by Pavoni . The motion picture was professionally directed by Nando Ccero who made other westerns as Il Tempo Degli Avvoltoi and Professionals for a Massacre and several Italian Sex comedies as La Dottoressa Del Distretto Militare  W La Foca  L'assistant Sociale Tutto Pepe  La Liceale Il Diavolo E L'Acquasanta  Il Gatto Mammone  among others".

Woody Harrleson and Anne Bancroft add weight as big names and the script and classy camera work does the rest. the script is top shelf realism with grit and it doesnt shy away from ripping out the brutality and venom of urban society. The young man playing 'blue' the 17 year old put away for killing his father is professional and it's a shame I haven't seen him in further films maybe someone should offer him some work. The road trip element is great and the freeways and highways are breath taking in beauty and well used for cinematography and as a tool to push along the dialogue throughout. The urbandust plains contrast is well thought out and the story darts form one tense setting to another. The biggest surprise with this excellent 'gem that got away' is the humour in the most unbelieveable circumstances. I personally loved the banter between Harrleson's doc and the young guy's tough insider. Casting is credible and the addition of a heart warming touching and spiritual story line adds visual and thoughprovoking undertones. The magic side story increases interest and plays with the audiences take on if this roomer is truth or a legend. The under dog 'ontherun' plot is gripping and apart from the use of the f word and graphic scenes of shootings this could have been a successful family film. I wonder if this movie gained any awards or acclaim as it definitely deserves some if there is any justice. This is a buried treasure in the dust of forgotten film. Nice work by all creates a thoughtprovoking drama with some excellent landscapes of rock formations and dusty plains. Catch it if you get a chance.".

This film was really quite different.There's a kind of spiritual theme to it all. Towards the latter stages of the picture the audience get a sense of the character development and how the Doctor Woody Harrelson who incidentally excels in this builds a sort of relationship with the kidnapper and cancer sufferer Jon Seda who really shows what he can do as a teenage convict  pure genius a magnificent performance.So here goes. While being transferred Seda manages to escape the police escort and when Harrelson comes over to take a look Seda takes him hostage and a whole road movie starts.What's great is the fact that the audience often underestimate the character of Blue. He actually shows he's got levels of intelligence when he explains to the Doctor who thinks he will die after a rattlesnake bite that using electricity works wonders so using the car Seda puts his magic to the test.We see that as well as the foulmouthed fool that Reynolds believes he is Blue is actually a believer and has faith hence his journey to the sacred lake that supposedly has healing powers May beauty be behind me in front of me above me below me and aaalll around me.Very emotional as it nears its climax and one heck of a movie. Just cannot praise it enough  I would love to see Seda back in action on the big screen this time in some more prominent pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brandon 'Blue' Monroe is only 16 but he is in a juvenile facility after being convicted of murder and because of an incurable tumor he has only a month or so to live. Figuring he has nothing to lose he takes Dr. Michael Reynolds hostage and demands that Dr. Reynolds take him to a 'sacred mountain' in Arizona where a medicine man he knew as a boy might be able to heal him.At first no one knows what has happened to Dr. Reynolds. Later he is suspected of having helped Blue because he was the one who recommended that Blue be transported to another hospital for treatment and it was while he was being moved that he escaped. Dr. Reynolds did not go voluntarily but later hostage and kidnapper begin to form a bond and to understand each other. For example Dr. Reynolds believes only in Western medicine while Blue who is half Navajo trusts the ways of the Native American. Renata who picks them up in the desert also tries to convince Dr. Reynolds that her people know about healing and that white people just push poison.The title of the movie refers to a healer with special powers. As we hear Blue tell the Sunchaser story we see in black and white scenes of young Michael and his brother Jimmy who died of cancer when he was young. Jimmy was on life support when he gave Michael a ring and Michael will not give up the ring to Blue even when being threatened with death.Jon Seda gave a great performance. Blue was unflinching and tough but also tender and even spiritual. This was not exactly Woody Harrelson's best work but he had his good moments such as when he first met Blue and when he told Blue about Jimmy. Harrelson got better in the movie's second half. Talisa Soto did a good job as the tough independent granddaughter of a Navajo medicine man.There were some funny moments such as when Dr. Reynolds tried to talk to Navajos he did not believe spoke English but they did. A woman who might have been Dixie Carter is told at a gas station that she looks just like the woman on 'Designing Women' but she says she does not even watch television.I was hoping for better car chases but there were some exciting scenes involving Blue and Dr. Reynolds driving too fast Dr. Reynolds was behind the wheel but Blue put his foot on the accelerator whether they were being pursued or not. The Arizona scenery meanwhile was magnificent.In between the fastpaced scenes there were deep discussions about spiritual and medical matters. This movie was no masterpiece but it was often intelligent.POSSIBLE SPOILERSI found the ending satisfying though one might have hoped for a 'miracle cure'. To consider the ending to be happy it is necessary to think on a spiritual level rather than hoping for life on this Earth to continue.Dr. Reynolds was so uptight that after getting tired and dirty climbing mountains and crossing streams he was still wearing a tie and he hadn't even loosened it!".

Working on a screen play by Charles Leavitt Mr. Cimino doesn't add anything new to this genre.If you haven't seen the movie please stop reading now.The choice of Woody Harrelson to play Dr. Michael Reynolds seems to have been the wrong decision. Mr. Harrelson a good actor otherwise appears out of his league and sometimes out of character. Dr. Reynolds is at the beginning of the film a man more interested in going to higher and better places rather than treating some of the patients he's assigned to see. He has all the accoutrements that go with his position as a rising oncologist including his brand new red Porsche the status symbol of Angelinos.When he is made to go along with the sick prisoner Blue he gets a taste of what the ghetto is like. He has no choice but to go along for a ride with this disturbed young man. Blue is a Navajo by birth but he's been away from his roots in a while.Along the way to the Navajo sacred mountain this odd couple experience quite a lot. Dr. Reynolds doesn't warm up to Blue at all. When a kind soul Dr. Baumbauer gives the pair a lift Reynolds voices his prejudices loudly. After all he's a man that has been trained professionally therefore he doesn't have time for these New Age charlatans who think the same way as Blue. The ending is predictable.Woody Harrelson is miscast in the movie. Jon Seda as the fugitive Blue gives an uneven performance. The only one that fares better is Anne Bancroft in her small role of a wise doctor Reynolds and Blue meet on the road.Just out of curiosity I watched the credits to see if the production company would have clarified that No Porsche was damaged during the filming process.....".

He has no choice but to go along for a ride with this disturbed young man. Blue is a Navajo by birth but he's been away from his roots in a while.Along the way to the Navajo sacred mountain this odd couple experience quite a lot. Dr. Reynolds doesn't warm up to Blue at all. When a kind soul Dr. Baumbauer gives the pair a lift Reynolds voices his prejudices loudly. After all he's a man that has been trained professionally therefore he doesn't have time for these New Age charlatans who think the same way as Blue. The ending is predictable.Woody Harrelson is miscast in the movie. Jon Seda as the fugitive Blue gives an uneven performance. The only one that fares better is Anne Bancroft in her small role of a wise doctor Reynolds and Blue meet on the road.Just out of curiosity I watched the credits to see if the production company would have clarified that No Porsche was damaged during the filming process.....";

Woodie Harrelson plays an eminent surgeon who's responsible for the welfare of a terminallyill halfIndian halfhomeyfromthehood 16 yearold serving a custodial sentence for murder. The two principal characters couldn't be more diametrically opposed if they tried  they come from opposite sides of the social track. The only thing keeping the young man alive is the dream of a mythical Navajo holy mountain with a sacred healing lake which sets in motion a sequence of events that leads to Harrelson's kidnap and flight across several states at gunpoint. Harrelson's surgeon is a pragmatist and naturalborn scientific sceptic who doesn't share the youth's flights of fancy. There's sufficient tension between the two characters to maintain the plot's momentum. Harrelson plays the predictable sceptic who eventually capitulates after much soulsearching and bonding with the criminalminded youth and finally assists the young man to his destination. There are some touching moments and an indisputable magic in the final scene as the young man is escorted by an Indian holyman to the lake. The movie finishes rather abruptly without filling in what happens to the youth after his submergence into the lake and only giving us a glimpse of Harrelson in handcuffs being led by FBI agents to his wife and baby daughter as the credits roll. The throughline of the movie is simple the journey the soul needs to make to embrace hope and faith. It's nothing special as far as movies in general go however it stands out as one of the best examples of a roadmovie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr Reynolds is an ambitious doctor who is assigned to a young Navaho patient who is doing a jail sentence for murder.  During transport to a treatment center the prisoner Blue over powers the guard and forces Reynolds to drive him to the desert where he believes there is a magic lake that can cure him.  During the long trip the two become friends and learn about each other.The first rule of a road movie is that the journey must always be matched by a simultaneous emotional or spiritual journey.  Surely rules were made to be broken?  Sadly this film doesn't break them but sticks to that principle. It is entertaining but it is very basic at it's core.  Materialistic doctor is taught a lesson by Navaho criminal  that's it in a nutshell.  The film goes to great lengths to put each character in their mould from the offset before taking them on a journey that is too much comedy action mixed with simple soul searching and mock spirituality.The last 10 minutes is exactly what you expect but is still a let down. Most of the film manages to be OK because it's still good  it's just unoriginal and quite samey.  Harrelson is OK but really has his character spelt out for him by giving him history materialism and a fancy car.  Seda does well and did this before he got big in Homicide LOTS.  Bancroft is wasted and the rest of the cast are incidental.  I didn't find the two leads convincing together and things just clicked too easily at the end.Overall this does exactly what it says on the tin and no more  if you are desperate for a spiritual themed road movie then this'll do you.  However if you want a really good film then this may not do it at all.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dr Reynolds is an ambitious doctor who is assigned to a young Navaho patient who is doing a jail sentence for murder.  During transport to a treatment center the prisoner Blue over powers the guard and forces Reynolds to drive him to the desert where he believes there is a magic lake that can cure him.  During the long trip the two become friends and learn about each other.The first rule of a road movie is that the journey must always be matched by a simultaneous emotional or spiritual journey.  Surely rules were made to be broken?  Sadly this film doesn't break them but sticks to that principle. It is entertaining but it is very basic at it's core.  Materialistic doctor is taught a lesson by Navaho criminal  that's it in a nutshell.

The biggest challenge to logic is the reemergence of Paula as Ms Hansen Charles Rainier's secretary. But that's the magic of the film we put up with every twist and turn because we figure these two will find one another in the end.To have Greer Garson play the role of PaulaMargaret was a stroke of genius. This actress with her unusual beauty made us believe she is that woman whose love for her man is everything.

Ronald Colman on the other hand plays his dual characters with a panache and conviction that only actors of that period had. Mr. Colman makes us believe he is Smithy the amnesiac soldier as well as the business magnate that he was prior to losing his mind in the war. He made these two men credible as he transformed himself from one to the other with an ease that was uncanny.Susan Peters had a small part playing Kitty who falls in love with Charles even though she knows it's an impossible undertaking.This is a film to be cherished by lovers of old American films.".

You will see that SmithyCharles Rainier is quite a young man at the beginning  however I did not find Ronald Colman too old in the role he overcomes the age difference with his splendid performance. And he doesn't seem too old to play Charles Rainier the prince of industry. I can't imagine another pair who could play the two romantic leads Greer Garson is so radiant. And all of us who watch old films know that people did look more mature back then  they looked like real adults! This is such a romantic film everyone should see it.

Beautifully accomplished in every department from writing to art direction to cinematography to scoring you have only to watch the first scene so like REBECCA's to be drawn in by it and then consistently surprised and entertained. And reading the 28 other comments here I am struck by the unanimity of opinion  because what makes the contrived plot believable scene by scene and what causes the picture as a whole to live so warmly in the memory is the unbeatable work from Ronald Colman and Greer Garson. More than MRS. MINIVER this is the archetypal Garson performance her tact gentle humor and intelligent restraint are in perfect service to her character and the story. If she seems too starry and aristocratic to be a lowly music hall performer she is right in every other respect particularly as an efficient secretary society hostess and perfect helpmate. And this is Ronald Colman's best work ever. He should have won his Oscar for this lovely subtle performance rather than for the strained work he did in A DOUBLE LIFE. Full of wistfulness as the amnesiac early in the film there is real heartbreak in the way he says the line I would have liked to have belonged to them about the couple he hopes will turn out to be his parents. But he is just as convincing later as the confident energetic 'Industrial Prince of England.' Colman and Garson are the perfect grownup romantic couple they make intelligence and maturity seem impossibly glamorous and they embody the idea that friendship loyalty and mutual respect must be at the center of every enduring love.".

For a modern take try Pat Barker's 'Regeneration' trilogy.I think one of the reasons this sort of film is so appealing is because of it's nowdated attitudes to commitment and relationships  you just can't imagine this story or for that matter Brief Encounter working nowadays  the protagonists would have taken shortcuts.But here's to the days when this was the way one behaved!";

I'm very pleased to check that I'm not the only who has this kind of feeling. Random Harvest is an outstanding film made in an era when the most important features were proper use of language dialogues looks music... In Random Harvest all of these ingredients are mixed to result in a master piece. Ronald Colman is superb. He plays to perfection the aristocratic role of SmithyCharles aristocratic when he is a humble writer and aristocratic when he plays the role of a member of Parliament. Greer Garson plays a lovely PaulaMargaret patient noble and guileless. They are not young in this film but it is also one of the best attractions in this film love is never old enough. There are some culminating points in this film but the highest ones for me are 1. When Ronald Colman is going to marry Susan Peters another lovely actress and they are choosing the hymns for the ceremony. Whe he listens the same hymn they played in his previous wedding the lovely O perfect love he stares Susan Peters in a indescribable way that says everything. And 2. The final scene indescribable you must see it to feel how your soul moves. One thousand times I'll see the film one thousand times I'll tremble. Thanks everybody who made possible that wonder! thank you very much!".

That just goes to show what a masterpiece this film is ! Indeed I have my own personal list of top ten best films and this is one of them together with Waterloo Bridge !. It is a beautifully romantic they just don't mak'em like that any more !! and satisfying film to watch and I just love the tune O Perfect Love which recurs on several occasions through the movie. I just wonder whether there is someone else in the world who loves this movie as much as me. Greer Garson is incredibly beautiful and sexy in this film and I would dearly loved to be picked up by her like Smithy was !! The overall plot is fantastic and is like a dream and the actors are beautiful. I may add that the quality of the DVD recording is excellent and in several languagessubtitles so there is no excuse for anyone being disappointed ! You need a large supply of hankies or Kleenex to make it right to the end without being flooded out. I did ! Let's hope that Waterloo Bridge will be given the same treatment in the coming months ..............".

	schema:reviewBody "The novels of James Hilton were very popular in America as well as in the United Kingdom. Mr. Hilton created British heroes that resonated with the American public and cerebral actors like Robert Donat and Ronald Colman seem born to play. I do remember as a lad being given a book with Lost Horrizon Goodbye Mr. Chips and Random Harvest by my mother to read and the stories fascinated me.Random Harvest concerns Charles Rainer who sustained a head injury during World War I and woke up in a hospital in his native country with no memory of who he is. On Armistice Day in 1918 Rainer walks out of the hospital and takes up with another drifting soul an entertainer named Paula. When you're Ronald Colman goodness oozes out of you from every pore so small wonder that Greer Garson accepts him at face value with no idea who he could be. They live together for two years and then one day in Liverpool Colman is hit by a taxi. He regains his memory when he regains consciousness. He remembers he's Charles Rainer oldest son of a title and a wealthy fellow at that. But no memory of his life with Garson.The chemistry between Colman and Garson is a thing of beauty. She wants so much to tell him who she is and he was for three years but she's advised by psychiatrist Philip Dorn not to do so. And Colman becomes even richer and more successful but with something missing. Memories just out of his reach and Colman exudes a sadness that the most hardened heart will find touching.One highlight for me is Greer Garson performing one Harry Lauder's great music hall numbers She's Ma Daisy with appropriate Scot's costume. This was the career year for James Hilton. In addition to this film Hilton did the screenplay for the Oscar winning Mrs. Miniver in 1942 and won a personal Oscar there. In fact Random Harvest ran second to Mrs. Miniver in a lot of categories. Mrs. Miniver was the Best Picture of 1942 Ronald Colman for Random Harvest and Walter Pigeon for Mrs. Miniver both lost to James Cagney for Yankee Doodle Dandy for Best Actor. And Susan Peters as Colman's stepniece lost to Teresa Wright for Mrs. Miniver as Best Supporting Actress.The film brought Susan Peters her first recognition. But her's was another career cut short due to a hunting accident that left her a paraplegic.Random Harvest as a book and as a film is how the British see themselves and how they like being portrayed on the screen. When you have players the caliber of Ronald Colman and Greer Garson doing it with the help Hollywood's English colony the results are outstanding.".

All of the praise that you can read about this film is simply not enough. Many people comment that they find the story improbable.  But folks this is the movies and movies need be neither probable nor practical.  An endearing story with smooth direction by Mervyn LeRoy and flawless performances it has quickly grown to be one of my alltime favorites.Spoilers! To put it simply John Smith Ronald Colman is a WWI vet who was found in the trenches without any knowledge of his own identity.  By chance he meets a music hall actress named Paula Ridgeway Greer Garson and strikes up a friendship which soon develops into a romance leading to marriage a baby and a poor but blissful existence.  Tragedy strikes when Smithy as she calls him is on his way to Liverpool to apply for a job with a newspaper  he is hit by a car.  He remembers his true identity  Charles Rainier wealthy aristocrat  but forgets he was ever John Smith. He returns home and months later Paula returns to him too  this time in the form of Margaret Hansen playing the part of his devoted secretary hoping that perhaps he will someday remember the life that they had together and the love that he had for her.  It's such a tragedy that Susan Peters was injured in a shotgun accident not too long after this film  she does a fine job as Kitty Charles' almostwife.  Also Henry Travers who is never bad in any film does a grand job though his role as a doctor is small.  The two stars of this film without a doubt are the folks with top billing Ronald Colman and Greer Garson.  Ronald Colman is wonderfully cast as the melancholy soldier who just can't seem to get a break any way he turns. Just listen to that rich voice and look into those big sad eyes  he really turns on the charm here.  Then you have Greer Garson  vibrant stunningly gorgeous luscious voice and indeed a talented little singer and dancer!  The She's Ma Daisy number is an absolute treat  a side of Garson the public seems to forget existed.  She takes your breath away as Paula and makes you believe in the power of her love for her beloved Smithy.All in all this movie comes highly recommended 1010 five stars twothumbs up... you know the bit... but be sure to have those tissues handy!".

Random Harvest is a splendidly made film both sumptuous and Expressionist and still looking as fresh now as it did then. The period detail is rendered handsomely as well not accurate perhaps but with the quality of how the film looks that doesn't really matter all that much. The music has that lush romantic feeling without being too syrupy the use of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake was apt and will be a delight for classical music enthusiastscount me as one. The script has the right dose of warmth and pathos with nothing being corny or overlysentimental this is a script with heart. As has the story which is romantic to the hilt heartwarming and incredibly touching you're guaranteed to need tissues when Charles doesn't return to Paula after going to Liverpool and when his memory starts to come back. I was so engrossed by the characters and so touched by the story that any improbabilities were easily forgiven. Mervyn Leroy's direction is masterly and the characters are sweet and very human complete with one of the most realistic and heartbreaking portrayals of shellshock on film. The supporting cast all give solid performances Susan Peters is utterly convincing in her feistiness and confidence and Reginald Owen Henry Travers and Edmund Gwenn are always watchable. But the two leads dominate and are a huge part of the reason why Random Harvest works so well. Ronald Colman was a revelation wistful and dignified but it is also very difficult to not tear up at Colman's body language when his memory starts returning a very telling piece of acting. Greer Garson is just radiant and is wonderfully sincere in her role. Their chemistry together is just pure magic. All in all beautiful and outstanding film cinematic romance at its finest. 1010 Bethany Cox".

Close the door settle down suspend belief for a couple of hours and let yourself get carried along on a wave of superb theatre.A warning though. Have the tissues ready.

Close the door settle down suspend belief for a couple of hours and let yourself get carried along on a wave of superb theatre.A warning though. Have the tissues ready.

What a beautiful woman Greer Garson was not just in appearance but also in poise and loveliness of personality with her warm and generous charm. This is a major achievement in moviemaking the likes we will never see again and believe me that is tragic because as a society we are the worse for it as it states that something is lacking in us in general. Ronald Colman was the classic gentleman a wonderful man whose acting brought out the best that is in all of us. This film was my mother's favorite and I can see why. This is truly a romantic film about two people torn apart by the mind and yet with hope and faith the couple in love can never be separated forever if there is a will for one to protect the other from harm. What a wonderful and beautiful climax right at the end of the film when Greer Garson exclaims Smithy and Ronald Colman is bonechilled as his mind recovers its memory of lost love when he replies with Paula. Your heart should melt at this point and if it does not there is something seriously wrong with you as a human being.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since this is one of my 3 favorite movies right behind GWTW and BenHur I'm pleased to see that the vast majority of reviews here are extremely positive.I want to begin my review my dismissing several of the oftheard criticisms of the film. First that Colman was too old for the role. When you a have a film than spans nearly 20 years any actor is going to be either too young for the older scenes or too old for the younger scenes. Either way there's going to be lots of makeup. Colman was 51 when he made this film meaning that if you want to go with actual ages his character would have been 47 when he entered the military at the beginning of WWI. In actuality that made Colman 6 years to old for enlistment status 41 was the upper limit. But just right to be the industrial prince of Great Britain later in the film. So you either err in the age of the soldier or you err in the age of the industrialist.Another criticism is the need to suspend belief. Yup. That's what the vast majority of movies require. If not you're usually either watching a very boring fictional movie or a documentary. Normal life portrayed on the big screen isn't usually very interesting.Another criticism is that the film brings in the twist midway through the film rather than at the very end as the novel did. Well doing the film way simply wouldn't have worked. Garson would have had to have been absent for half the film. And the choice is between total surprise or the interest in seeing how each of the main characters deals with the ruse. And Garson's character Paula explains why she wants the relationship only when Colman's character SmithyCharles comes to a realization based on love and remembrance not based on when he feels a legal responsibility. And frankly I recently read the book and I thought it was awful. And I doubt that most readers knew about the plot twist before reading the book you just can't keep secrets like that.One criticism of this film that I hear that is accurate though of little consequence is that the hair and clothing styles of the women are not accurate to the time period. Fair criticism but fairly common in the cinema.The one major criticism I have is the character of Kitty played by Susan Peters. Supposedly being only 15 when she first meets Charles while he is clearly in his 40s by movie standards not only didn't work for me but I found a bit repulsive. It would be easier to tolerate the liaison if Kitty had been fresh out of college when they met  a MayDecember romance  but this is a bit too much. Not only that but despite others praising her acting here I was not impressed at all. She was far more suited to the next film she made  an Andy Hardy piece where she was a coed. This one flaw is the reason that for me I can't give the film a 10.I hold Greer Garson and Ronald Colman in almost equal esteem. There are some who see this as Garson's film but I disagree. Considering the degree of suspension of belief required of viewers here Colman had the task of holding the center while being a shellshock victim and amnesiac on the one hand and becoming the industrial prince of England and a member of Parliament on the other. I noticed one of our reviewers for criticizing Colman for walking through the film. I had an uncle that was shellshocked in WWII and that's exactly what he did  walked through life with something missing. And Colman portrays that perfectly without going over the edge. He talks to Paula about wishing he had belonged to the couple at the asylum. Perfect. He becomes easily distracted by certain semiflashbacks but not able to focus on them. Perfect. This should have won the Academy Award although I'm not taking anything away from James Cagney. And then there's the scene which is as good an acting job as I've seen  at the cottage door when all you see is the back of Colman's head as the memory returns. Though lasting only seconds you see several stages of returning memory in just the way his body tenses in very slightly different movements. Absolutely perfect.Greer Garson also plays this perfectly. Just the type who would take in a stray dog. Just the type who would want the relationship to be based on love rather than responsibility. And her dance routine  so very entertaining...and different for her! I fell in love with Greer Garson watching this film.There are other actors in the film who make it feel so comfortable  Henry Travers Reginald Owen Una O'Connor Margaret Wycherly and more. But Philip Dorn a Dutch actor stands out as the psychiatrist.I love this film and have for years. Since its DVD release I find myself watching it a couple of times a year. I never grow tired of it. Almost the perfect film.".

Colman  Garson also gave it their all and are also gorgeous to look and listen to especially when Colman starts talking properly  my was he lucky bumping into her in the cigarette shop in the side street! They make it all seem so romantically believable and that such endless selfsacrifice always gets rewarded in the end no matter how long it takes.

But it does have value and the fact that we have at sometime been at war or had a conflict with other countries since then is a moving point. Although one can admit that the scenery and backdrops are slightly idealistic for rural England I do like the fact that Swindon on the Great Western Railway is mentioned. This being a Hollywood picture being filmed in 1942 with two leading British born actors could only inspire the home force. It is certainly a film that requires the tissues. But at the same time I for one having seen the film as a child an adult and an older person would recommend it but please buy in the tissue's!!!!!".

The movie kept a fast action high octane flow from the beginning to the end.

I'll definitely watch it again and again in the future.  Jet Li played a martial art master skilled in the magic spear and in this movie you get to see his skill with spears and the amazing things he can do with it from the opening action scene.It's short enough to be watched on some idle evening but believe me you are in for a treat...especially if you are into martial art and period movies.

Reviewers must realize that kung fu movies are fun movies with lots of action and a weak plot. You can't compare them to Hollywood's finest productions because people have to realize that they were meant to be released in Asia only and that they are to be compared to other Asian fighting shows. Now that I've finished ranting about other's reviews let's get back to talking about the show. Jet Li plays a different character than the usual Master Wong or Master Fong. Jet usually plays the master of the kung fu club or society but in this case him and his son are rebel outcasts of the main society. I'm not going to spoil the movie for you but it's the usual plot of a kung fu movie  he fights the true bad guys picks up a sexy girl who falls in love with Jet and he fathers and trains his son. By the way I only watch the Chinese original movies because I'd rather read the sub titles and hear the original music and read the proper meaning of the show. I understand that influences my reviews because others may be seeing badly translated dubs with stupid voices in them.Rent or buy the proper versions if you can. The theme song for Fong Sai Yuk Jet's character in the 'Once Upon a Time in China' series is an awesome instrumental song If you're picky about production quality quality of plot etc. etc. then don't watch Chinese produced Jet Li movies. Some of my other favourite Jet Li movies are 'Last Hero in China' and 'Hitman'".

Li's village is massacred by the ruling dynasty he flees with his young son and teaches him martial arts. The two keep running from officials across the country and end up protecting Shaolin kids also being sought by the empire. The acting is wooden as would be expected. The movie is very predictable and the comedy is corny.

The spear is one of Jet's better weapons and it's not too common for him to use it in his movies. It is similar yet quite different from the staff which Jet has used frequently through his career. Jet is pretty amazing with the spear so it's a wonder why he doesn't use it more frequently.All in all it's an average Hong Kong 90's action movie.

The script is dull silly as opposed to humorous and has a lot of inconsistencies and illogical actions. The thin plot is not particularly interesting the dialog is incredibly campy and made worse by perhaps the worst dub voice acting I've ever heard Jet Li's monotone dub actor actually... pauses to... let his Chinese... lips... catch up... to his English... words. The fight scenes  hello the whole POINT  are not particularly good. Jet Li restricts himself to using a magic spear through the whole film does too much wire work and not enough actual demonstration of his awesome talent and the constant quick camera cuts make it hard to really follow and admire the action. There's a lot more blood than I'm used to in this genre too. Also Li spends virtually the whole movie fighting an invincible guy who looks like Pinhead minus the pins smeared with peanut butter and who drives around in a ridiculouslooking armadillo version of the Batmobile. These fights are pointless and boring because you already know the immortal bad guy can't be beaten by Li's kung fu and you eventually see his cause of death coming from ten minutes away  and even that is implausible. I won't spoil the ending but hey early in the film the guy lies on a big cartoonish bundle of dynamite straight out of a Roadrunner cartoon and isn't killed by the explosion so the way they eventually kill him shouldn't work either I don't consider that a spoiler you know darn well the 1 bad guy must die horribly at the end of every action film. So anyway... bad script bad dialog HORRIBLE dubbing and no option for original Chinese with subtitles less than enthralling fight scenes and more blood and guts than usual. What's to like?".

These fights are pointless and boring because you already know the immortal bad guy can't be beaten by Li's kung fu and you eventually see his cause of death coming from ten minutes away  and even that is implausible. I won't spoil the ending but hey early in the film the guy lies on a big cartoonish bundle of dynamite straight out of a Roadrunner cartoon and isn't killed by the explosion so the way they eventually kill him shouldn't work either I don't consider that a spoiler you know darn well the 1 bad guy must die horribly at the end of every action film. So anyway... bad script bad dialog HORRIBLE dubbing and no option for original Chinese with subtitles less than enthralling fight scenes and more blood and guts than usual. What's to like?";

It felt very uneven and jumbled. It's like it was trying to have the cake and eat it too. You can't have both and the attempt failed in my opinion. The thing that keeps this movie watchable is the relationship between Jet  his son. The kid has some ridiculously good abilities and had great screen presence for his age. They had a tangible chemistry with each other that felt real. I also enjoyed the comedic bits with Deannie Yip  Chigmay Yau as the Mother  Daughter. It felt out of place at times but they were amusing as thieves. It has an OTT villain with burn scars all over his face. His invincible act got rather grating to my nerves and I had trouble buying into him as a threat. The finale is disappointingly routine but it does have a cool moment where Jet dives through a clock to save his son. I didn't care for this movie but it does have its moments.

Kwun recruits highflying criminal Red Bean Chingmy Yau and seeks revenge on the traitorous Ma LingYee ChuenHua Chi and the tyrannical ruling family.This is a great fun martial arts film. It is not for everyone. The film is very lighthearted and very slow paced at times. However the excellent cast performances from Jet Li and the rest of the cast far surpass the few problems with the movie. I am a bit biased since this was my first Jet Li movie. Of course I saw it on TV as Legend of the Red Dragon with terrible English dubbing. Original Hong Kong cut is highly recommended over English Dub. Still a great Jet Li movie and one of my favorites. 910.".

A sombresadalmost clown like humour is projected by Mastroianni's interpretation the evident disconnection with reality he is faced with really does tell us that at times Ignorance is bliss";

	schema:reviewBody "Guiseppe Tornatore's first film after the wonderful Cinema Paradiso got little attention when it came out and is not even available on DVD yet. Perhaps the increasing darkness of tone replacing the lightness of early scenesof the film put people offbut now that we can all see Cinema Paradiso in it's director's cut rather than the hacked upsimplified version that originally came out in 1989this should not really be a surprise.Again we have a film that celebrates life but asks questions about what is best in lifeand whether we all make the right decisions. The movie centres on an absolutely wonderful performance by a 70 odd Marcello Mastroianiin a role that allows him the full gamut of emotionsfrom great joy to terrible sadness.As before mentionedthe film is deceptively lighthearted at first. As Mastroiani travels from Rome to visit his childrenTornatore gives us some amusing and colourful snapshots of Italian life or ratherlife in general. The observation with a touch of caricature recalls Fellini another reviewer has pointed out the many similarities to Fellini so I will not repeat them all. Particularly great is the lunatic who makes a sculpture out of.....aerialssome kind of statement about the evils of technological progress no doubt. Even heremore serious bits creep insuch as a surreal but very symbolic dream scene shown in several bits and an incredibly touching little moment where Mastroiani is in the same hotel room he spent his honeymoon night in and recalls that time.As the film gets more serious and deeper it becomes a very poignant study of a man who feels lostout of touch with everythingnot just his childrenwho simply want the best for him but are actually somewhat embarrassed by himbut the world itself. These two elements reach their synthesis in a really haunting scene where Mastroianialone and homelessspends the night in a box and visions of his childrenas actual childrencome to him. All this is seemingly resolved with just a bit of hope and happinessthan Tornatore delivers a killer of a punchline at the end which really makes us re access our views of Mastroiani's character.As with the full version of Cinema Paradiso and later on The Starmaker and perhaps to a lesser extentMalenaEverybody's Fine is sentimental but in a tough way. There is a great deal of emotionboth for the character's and for usbut its tempered with both a sense of realism and a wider sense of life and what is best for us in life.With an absolutely superb score by Ennio Morriconeranging from the jauntyBaroquelike overture and 'travelling' theme to the tragic waltz for the 'hero'Everybody's Fine is a great film. Of course it's not as good as Cinema Paradisobut are there many films that are? I'm biased thoughas it's my favourite film!.".

Perhaps we have Mastroianni to thank for that who plays it very downtoEarth. Even when he spits out wise words of advice to his offspring there isn't that unrealistic expectation from the viewer to gasp with shock bewilderment and awe something very common in so many other European movies especially from the 60s and 70s. Too many directors think they reveal the secrets of the universe in their modest little underachieving flicks. Not the case here at least not in annoying amounts. STB is likable and even amusing at times.As for the experimental approach if every other movie that Italians and other Continentals release has the same type of surreal silliness going on then it isn't really experimental anymore is it? It becomes normal unsurprising stale even.It's far easier to cobble up a script chockfull of metaphoric nonsense than to actually sit down and write a compact stirring script with a beginning middle and end. STB leans far more heavily toward the latter.".

The viewer is able to see everything in the father's eyes played by Marcello Mastroianni. When he sees his children he sees them how they once were  not as adults. Mastroianni is always excellent. It is funny though to see him as a father and a grandfather when one is so used to seeing him as a bachelor like in La Dolce Vita. I was able to feel the love he had for his children and also the hurt when the truth was brought out in front of him. We all want so much for our children and it is painful to see it otherwise. An excellent statement. Besides the message the film brought it also gave the viewer a good dose of the Italian countryside Roma and Milano. The travel scenes were an added touch. Nothing can beat Cinema Paradiso in tenderness but Stanno tutti bene is not too far off!".

Instead he interviews almost all actors in Euskal Herria today providing a complete array of perspectives. Very instructive and entertaining at the same time. The camera is captivating and the editing is very effective. The music by Mikel Laboa is out of this world and gave me goosebumps. The only problem is that it is apparently done for an audience that knows a lot more about Basque history than the average foreigner like me so at times it was hard to follow the chronology. In fact i watched the longer almost 7 hours...i think this was the TV series version from a Spanish friend and it helped me understand the movie better.".

Even though the movie is not completely objective and it compares victims of terrorism to the families of the terrorists there are very intelligent opinions made by very intelligent thinkers politicians and journalists who are affected directly by the basque problem. There are also interesting comments made by those who are  in favor of the basque autodetermination including those who support terrorism. Medem has made a film where everybody has voice to criticise and to praise everything they want involved in this political and social problem being partial in editing therefore making people say things out of context. Content apart the movie has beautiful images of basque shores and mountains and includes some images from other movies too.

Also it was a LOT of information to process and although I watched it with English subtitles I had to replay scenes very often.I had only some very shallow not even basic knowledge of the Basque conflict before watching this. I am studying abroad in Spain and a professor here recommended this and I wanted to learn more. I didn't even bother testing my Spanish and watched it in English to understand it the best. Even then it is not a movie made for beginners. But beginner or not I still recommend this movie to anyone interested just as long as they read up a little on the Basque Country and Spanish political parties first as background info.However despite the confusion and incomplete variety of interviewees as a journalism student I say the documentary was beautifully intriguingly insightfully and ingeniously done. Even though it was confusing it was INCREDIBLY informative and my goal of learning more about the history culture and conflict in the region was met and surpassed. It was deemed very controversial for showing such an array of perspectives but I felt this was best and very raw and as objective as one can get especially for a Basque director. And despite the crazy amount of information it still kept me glued to the screen.The artistic aspect was brilliant too especially for an independent film. I really loved the flip flop from interviews in beautiful Basque landscapes to clips of the metaphoric pelota vasca to the old blackandwhite film by Orson Welles to clips of old historical videos to Mikel Laboa crooning his sometimes beautifully melodic and sometimes strikingly dissonant music. I want to especially applaud the music it is absolutely stunning and perfect!I highly recommend this documentary.".

I'm in favour of it and I didn't see that bias at all. It certainly is not apologetic of violence.

This is a Leslie Nielsentype silly parody except the late Lloyd Bridges played the lead role instead Nielson.Actually Jay Mohr was more of the lead actor in here narrating the film and taking Al Pacino's Godfather role while Christina Applegate took Diane Keaton's character. There are a number of laughoutloud lines in this movie and a number of overdone slapstick scenes. As with any comedy in which the material comes at you at a rapid pace see the Marx Brothers films from 70 years ago to see some of the origins of comedic mayhem you get a lot funny and notsofunny. They come at you so fast you can hardly keep up. I found that there were a lot of funny lines written on background buildings street signs etc. on this film. You almost have to freezeframe some scenes to read all the jokes much less hear them.This movie did do something that Hollywood films rarely have done poke fun at a Democrat. Usually the cheap shots are reserved for Republcians Nixon Gingrich Reagan Bush etc but here we have the famous But I never had sex with that woman! line delivered in a obvious reference. Well good for them. About time the Liberals were recipients of a cheap shot or two. It only happens about once every 25 years in films. So I give this film points for being fair and balanced.Also points should be awarded for having several actors from the actual Godfather films make appearances here too. The film was dedicated in loving memory to Bridges so I assume this was his last movie. Well he certainly went out with a laugh.".

This was the first movie that i felt it was obvious he was losing his touch. The comedy is not as fastpaced here as it was before nor is it as spoton. Spoofing the Godfathermovies shouldn't be very hard really. Those movies are as potentially silly as great movies always are walking the thin line that greatness is.The problem here is that i think they missed so many things that could have been spoofed and they included some things that didn't need spoofing. The best part of the movie in my opinion is the one with the young Cortino coming to America. The more contemporary parts are less funny and more silly. Mostly i find it to be a lack in the script department as both Lloyd Bridges and Jay Mohr are pretty suitable for their parts.In the end this is about 50 percent embarrassing and 50 percent funny much like many of Leslie Nielsens later movies. It's far from Hot Shots and Naked Gun but then again such comedy is not what it was.".

One day his youngest son makes a mistake and has to leave town. A little later he ends up as a casino boss in Las Vegas. But the heads of the other families want old Don Cortino out of the way.

Will he fall for her or will he return to Diane who by the way had run for President successfully in the meantime? Not every joke works but many of them are indeed quite hilarious. If you liked Jim Abrahams previous films i.e. Hot Shots 12 you'll probably like this film. It spoofs everything from The Godfather to Jurassic park 2 to Forrest gump. It was also entertaining watching many people who were IN the Godfather spoofing they're own characters! My rating for Mafia!810.ABOUT THE DVD Touchstone has released a reasonable DVD for the film. The image is presented in 1.851 and generally isn't a bad picture but has a surprisingly high amount of grain and dirt This is especially obvious during darker sequences but the picture is sharpcolors are good and blacks are solid. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is as fine as I could have hoped for. Audio is crystal clear and there's plenty of surround sound effects to keep your rear speakers occupied. For extras we are given a tiny production featurette which consist of cast interviews film clips and some behindthescene footage. This featurette runs a little less than 2 minutes. The disk is adequately closedcaptioned with substantial paraphrasing. My rating for the DVD 7.510.".

	schema:headline " Worth a few laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "Korean War veteran Tony Jay Mohr the son of Mafia boss Vincenzo Armani Windbreaker Cortino Lloyd Bridges in his final role before his death is handpicked by his retiring father to take over the family business. However this causes a rift between him and his Protestant peaceloving girlfriend Diane Christina Applegate who leaves him when it's obvious that the man she loves is not really what she thought him to be.Now Tony lives the life of a mafioso while trying to find a longtime family enemy who lost his thumb in a bizarre incident.If you are a Lloyd Bridges fan then you have to see this only because this was his final role before his death. This film is in the same vein as the Hot Shots movies which also starred him but you will not laugh as much as you would with those films. He was a lot funnier in the Hot Shots movies but does bring some pretty good laughs in this film.Surprisingly Mohr is pretty good in his role. He is pretty much the straight man for the rest of the cast and the visual jokes like a Vegas version of Candy Land. If you ask me he played Tony somewhere between a comedic role and a more dramatic role and did it nicely. He also did a pretty good narration but it wasn't perfect.You get a pretty even amount of physical comedy with some comical lines all through the film  all the way through the end of the closing credits in fact. And I suggest you actually watch the closing credits because they slipped some jokes into them. However I felt that many of the jokes just didn't work and found myself not laughing at them.The plot somewhat follows the one seen in The Godfather and relies heavily on that and other Mafia movies. However The Godfather series is the obvious inspiration for this film. However they do slip in some jokes poking fun at more modern things like HMOs popular children's games like Chutes and Ladders and President Bill Clinton's denial of not having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinski.There is character development in this film but not a whole lot. I thought a few characters could have been developed more especially if they helped in the plot twists. Even some of the major players in this film was not greatly developed.Because the cast is mainly Italian a lot of jokes target the Italian life. Many people may find these jokes offensive. If you ask me these jokes are fairly tame though.This movie is not for everybody. In fact if you haven't seen some of the greatest Mafia movies especially the Godfather trilogy you might not like this movie. Like I said earlier there are some jokes referencing things and events we've all experienced in out lives but this movie is for fans of the Mafia movie genre more than any other audience.Believe it or not there is no blood in this movie despite the subject. Yes there is some violence but it's played for comedy. At one point in the movie Don Cortino Bridges is riddled with bullets but no blood comes from the wounds and the witnesses including the band playing during the scene thinks he is doing various dances including the Macarena. You even get a death by flowers where we are lead into by a reference to Forrest Gump.If you are looking for Oscarworthy performances this movie is absolutely not for you. Except for Mohr you mainly get overthetop performances from the cast. Mohr who plays his role straight compared to the rest of the cast and Bridges are easily the two best performances. However Olympia Dukakis who plays Bridges mother she was actually 20 years younger than him at the time this film was made stands from of the supporting cast. Other major performers were given weakly written characters and their performances reflect that.Unlike the Godfather trilogy the score here is not really memorable. You get some current music from the time of its making and release but nothing too spectacular worth noting by way of original music.This movie got destroyed by critics when it was finally released. But like most movies it's not as bad as they say. If you like the Airplane! and Hot Shots movies you may like this one. However I find that this one can't live up to the comic genius of those previous movies.If you ask me I can't recommend this as a Must See movie but check it out on HBO for some good laughs and because it's Bridges' final performance.".

I found this on lovefilm and thought  why have i never heard of this? I haven't laughed this hard for ages. I admire the filmmakers so much for being so clever and entertaining. The production values are really high as well everything looks quality and well made. Older films like Airplane etc can look cheap but it adds to their charm so it was nice to see this modern film which was hardly a blockbuster made so well and looking like the budget was much higher.Of course not every joke tickled my funny bone I could have done without the farting spewing and when Lloyd Bridges get shot up but people think he's dancing.But apart from that I found it absolutely hilarious and I can't wait to see it again. Jay Mohr is so great  if you can watch Action. It's a TV series he did only one series but it's soooo good! Really funny and totally uncheesy like all American sitcoms feel they have to be. It's about a Hollywood producer.Anyway back to Mafia. The writers have worked so hard not only on the script but the visual gags injokes and references. I love spotting a funny poster or something in the credits. Everyone has put so much effort into making this movie the best and the funniest it could be. I was stunned by the low rating but hey different strokes for different folks.If you are reading the comments deciding whether or not to rentbuy this movie I definitely think you should  especially if you are a fan of AirplaneTop Secret Police Squad Naked Gun Police Academy and Hot Shots.Fun Fact! Actor Jay Mohr is allergic to poiWhat the hell is poi?".

So a parody seemed like a good idea to me. After all these films are always serious and sometimes you need to get a good joke out of them. So Mafia seemed like a good idea to me. I watched it last night and I have to say that while there were a few laughs here and there Mafia's humor is mostly forced and typical. I know that most parody films are usually predictable in humor but it would have been nice if it could have had more originality. Or maybe I'm wrong mafia movies are just not what you could parody for a story. Mafia pretty much has the typical humor of kid getting hit by every object movies that they parody that have nothing to do with the subject they're going for fart and sex jokes. It's just not original but there are a few laughs here and there I admit. The story could have worked if they just cut back on a few typical gags.Anthony is part of the mafia family he runs a casino in Las Vegas and his father is the Don of the family. But when his father is almost murdered during a wedding dance he goes into the family business. With the non existing help from his coke addict brother he must try to survive this business while trying to maintain a normal life. But he just about looses it when he decides to go ahead and kill everyone.Mafia! is over all not the most horrible comedy I've ever seen there are movies that are a thousand times worse but I think that the crew of the film just got a little out of control with what they had. I think it could have been a good film if the jokes were not just so predictable and bland. The cast seemed to have an alright time making the movie I don't think they were really into it except for Lloyd Bridges who played The Godfather he looked like he had a fun time. I don't know if I would recommend this film if you're looking for an average parody this the movie for you but don't expect anything more.410".

	schema:reviewBody "Mixing the plots of Godfather with Casino Goodfellas etc this follows the story of Tony Cortino who returns home as a war hero who is forced into the leadership of the Mafia following the attempted assassination of his father.What does the plot matter  it is broadly a copy of the first two Godfathers but ropes in plenty of spoofs of gangster movies as well as others eg Forrest Gump however it's main success if it has one is that it reminds you how good those films are.  When I finished watching this I wanted to watch all the real films to wash this nasty thing out of my mind.The spoof scenes are lazy and not inspired at all  they are really easy and obvious totally lacking any intelligence or effort.  I actually enjoy spoofs  Blazing Saddles Airplane Naked Gun  I enjoy them all so it's not like I feel they're beneath me or anything.  However the jokes here are stupid I actually chuckled twice in 90 minutes not laughed but chuckled and both of these were at stupid jokes.The cast are OK but deserve better  when I see Vincent Pastore in this after being so good in Sopranos it makes me sad.  Fair enough Jay Mohr probably doesn't deserve any better but the rest do.  The saddest sight is Bridges  so funny in Airplane and Hotshots but here his clowning is rubbish.  What makes it worse is that before the end credits the film is dedicated to his memory!  Surely a more fitting tribute would have been to reshoot all his scenes and prevent this from being one of the last things he did.Overall this is terrible  I'm a fan of spoofs and this barely made me laugh once or twice.  This only success in reminding you how good the original films were.  A mess!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lady with the Little Dog is arguably Chekhov's best short story and probably one of the greatest short stories ever written. I realize this is quite a statement to make but notwithstanding my opinion it has been also the opinion of countless literary critics since the publication of the story. The challenge to faithfully render it on the screen was indeed a daunting task but Heifitz sure of himself went ahead with the adaptation of The Lady with the Little Dog an intimidating task and succeeded. Of course it did not hurt that Heifitz had been a great admirer of Chekhov's work since his childhood and considered him his mentor. And of course nobody without a velikaya russkaya dusha a great Russian soul could have rendered this work. To a Russian his soul is something more than what a Westerner drags to church on Sundays and holidays. It is hard to explain the Russian soul but as they say I cannot tell you what it is but I know it when I see it.Andrei Moskvin and Dmitry Meskhiyev's black and white photography is exquisite in rendering the atmosphere of the film starting in its opening with the lethargic atmosphere of Yalta the snowy Moscow winter or the pathetic frozen atmosphere of its conclusion. Heitfitz' succeeds at reproducing Chekhov's style and symbols. As rapid cuttings distinguish the story's narrative technique the camera often jumps to new scenes without warning. These cuts and jumps through time give a sense of the suddenness and unexpectedness of Anna and Gurov's illicit love affair their falling in love their settling into their new life where much has to be improvised to maintain the relationship. Nature and the sea are important symbols in Chekhov's work and are portrayed in the film through lyrical long shots of the sea at sunset and the nearby hills at Yalta. The two protagonists sit silently reflecting from their vantage point on the birth of their love affair lost in the continuum of eternity.Yes when you stop to think the whole world is wonderful  everything except what we ourselves think and do when we forget the higher aims of existence and our human dignity says Gurov.Heitfitz uses a variety of shots appropriate for each scene. Close shots and close ups emphasize the moments of psychological drama. The dialogue is as in Chekhov minimal and never more than is necessary. Only few words convey the emotional complexity of the characters preserving the intensity of their feelings.As with Chekhov the Yalta seduction scene in Anna's room or any of the intimate scenes later on is not shown. In that respect ChekhovHeifitz followed the Russian mores of the time knowing full well that had Chekhov dared to innovate it would have never passed the censor's pen. One also notes the great care taken with the period details such as costumes carriages and the physiognomy of the actors.The acting of the two main characters Iya Savvina and Aleksei Batalov is on the mark. She is young fragile and innocent and he reserved sophisticated and aristocratic. Anna was Savvina's first role. She went on to appear in twentyseven more films her last one Trotsky in 1993. Batalov has appeared in more than thirtyfour films including Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears 1979. The other two lesser characters appear only briefly Nina Alisova as Gurov's wife is sullen and Pantelejmon Krymov in the role of Anna's husband indeed looks like a lackey. The lyrical music by Nadezhda Simonian like the dialogue is used relatively sparingly. A romantic love theme appears throughout the film with different tempi underscoring the different situations and in several scene transitions.The themes of this film are love and the Russian society in the late 19th century. The Lady with the Little Dog is a love story between two people who started in life on the wrong footing for whatever reasons as most of us do. To understand the story we have to speculate as to what had happened to these two characters before the story opens. She is an aristocratic Russian woman and thus was destined to marry for love if she was lucky but most likely without love just to fulfill her role in society to raise a family and be the centerpiece of that family. So Anna followed her destiny. Gurov is an older aristocrat from the big city a wellestablished member of the Moscovite society married with children. He is a man and therefore in relative control of his life and as a man of his time looks down on women but at the same time enjoys their companionship. For that epoch at forty years of age he is at the twilight of his womanizing years.Anna and Gurov meet and start an intimate relationship each for a different reason. Anna wants to escape her boring dreary small town provincial life. To Gurov Anna may represent one of his last chances if not the very last to seduce a young woman who will rejuvenate him invigorate his life. His life is turned upside down as the seducer is himself seduced hoisted upon his own petard. But love does not rescue Anna and Gurov from their stale marriages nor does it improve their lives. Of course divorce at that time and in that society was totally out of the question. At the end of the film nothing is said about their future. It would seem that their relationship may continue with their occasional assignations in seedy hotels a couple caught like a pair of birds of passage. They've been caught and forced into separate cages. Anna. Neither of them is brave or strong enough to fly free It seemed that in a little while a solution would offer itself a new lovely life would begin. Gurov This short story which Heifitz rendered flawlessly on the screen is among Chekhov's most poignant and lyrical.".

She is an aristocratic Russian woman and thus was destined to marry for love if she was lucky but most likely without love just to fulfill her role in society to raise a family and be the centerpiece of that family. So Anna followed her destiny. Gurov is an older aristocrat from the big city a wellestablished member of the Moscovite society married with children. He is a man and therefore in relative control of his life and as a man of his time looks down on women but at the same time enjoys their companionship. For that epoch at forty years of age he is at the twilight of his womanizing years.Anna and Gurov meet and start an intimate relationship each for a different reason. Anna wants to escape her boring dreary small town provincial life. To Gurov Anna may represent one of his last chances if not the very last to seduce a young woman who will rejuvenate him invigorate his life. His life is turned upside down as the seducer is himself seduced hoisted upon his own petard. But love does not rescue Anna and Gurov from their stale marriages nor does it improve their lives. Of course divorce at that time and in that society was totally out of the question. At the end of the film nothing is said about their future. It would seem that their relationship may continue with their occasional assignations in seedy hotels a couple caught like a pair of birds of passage. They've been caught and forced into separate cages. Anna. Neither of them is brave or strong enough to fly free It seemed that in a little while a solution would offer itself a new lovely life would begin. Gurov This short story which Heifitz rendered flawlessly on the screen is among Chekhov's most poignant and lyrical.";

This is why most instances of impossible love are similar to most incidents of unattainable love.The lady with the dog one of the most tender classics of Russian cinema is a film which deals with the theme of impossible love. This Iosif Heifits film describes the tragic tale of Gurov and Anna Sergeyevna who met and fell in love with each other while vacationing at Yalta Russia. It is based on a famous short story by Anton Chekov which also takes into account the realization of the worthlessness of one's existence in an extremely dull milieu. Gurov is an integral part of this milieu which he hates with all his might. The film remains faithful to the spirit of the book as it has added rich visual touches to the narrative which takes into account a highly puritanical Russian society where divorce had not yet made its appearance. The beauty of this film lies in the fact that both writer Anton Chekov and director Iosif Heifits emerge as true chroniclers of malefemale relationships as they emphatically convey that whenever a man makes the first amorous move a woman accepts it only when she is truly interested in getting herself involved in a love affair. Lastly we all know that love is not a child's play and can bring trouble as the viewers watch with astonishment how Anna Sergeyevna express incessantly all unease which she feels whenever she is made conscious of her love affair.".

The story is centered around a married man called Dimitri played by a very powerful Aleksei Batalov who meets a woman called Anna played by Iya Savvina during his holiday in Yaltasouth Russia.This woman walks along the boulevard with a little white dog.This woman is also married and like Dimitri unhappily.They start an affair which cannot last forever but they hang on until Anna decides to go back to St. Petersburg.Dimitri returns to Moscow and stays until he decides to see her once more in St. Petersburg.There the affair goes on and Anna tells Dimitri that she'll come to Moscow once.This will be their last meeting as Dimitri decides that it is not right to go on and leaves Anna behind at the hotel.Like I already saidthe use of black and white is really spectacular in this movie.The acting is of the same quality.Batalov is very convincing as a desolate man whose marriage doesn't work.Savvina resembles quite a lot one of those silent movie actressesespecially with her facial expressions. The best part of the movie though is the sublime score by Nadezhda Simonyan.The music is absolutely brilliant and very romantic at times.There is a great waltz and a beautiful composition when Dimitri and Anna are sitting on a rock looking down at the sea.Stillthe movie is very slow and therefore looks too long while it only lasts 85 minutes.This takes away the strength of the moviewhich is a little bit of a shame.  710".

As such it feels a lot more like a film than a sketch and is the better for it.  The onshore scenes are good and the action on the ship although a little stretched is well delivered and very funny.Laurel and Hardy are of course excellent and it is their delivery that makes the conclusion the live ghost of the title work rather than seeming laboured in terms of plotting.  The support cast is also good and well served.  Rather than being just goons or fall guys the actors all feel like characters  Walter Long as the frustrated captain I heard your ship has a ghost'  stop SAYING that!' was my favourite and gave the film a more rounded feel that went beyond Laurel and Hardy while still keeping them very much at the core.Overall this is an enjoyable film that is an all round showcase for the talents of Laurel and Hardy.

Its a Laurel  Hardy short that certainly does not disappoint.The movie can yet again be divided into two separate parts. In the first part the boys meet up with a ship captain Walter Long who is looking for a crew. He has a hard time finding a crew since the ship he owns is notorious among the sailors and is known to be haunted. The second part of the movie is set on the ship itself. It's the part in which the boys get into some hilarious trouble once more this time with a ghost who of course turns out to be not a real ghost at all.Both parts are different in terms of the humor that is used. But both parts are hilarious in their very own way. The both parts may not really connect with each other which doesn't make this the most consistent Laurel  Hardy shorts ever made but the silly and hilarious humor compensate for this more than enough.Another reason why this movie is better than the average Laurel  Hardy comical shorts is the presence of a couple of Laurel  Hardy regulars. Walter Long is great and bold as always. Arthur Housman does what he can do best playing a drunk and Mea Busch is also present. Here presence might feel a bit out of place and perhaps even unnecessary but she just was a great comical actress who also does provides some good laughs in this movie.The movie does really has some great comical sequences in it mainly when the two boys are being confronted by the 'ghost' and they start running and screaming like a couple of 10year old girls. It helps to make this comical short an highly amusing and memorable one.Good first part and a good second make a good movie overall.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

For it is them who also become familiar to the viewer and therefore form an essential part of their humour in general. Knowing how tough guy Walter Long always is you laugh twice as much at him than usual when you see that he does not care a bit when Stan hits his head with a pan. Another familiar laughing bonus is got from Charlie Hall's sadism and Housman plays again the drunk. Mae West's domina voice always guarantees you a freezing effect down at your stomach.The film itself makes moderate use of the concepts laughter and fear. Hijacking crew into haunted ship is funny in itself too but the Ghost that Stan  Ollie accidentally evoke crowns the whole show. This one definitely belongs into very essential Laurel  Hardy.

Walking along the doc the captain sees Stan and Ollie fishing. They work over at the fish market and today is their day off. The captain asks them if they'd like to make some easy money by way of Shanghaiing him a crew from that tavern a 1.00 a head. Stan and Ollie agree to this bargain and set about their task by having Stan go in with a bag full of eggs daring the men that they can't put one in their mouth without breaking it. They manage to do so but a pop on the chin breaks the egg and the enraged drunk chases Stan outside where Ollie waits with a frying pan to clunk him. The ploy works numerous times giving the captain a hull full of groggy drunks until Ollie decides he should be the one to go in and fish them out. The egg trick doesn't go quite as planned and Stan ends up not only clunking the guy but also Ollie and the captain who then clunks him back. When Stan and Ollie regain consciousness they find themselves shanghaied as well and the crew is acrimonious with them but the captain warns them not to lay a finger on his friends until they go ashore. He also warns the crew to never mention ghosts to him lest he twist their heads around 180 degrees. As a result Stan and Ollie remain on board the ship for the ten times that they dock. The captain orders a drunken sailor to remain on the ship with them but he sneaks off the ship anyway placing a trunk in his bed. When deciding to turn in themselves Stan finds a revolver and it accidentally misfires hitting the trunk. Fearing they've killed the man Stan and Ollie go off to get a sack to throw him off the ship before the others returned. Meanwhile the drunken sailor fell into a vat of whitewash before he staggered back onto the ship and slipped into his bed just as Stan and Ollie slip him into a sack and toss him overboard. Unfortunately the water didn't wash off the whitewash so when he climbed back aboard they assumed he was a ghost and freak out like children. When the captain gets back they tell him of their ghost sighting and he fulfills his earlier promise of twisting their heads from north to south. I wonder if it was the captain's plan all along to shanghai Stan and Ollie even if Stan hadn't clunked him. I'm sure it was as the man seemed pretty underhanded. As far as a critique this one is really good. With Laurel and Hardy you can seldom go wrong. This one is pretty funny and it even has a few creepy moments. Perfect to watch around the Halloween season. Other good spooky Laurel and Hardy shorts include Oliver the Eighth The LaurelHardy Murder Case and Dirty Work which were included with The Live Ghost on a video collection. So I definitely recommend The Live Ghost still a funny romp after 80 years.".

When the angry sailor gives chase Ollie's waiting outside the bar to whack him over the head so that the captain can throw him into the hold of the ship. Of course when Stan and Ollie swap roles Stan gets it all wrong and he and Ollie end up being shanghaied with their victims. Chaplin used a similar idea in one of his silent pictures but once aboard ship this story goes off in a completely different direction with the boys mistaking a drunken shipmate who has fallen into an improbably large tray of white paint for a ghost. The shanghai scenes are the best  after that you get the feeling they're just going through another day at the office. It's not their best work but it'll do.".

Chaplin used a similar idea in one of his silent pictures but once aboard ship this story goes off in a completely different direction with the boys mistaking a drunken shipmate who has fallen into an improbably large tray of white paint for a ghost. The shanghai scenes are the best  after that you get the feeling they're just going through another day at the office. It's not their best work but it'll do.";

The boys throw him off the ship when Stan's examination of a revolver leads to him firing a shot at the man's bunk. Thinking he's dead they throw him overboard and then go into a panic when he comes aboard ship again still appearing like a ghost.It's mercifully a short that doesn't overstay its welcome.

	schema:reviewBody "You may see this LH comedy short at YouTube either in its BW form or colorized form. I found the latter to be unacceptably blurry.. This film relies more on situation comedy and sight gags and less on slapstick and verbal comedy than most of their films........It's about a captainplayed by intimidating Walter Long of a small ship plagued by a reputation for harboring one or more ghosts. For this reason he has to mostly rely on shanghaied sailors. He enlists the aid of Stan and Ollie to round up a new crew. Their technique is to get a particular sailor in a nearby tavern angry enough to chase Stan outside where Ollie is waiting with a frying pan. Stan makes them mad by betting them that they can't hold an egg in their mouth without breaking it. They guess this is an easy task. However Stan then punches them under the chin and usually that's sufficient to break the egg. This trick worked wonderfully for quite a few sailors whom the Captain carried to the ship and tossed in the hold. But Then Ollie feared that Stan was becoming too well known so had then switch roles. On his first try Ollie encounters a problem. The intended victim is wise to the trick and demands that Ollie demonstrate that he can pass the test first. After Ollie inserts the egg this sailor punches his jaw and Ollie has to swallow the broken egg. Ollie then puts another egg in the sailors mouth and punches him along with pushing his head down. He chases Ollie outside but Stan misses few times with the pan then finally hits Ollie followed by the sailor. Meanwhile  the Captain has returned for another victim and the confused Stan bonks him on the head too. But being Walter Long he doesn't seem to feel anything. So he grabs the pan from Stan and bonks him on the head which knocks him out. The Captain takes the boys on board along with the sailor. When the others wake up they want to tear Stan and Ollie apart but the Captain says they are honored guests and he will not stand for any roughing them up unless they utter the word 'ghost' in which case he will screw their necks around so that they will now see what's in back of them. ........The boys share a bunk with a habitual falling down drunkplayed by Arthur Housman. Why the Captain puts up with him is a mystery. At a distant port of call the Captain forbids him to go ashore while all the others except of the boys go to a tavern. The boys are supposed to make sure the drunk doesn't go ashore. But he tricks them by making a dummy placed under his blanket then going ashore. The boys across from his bunk get ready for bed but Stan finds a pistol in their bunk. He points this at Ollie who tries to grab it but makes Stan pull the trigger shooting a bullet into the dummy which flinches. They fear they may have killed the drunk who doesn't move. Thus they plan to dump the body overboard after they find a body bag which they go looking for. Meanwhile the drunk has fallen into a tub of whitewash on shorewhat's it doing there? and comes out all white. He returns dismantles the dummy and pulls the blanket over his head after getting on the bed. The boys return with a bag and carefully load the 'body' in the bag. Presumably the drunk is so out of it he doesn't notice. After adding a big lump of coal for weight they slip the 'body' over the side but don't wait long to make sure it sinks. In fact the drunk emerges from the poorly secured top of the bag and swims to the boat climbing over the railing to scare Stan on deck who assumes it's the ghost of the body they just threw into sea. While Stan and Ollie are looking around the deck for the ghost the drunk goes into the bunk room  and climbs into the upper berth of the boys rather than his lower birth across from them. Ollie returns to the bunk room and gets in bed beside the drunk whose head is covered by the blanket and whom he assumes is Stan. But he sees Stan outside the window and makes a frightening discovery. He jumps out of bed and the 2 run around the deck screaming about a ghost who also jumped out of bed and is chasing them. Meanwhile a bunch of the crew has come board with the purpose of 'taking care' of the boys. Very fortunately for the boys this gang sees the 'ghost' panic and all jump overboard. Then the Captain arrives with a floozyMae Busch he picked up in the tavern. They don't see the drunk as being a ghost. But the floozy recognizes him under the white stuff to be her husband who deserted her. She cases after him. Meanwhile the boys forget that the Captain is present and talk about a ghost. The Captain carries out his threat of punishment if anyone mentioned 'ghost' on his ship........Yes it's a pretty tall tale but it's also fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so I am happy to see any of their films. In a bar a boat Captain Walter Long wants men for his crew but none of them are interested in sailing on a haunted tub. He hires Stan and Ollie to help recruit some men by tricking them to run outside with the egg breaking in mouth trick and get clunked on the head by a pan and the boys end up getting themselves clunked too. The Captain warns all the crew to not mention ghosts to him or he'll twist those who say its heads right round and this day the crew go ashore to have a break. The boys stay aboard to keep an eye on the Drunken sailor Arthur Housman who manages to sneak off leaving some suitcases under a bed cover as a decoy. Stan finds a gun in the room and accidentally shoots the wall causing the suitcases to move they think they have killed the guy so they go to get a body bag to throw him overboard. The Drunk walking back to the boat falls into a pit of white paint and after moving the suitcases and going back under his cover the boys throw him overboard. He swims out and climbs back on board and covered in white Stan screams thinking he is a ghost. When Ollie with Stan following go to investigate the Drunk gets onto the top bunk and when Ollie is sure he is talking to Stan they both see the white covered guy come out and they run screaming. The crew return wanting to get even with the boys but they end up jumping overboard seeing the white Drunk only the Captain and the Drunk's wife Maisie the Vamp Blonde Floozy Mae Busch recognise. The film ends with the Captain twisting the boys' heads round to their backs when they mention the word ghost to him. Also starring Charlie Hall as Sailor at Table and Leo Willis as Sailor at Table. Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian and Well here's another nice mess you've gotten me into! was number 60 on 100 Years 100 Quotes. Good!".

	schema:reviewBody "BachehaYe aseman Children of HeavenIt was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player  it was after all my first venture into Iranian cinema so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to and for the most part enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...This film is played with such beauty and innocence it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film we see the relationship between brother and sister played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face and Zahra's tears at the news are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure albeit not an easy one.We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict but it is also evident he loves his son dearly and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heartwarming and totally believable. Cycling through the city it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones into rural areas where houses with swimming pools ornate architecture and luxury are rife.There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure blowing bubbles swinging on swings with his new found friend the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth as Ali races through the streets the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head and on screen while at the same time parents of other children film the race on camcorders all the time Ali running fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.The film is directed perfectly and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.The film is not dialogue intensive and one could easily watch the film and understand the story even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers since they are not overly crucial to the film this is a story of true innocence and tugs hard at the heartstrings sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle warm and absolutely believable and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out but ultimately worth every second.Missing this film particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film it is an experience and one that is completely passionate and totally unforgettable.I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS  rent it borrow it or buy it  you will be glad that you did!Reviewed by Ollie".

	schema:reviewBody "The wonderful Iranian film Children of Heaven and its companion piece The White Balloon remind one of those great Czechoslovakian films of the 1960's The Shop on Main Street Loves of a Blonde etc. in that they achieve their artistry by providing keenly observed glimpses into the minutiae of everyday life. They also help to humanize a culture often regarded as alien and even incomprehensible to western eyes. Above all this magnificent film reminds us that real drama comes not in the form of overplotted special effectsladen extravaganzas but from films that examine the universal simplicities of life as we all know it. When it is distilled through the eyes of a poet  this is when art is achieved.Children of Heaven has its roots planted firmly in the neorealist tradition. Its simple story echoes not merely the earlier The White Balloon but the original Italian classic The Bicycle Thief. In this film young Ali accidentally loses his sister's recently mended shoes out of this tale of utmost simplicity the filmmakers take us on a fascinating tour of life in a typical Iranian village and family. As Ali and his sister scheme to overcome this obstacle the film touches on any number of universal themes the close ties of siblings united in their common bond of avoiding often irrational parental anger well meaning loving parents overwhelmed with the trials of everyday life who are often compelled to act out in ways that seem cruel to the children who adore them the petty viciousness with which children often strike out at each other yet at the same time the often unexpected kindness and empathy with which they also treat one another. The film manages to keep the audience constantly engrossed in its action without once resorting to even a smidgen of incredibility or melodrama. Beautifully directed with a superb soundtrack filled with heightened naturalistic noises it is a film of manysplendored wonders its lyricism caught in a glimpse of soap bubbles floating around a backyard produced by two children abandoned to their moment of incomprehensible youthful joy its high drama found in a shoe racing down a city sewer with a desperate young girl in tow.The actors children and adults alike underplay their roles in so naturalistic a fashion that one does not even feel they are performing at all the film through them becomes a magical fabric of life that draws the audience deep into its world.Children of Heaven brilliantly demonstrates that works of art often arise from the observation of the most seemingly mundane concerns of daily life and reminds us that this provides far more drama than all the exploding spaceships car chases and hyperkinetic melodrama that flood the screen in the guise of entertainment. It certainly shows just how phony empty and bereft of life most American films are. Don't miss Children of Heaven! It is a richly rewarding experience.".

How the little sister had no confidence in her brothers shoes was shown in such a warm and effective way. The ultimate despair Ali felt when he won was also so heartbreaking. Ali and his sister are both so cute and they can really act. This film can easily move one to tears. Do watch it!".

Every single scene is inundated with sweetness and the innocence of children. How they share one pair of shoes was amazing...and heartbreaking. How the little sister had no confidence in her brothers shoes was shown in such a warm and effective way. The ultimate despair Ali felt when he won was also so heartbreaking. Ali and his sister are both so cute and they can really act. This film can easily move one to tears. Do watch it!";

CALI COLOMBIA and ORLANDO FL It's easy to understand why there are over 100 reviews of Children of Heaven. Normally that simple fact would have dissuaded me from adding a review of my own. But as I'm sure others have felt this film so overwhelmed me with joy I feel obligated to share my feelings with all who would listen! After watching Children it occurred to me that I have perhaps never seen an Iranian film I didn't like. This film celebrates the essence and innocence of youth with an unencumbered intensity with such unpretentious panache that any comparison to American films that make an effort along similar lines regrettably seem rather empty almost laughable in comparison. The fierce sibling rivalry so familiar in the majority of American movies is replaced here by a warm caring fraternal relationship based on love consideration selfsacrifice and mutual respect. These little Muslim children demonstrate the most exemplary of true Christian behavior in both word and deed. I hope that here in America this opinion can be stated clearly in a review such as this one without fear of provoking a mindless outpouring of reactionary negative clicks. I feel more than a tinge of remorse even embarrassment when I think of the millions of Iranians who see far too many American films where children are portrayed more often than not as selfish wisecracking foulmouthed bullying disrespectful totally inconsiderate little brats. To make matters worse this abhorrent behavior is too often viewed as copacetic or worse even exemplary something that kids today often strive to imitate. Some have commented that Children seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging in midair. All I can say to them is just reflect carefully for a moment on the value systems of the kids in the movie...maybe then you will be able to feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience.10....ENJOYDISFRUTELA!Any comments questions or observations in English or Espaol are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPastoYahoo.com".

We catch a smile here and there e.g. when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.This is an absolute gem of a family value film.

Foreign films are usually thought to appeal to only a sophisticated and cultured audience but Children of Heaven is best suited for all audiences. Forget that this film is set in a foreign land with an unfamiliar culture. Forget that the script is written in a language that you can't understand. These elements are only a small part of the story that will whisk you away and get you lost in the simplicity of the plot. Children of Heaven follows the story of Ali and Zahra and their conquest to find a lost pair of shoes. In an attempt to hide the lost shoes from their parents the brother and sister duo decide to share one beat up pair of sneakers. This films gives an inside view of the life of a poor Iranian family and the innocence of young children. Children of Heaven opens your eyes to culture different from your own. A culture very much stereotyped because of its common appearance in American newsstands. Children of Heaven tells a story never broadcasted in the media. It can help to show the similarities and differences between American and Iranian culture. Our similarities are more than your local news lets on. We both share a class system which separates the rich from the poor. We both share the importance of family relationships and religion. We often forget that people all over the world endure our same trials and triumphs. Children of Heaven forces its audience to examine their own lives. As Americans we wonder how children with so little can be content? We wonder what it means to live simply. This film reminds us to be thankful and not value our material possessions. It also reminds us the importance of strong family relationships. Next time you contemplate viewing a foreign film think of all the benefits. Viewing foreign films exposes you to new and different cultures languages music and landscapes. It can contradict stereotypes and biases conjured up by news reports. You will become more respectful to those with values and morals that differ from your own. Foreign films encourage you to explore new places and create appreciations for the benefits that your own culture has to offer you. WARNING Children of Heaven may cause a new outlook on life. You will leave this film a little happier and more appreciative. Now don't say I didn't warn you.".

Note Films that have a universal appeal aren't necessarily better than films that only appeal to people from one or two countries but making a film with a universal appeal is no easy task. A boy named Ali Amir Farrokh Hashemian loses his sister Zahra's Bahare Seddiqi running shoes Zahra threatens to tell their father Mohammad Amir Naji. Petrified at his father's temper Ali promises his sister that he will get his sister some new shoes as soon as possible. In the meantime the two work out a tight shoeswitching schedule. The plot is inventive and provides some decent chucklesgood writing and comic timing. Hashemian is likable and relatable though he milks the babyish whimpering to an annoying extent. Naji is able to give us a stronger feeling that we are watching a real person on screen than any of the other actors in the film. It is not until the last ten minutes of the film however that we are swept up in a crazy whirlwind of emotion jolting from despair to joy to suspense though not in that order and the last ten minutes can make a movie great. Majidi gives us homage to The Four Hundred Blows. The ending to Majidi's movie is somewhat similar to that of Francois Truffaut's both movies contain the feeling of extreme desperation but Ali has a goal in his life while Antoine Doinel JeanPierre Laud is boldly going nowhere. Truffaut's film concludes with brilliant ambiguity leaving us wondering whether Doinel's last five minutes on screen were triumphant or pathetic Majidi does something quite similar less ambitiously in a way I would not dream of revealing.".

It is a children movie which will be equally enjoyed by adults and that's simply because it will take any adult back to their childhood days back to the days when they did something wrong and were afraid to confess to their parents. The film was made with great simplicity and soul and its impact is perfectly made through the characters of Ali and Zahra two amazing kids who can set an example to anyone. Majidi brilliantly captures the world of these young goldenhearted creatures. They are smart intelligent innocent respectful and caring. It's quite impressive to see how little kids pay respect to their seniors what moral values they have and their tender care for their parents' economic status and daily struggle is particularly moving. More than anything it is their own sibling relationship which tugs at the heartstrings. Majidi's portrayal of the neighbourhood the school where the kids study and their own home is most lifelike and authentic. Without a doubt the script is the film's main winner but the casting is one of the film's biggest strengths. Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi are astonishing in their roles  charming convincing heartbreaking and totally relatable. You really feel for these kids and really want to settle their problems so that they can move on. This film is a true example of superb acting by child artists and it shows how far they can go in their ability to explore the innocent spirit of childhood. BachehaYe Aseman is a wonderful cinematic experience which must not be missed by anyone. Just go and grab your seat I assure it will keep you on the edge of it for one hour and a half and will be engraved in your heart long afterwards.".

This film is a true example of superb acting by child artists and it shows how far they can go in their ability to explore the innocent spirit of childhood. BachehaYe Aseman is a wonderful cinematic experience which must not be missed by anyone. Just go and grab your seat I assure it will keep you on the edge of it for one hour and a half and will be engraved in your heart long afterwards.";

	schema:reviewBody "Children of Heaven which is Iran's selection for best foreign film at the Academy Awards is a very good movie mainly because anyone in this world can relate to the topic of family and showing love to each other no matter the living circumstances. As an Iranian film it is definitely played safe but a film with such an universal theme and elegantly told as here should really not be missed especially by movielovers.Majid Majidi's film is about a young boy named Ali who accidentally lost his sister Zahra's shoes. But their family can ill afford to buy new shoes Ali decides to share his shoes with his sister until he can get new ones for her and so he can avoid punishment.The acting is pretty good and pretty heartfelt. There is no questioning the chemistry between Amir Farrokh Hashemian as Ali and Bahare Seddiqi as Zahra. Reza Naji who plays as their father is also good as the man who is trying to do all he can to provide food for his family.Overall Children of Heaven is a simple film but it displays a strong message about the bond of family. There are some talented films from the Middle East and this is one of them. It's a strong film about courage and about doing what's right. My favorite scene is where the father and the son leave their poor slums as they head uptown to the rich neighborhoods. This film shows how American kids are vastly different than kids from these parts of the world.....and not exactly in a good way. This film is a little too simple for me but there is no denying how powerful this film is. I rate this film 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite movies is Children of Heaven written and directed by Majid Majidi an Iranian film from 1997.  The film industry in Iran is very different from the industry in America.  In this film you will not find any special effects marketing tactics or expensive sets.  The movie is told in a very simple real fashion using camera work acting and real life streets and scenery giving the film a realistic documentary feel.  This characteristic of Iranian film draws us in to the story and gives us the ability to relate closely with the children in a way American films does not.  The approach gives the film an honest character and believable reality. This subtitled film humanizes Iran for the American viewer.  You realize that people are people no mater where they live all have the same feelings and emotions.    Ali The story is told through the children and their experiences.  Children of Heaven takes you into the hearts and lives of a young boy Ali played by Amir Farrokh Hashemian and his sister Zhara played by Bahare Sediqi capturing the life of a family living in poverty in Iran.  After watching this movie seeing a story where a pair of lost shoes can be so important you realize that we are very lucky to live in a time and country where most people never go without such basic items as shoes.  This film shows us a place where people may not have much but they have what they need most of all each other.  The family bond is strong that can often be lost in the fast paced and transient society that America tends to be.  The father works hard but is basically unskilled.  He also has the burden of is caring for a sick wife and a baby as well.  The children have to help out in many ways which further bonds the family.  The family lives in a small apartment with only one room. The movie begins as 9yearold Ali goes out on errands one of which is taking his sisters shoes to be repaired.  The shoes are very worn but are mended.  Afterwards he stops to buy some potatoes at the market leaving the shoes and some other parcels at the front of the store.  While Ali is in the store a scrap collector comes along and takes the shoes along with the other bags he collects there.  When Ali comes out he finds the shoes missing. He frantically searches the fruit stand boxes knocking down several in the process and the storekeeper chases him away.  He has a difficult and tearful time telling his sister about the shoes being lost.  When Zhara realizes that they are truly gone she wonders what she will wear to school. Ali knows that his family cannot afford to buy her shoes and pleads with her to keep this a secret between then. Ali devises a plan and convinces Zhara to go along with it because their parents could not afford shoes at this time and it would only be a burden to tell them of the loss.  Ali talks Zhara into sharing his shoes with Zhara wearing them to her school in the mornings and Ali the afternoons to his. Zhara is skeptical but agrees and suggests that they clean the dirty sneakers.  The kids find laughter in this experience as they play with soap bubbles and wash the shoes together.     When it rains that night Zhara wakes Ali who goes out in the rainstorm to move the shoes to a dry spot. We are hopeful that the plan will work out but there is not enough time to make the switch without Ali being late to school each day.  Ali runs quickly to school and makes the best of the situation.  One social difference that you learn about in the film is the schooling where the boys and girls are in separate schools.  The schools are very regimented teach discipline and gender roles to the children.  The students do not speak to adults without raising their hands and waiting for permission. In once scene you see how the family interacts and the honesty that is taught in the home.  The father is working for the mosque breaking up a large piece of sugar into small lumps with a hand tool to be used for the tea at the prayer meeting.  As they prepare to have tea at home they realize that there is no sugar but the father will not allow them to use even a small piece because the sugar does not belong to them it belongs to the mosque.  This takes a lot of character when you are faced with doing without and you have so much temptation right in front of you.  However for them there is no question you exercise selfcontrol and honesty.In one scene the gravity of the situation continues to build its emotional picture when Zhara loses one of the sneakers in the gutter on her way home from school.  She runs down the street desperate to catch the shoe.  It was very distressful when she sat crying near where the shoe finally stopped but remained out of reach in a covered section of the gutter.  Fortunately a compassionate storekeeper helps Zhara retrieve the shoe and returns it to Zhara.  She doesn't have much time to explain as Ali rushes to put on the shoes one wet and one dry and runs off to his own classes.Ali and Zhara are very touching as they support each other through the adventures with the sneakers.  There are several moments of humor as well making this movie both sad and funny. Although Ali and Zhara are young they understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of not burdening the parents since they are already behind in rent and bills.  The children take on the burden of the lost shoes so that their parents won't have to deal with one more problem. Ali truly wants to make it up to Zhara for losing her shoes.  He gave her a pen he won for academic achievement a simple gift that although insignificant to you and I is a generous and much appreciated gift between Ali and Zhara.  Ali tells Zhara about the opportunity to run in a race to win a pair of sneakers.  He promises Zhara he will win the sneakers for her. She is pleased and touched as Ali assures her he can win the shoes for her. The smile on her face is brilliant.  Ali is a fast runner and feels that he can win.  He has a tearful meeting with the coach and tries to convince him to try him out for the race.  Although he has missed the deadline the coach decides to allow him to race after he sees how fast he can run.Zhara sees a young girl in the school yard wearing her missing shoes she befriends the girl after she and Ali follow her home and they see that she has a blind father they realize that she needs them as much as they do. Zhara is reassured of the girls' honesty when she returns Zhara's pen the gift from Ali to her after she saw Zhara drop it in the street.The race scene is suspenseful as we run along with Ali.  As he runs he envisions his sister going to school in his old shoes.  Ali is ahead in the race although he is running in the same worn shoes that he shares with Zhara each day.  Ali finds himself in 1st place as he comes toward the finish line.  He slows down and lets runners pass him by but finds that he is now in 4th place.  He struggles to regain his position and fate steps in again causing Ali to finish in 1st place.  Ali cries because h has not won the shoes for Zhara.    Everyone is a little shocked that he is not excited to win 1st place with the prizes that it brings.  However we know that although he wins the race he lost the prize.  In his heart he has lost so much he will continue to carry the burden until Zhara has shoes again.At home Ali soaks his sore and blistered feet in a fountain as gold fish swim around.  Fortunately the children are not to be burdened for much longer in the final scene we watch the father buying shoes for Zhara and Ali with money he eared doing side work as a gardener on the rich side of town.  My only disappointment is that we don't get to watch them receive the valuable gifts. This movie shows the simple unquestioned love between a brother and sister. Instead of the lost shoes coming between them they make the best of it and become closer by working things out together. You are taken back to the purity and innocence of your childhood through Ali and Zhara.  This movie is about much more than a lost pair of shoes it is about how a family is defined by the things that they do and how they treat each other.  Their actions and their decisions make them who they are.  Those that try to do right by others and care about people will be rewarded in the end just not always in the way you expect you can.  Its not always in your control.".

The storyline may be simple and you may think that you may not have anything to cheer about or feel angry about believe me when I say this movie will make you feel a variety of emotions from shocked to sad to happiness to disappointment. I credit all that to the simple yet extremely powerful story the excellent direction and the magnificent charisma of the two young leads. They shone and they will draw you into the story. My most favorite scene for this movie is the marathon scene. The fact that Ali had to beg and cried to get a place in the running team was heart wrenching and when the camera focused on Ali running we will cheer and cheer him on when he fell back. There was total silence except for his sister's voice of blaming him for losing her shoes and as he ran he kept seeing his little sister carrying her schoolbag running and running to rush him his pair of shoes so that he can go to school was sad. And he ran and ran and realized he was going to get first place and I screamed Don't! 3rd place Ali! and Ali ran a little slower and counted one two and he was third until one young man passed him and he was fourth and he ran harder and harder without thinking. In the end he won 1st place and got a free trip and his coach was overjoyed. But the tired Ali was silent and he was crying before the cameras. And when he went home he couldn't say a word and his sister knew there was no shoes and she walked away disappointed and Ali sat by the fountain with the goldfish in the pond nibbling at his blistered feet and he felt he had let his beloved sister down. That was the ending but we all knew it will be a happy ending when his father comes home with the new pair of shoes for both of them. And this was the success of this movie you felt like you were Ali or Zahra and you will feel deeply for these characters.1010. The best foreign language movie I have ever seen on any subject which I feel justifies the full marks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Majid Majidi's CHILDREN OF HEAVEN 2002 exists in radical opposition to various media representations of Iran Western viewers are most familiar with. Subversive politics oil female repression terrorism and hostageholding irrational crazy people are not displayed in the film images that pop into the average consciousness of a Westerner i.e. the masses when thinking of Iran. Quite the opposite is displayed alongside refreshing realizations that Iran is not entirely what Western media organizations have etched into the collective Western social unconscious. The value of Majidi's film for such Western viewers is its assistance in the mental decolonization process that might enable viewers to experience Iran absent from damaging Eurocentric stereotypes.CHILDREN OF HEAVEN is a beautifully simple film. Given the main characters are children the film is set up from their perspective. Alongside Majidi's covert filming technique using hidden cameras to bring out the highest possible realism from his actors the children are in an impoverished situation with the burden of acute familial responsibility that prematurely matures them. These children although improvised are not miserable as various media would suggest but happy and contented. The narrative circles around a pair of lost shoes and the strive to attain a new pair that are sought not out of a materialistic need but a fundamental need reflectant of the culture's attitude towards possessions an attitude different from the goals and desires of the spoiled obscene American brat of Hollywood. Although the spoiled obscene American brat might likewise be a stereotypical representation within the context of discussing representations it is significant to discern the contrast.Ella Shohat and Robert Stam note in UNTHINKING EUROCENTRISM that Eurocentrism or the belief in the supremacy of European culture and values whilst demonizing nonEuropean or nonWestern cultures and values as subservient is endemic in presentday thought and education and is naturalized as 'common sense.' From this limited perspective it is common sense to believe that people of the Middle East a Eurocentric term are suffering crawling through the dirt looking for the remnants of their families that had been blown to bits in a terrorist attack as a bloodstained Koran looms in the background. One might not venture too far from a film such as THE EXORCIST William Friedkin 1973 where a demonic spirit spawns from an archaeological dig site in the Middle East possesses a white American girl then is repressed and conquered by means of a Catholic priest to understand Eurocentric representations in Western culture and view the Middle East as mystical evil and worthy of fear.What is scary though as Shohat and Stam note these sentiments are accepted and normalized etched into the fabric of the social unconscious. Just as the sky is blue and the grass is green Eurocentricism elicits normalized depictions of Iran or other countries in the Middle East as a nation that births evil terrorists. But Ali and Zhara the children of CHILDREN OF HEAVEN are anything but evil  they are rather transcendent of Heaven. This is brought to fruition at the end of the film in the famous scene of the goldfish kissing Ali's feet in the circular communal pool in his village. Quite the opposite of a destroyer of peace Ali IS peace.This goldfish image serves as a powerful device within the narrative but more importantly for Western viewers serves in the mental decolonization process a process that must be engaged to replace negative perceptions of a culture with truer renderings. The goldfish leaves viewers in an extremely calm space almost meditative a malleable ending hinting that there is much more to Iranian culture versus the ugliness presented via various media  there is even beauty emotion and harmony. Such intense emotion yields great enjoyment and in CHILDREN OF HEAVEN great enjoyment and liberation is gleaned for the sake of a culture previously thought of as demonic and regressive.While it is true Iran like any country has issues it is important to remember these issues do not encompass the entirety of Iranian culture. When viewers focus only on what is bad the beauty and value of Iran is forgotten submerged beneath much negativity as unthinking Eurocentric beliefs are perpetuated and passed down to subsequent generations. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN reminds viewers of the unthinking thoughtprocess Western minds so willingly accept  the film helps humans realize there that the talking heads on their television sets might not be representative of absolute truth.Shohat Ella  Stam Robert.

	schema:headline " The Simple Things in Life";
	schema:reviewBody "When I had heard that we were going to be watching an Iranian film in class I was a bit apprehensive. I have experienced very little exposure to foreign films and was instantly put off by the subtitles. My trepidation was further reinforced when I was told to pay close attention to the pair of shoes in the beginning of the movie because they were a very integral part of the film. I couldn't imagine how something as trivial as a pair of shoes could keep me interested throughout the entire story. However I am very happy to say that I was wrong in my preconceived notions. This film made me realize that the simple things in life truly are the most important.The characters that were chosen for this film were not real actors. This choice helped to make the film appear real and keep it from becoming sensationalized because of the actors. The sets that were chosen helped to contrast the poor area of Iran and the more modernized and wealthy area that Ali and his father visited in search of work. An interview that I came across that Ross Anthony from Hollywood Report Card gave to Majid Majidi stated that the cameras used in the film were hidden even from the actors. This allowed for a more natural feel as well as decreased the inexperienced actor's apprehensions.The surface theme of Children of Heaven is about Ali losing his younger sister Zahra's shoes and trying to make things right without the help of his parents. The family is extremely poor and Ali knows that his father is not in any position to buy another pair of shoes for Zahra. When looking further into this theme I am amazed at the cultural differences in Middle Eastern and American lifestyles. I have no doubt that there are families in America facing extreme economic hardships that experience some of the sacrifices shown in this film. However the United States is overall very materialistic and it is not often that we are exposed to families especially children that are willing to make the sacrifices that the characters of this film made. Ali wanted to take direct responsibility for his sister and felt genuine remorse for the loss of her shoes. In most American films the audience would be turned off by the main character especially a boy crying so often throughout the movie. In this case Ali's love for his family is prevalent throughout the film and his strong emotions come across very heartfelt and sincere.In American films the extremity of violence and other shock factors has become necessary in order to appeal to a desensitized audience. However the simplicity of Children of Heaven had an ironically similar effect. In our society we often lose sight of the little things in life and base our happiness around the cost and quantity of what we have. This film made me experience more emotions than many American films that I have seen. The importance of the Muslim's belief in the will of Allah impacted the way that the characters interacted and handled their disappointments. In American society we tend to blame others for their misfortunes and expect them to be accountable for their own suffering. In contrast Muslims believe that everything that they experience is what God has intended. In that way suffering and misfortune take on very different meanings because despite your disadvantages you are coming closer to God by following his will.Another difference in the cultural influences of this film is the importance of winning. In America winning is everything and under no circumstances should you ever be content with losing. However when Ali won the race he was completely disappointed that he had not finished third. Although the reason for his being upset is because he wanted to win the shoes for Zahra for most Americans no circumstances would justify not wanting to come in first place. A large reason for this difference is again the importance of the will of God in the Muslim religion. I was extremely impressed with Children of Heaven and moved by the simplistic and powerful effect the film had on me. The idea that more is always better is proved wrong by this film and the impact that it has made on so many viewers. The extremely low cost of the film the inexperienced actors and the lack of technological advancements and images gives the wrong impression about the quality of the film. In fact the success of this film shows that the simple things in life are often more important.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally I've gotten my hands on a copy of Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven not illegally of course but from the library's collection and have set aside some time to viewing this much talked about masterpiece. And I couldn't agree more that the film is of great quality. I've often selected titles for my pop to view since he's retired and have gotten a call from him during a working day that I MUST watch this film. Of course I had to clarify that Jack Neo's Homerun is an adaptation of it given that he found some similarities in plot but I must say any movie is worth its salt if it can move my pops.There are so many things I like about Children of Heaven and basically the children Ali Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Zahra Bahare Seddiqi who play the siblings will definitely tug at your heartstrings with their innocence. The story goes that Ali happened to lose his sister's shoes during an errand run and coming from a poor family that spells disaster. Not wanting to be punished for it given that both understand the predicament they're in and not wanting to trouble their parents with yet another expenditure they devise an ingenious somewhat mad hat plan to share their shoes  Zahra goes to school in Ali's before running back to exchange them so that Ali could attend his classes. And this leads to many comical moments and accidental scenes that will surely make you go awww culminating in an exhilarating foot race which will put you on the edge of your seat.But the skill here that Majid Majidi possess is not to sledgehammer these emotions down your throat. Children of Heaven doesn't need to but has in itself this magic that comes forth through its simple yet meaningful story and through the strength of both children's acting. I was pretty amazed that both Amir and Bahare have this very charming and natural charisma in fleshing out their characters their banter being excellent and at times without a need for words. Truly they are the stars of this film and their abilities will put some established big name actors to shame too. Majid Majidi has created characters that endear but yet not out ofreach fictional as they are easily identifiable given that hey these are the kind of sibling love or blood being thicker than water that almost everyone would have experience or heard about.Being my first Majid Majidi movie I'm definitely piqued to want to watch a whole lot more of his films. The movie has superb production values and like any other foreign movie opened my eyes to the cultural and physical landscapes of countries that I've yet to visit. What I liked about it also is its showcase of the family how both Ali and Zahra show this strength in maturity with their helping around the house and being sensible wellliked kids. It justifies the number of awards that it has won in festivals everywhere and if you haven't watch this please do. It's definitely highly recommended stuff!".

And Hollywood beware because Asians can tell stories like no one else in the world. The movie is gripping throughout especially the last 15 minutes.

No background music no special effects but you could still feel the excitement and anxiety of Ali running for the cause. At that moment I realized they truly are the Children of Haven. Its amazing how two of the most beautiful foreign films of all times got nominated for Academy in the same year and eventually Life is Beautiful got the reward.

	schema:headline " Three Phenomenal Actors Give The Performances Of A Life Time";
	schema:reviewBody "Six years ago a director by the name of Curtis Hansen came out with a small time film named L.A. Confidential. Though the movie garnered several big nominations at the 1997 Academy Awards the nation had been swept up by the gigantic and romantic blockbuster Titanic thus shrinking the chances of this brilliant movie from garnering any real awards. 1997 completely screwed this phenomenal film in which three brilliant actors gave the performances of their careers.Russell Crowe plays Detective Bud White a tough L.A. cop who bends the rules in order to bring justice to the city. He is ruthless and unforgiving of anyone which brings him into direct conflict with Detective Lieutenant Ed Exley played by Guy Pearce. Russell Crowe became with this role a full pledged character actor the cop with a steel physique and a vulnerable heart. He becomes so believable and real to the audience you can not help but sympathize for his character under the circumstances.  From this role Crowe went on to garner three best actor nominations winning for his role in Gladiator.Guy Pearce the little known Australian body builder became the character known as Ed Exley a straight uptight detective trying to live up to the legend his father created before him. Exley has so much to prove to the LAPD trying to show them that he is just as good maybe even better than his father. He plays the politics in a corrupted police department very well and is able to use these skills in solving the corrupt and mysterious case of the Night Owl murders. This film officially put Guy Pearce in the big leagues of film making his next appearances in Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. He is a severely underrated actor who deserves better than what he has been getting.Finally the ever wonderful Kevin Spacey. Spacey plays Lieutenant Jack Vincenes a cop who gives a popular LA police show Badge of Honor real solved cases in return for money. Jack sees his life as an ever going soap opera until he comes across a case that somehow has a connection to the Night Owl murders. Kevin Spacey has proved time and again his abilities as an actor and he continues with this performance. Curtis Hansen does a wonderful job bringing this story to the big screen. His talents although recognized have not been awarded as of yet. I can only hope that someday someone will give this amazing director something worthy of his talents. Highly Recommended. MJR".

	schema:reviewBody "L.A. Confidential is without a doubt the best film of the 1990s and quite possibly one of the best films ever made.As with any great film it all starts with the writing.  The story is riveting the dialogue is smart and quite funny and the characters are written in three dimensions.The acting is phenomenal.  Perhaps a bigger tragedy than L.A. Confidential's loss to Titanic in the Best Picture race is that none of the three lead actors even garnered nominations.  Russell Crowe Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are absolutely phenomenal it is their characters that drive this fascinating story about police corruption in 1950s Los Angeles.  We get to know these people to understand who they are and why they do what they do and to root for them to overcome their imperfections.The directing is fantastic.  Curtis Hanson doesn't shove anything in the audience's face instead he allows the audience to discover the film's nuances on their own.  That makes this an excellent film for repeat viewings you truly catch something new every time.  1950s Los Angeles is reproduced beautifully.  The editing is quick and seamless the music is perfect for the film Hanson should teach other directors how to do a montage effectively and the cinematography is great.I can't find a negative thing to say about this film.  It's truly a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Give a collection of great actors a great story to work with and you are likely to end up with something rather special. Such is the case with L.A. Confidential. The boldface names jump off the page...Kevin Spacey Russell Crowe Kim Basinger Danny DeVito James Cromwell and in his first bigtime role Guy Pearce. And none of these big names are just mailing it in here to collect a paycheck. They're all on top of their games undoubtedly helped to no small extent by the wonderfully nuanced and utterly intriguing story.This story takes place in 1950s Los Angeles but this is a side of L.A. most people don't get to see. Behind all the Hollywood glamour L.A. has a seamy side which will be the focus of this tale. At the heart of the movie are three cops who ostensibly are supposed to be working together but who go about the business of dispensing justice in very different ways. Crowe plays aggressive hothead Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes who takes more pride in his work as an adviser on a popular television cop drama than he does in his actual police work. And Pearce plays Edmund Exley a young upandcomer in the department who plays things by the book. As we will soon see Exley is rather unique in an LAPD which believes in doing whatever is necessary to bring the guilty to justice. Even if it means becoming a little guilty themselves.The movie really begins to move forward with a massacre at a coffee shop. It seems a pretty cut and dried case but initial appearances can be deceiving. Soon White Vincennes and Exley will find themselves caught up in a maze of lies deception and mystery. It will be a great test for these very different men as it appears they may well need each other's unique talents to solve this puzzle. And quite the elaborate puzzle it is. One important piece is Lynn Bracken a high class call girl played by Basinger. Tying together many of this complex story's strands is gossip writer Sid Hudgens who is played with appropriate sleaziness by DeVito. And in the background the whole time is the somewhat mysterious Captain Dudley Smith played by Cromwell. Here is a man who believes in bringing the guilty to justice by any means necessary. That's all well and good if you know who the guilty are but in L.A. Confidential you're never quite sure who to believe. The viewer is guessing right along with the investigators on the screen. And in the end it all comes together and pays off brilliantly.L.A. Confidential is first and foremost a great story with many fascinating twists and turns along the way. The film also serves as a showcase for some of this generation's finest acting talents. Each of the main characters is wonderfully unique and each of the actors involved does a terrific job in bringing those characters to life. These are complex characters in a complex tale. It's so involved that the acting had to be stellar if this film was going to work and none of the stars disappoint. Terrific storytelling brought to life by a collection of inspired performances makes L.A. Confidential an absolute winner.".

When you look back at it and see that Russell Crowe Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce actually appeared in the same film back in 97 then you wouldn't have believed it since they have all gone on to better things but before that we had L.A. Confidential which was Crowe's and Pearce's ticket into Hollywood. Spacey had already made it with his Best Supporting Actor nod for The Usual Suspects but what puzzles me is how everybody apart from Kim Basinger didn't get any acting nominations at the Oscars.   James Cromwell is the most chilled out villain you'll ever going to see in a film like this and has been criminally ignored by the Academy.   Curtis Hanson was also someone who had made some good films but no masterpieces till this came along.  They all must have sold their souls to make this because when you get big cast get together to make a Hollywood film then you become a bit intrigued by it because if the cast is big then is the story any good?  In L.A. Confidential's case it had both and a lot more to say the least.I still think that this is Spacey's Crowe's and Pearce's best film of there career.  Russell Crowe as tough guy but sentimental towards women Bud White is flawless and is quite like the real Russell Crowe which is scary.  Guy Pearce as the quick witted but dumb looking Ed Exley is someone one you either love or you hate as the annoying rookie.   Kevin Spacey is just as cool as anything that Bogart and Mitchium could have pulled off as Jack Vincennes and there is the movie along with a great script by Brain Heagland of Mystic River fame and Curtis Hanson himself who put together a great script from James Elroy's novel.    Kim Basinger is as sexy as she is going to get and her acting is very good and well deserving of her Oscar if the boys were robbed.   I liked how we had three different stories and one case that all had something to do with another but were all separate anyway till the end.   It was like watching a movie with three stories based on a trio of detectives.   L.A. Confidential was a treat as far as storytelling goes because it enthrals you into the film straight away as well as it being more exciting than a night out in Vegas.We don't see Detective films like this so we should be grateful that this came along when it did.".

	schema:reviewBody "L.A. Confidential most likely falls into the category of one of the best movies of the past twenty years. The complex story line seemed to burst at the seams with intelligence.  I found the complexity of several different subplots working together challenged the intellectual part of my brain while the intense action through out the entire movie satisfied the craving of the notsointellectual part of my brain that enjoys seeing a good brawl followed by a good shootout.  Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson did and excellent job of combining many elements of several different kinds of films into one.  They seem to have made this movie with several different audiences in mind.  I for one as I have mentioned enjoyed the intellectual aspect as well as the action while my wife enjoyed the combination of a love story with drama.  It really has something for everyone.  Bringing together all of these elements into one film sets it apart from many others. Of course the best aspect of L.A. Confidential is the way that not everything is as it seems and then in an instant all of the plots are sprung like a trap and come together for a grand finale.  Overall L.A. Confidential is an exceptional film that contains something for everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a film evokes an era as well as L.A. Confidential does people take notice. It could be argued that it is easier to replicate the recent past than the distant on film  and in a sense this is true. Costumes language and the necessary absence of the modern in period pieces make them expensive and difficult to film. But couldn't it be argued that it is just as difficult to make a film about more recent periods? I have no knowledge of how a Victorian era table was set or what a knight really spoke like we are subject to the directors view of reality. But what if a good deal of your audience lived through the time you are portraying as in the case of the 1950's? I can even envision my grandfather coming back from WW2 to a booming economy and living in the world Curtis Hanson created.The real genus of this film is that it creates not only a physical world but one with all the politics corruption racism and inequity of the time. As a result we feel the characters motivations and understand their faults all  the better Bud White Ed Exley Lynn Bracken and Lana Turner all live here. This film like others that make us believe we are there for two hours and 7.50 will endure. I was thinking a  perfect double feature would be with Chinatown another film that will stand the test of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Truly one of the greatest mistake the Academy has made is not awarding this film the Best Picture award. For months I argued that while Titanic was a nice spectacle with great special effects the script the directing and the acting was all rather mediocre. However here we have L.A. Confidential. Perfection in script. Perfection in directing. Perfection in cast. Obviously because Russell Crowe Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey all gave Oscar worthy performances the voting was split and therefore none got enough votes for a nomination.    Crowe gave an invigorating performance and Bud White a man who knows that he is not very smart and has instead relied on pure brawn all his life. But as the film progresses you watch him yearn to put his strength aside and become selfreliant instead of being purely muscle for the cause of justice which has become obscured as he has had to resort to violent and debatably immoral method to preserve peace in Los Angeles. And yet while he does make us question whether he is going to end up on the side of good or evil by the end of the film uncertain we do empathize enough with him to hope that he does redeem himself by the end.    Pearce delivers Ed Exley as a man who is wholly set on the purest means of justice. While he follows his father into the same profession his goals are unique to uphold the law without having to bend or break it. And yet his good aspiration are certainly out of place in the corrupt organization of the police of that time. He slowly becomes drawn into the graft. He becomes gloryhungry pulling whatever strings he has to in order to be promoted or be seen in a good light by the press. And yet he does begin to find himself giving into exactly the cause he fought against. And so throughout the film he struggles to overcome the instinctive nature of man to achieve power and glory. He has to be a better man than that. And so the audience can quickly see the nobility in that. He is not perfect. But at least he tries to be.   And probably the best performance in the film comes from Spacey. Here we see what Exley might have become in a few years if he wasn't careful.  Jack Vincennes has succumb to the call of money and celebrity status. He does not care in the least about duty or about justice. It's all become simply a matter of vanity. And yet he begins to see through his own fault. Spacey's performance is undoubtable the best because he is one of those actors who doesn't have to try to communicate his emotions in order to communicate them or at least he is good enough not to show the strings. I had to watch this film several times to really take in the impact of his role and fully absorb his character. His key moments within the middle of the film are absolutely unforgettable. When he stares into the mirror of the bar after receiving the hundred dollar bill that scene is a turning point for the character. And he was able to convey the message of that scene without saying a thing. And also when asked why he became a cop the delivery of that next line just that was Oscar worthy on its own.   Even aside from those three performances it would have been totally respectable if James Cromwell or Danny DeVito  had received a nomination. Truly this film had one of the greatest ensemble casts ever captured on screen.".

Add to that Dante Spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artistic and believable comfortably as all period camerawork should Ruth Myers' costume designing and a script by Hanson and The Postman scribe Brian Helgeland I know I don't get it either that pares down Ellroy's mammoth plot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman with suspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or the spiderweb of events involved with it and you have the best movie of 1997 not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. The cast is all brilliant most notably Kim Basinger as a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind of steelBasinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll find yourself forgetting she's even actingand Kevin Spacey as a Dean Martinesque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits.

A truly gripping crime saga exposing the seedy underbelly of the City of Angels where cops never let the truth get in the way of justice and everyone knows everyone else's dirty secrets.Criminally overlooked at both the box office and the Academy thanks to the allconquering and overachieving Titanic LA Confidential will far more likely stand the test of time to be thought of as one of the best films of the 90s and possibly the best cop film ever.After cops give a number of inmates a beating in retaliation for two of their own being put in hospital the careerminded Ed Exley Guy Pearce agrees to testify to what he saw turning in his fellow officers. When one of the cops forced out turns up dead as a result of a shooting Exley hothead detective Bud White Russell Crowe and fameobsessed Sergeant Jack Vincennes Kevin Spacey all work to find the answers. However as they uncover the truth it leads to more questions of corruption blackmail bribery and conspiracy.The film superbly portrays the dual nature of Hollywood glamorous parties and beautiful people and the seemingly everpresent crime and corruption even in the police. Danny Devito's opening monologue perfectly sums it up  'There's trouble in paradise'. This is not the city at the end of the rainbow the city where dreams come true.A series of stellar performances from an allstar cast makes it impossible to pick the star although Kim Basinger richly deserved her Best Supporting Actress. Kevin Spacey is terrific as ever while Russell Crowe shows that Gladiator wasn't his first muscleswithaheart role. But the real standout is probably Guy Pearce in a careermaking performance as the one officer determined to what is right and just regardless of the potentially disastrous consequences for him. However LA Confidential is a true ensemble piece and everybody holds their own among the starry cast. Few will have made many better films before or since.Curtis Hanson directs in a careerdefining role the sweeping direction echoing the sprawling nature of both the story and the city. The story is a slowburner gradually unraveling all the twists but instead of clearing up the mystery the waters become muddier as the trio of officers are forced to work together. Hanson masterfully commands the James Ellroy's source material weaving it into a gripping multilayered tale. The characters are extremely well developed all threedimensional with no clearcut heroes and villains. White Crowe in particular is the classic film noir antihero the violent cop with a heartbreaking story thinking with his muscles rather than his brain. LA Confidential is a classic 50s noir film told for the 90s and keeps you guessing right up to the final scene as to how high the corruption goes. The twohour running time is never felt.A superb thriller and the perfect antidote to the rash of mindless actioncomedies that frequently come out of Hollywood today LA Confidential harks back to how filmmaking used to be  all about telling a story. And what a story it is. One of if not the best film of the 90s.".

As a Taiwanese I saw a lot of Hong Kong movies about police and gangsters while I was a child and they were all very impressive. Therefore the particularly genre has been promoted to such high levels in my mind that I can hardly be pleased. Fortunately L.A. Confidential satisfies me not only with its thoughtful scenario but also with several great actors' performances. More specifically the story is not just about justice versus evil there are also many elements such as passion wisdom greed friendship and of course love which all made this movie more than fun to watch. In other words you might feel angry at this moment shocked latter and finally moved by their insistence on doing the right things which made us believe there are still several police worth our trust.Guy Pearce was one big surprise in the movie not because he played the leading role of the movie but for his courage and wisdom and most important of all his slightly pride that caused admiration accompanied by hostility at the same time. Because the complexity he showed we couldn't help but be deeply attracted and that's when we built connections with the character inside the frame. Secondly Kevin Spacey was not the one who would gain our trust at first but no one ought to disagree with his contribution after the shocked Rollo Tomasi scene. Likewise Russell Crowe twisted his role impressions only after his cooperation with Guy Pearce but he really needed to adjust his tempers for his own sake. Such a crew made this great movie never outofdate not even after similar stories keep brainwashing our minds.How lucky I am to see such a classical film. As a matter of fact I haven't found one movie that reaches the same level as it did at least not in the genre. Thus I just have to repeat watching the film again and again and I believe many people are doing the same thing I do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading the comments I find few viewers seemed to have read James Ellroy's LA Trilogy on which LA Confidential is based. The Big Nowhere LA Confidential and White Jazz comprise the Dudley Smith story Smith is the only constant in all three. None of the heroes are in Nowhere Buzz Meeks being gunned down by Dudley while trying to escape having hidden the heroin. Buzz White survives Confidential along with Exley and White does go off to Arizona but Smith still lives and rides high. In Jazz Ed ExleyGuy Pearceand Smith do battle for the soul of David Klein who in the end brings down Smith. Of the three Confidential is surely the most complicated since with the heroin out there somewhere many more players are involved.Hanson's genius is to shorten the story eliminating Nowhere entirely and bringing Dudley his retribution without Dave Klein being involved. He eliminates so many back stories Exley's father is alive in the book and a powerful politico to boot and this is just one difference but in clarifying and making the story shorter he almost makes it better. The murder of Vincennes is a brilliant touch along with the code name Rollo Tomassi.Both the books and the film are pulse pounders intense to the core. My late wife who could never sit through any film without getting up for a cigarette was immobilized and by the end was screaming Kill him as Exley watched Smith depart. If I had one slight criticism it would be the cleaning up of some of the language about the original suspects in the Nite Owl killings but make no mistake about it this is the film for the 90's and the only 1997 Oscar nominee worth watching. Hurrah for Curtis Hanson.".

There were plot and character subtleties that were much easier to appreciate without having to concentrate as much on what was going on following the film noir guideline of having a complicated story line.  This movie successfully avoided stereotypical characters each character had many motivations some sympathetic some not. Loved Kevin Spacey's performance not unusual and Guy Pearce was really good as Exley.  The thing that most surprised me however was finding that James Cromwell who so wonderfully played the heavy Dudley Smith is the same James Cromwell that played the wonderful farmer Hoggett in Babe. Talk about different characters.".

However under the surface drug use is rife prostitution is rampant and the police officers are violent thugs.  In the middle of this are three officers with different aims.  Ed Exley is an ambitious young officer who will do anything to climb the ranks Bud White is a muscle man and gets the job done while Jack Vincennes is only concerned with celebrity busts and getting his face in the paper.  When the three come together on a coffee shop killing that brings in elements of cases they are following they solve it together.  However each has suspicions that something is not right.I'm sorry to say that I didn't pick up on this at the cinema and it wasn't until the Oscars brought it to my attention that I first saw it.  Since then I have seen it several times and have enjoyed it every time.  The plot is slightly complex although maybe not by the genre's standards and it isn't simplified for the audiences sake  it respects the audience enough to trust us to keep up with it's pace.  The film is split into three strands dictated by the characters they are not quite distinct but are mostly intertwined the whole way through  coming together in the final hour to great effect.The pace of the telling is great it has moments of drama of tension and great action.  Hanson has done a great job with the direction he has a great sense of place and time to his 50's Hollywood  whether it be the stars' lives or the black suburbs  but he directs each scene with a sense of tension and urgency that the material deserves.  The final twist is OK if not great but it is more the telling of the story that is enjoyable not just the denouncement.The casting did a great job of getting growth names and established qualities but no one huge star who could dominate the film.  It is the Australian stars that stand out here.  Pearce is excellent with a subtly changing character but it is Crowe that sticks in the memory with a very strong character and a performance to match.  Spacey is as quality as he ever is or at least was for a few years either side of this film and the support cast is as good with De Vito Basinger Cromwell Rifkin Strathairn and Guilfoyle.There is nothing I really dislike about this film.  The longer than average running time is not a problem as it easily fills it without dragging at any point.  The film oozes class and has a great tough plot from Ellroy where nothing is as simple as rightwrong and everything comes together at the end.  A real classy film with brains and brawn which continues to be one of my favourites of recent years.".

	schema:reviewBody "LA Confidential has all of the qualities that over time earn a film the honorific classic. The story is involved and involving and quickly pulls the viewer into trying to solve the mystery along with the main characters. The script is brisk and clever the editing moves along at a solid pace that builds toward the end the images of old LA are realistic and convincing and the character portrayals are more than wonderful they're truly memorable. It's safe to say that in many respects this film provided breakout roles for Russell Crowe Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce.Crowe's Bud White steals the show  brutal tender complex and in his own way rigidly principled White is a powerful character whose presence dominates scenes. Crowe's earlier role in Virtuosity showed a tiny violent piece of Bud White but lacked his complexity and depth. Bud White showed the world what Russell Crowe can really do on screen.LA Confidential similarly makes the best use of Kevin Spacey's abilities in his role as the worldweary cynical smart and smarmy Jack Vincennes. Spacey's earlier work e.g. The Usual Suspects is terrific and memorable but Jack Vincennes paved the way for the Spacey characterizations viewers love in his later films e.g. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil American Beauty Pay it Forward and the less acclaimed Beyond the Sea.The role of Edmund Exley provided Guy Pearce with an opportunity to demonstrate some of his enormous range as an actor alternately appearing naive selfrighteous scared streetwise and menacing. These qualities appear in the widely varied but dynamic characters he has created in subsequent films Memento The Count of Monte Cristo The Time Machine.More than reliable the supporting cast also creates characters that are believable complex and a pleasure to watch. Kim Basinger's wise and weary Lynn Bracken may represent her best work on screen. James Cromwell often cast as a failed administrator is wonderfully hateable as the cool and corrupt Captain Dudley Smith. Danny DeVito romps as slimy Sid Hudgens and David Strathairn's Pierce Morehouse Patchett is subtle and believable. Patchett almost certainly brought Straithairn the role of Edward R. Murrow in 2005's Good Night and Good Luck. Ron Rifkin Matt McCoy and the rest of the cast also bring realism and energy to their roles making the film solid and believable.The story itself is compelling and enjoyable a copsandrobbers whodunit with several twists. The dialog ranges from moving to hilarious to terrifying to inspiring without losing the story's consistency. The story's conclusion is dramatic actionpacked and contains a few sweet surprises.Anyone interested in seeing the early work of Russell Crowe Kevin Spacey or Guy Pearce should see LA Confidential. Anyone interested in seeing a great film should see LA Confidential. It's one of those films worth owning and watching a few times a year. Which is to say it's a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS...The story of three cops who changed their minds. Guy Pearce begins as a coldly manipulative cop interested mainly in promotions. He winds up sanctioning the use of brute force in order to obtain what passes for justice in this movie. Kevin Spacey is sort of affiliated with the LAPD but his chief interest is in being technical adviser on a Dragnet show and getting his picture in the L.A. Times. He discovers that he has a sense of responsibility when a sympathetic young bisexual is murdered on his watch. Russell Crowe is an apparently mindless brutal thug who finds that love has made him vulnerable and that the instrumentality of anger has its limits.Overall it's an excellent film. The theme is similar to that of Chinatown in which Jack Nicholson a brittle but basically decent representative of objectivity and order discovers corruption in high places. L. A. Confidential isn't Chinatown what is? but it brims with the same irony and sense of disease although our identification with a single isolated human being is dispersed over a trio of flawed cops.What a welldrawn flick. Curtis Hanson handles the direction competently blessedly without the sort of dazzling special effects a viewer has come to expect from cop movies. There is plenty of action but no car chases exploding heads or slowmotion deaths. In fact all but two of the deaths take place offscreen. That's directorial bravery for you. Bring another Medal of Valor here.The performances are about as good as they come. Danny DeVito is a tabloid reporter who speaks in headlines liable at any moment to say something like What he needs is a snoot of cocacola up the old schnozzola. This is 1953 don't forget. Kim Basinger is beautiful as a Veronica Lake lookalike but doesn't have too much of a chance to stretch her acting chops. Guy Pearce as the independent loner is the only character who gets my respect from beginning to end. He really BELIEVES in the cause a hard charger unfriendly though he may be. He also looks oddly like Arnold Schwarzenegger especially odd since he was a body builder of sorts. I knew another body builder who was Schwarzenegger's body double in Raw Deal because he was a ringer. Do all body builder have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger? I mean aside from their glutes? Speaking of body builders Russell Crowe gets a lot of screen time in a dark brown suit speckled with what looks like bird droppings perhaps the ugliest suit ever committed to film with shoulders as wide as the central span of the George Washington Bridge.Two of the performances are irreproachable. John Cromwell is the corrupt police captain. He plays the role chewing gum and exuding unpretentious Irish charm Call me Dudley. while tempering the charm with what sounds like goodnatured and sincere common sense advice. Underneath that he's thoroughly rotten in every respect. And Kevin Spacey is perfect as the vain detective who knows his way around the showbiz part of L.A. and enjoys schmoozing with councilmen celebrities and the press. He's involved in the two most amusing scenes in the movie. The first involves an almost miraculous control of facial expression. He's called in for interrogation by his superiors and is asked to testify against some other officers. No he says I won't snitch on anyone in the department. They offer him no punishment more severe than a slap on the wrist and before he knows it he'll be back on the show which he loves. The show? he asks. There is a long long moment while his face sort of drifts from surprise through disbelief and into resignation. Then he figuratively shrugs his shoulders and says without any deliberation All right I'll do it. The very model of a complete sellout. The other amusing scene is when he and Pearce accost a beautiful blond in a nightclub and sneer at her because she's a whore plasticsurgerized to look like Lana Turner. And Spacey informs Pearce to lay off She IS Lana Turner. When they return to their car both officers begin laughing.The photography is fine the early 50s decor is what you'd expect from a professional job like this. There isn't much in the way of original music in the score  hardly any in fact  but period music is used not overused to good effect. It's quality varies from Kay Starr to Cole Porter. Extra Casting and Wardrobe even went to the trouble of making the actors playing Jerry Mulligan and Chet Baker LOOK LIKE Mulligan and Baker although they cut Baker's recorded solo short on The Lady is a Tramp.The movie doesn't have a traditionally happy ending really. All values are gray as they are in real life rather than black and white. Pearce the political animal remains ambitious but now has distance enough from his role to see it for what it is. The same seems to be true for Crowe's character who has found the love of a good woman. Well the love of a woman anyway. Crowe still has a long way to go before reaching redemption. He's killed in cold blood a rapist and drug dealer and planted a gun on him and gotten away with it but we've seen him look disgusted at some violence he's forced to witness later in the film. Vincennes is dead.This one is definitely worth seeing.Catch this if you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "L.A. Confidential one of the best pictures of the '90s in fact it could have won the 1997 Best Picture Oscar it's so much better than Titanic is the definitive proof that there is no such thing as an unfilmable book Curtis Hanson with the help of cowriter Brian Helgeland has turned James Ellroy's noir masterpiece which is 800 pages long into a 135minute long modern classic. It's THE noir of the '90s!The story takes place in L.A. early '50s. It's a city where everything looks perfect where everybody goes to become a movie star. But as Danny De Vito's opening voiceover informs us it's not as good as it looks the City of Angels is actually run by Al Caponeclones such as Mickey Cohen Paul Guilfoyle aka CSI's Brass and the police... Well it just so happens a lot of the LAPD is among the mob's unofficial employees. And it's in this kind of environment that we first meet the three key players Ed Exley Guy Pearce is an ambitious young man who wants to be as good as his dad and do his job properly even if that includes turning in his colleagues Bud White Russell Crowe is a disillusioned cop who not only accepts violence as part of the job but even uses it as often and much as possible in his personal crusade against wifebeating men as his partner puts itYou're like Santa Claus with that list Bud Except everyone on it's been naughty and Jack Vincennes Kevin Spacey is the classic Hollywood Cop who gets paid by tabloids to bust cokesnorting celebrities.

Hanson has completely removed the subplots concerning Vincennes and Exley's love lives which occupied quite a bit of the book preferring to show us only the bond between Bud White and Lynn Bracken a whore but also the one person who truly understands the conflict and hatred that are at the center of the brutal cop's mind and soul.

But it's Crowe in his Hollywood debut who really steals the show. Forget A Beautiful Mind The Insider hell even Gladiator this is the role that should have obtained the Academy's attention.New to the genre? This movie is a good start alongside The Untouchables.

Confidential one of the best pictures of the '90s in fact it could have won the 1997 Best Picture Oscar it's so much better than Titanic is the definitive proof that there is no such thing as an unfilmable book Curtis Hanson with the help of cowriter Brian Helgeland has turned James Ellroy's noir masterpiece which is 800 pages long into a 135minute long modern classic. It's THE noir of the '90s!The story takes place in L.A. early '50s. It's a city where everything looks perfect where everybody goes to become a movie star. But as Danny De Vito's opening voiceover informs us it's not as good as it looks the City of Angels is actually run by Al Caponeclones such as Mickey Cohen Paul Guilfoyle aka CSI's Brass and the police... Well it just so happens a lot of the LAPD is among the mob's unofficial employees. And it's in this kind of environment that we first meet the three key players Ed Exley Guy Pearce is an ambitious young man who wants to be as good as his dad and do his job properly even if that includes turning in his colleagues Bud White Russell Crowe is a disillusioned cop who not only accepts violence as part of the job but even uses it as often and much as possible in his personal crusade against wifebeating men as his partner puts itYou're like Santa Claus with that list Bud Except everyone on it's been naughty and Jack Vincennes Kevin Spacey is the classic Hollywood Cop who gets paid by tabloids to bust cokesnorting celebrities. These three men so different will have to join forces when they discover their respective cases which involve corruption drugs prostitution and various murders are all linked to the Nite Owl massacre...The awardwinning script's focus is on the differences and similarities that connect the three protagonists and their views on the law.

	schema:reviewBody "L.A. Confidential is perhaps one of the best and most intriguing pieces of moving picture in the past few decades. The brilliancy of the script itself deserves a standing ovation because it is in my opinion one of the most thoughtout and nerve wrecking of its time. The direction by Curtis Hanson gives this intense and complex movie softness and makes a gentle approach to the audience because none of the material is forced through but instead it rests quietly in the subconsciousness of the audience the whole time. The plot is just awesome and stands out from any of the former and later policecriminal movies because we get to experience the action behind the curtain from a passive point of view. The plot has a great balance between tossing us into the action and gently luring us through one mystery after another trying to find the answers. The actors give the ideas of the script and the characters faces and gives us a chance to relate and identify with the characters involved. Each of them delivers great performances Spacey as always smart sly and above all believable though he does not exceed his brilliant performance in The Usual Suspects. Crowe with his so far best performance in my opinion with temper and depth. Pearce with an OK performance without really reaching the top but fills out his character nicely. Devito is amusing and cool and does everything he can to contribute to this movie. Basinger with her Oscarwinning role plays the beautiful blond convincingly and spices up the last aspect of the movie with splendor and depth as well. Alltogehter this makes one hell of a good movie. Fast smart complicated exciting raw and above all believable and entertaining. Well done by the creators of L.A. Confidential.".

Confidential is the kind of film that will make you laugh make you gaze in amazement at its appeal and become immersed in a murder mystery with so many twists and tangles that it could make your head spin. With one of the strongest plots I've ever seen which is executed masterfully by Curtis Hanson also has eye candy and sex appeal. The direction really is wonderful. The art direction is fantastic and brings you right back into the 50s. The acting is very good even if it comes off as 50s styled acting proving that todays actors are far superior than the actors of the 50s. L. A. Confidential even goes as far as poking fun at the sensationalized way films were made in that time period with a hilarious sequence where a cop on a show called Badge of Honor interrupts a women giving him details about some crime and he says Just the facts ma'am. Just the facts.The tangled and twisted plot is engrossing and filled with seduction cons lies betrayal killings and corruption. The acting is terrific from a slew of great actors including Kevin Spacey Russell Crowe Guy Pearce and Walter Cromwell plays one of the great villains I've ever seen. All of these guys have a lot of fun with their roles and do an excellent job. Kim Basinger plays a prostitute who tries to look like a movie a star so that her pimp Pierce Patchett David Stratharin can reap the benefits since everyone wants to be with a celebrity. L. A. Confidential is as much a look at the culture of the 50s both commercially through television and the dirty business of police officers exposed as it is being a stylized homage piece. This is a film that's done exceptionally well with some great lines great performances and a plot that will force you to watch it again and again. It hardly misses a beat. This is one of the few films that can recreate the 50s with its acting and style and still hold up with todays society. It works well as a film and exceptionally well as an homage piece.".

A whole lot of separate incident are tied together quite intricately as the cast's three police heroes together and separately piece it all together.Three very different kinds of cops are portrayed here. First is the laid back Kevin Spacey who has a casual attitude towards the corruption he sees. He's also the police adviser to a Dragnet style show and enjoys a whole lot of perks that come with it.Secondly is Guy Peace who's a real boy scout but is the son of a hero cop and also knows how to work department politics. He doesn't look the other way on corruption he rises in rank because he turned in fellow officers and he's hated up and down the line.Finally there's Russell Crowe whose character reminds me of the big dumb son in House of Strangers played by Paul Valentine who Edward G.

However did you ever see a movie that was barely OK production  acting wise but held your interest? That movie is The Last Chase. Sometimes you don't want a movie to be technically correct with perfect continuity and a flawless believable story line. This again is The Last Chase. Sometimes you see a movie at a certain point in your past and watching it again brings back great memories from that time in your life. The Last Chase has characters that you can identify with. Lee Majors plays Franklin Hart an exrace car driver living in a futuristic Boston who is tired of the laws of an America without oil. Chris Makepeace Meatballs plays a brainy student who tags along and gives Lee someone to talk to in the film. Longing for the days when America has gasoline and he could race his car and be a recognized sports figure Frank sees an illegal television broadcast from California A Free State and decides that Boston is no longer the place he wants to be. Set in the United States and filmed in Canada the Last Chase is a fun albeit silly romp that converts an interesting story to film. If it's listed record it. This one's very tough to find in any format. Made by Crown International Pictures Canada I'd plead for the DVD but that request would fall on deaf ears as almost no one would ever remember this one. But I liked it. The Gil Melle score is terrific!".

Nevertheless this film scored a basehit with me and earned the somewhat watchable rating of 5.If you have ever wanted to see Lee Majors siphoning regular gas from tanks abandoned 40 years ago and using it in a Formula I Car while chased by Burgess Meredith in a Sabre Jet this is the film for you. I'm afraid that if you have never had this particular fantasy you might want to avoid this film. Majors plays a professional race car driver forced to give up his career and dismantle his car by a US government which has outlawed petroleum use. Now let's just play along here and lets ignore the fact that the petroleum and defense industries have been the most valuable players in the election of most of the US's recent rightwing executives and a few of the lefties too  so let's ignore this impossibility of the basic premise  and let's not even ask how these people are generating electricity etc. I didn't notice any nukes.... Anyway. Steve Austin...ummm sorry.... Lee Majors' character decides to leave for of all places California where people have not realized that petroleum use is a desire not a right and are carrying on the same sort of destructive culture the rest of the USA has apparently disavowed. Believability is of course not an issue here as the viewer is never challenged to accept any of this absurdity.Instead you just let it go along from ridiculous scene to ridiculous scene. And if you start to wonder how Mr. Majors kept such a straight face throughout this film just think back on his run in The Six Million Dollar Man. And when you get bored with the Roger Cormanlike 2 minute pans across screen following the ancient Burgess Meredith and his Sabre Jet just imagine him cackling like the Penguin or focus on the other bizarre animal noises he keeps uttering in his aerially induced euphoria.This film is remarkably good for what it is. The script is not bad the directing and editing are fine the acting is decent and the soundtrack is even acceptable. It does get boring at times but given the utterly ludicrous plot it's not nearly as bad as it should have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "I only have myself and my ridiculously high expectations to blame of course but The Last Chase was one of the biggest disappointments in years! Here I was hoping to see a tremendously cool car chase motion picture in the same style as Vanishing Point only in a futuristic and thus even more desolate setting. In other words a virulent and adrenalinrushing road adventure in which one awesome hero gets chased by an increasingly larger army of dimwitted cops that continuously crash their cars or drive into ravines. Well like sadly far too often in my life I was wrong. The Last Chase is a dull and moralizing  almost prophetic  drama about the true definition of freedom and blah blah blah. The year is  um I forgot already but it's the not too distant future and the new fascist government prohibited all forms of private transportation due to the scarcity of oil products. Franklyn Hart used to be a racer but now he's assigned to go from school to school and preach about how the 1980's were barbaric times. During a moment of clarity however he fixes his hideous old car I think it's a Porsche and heads out to California along with a rebellious teenager. The authorities naturally cannot allow this but they don't have any means to stop Franklyn so they hire an 80yearold war veteran and his antique F86 Jet to stop him. Let me assure you it's a truly ludicrous sight to see a SciFi movie using scenery from the Korean War. This could have been a great actionadventure flick but instead became a boring and talkative drama with too much pretension. Lee Majors clearly craves back to the successful days of Six Million Dollar Man and Burgess Meredith although vivid and outrageous looks just as antique as the plane he's flying.".

It sums up my thoughts as well.One has to wonder whether this movie was the inspiration for Al Gore's desire to ban internal combustion automobiles. In any case this movie shows the kind asinine totalitarian regime Socialists seem to be trying harder and harder to turn the United States into. It gives us a taste of the sort of topdown obey the rules or else brainwashing type of society we could find ourselves in if we're not careful.Having been 'convinced' over the years to submit to authority and preach the 'goodness' of the new oligarchical system compared to the 'badness' of the old individualistic system Lee Majors' character an exrace car driver find encouragement in a few short pirate television transmissions. Radio Free California calling America inspires him to dig up and reassemble his hidden race car and flee the defacto prison the east coast has become.In true neoDemocratSocialist style he is ordered stopped at any cost preferably by being killed. A single Vietnam War aircraft and its pilot Burgess Merideth are pulled out of mothballs and a bottle respectively for this task.Other means are also employed along the way to try and stop the car and its occupants including a StalinMaoesquire slaughter of a group of innocent people who took them in to give them medical care.Now in 2005 since California is literally going broke spearheading the Union away from individual rights and toward Socialism the idea of Radio Free California returning to machines and to personal liberty takes quite a leap of faith but it's a fun 3000 mile trip across the country nonetheless.As the story goes the Social dystopia was able to take hold after a disease wipes out much of the population. Since the time the film came out 1980 the likelihood of such massive devastation from disease has only increased. And never has the proverb Power corrupts Absolute power corrupts absolutely been any truer than it is today.I don't agree for a second that the point of this movie was to encourage the worship of the internal combustion engine or petroleum products. But yes in the case of Lee Majors' character and the race car it was a gasoline engine that was the appropriate if not the only tool capable of escaping tyranny.If this movie is one big ad for big oil companies does that mean every movie about police who use firearms to help arrest evildoers or which shows someone defending their own life with a firearm is just a big ad for Colt or Glock? Loners who are ticked off at the system trying to pound them into behaving like everyone else will like this movie. I loved this movie! But if you're into that whole ride public transit or go to jail thing you'll only like the first 15 minutes of this movie...so have your Michael Moore tapes ready.".

However that didn't stop this movie to become funenjoyable vintage guilty pleasure low budget scifi action flick. Movie stardom hungry Lee Majors with mullet wearing silver racing jacket I think stunt man Mike from recent Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof might be got the idea from Lee's character Frank Hart. Well looks wise.... did his own car stunts with red Porsche racing car. The cross country chase between Porsche and jet was all old school stunts and it also captured beautiful DenverRocky Mt. No CGI on this!!! This movie also features Chris Makepeace from My Bodyguard and Vamp. I really like to see this movie available on DVD sometime soon!!!".

Others have noted the various issues that come up in this movie. The energy crisis that isn't solved by new technology but by the iron fist of regulation. Social control achieved through restriction of movement and herding people into cities. Reeducation as a stand in for jail. Devolution of government into authoritarianism. An Ebola like plague laying waste to America.These issues get paraded through the plot in a pretty clear blackandwhite line up. Fast cars  good. Government bureaucrats  bad. And for that reason this film has largely been written off as a mere adventure film one that stacks up poorly against its contemporaries. But strip away the zooming car shots and barrel rolling areal sequences and you get something that is a little bit GATACA a little bit Vanishing Point but with a very 1980s Reaganesque ideology.You also have a few shallow side plots that are meant to break up the diadacticism. The creation of a fatherson bond. The hopelessness of losing your purpose in life. The emotional baggage of causing a fatal crash or losing your loved ones to premature disease.Today all those things would be played out with color filters and weeping string accompanimentsoverdialuage that are the hallmark of post LORT adventure films. Back then that was out of the question. Protagonists like square jawed Lee Majors looked you squarely through the camera lense and gritted out lines like I've done a lot of losing in my life I don't want to lose you too. All actor. Maybe not the best actor but no fluffy BS. Solid performances by Majors and Meredith here and nothing but praise for George Touliatos's Hawkins. Performances backed up not tread upon by a rich and powerful musical landscape which is in my opinion Gil Melle's best.The story is simple a man and a boy on the road the latter there to expose the complex layers of the protagonist's character. Today the story would be about a bunch of tweeny kids wrestling with themselves through emotional fullnelsons that would put Hulk Hulgan to shame. Got to play to the youth market if you want boxoffice .All I can say it the conflicts in this movie make it well overdue for a remake but thankfully the wrong people haven't made one. Redone in the minimalist style of Road to Paloma the 917 CanAm Spyder could come roaring to life again for an epic remake but probably end up a commercial flop. Redone with typical Hollywood sensibilities I'm thinking Rollerball now it would still be a commercial flop. So there it is... if the film sounds interesting to you nothing for it but to start looking through those crates of VHS bootlegs at the next yard sale you drive by... until that is the oil runs out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This juvenile bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens' bodies desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years. How ? By burning up gas and equating a fast reckless car or plane with freedom.The plot borrows heavily from Mister Rogers' neighborhood if it were run my an oil conglomerate and Logan's Run if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style.Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this film is set in a postgascrisis world in which an allpowerful government doesn't want you to ahem drive your car and burn gas. Sort of the opposite of today's EnronandBush oilgrabbing SUVpushing government.This juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable. But wait...there's more. Although the film is set in the future we're not shown any signs of future technology beyond a return to bicycles golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks... exactly like today. Same clothing same suburban houses same green lawns as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels no windmills no concessions to alternate energy.The acting is flat and flavorless. Even scenes which could have been gritty or moving buddyflick honor romance horror... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase.Continuity is lacking the jet flown by Burgess Meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again.The plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a Dukes of Hazzard episode.Even diehard carfilm and SF fans should avoid this film like monthold roadkill unless you enjoy heckling Exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's gas tank.".

There was no sickly sentimentality and characterization was believable with excellent periodpiece detail. If you're a fan of Robert Duvall's you'll find that he doesn't let you down in this film. He is well supported by Aidan Quinn Frances Fisher and Brian Dennehy a cast which attracted my attention in the first place. I was interested too to discover that Clint Eastwood's daughter Francesca Ruth Eastwood by Frances Fisherplayed the role of Miss Fisher's daughter in the film.

There was no sickly sentimentality and characterization was believable with excellent periodpiece detail. If you're a fan of Robert Duvall's you'll find that he doesn't let you down in this film. He is well supported by Aidan Quinn Frances Fisher and Brian Dennehy a cast which attracted my attention in the first place. I was interested too to discover that Clint Eastwood's daughter Francesca Ruth Eastwood by Frances Fisherplayed the role of Miss Fisher's daughter in the film. It's a shame the film did not have a wider distribution.";

	schema:reviewBody "Well this is pretty rare thing as I'm reviewing on Swedish comedy oriented drama the genre I'm not so familiar with. I got the DVD for a birthday present and I probably would not have boughtrentedwatched the film otherwise. The film is however pretty positive experience and recommended highly for most of the people.It tells the story of Swedish youths that are having little problems with relationships relatives impotence and other stuff. I won't tell too much about the plot but there are many things found in normal every day life too so I think many will be interested once they start to watch the film.The director is young and talented Josef Fares and many of his relatives also act in this film. The actors are mostly young people like 19781982 and couple of older too but they all are very talented and natural. It took 30 days to shoot the film and technically the film is very great as there are many different techniques used by the director and the story is also very interesting and genuinely funny not some stupid slapstick comedy.The themes of the film are mainly about love and the total misunderstanding of it. It shows that love cannot be arranged or planned it is born once the two right people meet and there is no need for help from another parties. This is important issue and is more powerfully depicted in Jane Campion's masterpiece The Piano. There are also other things that are topical all the time and the impotence of one character is one of them despite I don't know how usual impotence is in these age groups of 30s or so. Well that subject matter is also depicted warmly and with positivism and the subject matter of love is once again the main key for the problem. And many hilarious scenes about the impotence are also included!The dialogue and scenes are often hilarious and I found myself laughing very much throughout the film. This is positive cinema at its greatest and therefore this can be recommended for everybody with interest in cinema. There are many great actors and actresses in the film and they really do their job fine and this was feature debut for many of the actors. It is not visible though!I give this positive piece of life 810 and high recommendations!".

Jalla! is about change grandma is still firmly rooted in the old ways dad keeps up appearances but turns out more flexible than you thought and Roro is for all intents and purposes just as much a modern Swede as a Lebanese. Although he is sincere and outspoken he's just not able to totally say goodbye to his heritage and his roots. Finally it was very gratifying to see a film about immigrants without some profound and ostentatious message but more occupied with the sometimes impossible daily choices between morality and practicality one is forced to make despite the lack of understanding in one's surroundings and truth be told neither Mns nor Lisa display much understanding for Roro's predicament.

Quite a lot as this movie proves. It's subject certainly isn't one of the easiest but Josef Fares made a good movie out of it.Don't ask me what Jalla! Jalla! stands for because I really don't know. I don't even know if it is Arabic or Swedish I guess the first. But what I do know is that this is a movie about Roro a man from Lebanese origin who works as a park attendant with his best friend Mns. Roro has a Swedish girlfriend something that he doesn't want his parents to know  and is forced to marry a LebaneseSwedish girl. He likes her but doesn't love her but decides to marry her anyway to help her because if she doesn't marry her brother will send her back to Lebanon to their parents. Mns has entirely different problems. He has a relationship too but because he's having potency problems his relationships isn't exactly going very well. While Mns tries to fix his problem using all kinds of methods Roro has to try to keep up appearances while stalling the wedding plans and maintaining the relationship with his unknowing girlfriend.I must say that I didn't expect all that much about this movie. Normally a movie about mixed relationships or other multicultural society problems tends to get incredibly preachy. But not this movie instead of showing how bad and racist the 'white man' is and how nice the 'black man' this movie has made a comedy out of it. And it works. The characters and the situations that they get in are believable but more important also incredibly funny.The acting too was very nice. I had never heard of any of the actors before but I must say that they all did a very nice job. Most surprising is probably that most of them has never played in any other movie before or since this one. Does that mean that these aren't professional actors? I don't know but I sure hope to see them again soon because I really had a very good time with this movie and I can't remember being annoyed by it once. That's also the reason why I give this movie at least a 7.510.".

The story is well told and keeps up the interest but the end is predictable like I said conventional and a bit too cute. I didn't really understand the problem between Mns and his girlfriend Jenny? they seem to fall out of love just because it suited the plot and I thought that Mns' and Roro's third coworker the soul brother with the afro was a bit too cute and multicultural yes I got it  we're one big family of cool dudes. My favourite role was Roro's very cool father. And a protagonist in the shape of a pudgy middleaged Arab you don't have that too often in a movie do you?".

This works fine in Warner Bros cartoons. But in a movie which remotely in any way is going to depict reality no. Fares should have left this for his action movie that evidently is going to be his next project. The dialogue and the funny parts are other problems too. The comedy revolves mostly around the male reproduction organ and the main character's dad using his big belly to ward of people he dislikes.Some of the actors are not at all convincing I hate to say it but it adds to the amateurishness of this production. Which I can live with to a certain extent however since it is director Josef Fares' first real movie.

After the movie I thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts. oh on dogs as well... The story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time. Of course the public chose Jalla! Jalla! while Vingar av glas got little attention.What was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad. That was probably due to the fact that first time director Josef Fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it for fun I suppose. The result however is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them. This was very frustrating. Maybe Josef Fares should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can master.Another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together. At several times in the middle of the movie the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable. And then I have not mentioned the 2dimensional characters especially those in the supporting roles. Even though I consider this one of the worst Swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated it is kind of understandable that the public liked it. I mean bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses...I'm more surprised that the critics enjoyed it. They should have known better...Grade 2 of 10".

He has a girlfriend with who he is very much in love but his family not knowing about his girlfriend want him to marry in an arranged marriage to YasminLaleh Pourkarim. Such a story can easily becomes a heavy melodrama which can make you cry. However Josef Fares director  writer chose a lighter tone and made a heart warming comedy. Through the comedy he manage to convey the difficult situation that children from conservative families face when they have to choose between their tradition and the western way of life where they grew up. It is a no way situation and a constant struggle and yet the film leave you with the feeling that you can survive such a situation. But you need to make a choice which is the best for you. Another thing about arranged marriagewhich the film doesn't clearly say is that it sometime used as a peace treaty between rival families. You can get the idea of it when you see what happens to the wedding celebration when Roro announce that he will not marry Yasmin.There is another story going on and it is the one of Mans Torkel Peterson who is impotent.

He has a girlfriend with who he is very much in love but his family not knowing about his girlfriend want him to marry in an arranged marriage to YasminLaleh Pourkarim. Such a story can easily becomes a heavy melodrama which can make you cry. However Josef Fares director  writer chose a lighter tone and made a heart warming comedy. Through the comedy he manage to convey the difficult situation that children from conservative families face when they have to choose between their tradition and the western way of life where they grew up. It is a no way situation and a constant struggle and yet the film leave you with the feeling that you can survive such a situation. But you need to make a choice which is the best for you. Another thing about arranged marriagewhich the film doesn't clearly say is that it sometime used as a peace treaty between rival families. You can get the idea of it when you see what happens to the wedding celebration when Roro announce that he will not marry Yasmin.There is another story going on and it is the one of Mans Torkel Peterson who is impotent. Through this story Fares Fares try to tell us that there is a connection between love and sex.some of the funniest scenes in the film involve the character of Mans.The film is very natural in his tone.

I also loved the fact that he is a lover of all animals except Bats.  I thought that was such a funny idea for the character.

This proves my theory that sequels that are made the very next year of the movie are never as good aside from SCREAM 2.Ace Ventura Jim Carrey after accidentally letting an animal die in one of his cases has gone into selfimposed exile. But he returns to the pet cases at the request of Fulton Greenwall Ian McNeice to save a sacred bat. The wealthy Vincent Cadby Simon Callow has paid Ventura to save the bat before two African tribes go to war over it.Jim Carrey is his usual overacting self in this movie but it's more annoying this time. This is the stage of his career I really didn't care for. This movie is still not as bad as DUMB  DUMBER though but the jokes are either old from the first movie or stupid. Ian McNeice and Simon Callow do an OK job but their characters are not interesting because of bad plot and acting. The absence of Courtney Cox is probably the worst part of the movie.My final analyses...don't bother with this movie unless you are a Jim Carrey fan.".

However they are not given as much to do and are of less value  Callow Gunton and McNeice are not that missed when offscreen.  Of curiosity value are several British actors playing Nigerians  AkinnuoyeAgbaje is better known as the amazing actor from Oz on HBO and is given nothing to do here meanwhile Okonedo is pretty and humorous for those of us who know her better for her gritty role in Clocking Off on BBC1.Overall anyone watching this should just be aware of what they are getting  it's a silly comedy that is totally reliant on Carrey's mugging to carry it.

Not because the first movie was that good but there was just something so mesmerising about Carrey that he was too important to ignore at that time. He had three hit movies in a row although I didn't really enjoy Dumb  Dumber that much either. Boy was I disappointed. Not only did the movie suck but there is a mean spiritness running all the way through the proceedings that is hard to swallow. I am not talking about the grossout humor like Carrey making the biggest loogie in history by the way that was quite disturbing but the director seems to think that Ace has to be the World's biggest jerk to survive in the African setting.As in the first film many of the supporting characters are just decorative except Simon Callow he was the gay guy who croaks in Four Weddings and a Funeral and Sophie Okenedo. It's amazing she was nominated for an Oscar this year judged by this film. Carrey totally dominates every scene and it looks like that the star in him has taken over completely. That's acceptable as so many 20 million Dollar men would probably do the same.The plot of the movie does seem more thought out but in this kind of venture who cares. It is totally under the mercy of how many catchphrases Carrey can recite and the rather embarrassing slapstick humor. Another annoying thing is the way Ventura has suddenly been turned into a pervert although the twist at the end is rather clever.So in summary the film is in very bad taste but there was a market for that sort of thing as the movie was a huge hit. But please let's stop the insanity before Jack Black who is the next pretender to Carrey's place takes over.".

He takes you on a journey where the viewer actually feels pain when he is in pain we feel sad when he is sad and laugh when he laughs.Although the movie is about the right to die it is not at all depressing.

His status renders him incapable of being the person he once was and found in the impossibility to reconcile his former self with his current condition Ken Harrison decides to die.His quest is most obviously a difficult one. The doctors do not support him in his decision and in this debate  doctorpatient  it is where the film conjures the most solid arguments in its plea. Going beyond the usual ethical components of this choice the film manages to assert a very personal position to the main protagonist which therefore makes the whole experience one of anguish on a very personal level. And this is where it makes its point there is no universal justification for death and the world has no right to interfere in the sphere of anyone's consciousness. Perhaps it is at times overly dramatic and it treats the subject with tantalizing care but in the end I felt the film balanced all the facts concerned in a convincing and compelling way vividly portraying the painful demise of a strong mind in face of the cruelty of destiny. It might seem to take a stance on every man's right to choose his fate but in the matter at hand whether death by will is right or wrong it emits no absolute messages.Beyond everything Richard Dreyfuss sustains an authentic feeling of intellectual pain in his convincing performance. And it is only in pain and suffering that we can look into ourselves to understand how much we are willing to bear in this world and what makes us be. Suicide I do not believe a solution but then again I am on the other side of the river where things seem filthy green rather than nothing at all. We are so alone in death and pain that nobody can truly claim to understand us.".

He ultimately learns that he will be dependent on being trapped in a hospital bed for the rest of his existence paralyzed from the neck down and only able to move his head. Though Ken has a strong spirit and is basically goodnatured he cannot accept the fate of never being able to perform his craft again and seeks to be set free and allowed to die. His doctor John Cassavetes however is a gruff but dedicated man with strong principles who feels he has a responsibility to preserve life rather than destroy it and thus fights Ken every step of the way.I first saw this controversial John Badham film upon its initial theatrical run and it didn't get a DVD release until 2007 which then went quickly out of print and that's a shame. It cost me a bit much to get the nowrare DVD but it was worth it to me because I think it's such an involving movie. Richard Dreyfuss has one of his best roles and it's amazing that he manages such a good performance when you realize that the actor himself was going through the flu at the time of shooting and by his own admission has stated that he now has absolutely NO RECOLLECTION of making the film as he was also heavily addicted to drugs at the time which nearly killed him. It's quite mindboggling to think that a person could be starring in a movie which is primarily focused on the value of life as its subject all the while risking his own life with drug abuse simultaneously in between shooting. I really like John Cassavetes as Dr. Emerson in this story he's got a professional yet snide demeanor that really makes him effective as the villain of the piece. Christine Lahti shines as another doctor taking care of Ken Harrison who at first cannot sympathize with his plight but gradually becomes receptive to his feelings. The relationship between the Lahti and Dreyfuss characters is one of the strongest assets in the film. 12 out of ".

Mary Jo Sadler is the young inexperienced new nurse and Rodriguez is the veteran. John is a friendly orderly. Dr. Clare Scott Christine Lahti is concerned about Ken and Dr. Michael Emerson John Cassavetes is the hardnosed supervisor who insists that he knows what's best. Ken drives away his supportive dancer girlfriend Pat. He hires lawyer Carter Hill Bob Balaban to sue for his right to die.This is an amazing character played by an icon. It's as simple as that. The emotions are all on display despite the character's limitations. It is a compelling performance and very human.";

Give me a break! Finally Dreyfuss's decision to remain in the hospital to die at the end... the judge's ruling was specifically that he be released writ of Habeus Corpus not that he be allowed to die without treatment in the hospital!These serious problems particularly the latter where he decides to stay in the hospital just about ruin the film for me. Never mind that there's never much of a real sense of suspense or genuine emotion here and everything plays far too liberally off melodrama generated by the Dreyfuss character's decision. I'll give it 610 and I feel like I'm being generous. Comes dangerously close to trivializing the issues portrayed in the film and occasionally crosses the line... if it weren't for much more honest films with subject matter just as difficult like Dead Man Walking I might be more forgiving and just chalk it up to the best Hollywood can do with this sort of material but I know better.".

I first saw this movie when I was in high school and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it.

Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubberfaced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career which later brought us many more excellent movies.

Courtney Cox I think did the best acting job in the movie.It's worth watching if on TV but I wouldn't say it's worth buying or renting. Jim Carrey fans will of course love this movie and probably not MAN ON THE MOON. For me it's the other way around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ace Ventura Pet Detective shouldn't really be as funny as it is. It's random head scratching and just deeply juvenile and happens to be one of the funniest films ever made. Why? Jim Carrey. The man is spun gold on camera and he sells every outlandish minute of this gonzo Looney Toons goofball of a flick. It really wouldn't work without him. I mean could you imagine say Dustin Hoffman or John Travolta trying to pull of this kind of malarkey? OK I did just laugh really hard picturing that so it would be funny but only in an embarrassing way. No it had to be Carrey and he's an engine of unbridled comic mania the entire way through. One acting technique involves basing your performance off of the mannerisms of an animal and I've heard that he chose a cockatoo as the blueprint for Ace. The head bobs squirrelly movements and that epic instantly recognizable ocean crest of a hairdo. Makes sense and I couldn't unsee it after hearing that. Ace is probably the most eccentric beloved character Carrey has ever fashioned and for good reason. He's like a cannon loaded with jokes quips pop culture references personal space invading antics a complete lack of inhibitions a treasure trove of rubber faced muckery and a deep love for any and all creatures of the animal kingdom. Those are pretty much all of the qualities one should look for in a human being. I say that now but I feel like after spending ten minutes with the guy I'd look for the nearest exit. Ace is on the case when he's not goofing off which is always. Somehow he finds time to search for the missing mascot of the Miami Dolphins an actual dolphin named Snowflake. The story dimly unfolds in the background of all his tomfoolery and includes Dan Marino a suspicious billionaire Udo Kier whose exasperation at Carrey's behaviour looks very unfaked and an ice queen of a Police Chief played by Sean Young with an arc that goes to some pretty disturbing places for this kind of light fare. He also finds time to have hot jungle love with Courtney Cox and speak to people through his asshole like a deranged Muppet among many other things that will have you questioning why you're watching it only to realize it's like your twentieth viewing and you have no plans to ever stop. It's Carrey's show and he takes it into orbit never letting the mania subside for a nanosecond. He's borderline certifiable which comes in handy when he has to infiltrate a mental facility because the guy halfway to belonging there anyway. There's just so many cherished little moments mannerisms and scenes that don't ever get old for those of us that love this character. Carrey shaped the landscape of comedy a lot during this portion of his career and the mile markers that he released stand tall and undiminished to this day bringing hilarity to all. The sequel is genius too and one of those rare follow ups that is just as solid as the first.".

Jim Carrey plays his character with his typical undoubtedly unrivalled madcap charisma that has now become so famous throughout the world yet this movie probably remains the greatest example of just how outlandish a Carrey movie can be. The plot is so thin that it becomes obvious that the story was made to suit Carrey's style rather than vice versa and surprisingly succeeds well. Carrey's extremely arrogant and oddball Ace Ventura' character is unexpectedly likeable and continuously places the viewer in a fit of hysterics with the increasingly wacky scenarios he finds himself in. Carrey's off the wall antics are what made this film and direct attention away well from the flaws that the movie has.It is safe to say that Carrey was the star and provided all the highlights of this movie and while Sean Young playing Lt. Lois Einhorn and Courteney Cox in some ways aided the movie they simply came off as bitpart characters rather than stars as Carrey stole the entire show. Capable direction from Tom Shadyac is a further high spot in this movie and recognition should also be given to Jack Bernstein who cowrote an astoundingly funny script with Jim Carrey.Ace Ventura Pet Detective' is certainly one of the finest comedies Jim Carrey has offered the world so far and despite missing the more heartwarming moments that later films such as Liar Liar' 1997 offered is a good movie in it's own right. However as humour is viewer dependant it would be unfair of me to say I recommend this movie to everyone. Those people who dislike many of the Jim Carrey movies will probably not enjoy this one and I can understand why some would condemn this movie as being puerile nonsense. Many of the jokes do border on bad taste and much of the movie has an atmosphere of schoolyard humour to it. I am aware that some people will not find Carrey's zany antics and silly noises funny at all. That being said I personally do enjoy this movie and feel that fans of Jim Carrey and many other people will find this entertaining fun. To sum up  I feel this is an enjoyable movie for teenagers young adults and probably for the more openminded older audience despite being somewhat childish and risqu. Not for everyone though. My rating for Ace Ventura Pet Detective'  710.".

I've never laughed so hard in my life that was from the first time I saw it. I saw Shaun of the Dead 10 years after Carrey's vehicle that was another time when I laughed myself silly.Sure the humor is immature from time to time. But that's part of Carrey's act as the colorful gumshoe of the title who takes on the case of retrieving the Miami Dolphins' prized mascot Snowflake after it's stolen from its tank one night. Of course as the title would lead you to believe Ace Ventura is no ordinary detective. I don't do humans he asserts to us. His specialty is pets. It's hard out there for pet detectives since it's a field that nobody takes too seriously except Ace that is. So when he gets the call for duty he's all over the case.His investigation pairs him with Melissa Robinson Friends Courteney Cox and the two uncover some startling details about the Miami team's history and one of its most controversial players who missed the field goal kick at the 1984 Super Bowl that would have won the game and blames Dan Marino for the whole thing. That player hasn't been seen since. Meanwhile Ace runs afoul of Miami police department lieutenant Lois Einhorn Sean Young who seriously needs to take a chill pill and is hiding something more than just a gun under her skirt.Ace Ventura Pet Detective is a comic tour de force. Of course Carrey has done plenty of better things since this flick but for commercial purposes so let's just leave that in the future. Ace Ventura is something that only he could have done and made it work. Sure his methods are unusual but hey he gets the job done.I wonder if this flick helped to spark interest in a new law enforcement field?1010".

The mascot of the Miami Dolphins Snowflake the Dolphin has been kidnapped. It is Ace's job to find this dolphin. He has help from Courney Cox Arquette and Sean Young who has a funny but sick story towards the end. There is also an appearance by legendary Miami Dolphin player Dan Marino as himself. A hilarious film with wonderful slapstick and cuddly animals thrown in. The best part for me is seeing Ace being thrown about by a shark! Ace Ventura When Nature Calls followed. Very good!".

	schema:headline " The movie that launched Jim Carrey into orbit.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one crazy comedy that is totally being carried by Jim Carrey's performance.Sort of the problem with comedies though is its simple written story. It's as if the best writers don't want to touch the comedy genre with an 10feet pole and they are above the genre which is sort of understandable since comedies simply never have been amongst the most appreciated or high class movies. But than again on the other hand comedies also shouldn't ever be too complicated or else they wouldn't be really comedies. But at least you should always trow in some originality. Basically the only thing that makes this movie truly original is Jim Carrey.You can say that this is really the movie that launched Carrey's comedy career. Shortly after this he got parts in movies such as Dumb  Dumber The Mask and The Truman Show. It's as if director these days keep him more on a short leach but in this early movie from him there is no holding back and he goes totally overthetop with his Ace Ventura character. This is perhaps also the very same reason why Ace Ventura has grown out into a well known comical character. It's really Carrey that makes this movie and its humor work out so well since lets face it the movie its script really doesn't provide the movie with that much comical material to work with. I really can't imaging how this movie would had been without Jim Carrey in it.The movie further more also has a good supporting cast with fine actors such as Courteney Cox Sean Young Udo Kier Troy Evans John Capodice and more.No it's not its directing or overall style that makes this really a special comedy to watch. It has a very typical style in directing character treatment it's music and other little things such as this. The '90's just wasn't the best decade for movies in terms of style and its way of filmmaking. You didn't really realized it at the time but looking back at it now the '90's is perhaps the decade of movies with the least distinctive and stylish style.Luckily Jim Carrey's presence compensates for basically everything. He makes the movie a real worthwhile one although the eventual movie still is just not as classic as its main character is.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

This kind of lamebrain humor is tolerable one time is all I am saying.Carrey is good at what he does and he's far better than the script. I can enjoy moronic humor many times but this takes it to another level! How I sat through this the first time makes me shake my head in wonder except that I was with a friend at the theater so was a big Miami Dolphins fan and wanted to see how quarterback Dan Marino acted in here. The story revolves around the pro football team's dolphin mascot being stolen. Ace may be weird and a bit stupid but he has a good heart and that's why he make a likable character.Carrey can be funny with the stupid characters he plays  which includes this film  but he also be extremely annoying and wear thin fast. This is a great example of that. It's also an example of crude humor insert into what  on the surface  looks to be a cute animal picture. This is not a kids' film  certainly not appropriate. It isn't much an adult film either but it sure served Carrey well and it helped catapult him into stardom.Apparently a lot of folks like this movie because it spawned a sequel. If you thought this film was bad don't see the sequel. It makes this movie look like Citizen Kane.".

	schema:headline " Probably one of Jim Carey's more irritating movies";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people swear by this movie I swear at it. I do not particularly like this movie. It is crass funny in parts and in other parts down right disgusting just as discovering Mr Winkle on Sean Young. This movie is about evil transvestites homosexuality jealousy being a sore loser refusing to take the blame for one's actions and generally other things that I don't particularly want to watch. The mascot for the Miami Dolphins has been kidnapped and a secretary recommends a pet detective named Ace Ventura Jim Carey to solve the case. Ace discovers that somebody involved with the Dolphins kidnapped the dolphin and his trail leads to a player that missed a field goal and cost the Dolphins the grand final a few years back. This player has received a lot of hate mail from psychotic fans and you start to feel sorry for him that is until you learn that he blames somebody else. Thus he has created an elaborate ploy in which he becomes a woman so as to get back at the Dolphins for his humiliating defeat. My main criticism about this movie is the character of Ace Ventura I don't think that it suits the movie. In a way he is disgusting the most horrid character Carey has played. Now I don't mind Jim Carey his comedy style is a little over the top but generally he is a reasonable actor. It is just that this movie really puts me off him. It seems that the character of Ace and the plot of the movie clash and doesn't work. The plot is not that important though because it is Carey's character that people come to see. This is not what I watch a movie for and as such this causes problems with the movie itself. Adlibbing Carey probably did a bit of this in the movie and if done properly then it can come out well. I think ad libbed lines are best when the actor has the gift of doing it and Carey probably has. Eddie Murphy is a dream at it but then Murphy is one of my favourite comic actors. Carey on the other hand is reasonable. I think he has done some fine movie but Ace Ventura is not one of them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raymond Chow produced Lady KungFu a noholdsbarred martial arts action flick from the early 1970s directed by Feng Huang and contains shades of nearly every Bruce Lee movie from that time. When I looked at it last night I saw a number of interesting parallels between this flick and Bruce Lee's The Chinese Connection as both films were released in 1972. Most notable is that the plots bear some resemblance to one another and there is a strong sense of conflict between warring martial arts schools. Unlike The Chinese Connection however the enemy the Japanese are portrayed in a flagrant onesided racist and xenophobic light they are sometimes referred to as Japs by the main Chinese characters I know this film is set before World War II  I wonder did such racial epithets exist before then?. But I'm getting off track. Angela Mao Carter Wong and Sammo Hung star as three Chinese gongfu students studying martial arts in Korea under a famed exile Hapkido Grandmaster Han Jae Ji. They take their Hapkido training called kungfu in the film back to China and attempt to set up their own school only to face opposition from the ruling Japanese occupational forces who seek to promote their art of Judo founded in 1882 by Dr. Jigoro Kano. That's about all there is to the plot and then we have the fights. During the opening credits we're treated to one incredible sequence with Wong drubbing a band of thugs. Next there is a training sequence with Angela Mao. Then Han Jae Ji himself demonstrates his unique Hapkido fighting art. In Lady KungFu there are a number of familiar faces from Chowproduced martial arts action flicks too. Mao is probably my favorite fighter since she is mostly famous for her tragic portrayal of Bruce Lee's sister in Enter the Dragon 1973. On a side note I am currently studying Hapkido and I encourage anyone else interested in it to check out this flick.An enjoyable martial arts romp.810".

Can she compromise and how will she resolve the conflict? Don't get me wrong there is a story to this but Ms. Mao is the epitome of Hopkido here.

Angela Mao was hot commodity for Golden Harvest at the time and she takes the lead in this movie. She has this unique school girlish looks that makes her stand out in any movie she's in. Very young Sammo Hung also stars in this movie. It seems that he hasn't gotten a hair cut between this movie and the time he stared in the Enter the Dragon the following year. He's also gained lot of weight between this and the Enter the Dragon.This movie looks better now than when I first saw it. It has aged pretty well over 40 years. Still a great kung fu action movie and recommended for viewing.".

Obviously this being a martial arts film there are some spectacular fight scenes between the Japanese and the Koreans particularly the end fight where Angela Mao and Hwang in Sik take on two Japanese senseis one of whom is a dab hand with a sword and fight them to the death Angela Mao having a unique figthing technique that involves her pigtails.The main drawbacks are fairly poor dubbing on the version I've seen Angela is given a corny American accent the very cheap sets and poor acting.

Although I have never been a fan of Carter Wong or Sammo Hung Kam Bo I have enjoyed the scenes with Hwang In Sik. He is such a good high kicker.One thing that bothered me about this movie is that it looks way too similar to Fist of Fury. They even used the same guy that played the annoying Chinese man siding with the Japanese in Fist of Fury too.Definitely not as good as Fist of Fury but much better than most of the martial arts movies.

The reason I'm writing a comment is because recently I have been a little disenchanted by some of the 70's kung fu films that I have seen. People have said films like The Master of the Flying Guillotine or The Five Deadly Venoms are Fabulous but it seems to me that although there is things that are mentionable in those filmsthey lack something perhaps a story that just hooks you such as Hapkido does. The only thing I am sad about is that the DVD I bought was in poor quality visually but it was still in widescreen. I've only seen two of Mao Ying's filmsHapkido and Dance of Death. Dance of Death exhibits Mao Ying's talents but it lacks a bit in story. The difference between hapkido and dance of death is that in dance of death mao ying is constantly fighting scene after scene which could be a joy to watch...though as I said before the story lacks...HEY I just put two movie critiques in one...heheh Last words Hapkido should be a classic and it should be on DVD digitally remastered widescreen with originally Chinese language and English subtitled for the world to love..by the way this is better than fist of fury in my opinion sorry bruce...bruce is great but this movie is better.".

Then trio travels to China to start Hapkido school but Hung gets in problem thus Japanese getting interested about Hapkido school. At first Hung fights 2 drunk Japanese students they tell it to their master and Japanese makes short visit to Hapkido school. Then Hung beats even more guys in market and all Japanese wants Hung dead. Hung's friends noticed it and they advise Hung to keep it low and go to hide. Spy notices Hung's secret place and sends MartialArtist's to fight Hung. Hung beats few guys but last guy kills Hung. Coincidence Mao goes to visit secret place and founds Hung's dead body. That was it for Hapkido and BlackBear school. Without wasting any time Mao goes to BlackBear school and says If you're smart enough you let me walk. Of course they don't and if I remember right Jackie Chan is in that scene. Chan gets thrown by Mao and Chan slides in floor. After that scene Japanese invade Hapkido school and Mao and Wong escape in the nick of time. Then girl goes to Hapkido school and sees Japanese are drinking and eating. The girl goes to get Mao and Mao fights in really dark room I think that was night scene. Pretty soon Han Jae Ji arrives and he and Mao are going to teach Japanese a lesson. Thus end fight begins. I remember Japanese leader getting Samurai sword and he nearly kills Han Jae Ji. Lucky for him Mao was present and she finishes Japanese leader. In the mid of this movie Carter Wong has fight scene in BlackBear school and he gets beaten really bad. There's also dark scene when Wong fights 10 guys and they kill Wong. Why I compare this to Casablanca because its every fighters dream movie. I say this is better than Fist of Fury 1972.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having witnessed the flop of his last few contemporary dramatic pictures Cecil B. DeMille made a pledge to the public that from now on he would only make epics. True to his word he strove to make each successive picture more stupendous than the last. He had made some very effective shoestring epics in the povertystricken early 30s but by 1935 the worst of the depression was over and DeMille could at last be reunited with the big budget.While DeMille had proved on Sign of the Cross 1932 and Cleopatra 1934 that he could make a big picture without masses of extras or impressive sets he certainly knows how to make the most of those assets when he does have them. It is in The Crusades that we see the development of the style of presentation that he employed for all his subsequent epics. Rather than bombard us with the colossal he likes to gradually reveal the vastness of a place by slowly and smoothly pulling the camera back. During these moves he usually has an extra or two move horizontally across the frame at a similar pace to the camera giving the manoeuvre extra grace and momentum. Then there are the battle scenes tense and frenzied creations of Anne Bauchen's superb editing. These are similar to the ones in Cleopatra but far more effective not because of the higher production values but because the shots are held for longer and their sequencing is better timed.And while DeMille clearly loves the massive crowd shot he has enough sense to shrink the space and simplify the setting when it comes to key dialogue scenes. Compared to the busy outdoor locations many of the interiors are quite plain which helps to focus us entirely on the actors their expressions and their words. The transitions to these dramatic moments are often very smooth with the drop of a tent flap or simply a change of angle to frame the actors against a bare wall. DeMille was an expert in turning the spectacle on and off as it were according to the demands of the narrative.Given the above it's a pity that like most DeMille pictures of this era The Crusades is dramatically rather weak. The dialogue is bland and most of the characters are lazilywritten stereotypes. In the early scenes there seems to have been this attempt to cram in as many Olde Englande accessories as possible with a cheeky minstrel a burly blacksmith the king and his court all hanging out together. Mind you there is at least a fairly decent character arc in that King Richard is portrayed as a kind of medieval cad who joins the crusade for ulterior motives but is eventually humbled by his experiences. It's also a refreshingly mature approach to make Saladin an honourable foe although there is of course still the obligatory moustachioed villain in the form of some anachronistic minor king played by Joseph Schildkraut naturally.After having suffered Henry Wilcoxon's wooden turn as Mark Anthony in Cleopatra it's a major disappointment to see him again in a leading role. You might wonder why DeMille so persistently cast amateurs like Wilcoxon until you realise he selected players primarily for their physicality their talent being of secondary concern. In this light it makes sense for Wilcoxon with his prominent brow and broad shoulders to play a king. And although Joseph Schildkraut was as it happens a very good actor DeMille repeatedly cast him as these Judas figures because of his thin face and piercing eyes.But this is DeMille. Script and cast will always play second fiddle to the director's showmanship. Despite all the baloney and anachronism his visual style is on top form here. The Crusades is like a stainedglass window in a church. It will not reach us on an emotional human level but it is full of grace and majesty. Yes DeMille is often called a Victorian moralist but in his presentation and imagery he was practically medieval. And we should forgive him because he did it so well.".

	schema:headline " No history lesson but interesting look at different aspect of DeMille's genius";
	schema:reviewBody "After the release of Ridley Scott's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and 70 years after the premiere of DeMille's CRUSADES I found it interesting to see the film. Cecil B DeMille is usually associated with ancient or biblical epics like TEN COMMANDMENTS CLEOPATRA KING OF KINGS or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS. However after the two great epics of the early 1930s he made a movie about a different historical period the infamous crusades that aimed at protecting the Holy Land from the Muslim infidels. The problem with this film however is that it looks historical but contains serious historical inaccuracies. Therefore it cannot be treated as a serious historical epic and it is not a history lesson whatsoever. Nevertheless it is a very interesting movie being an authentic look at DeMille's talents and a real 1930s movie. Consequently it can still touch some of the 21 century viewers particularly classic movie fans.CHARACTERS Most of the names that we hear in THE CRUSADES are historical. They are however showed in a different perspective and addressed to the audiences of that time. DeMille calls our attention foremost to Richard the Lionheart Henry Wilcoxon and his lovely wife princess Berengaria Loretta Young. Richard is a man of courage a king who unlike other kings is close to his people. But he joins the crusade due to entirely different reasons than other kings. He does not have any faith in the cross he is to wear but wants to escape marriage with Alice Katherine DeMille the sister of Philip king of France. On the way to the Holy Land he meets the love of his life Berengaria a very noble and pure lady who in the long run changes Richard into a peacemaker and believer. These two characters are very well developed and their plot has much to say to today's viewer the love between a man and a woman does not have to be based on sex only. Their love is mostly a spiritual love rather than sexual one so appreciated by Medieval people. It is showed a bit humorously in the moment when Richard dares jump into his wife's bed dedicated to John Matthew Luke and Mark... Another character that needs mentioning is the Hermit C.Aubrey Smith. This is a man of great courage and faith whose sole aim in life is the cross. Take the Cross to your hearts as he says to the people in England gathered to join the crusade is a particularly powerful moment.CAST Even though Henry Wilcoxon plays the main role he is not that good in this movie. As a matter of fact I far more liked his performance in CLEOPATRA 1934. His acting behavior of a proud man suits Antony very well but does not suit Richard that well. Stars who deserve highest attention in this movie are C.Aubrey Smith as the Hermit Ian Keith as Saladin and Joseph Schildkraut as Conrad Marquis of Montferrat. Smith memorably presents a stereotypical hermit this face and this voice! Keith stresses Saladin's wisdom and an indefatigable desire to defend his religion. He shines in the scene when visiting the royal assembly. Finally Schildkraut undeniably deserves careful attention in his magnificent portrayal of conspiring Conrad. It is true that his role is distorted historically but he does in this performance alone a terrific job. Loretta Young's performance however is far from masterpiece. Sometimes she is sweeter than chocolate with sugar.DIFFERENT DeMILLE It is noticeable that THE CRUSADES though an epic concentrates more on message rather than lavish sets and costumes. As a result DeMille is less noticeable than in lavish CLEOPATRA or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS. What we get here is the story vivid characters message of peace. That is very important to state since a lot of people associate DeMille ONLY with sets visual effects costumes and bathes. Here he gives something more. It is true that there are monumental moments like the siege of Acre or a touching scene of crusaders leaving their families for the Holy Land but they are not in the main focus.This film is filled with one more thing that I consider significant to mention SYMBOLISM. It is in other DeMille's movies too but never that much as in THE CRUSADES. The most memorable moment is a scene of salvation. Simple crusaders die and just before their last breath they desire to touch the Cross. They climb high steps enlightened by the light coming from above. It is similar to Christians going to arena in THE SIGH OF THE CROSS but here it really seems that DeMille wanted to show a vision of heaven.In the end the film shows the victory of peace. It is a historical fairy tale but partly refers to the period of peace between Christians and Muslims termed by Saladin. This led another director to make a movie 70 years later... THE CRUSADES however is still entertaining in some way. It is not for historians but a must see for all DeMille's fans and all people interested in early talkies. 710!".

	schema:headline " DeMille Leave's Old World History For Awhile";
	schema:reviewBody "Cecil B. DeMille's spectacles were mostly bound to America and Americans for most of the silent film period into the early talkies. His exceptions were the original Ten Commandments but there was a modern story set in America as well as the tale of Moses and King of Kings where he told the story of Jesus's Ministry. Then in 1933 he decided to do movies that dealt with the history of the ancient world. First came Sign of the Cross in 1933 and then Cleopatra in 1934. Both were in the Roman Empire and both allowed DeMille ample scope to be lascivious and tantalizing about sex and yet be moralistic as well especially in Sign of the Cross. Both had Claudette Colbert in them in the female lead shared in Sign of the Cross with Elissa Landi. Sign had Charles Laughton and Frederic March in the leads. But Cleopatra only had Henry Wilcoxon and Warren Williams as the leads. Still both films were very successful.DeMille seems to have planned to tap European and Middle Eastern history for awhile. His next historical pageant is The Crusades which while an entertaining film none of his films are less than entertaining is not as good as the first two. It is actually telling the story of the Third Crusade of 1190  92 and although lauded in some of these comments as being historically accurate it doesn't really go into it too well. The third crusade was led by Richard the Lion Hearted King Richard I of England King Philippe Augustus of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarosa. Now the movie does show Philippe at the initial planning stages and Richard soon getting involve. But aside from an occasional mention of Barbarosa and one or two brief glimpses of an actor as the Emperor his character is never developed. Frederick Barbarosa was a lead player in this crusade and he drowned trying to ford a stream during the early part of it. This was a real tragedy for the European invaders as Frederick had been umpiring the constant arguments between Philippe and Richard neither of whom liked each other. None of that is in the film.To fully appreciate this film flaws and all watch it first after seeing Becket and then The Lion in Winter. Those two films tell the story of Richard Plantagenet's daddy and mommy Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Henry II had built up his kingdom and power despite problems from his old friend Thomas a'Becket. Most of the power was due to the inheritance of Eleanor in France which was her dowry. Eleanor had been Queen of France briefly but divorced King Louis and took her property with her. Henry was in a very good position to dominate King Louis and his son Philippe. But from The Lion in Winter you will remember that Philippe tells off Henry that time is on his side  Henry is going to die soon and Philippe is young. Philippe was also very sly. He was more interested in getting Richard into the Crusade so to weaken the English government and allow Philippe to make incursions into Eleanor's power base. And it worked like a charm. Once Barbarosa was dead Philippe took advantage of the first argument with Richard to take his men back to France. Soon he was in touch with Richard's brother Prince John who was regent for the king. John soon makes arrangements to keep Richard from ever coming home again. At this point I'd suggest you see The Adventures of Robin Hood followed by Robin and Marion to see the return of Richard and the end of his lamentably bad reign.DeMille hints at the political skulduggery. Note the business between Conrad of Montsarrat the potential King of Jerusalem and John. But John is made to be the mainspring of these conspiracies. That he was involved there is not doubt but Philippe was the real key to them.There is also another issue touched on in The Lion In Winter but dropped here  DeMille would never have discussed it in the context of a hero. Richard I was gay. His marriage to Berengaria was not a love match although made one here and in the later film King Richard and the Crusaders based on Sir Walter Scott's The Talisman. So on that part the film is not accurate. The battle for Acre was very bloody but the worst part of it which Arab historians have bristled about for centuries  British ones tended to ignore it were the massacres of Arab and Jewish citizens at Acre. Somewhere over 30000 at least were killed. This atrocity was sort of dropped from the movie.The acting is good and some of the scenes quite fascinating the marriage by proxy of Berengaria and Richard represented by his friend the minstrel Blondel The literal horse or cattle trading by the King of Navarre for his daughter to get married is funny. Especially moving is a scene where Richard sees his old friend the blacksmith die after a fight with the Saracens. The Crusades was a box office flop. DeMille for the next 15 years made films about American History beginning with The Plainsman. Only in 1949 did the old world beckon again with Samson and Delilah. And his final masterpiece the second Ten Commandments would be his picture of ancient Egypt.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cecil B. DeMille's spectacles were mostly bound to America and Americans for most of the silent film period into the early talkies. His exceptions were the original Ten Commandments but there was a modern story set in America as well as the tale of Moses and King of Kings where he told the story of Jesus's Ministry. Then in 1933 he decided to do movies that dealt with the history of the ancient world. First came Sign of the Cross in 1933 and then Cleopatra in 1934. Both were in the Roman Empire and both allowed DeMille ample scope to be lascivious and tantalizing about sex and yet be moralistic as well especially in Sign of the Cross. Both had Claudette Colbert in them in the female lead shared in Sign of the Cross with Elissa Landi. Sign had Charles Laughton and Frederic March in the leads. But Cleopatra only had Henry Wilcoxon and Warren Williams as the leads. Still both films were very successful.DeMille seems to have planned to tap European and Middle Eastern history for awhile. His next historical pageant is The Crusades which while an entertaining film none of his films are less than entertaining is not as good as the first two. It is actually telling the story of the Third Crusade of 1190  92 and although lauded in some of these comments as being historically accurate it doesn't really go into it too well. The third crusade was led by Richard the Lion Hearted King Richard I of England King Philippe Augustus of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarosa. Now the movie does show Philippe at the initial planning stages and Richard soon getting involve. But aside from an occasional mention of Barbarosa and one or two brief glimpses of an actor as the Emperor his character is never developed. Frederick Barbarosa was a lead player in this crusade and he drowned trying to ford a stream during the early part of it. This was a real tragedy for the European invaders as Frederick had been umpiring the constant arguments between Philippe and Richard neither of whom liked each other. None of that is in the film.To fully appreciate this film flaws and all watch it first after seeing Becket and then The Lion in Winter.

He was NOT very noble or chivalrous and was probably one of England's worst kings. Instead he delighted in going to war and was renowned for his bravery and brutalitysacking cities and killing everyone inside! He spoke Frenchor at least the French language of his empire in what is modern Western France. Although he adored war and manly deeds he showed little interest in womenand pretty much ignored his wife. This has led to speculation that he was gay. Not surprisingly he didn't leave an heir.Now the Cecil B. DeMille version of Richard Henry Wilcoxon in The Crusades is not as flowery and ridiculous as that in many other films of the era. He was a warrior first in this filmwhich is who Richard truly was. But in the film he is a nice and good kinga man to be admired ha!. And although initially showing no interest in women or his poor wife the film later shows a touching romance between him and his queen Berengaria Loretta Young. Weirdly however his strange relationship with his enemy Saladin Ian Keith isn't that far from reality. Despite being enemies there was a strange respect and admiration between themand when ill Saladin really did apparently send doctors to treat Richard! Let's put aside the historical problems with the film there are many more. After all as a retired history teacher it's easy for me to go on and on about this...and thus bore you to tears! How is the film as entertainment? Well it's a very mixed bag. Despite being a film about war and death and the like it's amazingly subdued and VERY talky through the first half of the film. I kept hoping to see someone kill someonebut they kept talking and talking. Some of this wasn't all bad there was a serious rivalry between Richard and the King of Franceand a lot of plotting but for an action film there was a tremendous lack of action. Later things did heat up a bit and I must admit the costumes and battles were pretty well orchestratedthough on a relatively small scale despite nice props for a DeMille film is lacked the huge cast you'd usually expect. And even when fighting FINALLY broke out there still was a lot of talking and talking. It's not good...but at least it beats King Richard and the Crusadersa horrible epic about the same material done in the 1950s.So overall it's a dull film with some historical errors. It's certainly not among the worst films about the subject but you can certainly do better. For example the wonderful series on the Crusades by Terry Gilliam is leapyears bettermore interesting more accurate and oddly a bit funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever else you can say about Richard I the Lion Hearted he was a mighty warrior in battle. In fact he loved wars and battles so much he spent very little time ruling his own kingdom. Remembering that his kingdom was not just England but a good deal of what is now France it is estimated that he may have spent at most six months on the British Isles.Not that his brother John was any bargain. But Richard and his wars cost his people a great deal in taxation. England was in medieval chapter 11 after he was done. Yet his legend as a warrior lives on perpetuated greatly by Cecil B. DeMille and this film. It's a typical DeMille product characterized by topflight spectacle and action scenes and some arcane dialog the kind that was used when DeMille was learning his trade from David Belasco in the early 20th century.DeMille sent out for his leading lady over to Fox for Loretta Young. I'm sure Ms. Young was more than happy to star in The Crusades as she Irene Dunne and Rosalind Russell were THE three Catholic stars of the screen. Young plays Berengaria of Navarre who has the dubious distinction of being the only Queen of England never to set foot on English soil.Berengaria here and in real life was a political pawn in an arranged marriage. Richard was supposed to marry Princess Alice of France played here by Katharine DeMille. But for the real story of who Richard would have married in a love match check out The Lion In Winter. Berengaria survived her husband by about 30 years. I'm sure in real life she was one lonely person.DeMille tried hard to make his good friend Henry Wilcoxon a star both here and in Cleopatra. Wilcoxon as an actor did far better away from C.B. than with him. He's probably best known for playing the Vicar in Mrs. Miniver.It's hard to sympathize with Richard. Even in this favorable treatment of him he comes across like a blundering fool. He goes to The Crusades in the first place to get out of marrying Alice because any promises would be absolved if he went on Crusade to reclaim Jerusalem for Christendom. And after that it's one blunder after another.Remember in Patton George C. Scott remarks how much he enjoys all the combat and how Karl Malden chides him for just that. The plain truth is that was what got Richard going in the morning. Sex with whomever didn't measure up to a good battle.Ian Keith as Saladin comes off far better. He was a genuine warrior hero defending his kingdom as chivalrous a person as the Christian knights claim to be. And politically he spins rings around Richard. So does the wily Conrad of Montferrat as played by Joseph Schildkraut. Another reviewer described him as unctuous. That's the word that fits him best. In fact in a later role in The Shop Around the Corner Schildkraut practically patented unctuous for the screen. The spectacle is grand the Battle of Acre was one of the most ambitious screen undertakings up to that point. But a Victorian script and a fool for a hero defeats this film.I'd recommend the recent Kingdom of Heaven for a more accurate depiction of The Cruades. I'd even recommend King Richard and the Crusaders with George Sanders as Richard and Rex Harrison as Saladin as being better.".

	schema:headline " DeMille assassinates the King of Jerusalem characterwise at least";
	schema:reviewBody "Having seen Ridley Scott's 'Kingdom of Heaven' and returned to my 12C passions I decided to check this out having seen it on TV many years ago. How I survived it without smashing the tape is a miracle. What appeal the film has is in the realms of kitschhigh camp  as unwitting twisted comedy for which I'm giving it 510. 'Kingdom' is gratuitously ahistorical but this is just as bad if not worse in some ways. At least I could sortof recognise three or four characters in 'Kingdom'. What particularly outraged my chivalric instincts was the script's characterassassination of Conrad King of Jerusalem  over and above the physical Assassination he suffered in 1192. Imagine Sir Walter Scott's 'The Talisman' spliced with Maurice Hewlett's 'The Life  Death of Richard YeaandNay'. Add to this some 'romance novelette' clichs the rivalry between blonde angelic Berengaria and dark worldly Alice Berengaria torn between Saladin and Richard her rle in reforming and redeeming her selfish irreligious husband. The religious ethos is a Victorian Protestant Sunday School version of medival spirituality just as unperiod as 'Kingdom''s easygoing 21C goodwill to all which Berengaria prefigures when she pleads for peace between Richard and Saladin. Richard's England is depicted as a bucolic jolly place the 19C fantasy of 'Merrie England' and as his main home in fact he spent very little time there being essentially a Frenchman. There are also hints of 19C exoticerotic Orientalism right at the start we see beautiful Christian maidens and a middleaged nun being sold at a slavemarket in Jerusalem. Visually there are some striking scenes by the standards of 1930s cinematography and special effects the siege of Acre a cavalry charge. But the film is rather more characterdriven than some of DeMille's other epics and the characters are the weak link.Alan Hale does his jovial minstrelAllanaDale act as Blondel performing musichall songs that more closely resemble the uvre of Eric Idle's minstrel in 'Monty Python  the Holy Grail' 'The Ballad of Brave Sir Robin' than the melodic output of the Lord of Nesle. Ian Keith's tooyouthful Saladin is more Boston Brahmin than Kurd. According to DeMille Frederick Barbarossa did make it on Crusade alive !!! as did William II of Sicily and Russians and Norwegians were there too. However there's no sign of Guy de Lusignan Queen Sibylla or any of the other resident Frankish nobility anywhere! But what struck me most forcibly was the misrepresentation of Conrad Marquis of Montferrat and King of Jerusalem c 114592 one of the era's most dashing and tragic heroes. This is a result of the Romantic 19C cult of Richard 'the Lionheart' which Walter Scott did so much to foster and on which DeMille was clearly raised.Conrad is played by Josef Schildkraut as a sleekit sinister weedy and somewhat camp schemer with a bizarre chevron haircut and matching helmet. The Byzantine chronicler Choniates who knew him described him as handsome courageous intelligent and strong. As in Hewlett's novel he is introduced lurking furtively around Philippe's court in France when the Crusade is preached. In reality this indomitable dynamic Piemontese warrior had been defending Tyre  one of the last major cities in Frankish hands  since July 1187 without Western support. His envoy Archbishop Josias of Tyre not a simple Peter the Hermitlike 'Holy Man' as played by C. Aubrey Smith was the source of the appeals that launched the Third Crusade. Conrad saved the remnant of the Latin Kingdom pretty much singlehanded and was lauded as the Marqus valens e pros by troubadours such as Peirol and Bertran de Born. Even the Arab chronicler Ibn alAthir acknowledged him as a man of extraordinary courage as well as a sharp political operator. You would not suspect this from DeMille's depiction. The film also shows him on a visit to England conspiring with John to kill Richard so that John and Philippe will make him King of Jerusalem. This is arrant nonsense John had no part in the politics of the Latin Kingdom. We see nothing of the dispute for the throne with Guy de Lusignan whom Richard was supporting hence the understandable antipathy. Finally Conrad is summarily murdered offscreen by Saladin's men for offering to have Richard killed if he will make him King. Again this is loosely derived from Maurice Hewlett. In fact he was mortally wounded by Assassins Nizari Isma'ili days after he was elected King by the barons of the Kingdom. His pregnant widow Queen Isabella was married off to Richard's nephew a week later. Richard is a major suspect in the murder but again one would never guess from this film. Essentially this characterisation is derived from Scott's 'The Talisman'  a Gothic novelera racist stereotype of 'sneaky cowardly and effete Italian'  with elements from Maurice Hewlett. Peire Vidal who dedicated songs to Conrad's siblings Boniface and Azalas might justly have railed against the scriptwriters as fals lauzengiers desleials. Conrad's real Assassination was tragic enough his posthumous cinematic characterassassination is undeserved and leaves a particularly nasty taste.".

There are also hints of 19C exoticerotic Orientalism right at the start we see beautiful Christian maidens and a middleaged nun being sold at a slavemarket in Jerusalem. Visually there are some striking scenes by the standards of 1930s cinematography and special effects the siege of Acre a cavalry charge. But the film is rather more characterdriven than some of DeMille's other epics and the characters are the weak link.Alan Hale does his jovial minstrelAllanaDale act as Blondel performing musichall songs that more closely resemble the uvre of Eric Idle's minstrel in 'Monty Python  the Holy Grail' 'The Ballad of Brave Sir Robin' than the melodic output of the Lord of Nesle. Ian Keith's tooyouthful Saladin is more Boston Brahmin than Kurd. According to DeMille Frederick Barbarossa did make it on Crusade alive !!! as did William II of Sicily and Russians and Norwegians were there too. However there's no sign of Guy de Lusignan Queen Sibylla or any of the other resident Frankish nobility anywhere! But what struck me most forcibly was the misrepresentation of Conrad Marquis of Montferrat and King of Jerusalem c 114592 one of the era's most dashing and tragic heroes. This is a result of the Romantic 19C cult of Richard 'the Lionheart' which Walter Scott did so much to foster and on which DeMille was clearly raised.Conrad is played by Josef Schildkraut as a sleekit sinister weedy and somewhat camp schemer with a bizarre chevron haircut and matching helmet. The Byzantine chronicler Choniates who knew him described him as handsome courageous intelligent and strong. As in Hewlett's novel he is introduced lurking furtively around Philippe's court in France when the Crusade is preached. In reality this indomitable dynamic Piemontese warrior had been defending Tyre  one of the last major cities in Frankish hands  since July 1187 without Western support. His envoy Archbishop Josias of Tyre not a simple Peter the Hermitlike 'Holy Man' as played by C. Aubrey Smith was the source of the appeals that launched the Third Crusade. Conrad saved the remnant of the Latin Kingdom pretty much singlehanded and was lauded as the Marqus valens e pros by troubadours such as Peirol and Bertran de Born. Even the Arab chronicler Ibn alAthir acknowledged him as a man of extraordinary courage as well as a sharp political operator. You would not suspect this from DeMille's depiction. The film also shows him on a visit to England conspiring with John to kill Richard so that John and Philippe will make him King of Jerusalem. This is arrant nonsense John had no part in the politics of the Latin Kingdom. We see nothing of the dispute for the throne with Guy de Lusignan whom Richard was supporting hence the understandable antipathy. Finally Conrad is summarily murdered offscreen by Saladin's men for offering to have Richard killed if he will make him King. Again this is loosely derived from Maurice Hewlett. In fact he was mortally wounded by Assassins Nizari Isma'ili days after he was elected King by the barons of the Kingdom. His pregnant widow Queen Isabella was married off to Richard's nephew a week later. Richard is a major suspect in the murder but again one would never guess from this film. Essentially this characterisation is derived from Scott's 'The Talisman'  a Gothic novelera racist stereotype of 'sneaky cowardly and effete Italian'  with elements from Maurice Hewlett. Peire Vidal who dedicated songs to Conrad's siblings Boniface and Azalas might justly have railed against the scriptwriters as fals lauzengiers desleials. Conrad's real Assassination was tragic enough his posthumous cinematic characterassassination is undeserved and leaves a particularly nasty taste.";

Add to this a very crafty script that quietly and gracefully clears up all promises ties up loose ends and creates a completely believable mix of unique characterizations and DeMille's Crusades ends up being a very delicious and powerful romantic story.I've not previously been very interested in DeMille's career beyond his importance to Hollywood and film history but this movie made it clear that he is an expert craftsman and artist.PolarisDiB".

In fact Young's abduction by the Muslims with her dressed as a sentry in a suicidal bid to end the discord between the various royals! is pretty contrived similarly the fact that Young is contended in the terms laid down by Saladin for the truce with the Christian world is pure Hollywood.

Henry Wilcoxon's Richard the Lionheart gives along with his star turn as Marc Anthony in DeMille's CLEOPATRA the previous year the greatest performance of his entire career. Mesmerizing in its power just as effective today as when it was filmed in 1935. A mustsee for all who esteem the epicspectacle genre. Fine performances given by an allstar cast right down to DeMille regulars in supporting roles. They don't get much better than this!";

	schema:headline " Typical DeMille  and that's not at all bad";
	schema:reviewBody "Nobody ever accused DeMille of painstaking historical accuracy  his films are far more the type to set the mood and tell a good story with a historical period as a background. The Crusades is a prime example  historically Richard the Lionheart was a lousy king of England who barely spent a year in England during his entire reign  to him England was merely a source for taxes and troops so he fight the his continental wars. The opening scene of the movie when the Chrisitians captured at Jerusalem are being sold into slavery with the obligatory Muslim leering at the blonde Christian beauties is also historically suspect. Saladin and his generals expected the Christian nobility that was captured at Jerusalem to ransom the common people prisoners. When they didn't Saladin and his generals were so disgusted at such a lack of concern that they ended up ransoming many of the commoners themselves  supposedly Saladin personally ransomed several hundred so they could return to Europe. But I digress.This is a movie which contains a scene that has stayed with me for several decades. I doubt if it would play well today  I can't think of any actors who could pull it off. The scene is where the Christian leaders of the Crusade meet Saladin for the first time when Saladin comes to warn them to go back to Europe. The various Kings dukes et al are all seated and listen to Saladin's message. Richard the Lionheart then steps up and tells Saladin that the Christians aren't afraid that their armies are powerful and to illustrate his point he has two servants hold an iron mace while he proceeds to cleave it in two with his sword. An impressive display of the strength of his blade. But Saladin has a priceless response. He walks over to Berengaria and asks if he can have her silk veil. He takes the veil tosses it into the air and then pulls his own sword and positions it below the falling veil blade up. The veil falls onto the blade and is cut in two by its own weight  for this was a famed Damascus blade. Saladin's point  brute strength isn't everything. Of course all of the Christian nobles just drop their mouths in utter shock at the demonstration. A priceless scene  and an illustration of the little things that separate a humdrum film from one you enjoy watching time and time again.".

Richard was not a Christian and de Mille shows this. He gave the usual lip service but he represented the mercantile endeavors of those who used the papal promises for their own ends. The pope made the mistake of granting Richard rule over all Christians in the conquered lands. What this led to was Richard simply slaughtering any person who wasn't guaranteed to be under his rule which meant non Christians.This was the savagery of the Crusades. It had nothing to do with religion but of men taking advantage of religion. In a subtle way de Mille does show this.Saladin was well depicted. Despite what critics say he was one of the more benevolent of warriors which isn't saying a lot but if you were captured by a Moslem force you would rather it be by Saladin than most others. He could be reasoned with. if nothing else you could convert to Islam and be spared by him.The business with the sneaky European who Saladin killed is derived from another instance well chronicled dealing with a man whose evil was not nearly as Mickey Mouse as this villain and who would've tried any person's patience. he was the terrorist of the era and Saladin offered the cup of safety to everyone he captured but this man. The incident is depicted fairly faithfully in the modern epic Kingdom of Heaven.de Mille simply combines all the events into one main event and that's fair poetic license. Certainly closer to the truth than Tombstone is of Wyatt Earp and the Clantons.The personal lives are laughably unbelievable. King Richard comes across as gay and he probably was gay or bisexual resisting romance with the gorgeous princess of France spurning her and then later becoming enchanted with a very homely princess of another land. Loretta Young looks her worst for this. She is figuratively the ugly step sister and we see the hand of women in the making of this to be a chick flick where the homely girl gets the romance and the pretty girl is out in the cold. Nice fantasy for the female wallflowers but men had to be shaking their heads at this particularly when Saladin falls for the pale homely girl when we know how beautiful Arabian women are. Loretta is not usually this plain. Her hair looks pitifully bland but we have to remember this is a Hollywood movie and Hollywood has always pushed the blonde woman look in heir chick flicks to appease the female audience.We get a lot of ho hum no risk same old stuff. The nice guys all die of course true to Hollywood clichs. The hero has to start off as a creep and actually he's a total monster but de Mille does some clever snake oil soft soap to make us think he isn't a monster.It's easily one of de Mille's worst works.

A knowledge of the dramatis personae and the basic circumstances is presumed of the viewer just as Homer expected his listeners to know who Paris was or how Iphigenia died.Unlike any other Trojan War film I've seen this one like Homer includes the gods and their divine intervention in human affairs. Achilles' nearinvincibility is a supernatural fact as demonstrated in a scene when he's stabbed and the blade is destroyed as if blasted by lightning. Yet the film doesn't feel like a fantasy as do similar films about Jason Hercules or Ulysses it's a psychological drama in which the psyche of the main character is driven by his understanding of his divine destiny. An oracle has revealed that Troy cannot fall until its champion Hector dies Hector cannot die until Achilles slays him and once that happens Achilles must die. This is the burden of greatness  and doom  that lies upon Achilles.Even dubbed Gordon Mitchell gives a powerful and convincing portrayal of the warrior who is both hero and monster. His physical presence is perfect his physique is statuesque but his features are so rugged as to be ugly think of Charles Bronson or Jack Palance he is sexually alluring physically intimidating and frightening to look at.The script is surprisingly sometimes amazingly literate verging on the poetic. Especially memorable are Achilles' explanation of his invulnerability to the captured Briseis which ironically reveals his vulnerability and wins her pity and affection Patroclus' plea to Hector to kill him after he's been wounded and Hector's farewell speech to his wife and the people of Troy before he goes out to battle Achilles. The climactic duel between the two warriors is very wellstaged and utterly riveting.I wonder if the makers of TROY saw this movie? If so they learned nothing from it. If they had simply done a remake of this film reproducing its insights into the tragedy of Achilles and Hector Brad Pitt would be the possessor of an Oscar today!Here's the rub this movie is very hard to locate on DVD at least in the US. The only copy I've found on a compilation DVD called RETURN TO TROY is from a very degraded fullscreen print hardly watchable by most viewer's standards.

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Good";
	schema:reviewBody "It's kind of silly to realize that Achillies  played here by Gordon Mitchell one of the demigods of cult cinema  was also personified at one point by twigboy turned actor Brad Pitt in Wolfgang OneShot Peterson's TROY which basically tells the same story who's career zenith still remains the stoner roommate from TRUE ROMANCE. The two performers and the two performances are incomparable as are the two films made four decades and a couple of continents apart. One is a silly computer enhanced vanity piece for a number of special interest causes the other a low budget yet undeniably powerful genre film that was far better than it ever had to be. I will let you figure out which was which.One should never confuse movies or their content with the real world hello Michael Moore! since movies are ultimately meant to entertain those who watch them rather than serve as literal interpretations of history facts even legend or myth. A good working example is the ongoing debate amongst fans of the Western as to who was a better shot  John Wayne Clint Eastwood or Lee Van Cleef. The answer is of course neither Anthony Steffen gets my vote since they were all actors and the gunplay was special effects work. BUT if there was one film from the Peplum era of Italian sword  sandal films that I would recommend to a history professor who wants to help make Greek mythological history come to life I'd pick FURY OF ACHILLIES. This is such a wellwritten and well acted film  even when dubbed into English  that the history it tells really does come to life. Much of that credit should go to Marino Girolami father of Enzo G. Castellari god bless him and his choice of muscleman turned genre star Gordon Mitchell as Achillies. Standing 6'3 and about 225lbs of sheer attitude Mitchell is quite believable as the invulnerable ultimate warrior of Greek mythology and I will hazard to opine that Mr. Pitt was too busy having his nails buffed to bother watching this film to realize that the trick is not just in Mitchell's bulk but the way that he carries himself that makes his character SO much larger than life. Mitchell really carries this movie which might be his finest hour behind the shield.And as any performer will attest if it isn't on the page it isn't on the stage writer Gino De Santis' surprisingly poetic and verse oriented script is wonderfully faithful to the literary traditions that gave birth to such names as Achillies Hector Troy and Odysseus. Special mention should be made of familiar genre face Mario Petri's portrayal of the agonized King Agamemnon driven mad for power by the sacrifice of his young daughter to the gods. It is Agamemnon's agonized vanity that results in the film's dramatic meat  potatoes highlighted by a number of genuinely moving funerary scenes dramatic speeches fights to the death vows of allegiance or damnation. Here actually is the stuff of legends realized on film with a sort of restrained grandeur by director Girolami who worked within the modest budget allotted to create a masterful telling of myth that is still quite human.Most of these Peplum thrillers are silly spectacle films centered around a muscleman hero special effects setpieces sexy Veil Dances and maybe a duplicitous scheming Caesar or sorcerer pulling the strings of our hero. This time our hero is on his own sort of thrust into his role of savior of his army  people's with little or no regards to how he may feel about it. That is what is often referred to as fate and if Mr. Peterson's film had managed to capture such universal indifference to our own petty concerns as mere mortals it might be remembered as something more than the film where Gladiators finally came out of their collective closet. Another point missed by TROY HANNIBAL the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and some of the other epic sweeping historical budgetevent films of the mid 2000's is that these Italian Peplum potboilers were made with such low budgets that their directors writers set designers and performers had to rely on their wits imagination resourcefulness and iron necks to make what could have and often did result in films that were absurd. Here is one that didn't and might be the best example of the Peplum thriller as a take on history that I at least have ever encountered. And is a wonderful example of humanity's penchant for story telling without the need for computer animated effects which for my money always take the fun out of stuff like this by allowing you to bypass your own sense of imagination. This one engages it and is almost as good as the myths upon which it was based.910 and very worthy of a proper restoration.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's kind of silly to realize that Achillies  played here by Gordon Mitchell one of the demigods of cult cinema  was also personified at one point by twigboy turned actor Brad Pitt in Wolfgang OneShot Peterson's TROY which basically tells the same story who's career zenith still remains the stoner roommate from TRUE ROMANCE. The two performers and the two performances are incomparable as are the two films made four decades and a couple of continents apart. One is a silly computer enhanced vanity piece for a number of special interest causes the other a low budget yet undeniably powerful genre film that was far better than it ever had to be. I will let you figure out which was which.One should never confuse movies or their content with the real world hello Michael Moore! since movies are ultimately meant to entertain those who watch them rather than serve as literal interpretations of history facts even legend or myth. A good working example is the ongoing debate amongst fans of the Western as to who was a better shot  John Wayne Clint Eastwood or Lee Van Cleef. The answer is of course neither Anthony Steffen gets my vote since they were all actors and the gunplay was special effects work. BUT if there was one film from the Peplum era of Italian sword  sandal films that I would recommend to a history professor who wants to help make Greek mythological history come to life I'd pick FURY OF ACHILLIES. This is such a wellwritten and well acted film  even when dubbed into English  that the history it tells really does come to life. Much of that credit should go to Marino Girolami father of Enzo G. Castellari god bless him and his choice of muscleman turned genre star Gordon Mitchell as Achillies. Standing 6'3 and about 225lbs of sheer attitude Mitchell is quite believable as the invulnerable ultimate warrior of Greek mythology and I will hazard to opine that Mr. Pitt was too busy having his nails buffed to bother watching this film to realize that the trick is not just in Mitchell's bulk but the way that he carries himself that makes his character SO much larger than life. Mitchell really carries this movie which might be his finest hour behind the shield.And as any performer will attest if it isn't on the page it isn't on the stage writer Gino De Santis' surprisingly poetic and verse oriented script is wonderfully faithful to the literary traditions that gave birth to such names as Achillies Hector Troy and Odysseus. Special mention should be made of familiar genre face Mario Petri's portrayal of the agonized King Agamemnon driven mad for power by the sacrifice of his young daughter to the gods. It is Agamemnon's agonized vanity that results in the film's dramatic meat  potatoes highlighted by a number of genuinely moving funerary scenes dramatic speeches fights to the death vows of allegiance or damnation. Here actually is the stuff of legends realized on film with a sort of restrained grandeur by director Girolami who worked within the modest budget allotted to create a masterful telling of myth that is still quite human.Most of these Peplum thrillers are silly spectacle films centered around a muscleman hero special effects setpieces sexy Veil Dances and maybe a duplicitous scheming Caesar or sorcerer pulling the strings of our hero. This time our hero is on his own sort of thrust into his role of savior of his army  people's with little or no regards to how he may feel about it. That is what is often referred to as fate and if Mr. Peterson's film had managed to capture such universal indifference to our own petty concerns as mere mortals it might be remembered as something more than the film where Gladiators finally came out of their collective closet. Another point missed by TROY HANNIBAL the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and some of the other epic sweeping historical budgetevent films of the mid 2000's is that these Italian Peplum potboilers were made with such low budgets that their directors writers set designers and performers had to rely on their wits imagination resourcefulness and iron necks to make what could have and often did result in films that were absurd. Here is one that didn't and might be the best example of the Peplum thriller as a take on history that I at least have ever encountered. And is a wonderful example of humanity's penchant for story telling without the need for computer animated effects which for my money always take the fun out of stuff like this by allowing you to bypass your own sense of imagination. This one engages it and is almost as good as the myths upon which it was based.910 and very worthy of a proper restoration.";

The lead is a little bit stiff but on the other hand that's maybe just the way they wanted Achilles to be! The direction is fantastic giving the battle scenes at night a very theatrical feeling through the uncommon use of the lightning. Editing is surprisingly good too as are all the other actors. Carlo Savina's score is also a gem. It's really funny that this 60s movie beats Petersen's version in every category! A mustsee! There is a German widescreen DVD but image quality is not that good possibly because of the shoddy company that gave the license. I hope a good English DVD will be available sometime!".

Throughout the film the wellpaced and convincing battlescenes are interspersed with many instances of wellwritten dialogue from the main characters conveying the deeply humanistic motives running throughout the Iliad. There are no crass scenes heroes show fear or nobility whilst kings betray their obligations or come to their senses and do the right thing.

As for the casting Gordon Mitchell is just right as Achilles and gives a fine performance. This film is highly recommended.".

Achilles  a fierce Mitchell and Hector a rugged Bergerac both carry the film..and are well portrayed and the plentiful action is believable and wellstaged. Like other fans of this film I marvel at the superior product of a modest budget which far outshines the overblown Troy. The only faults were the misrepresentation of the relationship with Patroclus and the fact that Queen Helen is neither seen nor barely even alluded to. And oddly the audience doesn't get the fulfillment of the prophecy the death of Achilles by being shot in his heel For these reasons I would rank Robert Wise's Helen of Troy as number one and Fury of Achilles as a very close second. All other versions are not even contenders. Mitchell's portrayal of the conflicted Greek hero is a much more interesting and faceted one than has ever been rendered before...and the doomed Hector as played by Bergerac has a worthy rival indeed. It is to be hoped that this film will be restored to its original glory the prints available on video and DVD currently are too poor a quality to do it justice.".

This movie is typical of the sword and sandal films of the period but better than most. The story pretty much follows the story of the Iliad fairly accurately. The Iliad is the story of Achilles and thats the theme of the movie. It also ends where Homer's Iliad ends with the ransom of Hectors body.

The story is deep and surprisingly interesting it's not just a film that one only watches for the action and cool costumes. It's a darn good story.If I were going to recommend a 60s peplum I would have to mention this one. It is worthy enough for a good clean copy for distribution. My copy is pretty good already.

Whereas the first two entries Takeshi's and Glory to the Filmmaker could basically be described as one big selfreferential absurdist joke Achilles is a more controlled film with a proper story and a precise set of themes albeit decorated with cheerfully absurd humor.Such a scenario occurs right from the beginning in an animated prologue which explains the bizarre title as pointed out by the philosopher Zeno if Achilles the fastest mortal man according to Greek mythology and a tortoise competed in a race and the latter had even the slightest advantage say three feet logic demands that in the time required for Achilles to reach that point the tortoise would keep moving forward and therefore the famous warrior paradoxically enough would never be able to catch up with the notoriously slow animal.In Kitano's film Achilles would be Machisu a young boy fascinated by art and the tortoise is success. Despite the boy's determination and occasionally bold choices of subjects he has a knack for painting macabre events his lack of stylistic originality makes all galleries shun him and most of his friends abandon him. Only his wife will keep supporting him even in his older days at this point Kitano himself plays the role when they're practically broke and their own daughter is ashamed to live in the same house as them.Kitano's passion for painting is quite well known among those familiar with his work he personally makes all the artwork that shows up in his movies and so Achilles and the Tortoise is a good opportunity for him to use his hobby as a tool to reflect on the elusive subject of art and its various ramifications. Naturally he does this with his usual penchant for darkly humorous setups especially in the third act with some scenes so audacious it's doubtful even something like Six Feet Under would have featured them. And yet one does not feel repulsed by those scenes. On the contrary it's the absurdity of the plot paired with Kitano's quietly composed directing and minimalistic performance that constitutes the movie's primary point of attraction. In fact Kitano's onscreen presence is so charismatic that perhaps he would have been better off shortening the first section of the picture and granting his quirky alter ego more room. Furthermore the straightforward happy ending feels completely at odds with everything else but then again coming up with a suitably crazy epilogue might have proved too arduous a task.Ultimately the only thing that seriously damages a part of this strange and in its own way funny opus is the running time almost two hours with minor help from the somewhat off beat conclusion. Nevertheless Kitano fans are likely to find something to embrace yet again and anyone with some kind of interest in art should take a good close look at this original take on the matter.".

The issue of autism isn't directly addressed but the character certainly exhibits symptoms.This is a very good film although a little long.

To my surprise it turned out to be a fantastic film that's not only funny but also deep.The story follows the life of a boy who loves art and destined to become an artist though fail to achieve success due to lack of originality and excessive imitation.What I really liked about this film is that it explores what art really is and pokes fun at the absurdity of some of today's socalled 'modern art'. It also depicts the suffering of an artist whose works are not 'understood' by others. It's interesting Kitano Takeshi's films are often artistic in its own way. Makes me wonder if his previous two films were too artistic for me to comprehend? In any case I enjoyed this film tremendously and there were many memorable moments. Casting was done extremely well especially in the 'college days' and all the actors gave a great performance for this wonderful movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "After two introspective films before Achilles to Kame Kitano is back to complete his trilogy. With Takeshis' he explored himself as an actor Kantoku Banzai! revealed Kitano as a troubled filmmaker and Achilles to Kame third in line is telling us something about Kitano as a painter. And art. Or nonart for that matter.The film starts of rather slow. Kitano seems to reach back to the feelgood 50s tryouts he made in Kantoku Banzai! Soft lightning and swift switches between humor slices of life and drama of the poor make up most of the first 30 minutes. A few scarce moments remind us we are watching a Kitano film most of them coming from the interaction between the young kid and the village retard. Scenes that are not unlike the ones between the grandpa and little girl in Ishii's Taste of Tea.While those first thirty minutes are quite pleasant the humor is warm and comforting and the score is pretty spot on staying very close to the work of former Kitano regular Hisaishi as a Kitano flick the film is definitely missing something vital. That something is added when we jump a couple of years forward to the painter's college years. It is obvious that Kitano's style starts to flourish in a more modern Japanese environment.This is also the time when things start to go wrong for our young painter. Up until then he has been following his heart making the paintings he likes best. But apparently that is not to the liking of the young art dealer who is asked to sell his work and our young painter is urged to start following art lessons. He begins learning about art which kickstarts his everlasting journey to grasp to concept of Art with a capitol A.Visually this second part is much more like the films that made Kitano famous. Static camera views harsh lighting and many shots of stark facial expressions. The structure too becomes more like his older work reminding me a lot of Kikujiro. Where the first parts grounds the trip the main characters are about to make the core of the film lies in the sketchy scenes that follow. Our young painter teams up with his classmates and through several often very funny attempts eh tries to capture the core of art spirit and originality.After this second part the film jumps to the current time Kitano himself of course portraying the painter as someone who has lost touch with reality still running behind this idealized image of capturing the essence of art. In this third part the film really starts to shine as Kitano himself can fool around to make the best of the scenes he's in. He is visibly enjoying himself as probably a couple of those scenes were largely improvised on set remembering the docu I once watched on Kikujiro.Kitano will always remain Kitano no matter what character he plays but since he's playing himself that's hardly a fault. Apart from that his mannerisms and posture are gold in the comedy scenes. Still Kitano's character starts to sink deeper and deeper to the point where the comfortable life around him is shattered to pieces with Kitano unable to let go of his selfinduced passion.The first section of the film is obviously the weakest but important for Kitano's vision on the subject. The moment he goes to school to learn about art he loses his spirit and becomes a parody of what an artist is supposed to be. Kitano pretty much trashes artists art dealers selfindulged amateurs and buying customers alike as he questions and undermines the importance of art and its function in our society.It is nice to see a director doing this so openly and directly. Even though the film revolves around Kitano as a painter it is easy to broaden the perspective and to see this film as a comment on art and art appreciation in general. On how people approach art want to understand art and want to profit from it. It is also good to see that Kitano can walk away from it in the end with a contented heart and a freed soul.Achilles to Kame is a film that combines the themes and topics of his two latest outings with the style and feel of his earlier work. The comedy is typical for Kitano the acting with a neat little cameo for Terajima directing structure and pacing are all very much like his earlier films too. Even the music seems to come right out of Hisaishi's office. It's very nice to see all these things come together to create something that feels like the current Kitano bearing his past baggage and showing multiple sides of his personality as a director while still remaining very consistent in style and feel.A must for Kitano fans and probably art fans alike as all paintings were made by Kitano himself and are apparently based on existing paintings. Probably not the best place to start for people not really familiar with Kitano's earlier work as a director but as a fan of his directorial efforts this is a pretty complete and awesome film to behold. 4.55.0".

It's very nice to see all these things come together to create something that feels like the current Kitano bearing his past baggage and showing multiple sides of his personality as a director while still remaining very consistent in style and feel.A must for Kitano fans and probably art fans alike as all paintings were made by Kitano himself and are apparently based on existing paintings. Probably not the best place to start for people not really familiar with Kitano's earlier work as a director but as a fan of his directorial efforts this is a pretty complete and awesome film to behold. 4.55.0";

Since Van Gogh Heinich it is clear that worth in arts stems from selfsacrifice for a superior cause art itself.

	schema:headline " Kitano's latest passion";
	schema:reviewBody "Achilles is the last of the Kitano's trilogy about the joys and woes of a creative artist. I have watched the second Glory to the filmmaker 2007 but not the first Takeshis 2005. Glory was a little disappointing mainly because it was unfocused seeming to wander and meander without s clear course. Achilles is anything but unfocused.While this movie is generally labelled a comedy the first half comes off like a Dickensian tale of an orphan. Coming from a welloff family little Machisu finds himself plunged through a series of misfortunes  the family financial disaster suicide of father and then mother an existence of drudgery under an unsympathetic uncle then the orphanage and finally making a living at a lowly position. The tale is told however with little poignancy. One reason is that the misery our protagonist goes through is nowhere near an average Dickensian orphan's. He has schooling a kindly aunt and a very reasonable employer just to name a few blessings. But the most important factor is Machisu himself.The taciturn child has a singular passion for painting to the extent that he at times almost seem autistic although he is in fact not. But painting is such a consuming passion that nothing else counts. This is portrayed with remarkable consistency by the three actors from early childhood to young manhood when he marries an insanely just a manner of speaking supporting girl who not only understands but also embraces his addiction for painting. At this point the comedy takes over mainly generated by Machisu and his cohorts in their various imaginative attempts at creative painting. Hilarity ensues but also some lethal consequences literally. There is black comedy but comedy nonetheless.In comes Kitano playing Machisu at middle age and wife played by Kanako Higuchi whose heartwrenching performance in Memories of tomorrow I still remember with a daughter in late teens. Those who are familiar with Kitano's work will appreciate how well this character fits with his bestknown screen persona  the expressionless face this is full of expressions if you know what I mean. By this time his passion has gone completely out of control and all hell breaks loose. I shall not of course disclose the ending. Better than Glory this is not Kitano's best. Still it has all the good old Kitano ingredients such weird humour and underplayed characters. The profusion of colour scheme often but not always through the paintings themselves reminds me of Dolls 2002 which he directed but did not act in. On the title the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise often used as an introduction to calculus is adopted here to depict Machisu's perpetual pursuit of the elusive art of painting.".

	schema:headline " Beat Takashi lays waste to everyone and everything except the creative spirit in this misfire film on artistic obsession";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the third part of Beat Takashi Kitano's trilogy about artists especially Takashi himself and the creative process. The first film was Takashis and was an off beat semiautobiographical look at director Takashi. The second film in the series is Glory to the Filmmaker. It concerns a filmmaker trying to come up with a way of completing his latest film. As of this writing I haven't seen it.The last film in the sequence is this one Achilles and the Tortoise.The plot of the film has young Machisu Kuramochi meeting an artist as a child. The artist is impressed by the boys work and gives him words of encouragement. From that point on the boy does nothing but paint through school through marriage through happy times and sad. Art is all. Unfortunately he never really tastes any sort of success seemingly just behind the curve of the happening artists.To be honest I'm not sure what I think of the film. I'm not sure the story really hangs together. Essentially a three part film with three actors playing Machisu one as a child one as a young adult and Takashi himself playing the artist in middle age. Each part has a different feel. And the work as a whole left me feeling rather depressed.The early part of the film is a bit awkward as Michisu is discovered and then moves to live with an uncle when his family is broken up by bankruptcy. It the film feels unfinished.The second part of the film where our hero tries to sell his work gets into art school and meets like minded people is a very funny destruction of artists and their drive for art for arts sake.The last part of the film where Takashi takes over is a darkly funny look at the extremes some people go to create.This is a vicious destruction of artists and the world they exist in. Critics are savaged. Art dealers are shown for what they are. Artists and their attitudes are ridiculed. The public and its taste and ability to know what's good is roasted. It's a black comedy that leaves no one unhurt. Takashi lays waste to everyone and everything. Anyone in any sort of creative endeavor is torn apart.This isn't to say that Takashi is against art or creating. He isn't and its clear from watching him create on screen all of the paintings in the film are his a fact that creates a weird sense of reality since his own paintings are being judged as poor when compared to his own paintings that he loves to create he's just against the attitudes of those who take their art too seriously he doesn't hence his deconstruction of his life and work over the three films and those who criticize or market the art. The only thing spared is the joy of creation though this is a cautionary tale about letting that get too far out of hand.I hope that Takashi enjoyed making the film because I'm unsure about what to really say about it.To be certain Takashi hits his targets with deadly and hysterical accuracy all along the way but in the end I don't know what it all means. I was left wondering what the point was and why I bothered to stay all the way to the end. Okay yes I know the reason I stayed the bits carried me to the end but when I got there I was kind of left wanting and unsatisfied. Perhaps the lack of meaning is the point but at the same time I don't know why it took me two hours to get there.Perhaps the films darkness and almost nihilism got to me. More than a fair number of people die both by their own hand and that of others there is an undercurrent about suicide here. We also see the dark existence of some of the characters for example Machisu's daughter becomes a prostitute to support her family. This is not a happy film despite the laughs. When it was over I was left in a very dark place.What does it mean? I don't think it means anything. After seeing the film last night I sat down at the computer and tried to see if I could glean anything from what other people. Out of the six or seven pieces I read I got six or seven different interpretations. Everyone had the film speak to them in differing ways. Good art speaks to each of us in our own way and by that definition this would be good art but then again so does a muddled mess.Do I like the film? Yea maybe possibly. I like the bits. As a whole I'm not too sure. I don't think it all hangs together. For me its too mannered too obviously constructed. I could pull it apart but I don't see the point. The films anti critical stance makes it a tough prospect Though if I were to say something I'd say the first bit needs to be reworked. The middle section works and the final third needs to have an ending.I think the film is worth trying especially once you get to the middle section. Its almost required for anyone who has ever tried to create anything and had to put up with the slings and arrows of people who know better. Its an interesting misfire with moments of brilliance.Beyond that you're on your own. As for me I'm still pondering".

He isn't and its clear from watching him create on screen all of the paintings in the film are his a fact that creates a weird sense of reality since his own paintings are being judged as poor when compared to his own paintings that he loves to create he's just against the attitudes of those who take their art too seriously he doesn't hence his deconstruction of his life and work over the three films and those who criticize or market the art. The only thing spared is the joy of creation though this is a cautionary tale about letting that get too far out of hand.I hope that Takashi enjoyed making the film because I'm unsure about what to really say about it.To be certain Takashi hits his targets with deadly and hysterical accuracy all along the way but in the end I don't know what it all means. I was left wondering what the point was and why I bothered to stay all the way to the end. Okay yes I know the reason I stayed the bits carried me to the end but when I got there I was kind of left wanting and unsatisfied. Perhaps the lack of meaning is the point but at the same time I don't know why it took me two hours to get there.Perhaps the films darkness and almost nihilism got to me. More than a fair number of people die both by their own hand and that of others there is an undercurrent about suicide here. We also see the dark existence of some of the characters for example Machisu's daughter becomes a prostitute to support her family. This is not a happy film despite the laughs. When it was over I was left in a very dark place.What does it mean? I don't think it means anything. After seeing the film last night I sat down at the computer and tried to see if I could glean anything from what other people. Out of the six or seven pieces I read I got six or seven different interpretations. Everyone had the film speak to them in differing ways. Good art speaks to each of us in our own way and by that definition this would be good art but then again so does a muddled mess.Do I like the film? Yea maybe possibly. I like the bits. As a whole I'm not too sure. I don't think it all hangs together. For me its too mannered too obviously constructed. I could pull it apart but I don't see the point. The films anti critical stance makes it a tough prospect Though if I were to say something I'd say the first bit needs to be reworked. The middle section works and the final third needs to have an ending.I think the film is worth trying especially once you get to the middle section. Its almost required for anyone who has ever tried to create anything and had to put up with the slings and arrows of people who know better. Its an interesting misfire with moments of brilliance.Beyond that you're on your own. As for me I'm still pondering";

Gamblers take advantage of this opportunity to offer some players money to throw the series. Most of the players didn't get as much as promised. But Buck Weaver and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson turn back at the last minute and try to play their best. The Sox actually almost come back from a 31 deficit. Two years later the truth breaks out and the Sox are sued on multiple counts. They are found innocent by the jury but baseball commissioner Landis has other plans. The eight players are suspended for life and Buck Weaver for the rest of his life tries to clear his name.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was a much more difficult Joe Jackson story to tell than Field of Dreams.'Sports movies are never easy to do and making one that reaches beyond the bounds of sports fans is especially challenging. While Eight Men Out' may not quite grab the nonsports enthusiast as well as Field of Dreams' Hoosiers' or A League of Their Own' my own nominations for the three best sportsrelated movies of alltime it DOES more than hold its own among the top third of the evergrowing list of baseball movies.This is largely because it is not really a  BASEBALL movie. Like the aforementioned films it is a movie about people who happen to PLAY baseball. Based on the Eliot Asinof novel the movie is by and large historically accurate. It also seems to be fairly evenhanded in dishing out guilt. Yes the players played for skinflint Charles Old Roman' Comiskey yes they were easy prey for the gambling element yes they were lacking in education and common sense  yet they are not portrayed as innocent victims either.I have been a huge David Strathairn fan ever since Eight Men Out.' His sensitive portrayal of star pitcher Eddie Cicotte was pivotal to the movie's success. Asinof correctly focused on Cicotte as the pivotal figure in the World Series fix. Eddie's the key!' more than one character exclaimed. Other players approached with the idea of throwing the series reacted with shock when finding out the highlyrespected Cicotte was involved. This was certainly no easy choice for Cicotte a man of some integrity and conscience but a pitcher nearing the end of his salad days and a man bitter at his mistreatment by Comiskey. Strathairn plays the intelligent stressed character under the gun as well as any actor of his generation.The rest of the cast is fine too with despicable Chick Gandil Michael Rooker and Swede Risberg Don Harvey playing the odds and pressuring teammates to go along. James Read is excellent as henpecked southern pitcher Claude Lefty' Williams probably the second most respected player on the team.  Of course Buck Weaver John Cusack is a huge figure considering the gamblers' pitch then opting to pass when the money isn't immediately forthcoming. The movie isn't shy about its version of good guys  bad guys. Gandil Risberg  Swede's buddy Fred McMullin Perry Lang are the villains while Williams Weaver Joe Jackson D.B. Sweeney and Manager Kid Gleason John Mahoney are victims. Hall of Famer Eddie Collins Bill Irwin and nononsense catcher and controversial Hall of Famer Ray Schalk Gordon Clapp are frustrated onlookers while Dickie Kerr Jace Alexander is the wideeyed  nave rookie. All turn in fine work and I find myself loving the taciturn Schalk the kind of catcher every manager wants. Most interesting is the movie's portrayal of Shoeless Joe who is interpreted as being mildly retarded rather than just illiterate.The baseball scenes are quite realistic as are the ballpark backdrops. I first saw it the year after visiting Old Comiskey Park the year before it was torn down and felt right at home on the movie set  even the turnstiles looked authentic.In closing I can't honestly say that someone with NO knowledge or interest in baseball would flip over this film. Yet one doesn't have to be a bleacher bum to enjoy it  and not knowing the outcome may actually make it MORE fun for the neophyte! Overall a fine movie.".

I cannot imagine a better telling of this story. And the baseball action is excellent. One factual error though Bucky Weaver John Cusack would never mention Babe Ruth as better or even comparable to Cobb Speaker and Wheat in 1919 or 1920. It shocks me that Sayles kept that line.

	schema:reviewBody "I especially enjoyed Studs Terkel and John Sayles as the two sportswriters Fullerton and Lardner. They're very droll. They act as a kind of Greek chorus making cynical wisecracks keeping the audience clued in on what's supposed to be going on. As the White Sox play out yet another crooked game Sayles said to Terkel Nothing but fast balls. Nice sloow ones adds Terkel. It gets better. Terkel writes a column for the Chicago paper accusing gamblers of corrupting the game of baseball and Sayles is reading it aloud. Writers are tainting the game or something says Sayles. Keep reading says Terkel. The game would be better off without the longnosed thicklipped Eastern element preying on our boys in the field. Terkels smiles around his cigar and says Makes you proud to be a sportswriter doesn't it?The rest of the movie is pretty good too although I sometimes get the characters and their motives a little mixed up. The baseball scenes are very well done. I say this being no big fan of the sport myself. Charlie Sheen a true aficionado looks like he's heaving a heavy bat as he clunks out a hit not a rubber prop. I admired too the way the series games swung back and forth as the players on the take tried to figure out if they were playing for the money or for themselves. It's tough to throw a game because part of one's self always wants to do what one does best  in this case play baseball well. The German ethologists call it Funktionslust. In the end despite some indecision they do however lose.The movie isn't kind to the gamblers or to the owners. Comisky was incredibly cheap and greedy. The script gives this as one of the reasons why the players agreed to throw the game. As Strathairn says when someone offers him a part payment I don't care about the money. He's throwing the games to foul up Comisky who has just denied him a promised bonus because Strathairn playing the pitcher Cicotte has only played 29 games instead of the 30 they'd agreed upon. Comisky has made him sit on the bench for the last few games so he wouldn't cross the bonus threshold. Question Given that Comisky cheated Cicotte of the contracted bonus was Cicotte morally justified in throwing the games? The movie isn't nice to the gamblers either. Not only don't they pay off but they treat the players with contempt. Arnold Rothstein A.R. treats EVERYBODY rudely. He never says hello when he enters a room never says goodbye when leaving and never smiles.I kind of liked this. Sayles may not be a master but his films are always highly individualized. I cannot visualize him directing Die Hard With A Sardonic Grin.".

	schema:headline " Interesting Film for all Baseball Fans";
	schema:reviewBody "Eight Men Out provides a Reader's Digest version of the complicated events surrounding the 1919 World Series.If you forgive the fact the film has to simplify certain aspects of the conspiracy in order to make the film easier to digest then you will find that Eight Men Out is a worthy film and in the category of baseball movies it's one of the best.There are anachronisms in the film here and there the worst of which is Buck Weaver's question asking which of the lawyers was the Babe Ruth of law. Sure Babe Ruth was coming into his own by 1920 but most ballplayers in that era would not have place Ruth in the class of Cobb Tris Speaker or Walter Johnson. For baseball fans this line in particular really comes off as shallow especially since the rest of the film really tries to capture the deadball era. For the most part though this film feels and sounds a lot like America right after World War I ends a fascinating time and place.Studs Terkel steals the show in my estimation. His character in the film is not far from whom he is in real life and his authenticity is undeniable. John Sayles is a little stiff by comparison and his singing in the railway car which according to legend did actually happen is rather difficult to bear. None the less his direction makes up for his foibles as an actor.Straitharn is another gem in this movie and once again this actor seems to get right to the soul of the characters he is given to play. Eddie Cicotte's dilemmas are written all over Straitharn's face in every scene he's also given some of the best dialog in the film. Cusack plays his part well despite the fact that many of his scenes are reduced to clichs. Cusack's best moments are when he is frustrated about his inclusion in the conspiracy trial despite the fact he gave his all to try and win the series. His outbursts in the courtroom seem perfect as if drawn from the trial transcripts themselves.Joe Jackson is given unfair treatment. If Field of Dreams mythologizes Jackson to point of hyperbole Eight Men Out plays up his illiteracy with too much of a heavy hand. Joe Jackson wasn't stupid indeed if you read his last major interview before he died he speaks about the Black Sox with great alacrity and clarity. He was not as ignorant as this film would have you believe. One day someone will produce a film about Joe Jackson that will portray him accurately but Eight Men Out is not that film.Although their roles are very minor Kid Gleason and Ray Schalk are really well played and written. These two went through a very difficult time during the series and this is well demonstrated. One minor beef is that Nemo Leibold Shano Collins and other players outside of the conspiracy are never touched upon at all. This is understandable to a degree given the relatively short length of the film despite the complexity of the subject matter.The baseball scenes themselves are well done. The bats balls gloves and uniforms look like the equipment of that era and the ballparks are successful mock ups for the most part. There are even a couple of nifty athletic displays in the outfield that must have taken several takes to pull off.Overall this is my second favorite baseball movie next to Bull Durham. Its a little light on some of the details of the conspiracy but it makes up for it in other areas. It has some great music some great sets some solid acting and overall seems genuine and fair to all the major players in the conspiracy.Eight Men Out isn't perfect but it isn't as flawed as Roger Ebert would have you believe. If you a fan of baseball in fact I'd say its mandatory viewing.".

The Black Sox scandal and its effect on baseball transcended baseball.  The ensemble cast does a marvelous job particularly Straithairn and Sweeney who plays Shoeless Joe Jackson one of the more tragic figures of the whole mess.  In spite of taking money to throw the Series Jackson went out and batted .375 for the Series.  The Chicago payers in on the payoff and one poor soul who didn't go along but was approached were banned from baseball for life.  No less an authority than Ted Williams believes Jackson should be in the Hall of Fame.  But I digress.  The film goes into the motivations of the players who were playing for a pittance and had no say over where they played.  Thus they were perfect targets for the fix in the first place.  Excellent and gripping film about human reactions to stress and temptation.  Most recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the best baseball films ever made was about the sport's darkest hour the fixing of the 1919 World Series. Eight of the heavily favored members of the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series as a result of payoffs and bigger promises of payoffs to gambling interests. In the background of those interests was the notorious Arnold Rothstein who was never brought to trial. The eight players were the Eight Men Out banned for life by the newly appointed Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis played here most impressively by John Anderson. Anderson even looks like Landis.The whole unvarnished truth is laid out there owner Charles Comiskey a pioneer owner in the American League who treated his players like field hands as he assiduously courted the press and through them the fans. A little more generous with the profits this story might never have occurred. Clifton James plays the greedy and rapacious Comiskey. The incident where Eddie Cicotte is not started so that Comiskey can save on a promised bonus if he pitched and won 30 games has come down in legend. Cicotte and Lefty Williams played by David Strathairn and James Read were the key to the conspiracy. They lost the five games in that best five out of nine series to the Reds to throw the series. The bad play in the field by the others insured the result.Two things that are not mentioned in the film but are very important viewers ought to know. The best pitcher the White Sox had was Hall of Famer Urban 'Red' Faber who had led the team to a World Series win in 1917 the last one they would have until 2005. Faber came up injured and was disabled and was not available to pitch in the 1919 series. Had he stayed honest and not been injured the result might have been different.Eddie Collins the second baseman was played here by Bill Irwin and what's not mentioned here is that Collins started out with Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics part of his fabled 100000.00 infield. When Mack broke up his team and sold off the players in 19411915 Collins got a guaranteed salary of 15000.00 way above what his teammates were getting. Collins was one of Mack's favorites and he got that salary guaranteed for him by Comiskey before parting with him. That caused a lot of the jealousy you see portrayed in Eight Men Out.The real ringleaders were shortstop Swede Risberg and first baseman Chick Gandil as is shown here. They roped the others in. They're played by Don Harvey and Michael Rooker.The two that come down to us as the biggest tragedies are John Cusack as Buck Weaver and D.B. Sweeney as Shoeless Joe Jackson. Weaver knew about the fix but would not rat out his teammates hoping they'd come around and play on the square. He was treated as if he were a conspirator himself and suffered the same banishment.As for Shoeless Joe Jackson his lifetime average of .356 and the fact that he is one of the select group of .400 hitters would put him in the Hall of Fame. During the teen years he was overshadowed by Ty Cobb in the American League but in the Twenties might have come into his own. He showed signs of adapting to the lively ball era that Babe Ruth was just inaugurating. He was also illiterate and was easily manipulated into the fix. Despite that his play like Weaver's was outstanding in that series he hit the only home run recorded by either side in that next to last series of the dead ball era. What you see with D.B. Sweeney is exactly how poor Jackson was.Baseball like other sports is a business and some of those businessmen are greedy indeed. Sad that it was the players who paid the ultimate price to clean up the sport in the mind of the public. Eight Men Out captures the era and mood of the times and even nonsports fans will enjoy this film immensely.".

	schema:reviewBody "When people talk about their favorite baseball movies you always hear the same titles being tossed around. Bull Durham Field of Dreams and of course these are terrific movies. But I don't think any one movie has so perfectly caputured the game the public's love and obsession with it and how fragile and vulnerable the men whos play it can be. John Sayles movie from Eliot Asinof's impeccably researched book so perfectly caputres America in 1919 and paints the Black Sox scandal as a tragedy whereby men capable of great things are brought down to the level of theives and gangsters by something as simple as greed and as awful as revenge. What sets this movie apart to me is the cast. There is an athleticism about this cast. Charlie Sheen had a scholarship to play ball at Kansas State and is well known for his passion for baseball. D.B. Sweeney who is simply remarkable as Shoeless Joe Jackson the illiterate hitting machine whose tragedy also spawned the novel Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella which served as the source for Field of Dreams played minor league ball before a motorcycle accident ended his career. They look and play like ballplayers. In far too many films there is something horribly fake about the baseball aspect. Some capture baseball scenes perfectly and simply haven't the emotional real life depth that a movie needs while others capture plenty on the emotional side but fall short in terms of the realism on the field. This movie is a rare GEM that captures both so well. The acting is terrific. Sweeny as said does a fantastic job as do John Mahoney as the team's manager and the terrific character player Michael Rooker who oddly is only good in movies where he isn't highly billed...for example don't see Jean Claude Van Damme and Michael Rooker in Replicant... as Chick Gandil the first baseman whose shady connections initiate the whole gambling scenario. But the standout performance has to be John Cusack as thirdbaseman Buck Weaver. His being drawn into the scandal's backlash is by far the most devastating part of this film as he is the moral center of the film torn between his love of his teammates and his loyalty to the integrity of a game he loves and never got over the loss of. Simply Remarkable.".

Writer director John Sayles succeeds in showing exactly how and why eight players on the best team in baseball set in motion what had to be one of the most poorly conceived organized and executed conspiracies in the whole history of graft and in his usual role as a champion of the working class portrays the guilty players as victims of moneygrubbing corporate exploitation represented both by team management and organized crime.But it's all the cynical wheeling and dealing behind the Black Sox scandal which make the film so fascinating. The story might have been unbelievable if it wasn't entirely true but like any aspect of real life the details are messy and inconclusive. Most of the film recounts the mechanics of the fix events during the subsequent exposure and trial are telescoped too quickly into the final forty minutes or so which makes sense in any conspiracy the crime is always more interesting than the punishment.It helps to be at least slightly familiar with the huge cast of characters involved players gamblers reporters and so forth. A few scenes have been added for dramatic unity and others were abbreviated to maintain a consistent pace but all the facts are there and Sayles manages to pull them all together in an entertaining history lesson from our collective adolescence recreating that fateful moment when the boys of summer grew up for good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eight Men Out 1988 was written and directed by John Sayles. The movie is a dramatization of the events before during and after the 1919 World Series. I found this movie both fascinating and moving.Director Sayleswho also plays journalist Ring Lardnerhas formulated the film as a labor vs. management struggle. Sayles portrays club owner Charles Comiskey as a miserly selfish dictatorial boss. His team was the finest in baseball yet he underpaid them broke promises to them and got rich while they remained poor. From this perspective most of the players were easy targets for gamblers who arranged for them throw the series and collect the cash offered to them.The acting was excellent especially by John Cusack who played George 'Buck' Weaver. Weaver maintained that he was innocent until the day he died and Cusack made that position believable. Also excellent was Hugh Fullerton who played journalist Studs Terkel.If you love baseball this is a can'tmiss movie. If you don't love baseball I still recommend it. That's because it's very dramatic and it really is a labor film as much as it's a baseball film. We saw the movie in the wonderful Dryden Theatre in George Eastman House in Rochester NY. It was part of the excellent Rochester Labor Film Series.It was a treat to see an original print of the film projected on the large screen at the Dryden. I think some of the drama of the baseball games will be lost on the small screen but the film will work well anyway. Find it and see it!".

It was part of the excellent Rochester Labor Film Series.It was a treat to see an original print of the film projected on the large screen at the Dryden. I think some of the drama of the baseball games will be lost on the small screen but the film will work well anyway. Find it and see it!";

	schema:reviewBody "This was a welldone account of the famous 1919 Black Sox scandal in Major League baseball many years ago. The movie features an excellent cast and does a nice job of recreating the era. The music of period is effectively used here too as are the interior and exterior of the ballpark.The most memorable players seemed to be pitcher Eddie Cicotte David Strathairn and infielder Buck Weaver John Cusack. Cicotte being the ace pitcher on the staff was the key player involved in fixing the 1919 World Series and Weaver stood out because he was made to look as a totallyinnocent player who got unfairly blackballed from pro baseball. At least this is according to John Sayles who directed the film. Sayles also shows Shoeless Joe Jackson the most famous player of that scandal to be just a naive kind of dumb guy who didn't know what was going on. However history records Jackson making an unusual number of throwing errors in the field which makes him suspect.Sayles also goes out of his way to make Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey as a notorious tightwad who invited this sort of thing players taking bribes by grossly underpaying his players. They also make a point of showing him screwing Cicotte out of a big bonus. The filmmakers almost make the crooks into the good guys! Gosh Hollywood would never do that! So as you can see so don't take this story as gospel. I'm sure some of it is very true but how much?The baseball scenes are realistic in the field but aren't all that credible pitching and hitting. Note Sayles has an acting role in here as does reallife sportswriter Studs Terkel who isn't a bad actor! Michael Lerner Charlie Sheen Christopher Lloyd Michael Rooker Clifton James all add to this deep cast.".

Sayles takes a complex and important part of our country's sporting past and tries to make sense of it. I admire the casting the baseball parts are authentic looking and you gotta enjoy seeing old John Anderson as Kenesaw Mtn Landis. Dead on.In reality Charlie Sheen looks a lot more like Chick Gandil than Rooker does but that is okay. Both guys were fine in their roles. Sweeney takes some of the 'Field of Dreams' mystique outta the Joe Jax role simply plays him as a gifted hitter who was a dumb hick outside the field. Buck Weaveras played by Cusacksympathetic as well nicely done.All of them in factfamiliar faces be it Harvey or Straitharnkinda Bill Bixby looking isn't he? or 'Ray Schalk' 'Lefty Williams' etc. The usual great Sayles ensemble. I also like seeing Clifton James in here too as 'the Old Roman'. 'Live and Let Die' anyone? What doesn't work? Some of the guys look too much alike and if yer not a baseball fan you won't know Risberg from Mullen. And the whole business between Christopher Lloyd the varied gamblers and the law wellit was difficult to follow that too.It looks like Comiskey paid off the Gamblers to keep their association outta the public eye. At least that is shown. And to target the players only.Comiskey paid for the lawyers repping the players 'secretly'.The Gamblers bought off the jury to keep the players from being convicted and gamblers possibly being drug into trial further.The players didn't have reps when signing the confessions and were tricked esp. Joe Jax.The Commissioner was gonna tar and feather the 8 no matter how the jury went to make an example for everyone to see.Kenesaw Landis was a corrupt racist who helped make sure the black players were kept outta the game during his lifetimethru '44...The Gamblersmob guys got away with it even though they were the ones who set it up profited from it paid for it etc. Comiskey was a cheap SOB who deserved what he got too.

So the solution was not far and the players accepted to sell the games for money that never came to them. Most of these players are dead at present but it would still a justice to really know whether Joe Jackson and Buck Weaver played for money. It is true that they knew of the deal but one thing is to know and another is to play wrongly. Looking at this film you finished with these doubts and nobody may yet clarify them. In any case the film was done very well giving the correct environment of that period in Major Leagues the gloves used by players clothes etc. Among the actors I like the acting of David Strathairn as Cicotte D.B.

	schema:headline " The Unholy Octet";
	schema:reviewBody "One hundred years ago as of this writing the Chicago White Sox won Major League Baseball's World Series. Two years later in 1919 they did not repeat as some players planned to lose. Charles Commie Comiskey Clifton James owner of the Chicago White Sox addresses a group of sports writerspress agents including Ring Lardner John Sayles and Hugh Fullerton Studs Terkel. Comiskey cocksure says that his team led by Kid Gleason John Mahoney is so good that the 1919 World Series with the Cincinnati Redlegs won't go the ninegame limit. Actually that was the prevailing view then and the gambling odds were 31. But below the surface his team is disgruntled the players are vastly underpaid except for Eddie Collins Bill Irwin a college graduate who knew how to negotiate contracts. The players did not even get their promised bonuses. And 35year old Ed Knuckleball Cicotte David Strathairn had the greatest grievance of them all. Skinflint Comiskey had promised him a 10000 bonus if he won 30 games. Cicotte won only 29 because the owner told Gleason to rest him for two weeks. The players are easy prey for the gamblers who are watching the pennantclinching game against the St. Louis Browns. These gamblers include Bill Burns Christopher Lloyd and Philly Maharg Richard Edson who are sizing up their potential lackeys Chick Gandil Michael Rooker Swede Risberg Don Harvey Shoeless Joe Jackson D. B. Sweeney Hap Felsch Charlie Sheen Lefty Williams James Read and others. After the first few minutes the movie concentrates on the gamblers. Abe Atell Michael Mantell a crooked former featherweight champ of the world is approached by Burns and Maharg. Atell apparently lies when he says that he will fix the series with Rothstein's approval. Rothstein balks when first approached  not by BurnsMaharg  but by Boston's Joseph Sport Sullivan Kevin Tighe another crooked gambler. Later Rothstein supposedly gives the nod to Sullivan and gives him the first payment of 40000 for the players but Sullivan uses most of it to bet on the Reds so does Atell. Because of the heavy betting on the Reds the odds ominously drop to evenup. Suspicions are everywhere. Ring Lardner and Hugh Fullerton agree to mark their scorecards with circles when they spot a suspicious play and to compare them afterwards. After fortyfive minutes the World Series begins in Cincinnati. In game one Cicotte hits the first batter in the bottom of the first inning the signal that the fix is on for real. Cicotte is shelled in the fourth as the Reds win 91. Ring Lardner John Sayles visits Cicotte after the game and wants to know if things are legitimate Cicotte says yes. In game two Lefty Williams also in on the fix loses a more respectable 42 decision. He refuses catcher Ray Shalk's Gordon Clapp entreaties to throw his curve ball. Comiskey furious that his team is losing complains to Ban Johnson Clyde Bassett to no avail. Atell welches on most of the bet money owed to Burns and Maharg for the players. White Sox rookie Dickie Kerr Jace Alexander not in on the fix pitches brilliantly in game three as the Sox win 30. Atell blows his cash by betting on Cincinnati. So do Burns and Maharg. In game four Cicotte pitches well enough and doesn't yield an earned run. But he deliberately misplays an easy grounder and then intentionally interferes with Jackson's terrific relay that would have cut down a runner at home plate. Reds win 20. In the next game Williams is shelled and loses again. Then in Cincinnati Cicotte defeats the Reds. Then Kerr again courageously wins again as Gandil drives in the winning run in the tenth!Now with the series returning to Chicago gamblers get anxious even though Cincy still leads in games 43. Williams scheduled to pitch is told by a gambler sent by Sullivan that his wife would be shot if he wins. In real life his own life was threatened not hers. So in game eight Williams amazingly loses for the third time 105 and the Reds win the series. But in the end the players get very little of the gambling money. And Atell earns a broken nose for crossing Rothstein?. With rumors and suspicions flying about and with exposs by Lardner and Fullerton the owners decide to hire eccentric Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis John Anderson as baseball's first commissioner. A grand jury is then formed. Before the trial a tearful youth supposedly asks Jackson the famous quote Say it ain't so Joe. At the trial the players win acquittal !. But ironically and regardless of the favorable verdict Landis expels the Black Sox from the game for life. Major League Baseball was a private monopoly after all. It would take the White Sox forty years to win another pennant but they again lost the series. Not until 2005 would they finally win it all the first since 1917! The movie is based on Eliot Asinof's excellent book of the same name. Despite the dramatic liberties and plot simplifications for the audience's sake the film is factual. It is a fine period piece with the uniforms and authenticlooking stadiums and their ominous concrete outfield walls. It is best understood by baseball aficionados. Of the crooked players David Strathairn Ed Cicotte John Cusack Buck Weaver and D. B. Sweeney Joe Jackson are the most sympathetic. Cicotte mistreated by Comiskey wrestled with his moral dilemma. Weaver did not participate but failed to report the plot. Jackson played very well batted .375 and belted the only homer of the series! Ringleaders Gandil Rooker and Risberg Harvey along with the gamblers are the real villains. Writerdirector John Sayles as Ring Lardner is sufficiently impassive. Historically note that the fix was not confirmed until the closing days of the 1920 season when the Chisox were battling for a repeat pennant. The trial occurred in 1921.".

	schema:headline " Sox get washed!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a great movie. The story of the 1919 Black Sox Scandal as portrayed by John Sayles was truthful to the real events of that World Series. The cast gave such wonderful performances as players and owners that you can understand how this could happen. You feel bad for the players. When asked about their bonus and they only are given the champagne you see the hurt in their faces and it is painful to see. John Cusack and D.B. Sweeney were great as Buck Weaver and Joe Jackson. Their performances showed a great love for the game. The film also contains scenes showing how different groups of the conspiring gamblers were doublecrossing one another as well as the players they were conspiring with. An interesting side element of which I had been previously unaware. The cast is absolutely topdrawer including Charlie Sheen D.B. Sweeney both of whom were already good high school and college baseball players respectively in real life John Cusack Michael Lerner David Strathairn Christopher Lloyd Clifton James Michael Rooker John Mahoney Studs Terkel and several other fine actors.The real moral compass of Eight Men Out is Buck Weaver played by John Cusack in what may have been the performance of his career. Sayles' Weaver is portrayed as the victim of the ultimate betrayal for not participating in the scheme. His teammates don't back him up. The courts do not defend him. The press lumps him together with the guilty. His only crime was not being a snitch. And for that Weaver has basically been relegated to baseball history's limbo in spite of an abovepar career. Sayles does an admirable job in evoking a justified sympathy for Buck Weaver and Cusack captures it beautifully.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

Crisp direction. Compelling story. If you were intrigued by the Black Sox scandal referred to fleetingly in Boardwalk Empire than watch this film. One of the best films made about sports and the temptation of money corrupting sports. Not some soapy film like Pride of the Yankees or A League of Their Own which I enjoy but are far from reality.

However Bottoms' blackmailer is even better! He plays the young man with the cold calculating efficiency of the sociopath. Very understated which is a sign of good acting. I'm reminded of a Jack Lemmon quote describing his early years in film when the director kept telling him a little less. Bottoms give us the bare minimum which is perfect for this character. The script is also good taking what could be an actiononly clich and turning it into a suspenseful how is he going to do it.

	schema:reviewBody "This is probably my favorite childhood film having seen it 30 times at the theater during the summer of '77 to put it in perspective I only saw Star Wars 12 times and it still holds up very well. I'm sure part of that is the nostalgia factor as it seems to capture a time and places pretty well but there's a bit more to its appeal to me than that. It works because none of the characters are grossly exaggerated caricatures but everyday men with foibles like struggling to quit smoking. The Caulder character is identifiable because of his family and work failings while Bottom's softspoken psychopath which probably would be portrayed as over the top if the movie were to be made now is much more in tune with an understated realism that most contemporary madmen you see on screen today lack. While the Widmark character of Hoyt is a pretty much by the book portrayal of a federal dick his sardonic exchanges with Segal lend an heir of authentic yet begrudging mutual respect. That credit should go to the screenwriters. Henry Fonda's exchanges with Caulder are similar in their edge and that makes for an understanding of what Harry is up against in trying to stop the bomber. Susan Strasberg as Caulder's love interest is sympathetic and very pretty but isn't given much screen time outside of being a nanny for Caulder's daughter...a minor complaint to be sure.After Rollercoaster came down from my long since demolished local three screen multiplex and had its initial HBO run it sadly all but seemed to disappear from my life outside of an occasional run on late night TV during the eighties but reappeared in 1998 when I stumbled upon a VHS copy from a company called GOODTIMES at a Tower Record store in Seattle. I was ecstatic. I still pull it off the shelf every once in awhile to remind myself that some of the minor films of the seventies that weren't appreciated in their day deserve another view.".

The Caulder character is identifiable because of his family and work failings while Bottom's softspoken psychopath which probably would be portrayed as over the top if the movie were to be made now is much more in tune with an understated realism that most contemporary madmen you see on screen today lack. While the Widmark character of Hoyt is a pretty much by the book portrayal of a federal dick his sardonic exchanges with Segal lend an heir of authentic yet begrudging mutual respect. That credit should go to the screenwriters. Henry Fonda's exchanges with Caulder are similar in their edge and that makes for an understanding of what Harry is up against in trying to stop the bomber. Susan Strasberg as Caulder's love interest is sympathetic and very pretty but isn't given much screen time outside of being a nanny for Caulder's daughter...a minor complaint to be sure.After Rollercoaster came down from my long since demolished local three screen multiplex and had its initial HBO run it sadly all but seemed to disappear from my life outside of an occasional run on late night TV during the eighties but reappeared in 1998 when I stumbled upon a VHS copy from a company called GOODTIMES at a Tower Record store in Seattle. I was ecstatic. I still pull it off the shelf every once in awhile to remind myself that some of the minor films of the seventies that weren't appreciated in their day deserve another view.";

	schema:headline " If Columbo worked for Standards and Safety...";
	schema:reviewBody "A mysterious young man Bottoms derails a Rollercoaster with a bomb killing or injuring passengers then attacks more amusement parks across the US in order to extort 1m from the companies running them. It is not immediately obvious that these attacks were deliberate as opposed to being accidents e.g. through metal fatigue so the Amusement Park owners can keep what is happening quiet. It also makes it easier for the extortionist as he has public hysteria to threaten the owners with if they don't pay him off.Harry Calder Segal works for Standards and Safety. He had inspected the derailed Rollercoaster realises other amusement parks have suffered similar problems and finds out about the plot. Calder gets involved more deeply than he envisaged as he becomes a reluctant 'bag man' for the 1m whilst the FBI try to catch the mystery man just as the US heads towards 4th July and a wealth of potential targets.This movie is a decent suspense thriller and I have seen it several times. I have never regarded it as part of the 'disaster' movie genre and feel such a description is both lazy and inappropriate. Whilst the Rollercoaster crash scenes were fairly horrible for the time they seem pale today. The horror is in the mind and there are only a couple of such scenes in the movie. It is not therefore a bloody horror flick either.I don't know if this misconception comes from bad marketing suggesting that this is a disaster movie or if there were suggested scenes of gore and blood for the horror fans in order to con people into the cinema or if this is down to the critics of the time being lazy and perhaps even reviewing a movie they didn't see. I am a little too young to have seen or read anything at the time.This is a suspense thriller even though there is no suspense about 'whodunit' but the movie's style is familiar and it is no surprise to see 'Columbo' creators Levinson and Link in the credits.The strength of this movie is the cynical maverick but quickwitted Calder character that is played so well by Segal. He also has the oftenamusing story thread to play with of trying to quit smoking you wonder if 'Airplane' got the picked a hellofaday to quit smoking from Rollercoaster. Calder we also find is divorced from his wife amicably and has a daughter called Tracy Helen Hunt in a child role that hints of the actress to come and he has a lover Fran Strasberg.Widmark gives FBI Agent Hoyt authority and a little added depth as the film progresses and he spars nicely if not quite equally with Segal's Calder. Henry Fonda in his 70s essentially has a cameo as Calder's boss and Strasberg is underused as Calder's girlfriend in a role that you suspect may have had a little more to it in the script than there was in the movie's final cut. I smell a plot twist that was cut for some reason perhaps time.Bottoms is suitably chilling as the amoral perhaps sociopathic extortionist because he is young goodlooking quiet polite intelligent cleancut and as he corrects Calder about his psychological profile this is for him a business transaction he is only interested in the money.Some may feel that this character is a bit thin and this may again be down to a cut from the original script but he might simply have been written that way. You don't really need to know more than you ever find out about this character but because he is a cool calm sort of a madman as opposed to the more traditional 'raving lunatic' you may be left wanting at the lack of an obvious answer or explanation for his actions.There are hints however. As well as the sociopathic traits he is an explosives expert electronics expert about 30 and in an early scene a decent marksman. In mid1970s USA what does that suggest? Perhaps the guy running the amusement park duck shoot has him correctly pegged perhaps not. The Bottoms character simply smiles and walks away staying mysterious.There are also bit parts for Harry Guardino Craig Wasson and Steve Guttenberg and it features real life band Sparks.I recommend this movie. It is a suspense movie that appeals to the brain rather than a horror or disaster movie that appeals more to the senses. It has become a bit dated as for example a 1m extortion fee seems small these days and Rollercoaster rides were really at their height then so the enthusiasm for the rides by adults indicates a bygone era and a 70s movie in setting and style is too distinctive to be anything else but that now becomes part of its latterday charm.Rollercoaster is also a duel of wits with Segal perfectly cast and Bottoms as I say suitably chilling. With both characters being intelligent and quickwitted able to plan and to improvise this adds to the plot the tension and therefore the overall enjoyment.You might also recall and bear in mind that this movie was made at the time of Son of Sam The Hillside Stranglers and Ted Bundy.".

The only flaw with the film is quite surprising Henry Fonda. That's right! I said Henry Fonda. Sacrilege right? Fonda plays a minor supporting role but manages to bring the film down to a lower level every time he is on screen. Every other actor in the film takes the script seriously and delivers a great performance. Fonda however seems to consider this an unimportant role in an unimportant film.

What it is is a psychopath based thriller that adheres to procedural values and character involvement. As it runs at nearly two hours in length should notify viewers that it isn't a film chocked full of Rollercoaster sequences and explosive pyrotechnics. Yes there's some exciting Coaster sequences neatly shown to us in POV and in spite of the obvious 1970s use of dummies for the plot setup carnage this thrives on human interest and race against the clock suspense.The marker is set early on as Bottoms' smirking killer sets up his first murderous act whilst listening to some deathly string arrangement on his cassette player.

From here on in the Bottoms character remains mysterious but we know just what he is capable of so does Segal's character as do the likes of Widmark's Agent Hoyt and the rest of the suits frantically scratching around trying to avert further tragedy as the fresh faced bomber demands money with menace. This ensures the bulk of the film is made up of Calder and Young Man interactions and police procedural movements. It has much talk very much so but it's well scripted dialogue and heightens the tension as we enter the final third.One of the few films to feature the Sensurround gimmick the film perhaps logically loses much impact on the small screen. Prints of the film are only adequate and the sound mix doesn't shake your lounges in the way it certainly did back in 1970s theatres. Yet this is still a damn fine suspense picture a film that also carries with it some stoic performances from Segal and Widmark and a chillingly effective villain turn from the undervalued Bottoms. Henry Fonda is on the credits but really it's just a cameo appearance while there's much interest value in watching future Academy Award winner Helen Hunt as the young daughter of Harry Calder.Expect a taut thriller like TwoMinute Warning that was released the previous year and you hopefully will not feel let down. Expecting a two hour disaster movie full of Coater Carnage will only lead to disappointment. 810".

When I saw this film in the theatre I didn't realize or appreciated the living legends in the cast. Hey it was 1977 and I was like...14 and Star Wars was the word on the street. Now looking back in hindsight I know better. I mean Fonda AND Widmark even though they were also in The Swarm tsktsk on the big screen was a treat. After recently watching this film as an adult I can honestly say... it was great! Now I really appreciate the Hitchcockedge suspense crisp cinematography and fine editing. Not to mention the chilling score done by composer Lalo Mission Impossible Schifrin. FYI the title soundtrack is called Apple Turnover by Lalo himself. I echo the user who wrote that this is In The Line of Fire in an amusement park. Especially the film's high point standoff scene when Timothy bottoms is surrounded by authorities holding the detonator to the bomb planted on the last car of the coaster. It has that same height of dialogue suspense when the FBI jams the detonator's frequency the way Eastwood said Just one thing...aim high to Renee Russo in In The Line of Fire. GREAT EDITING!!! If you were to play that ITLOF scene side by side when Richard Widmark says Take him! Take the sonofabitch...we jammed his frequency you'd definitely see the similarity. Maybe ITLOF director Wolfgang Peterson was inspired by Rollercoaster for that Eastwood scene. But that scene in Rollercoaster was more intense because it happened just as the riders were going through the loop which was all the film's hype...the first loop rollercoaster! A big thing back then. A special edition remastered DVD release would be nice today. We could all watch it in our OWN sensurround. THX!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "1977's Rollercoaster is one of my alltime favorite movies. My uncle took me to see it in New York City when I was a little kid back in 77. Seeing this movie for the first time in the theater was really a suspenseful experience. The suspense is fueled by the extortionistterrorist character played by Timothy Bottoms and we're made aware of what he's capable of at the beginning of the film when he with the use of an explosive causes a terrible rollercoaster crash that kills several people. This scene heightens our fear of him at least I feared him throughout the rest of the movie and I was hoping he wouldn't cause anymore crashes. But Director James Goldstone obviously exploited this as he tortured the viewer with suspense as throughout the film he never makes it clear about what Bottoms is going to do through cuts of Bottoms reaching into his pocket for something or camera POVs looking like a rollercoaster train might be derailing suspenseful music and other means.Bottoms' character's goal is to extort money from the amusement park owners under threat of causing more havoc. Safety inspector Harry Caulder George Segal and FBI agent Hoyt Richard Widmark are called in to try to catch Bottoms before he does anymore harm leading to a cat and mouse chase that brings them to several amusement parks across America as they go through the initial motions of cooperating with Bottoms' demands while waiting for their chance to grab him. Caulder is the main character here and he's the type that hates red tape. The movie is given some personality by dipping a little into Caulder's personal life  he's divorced trying to quit smoking has a daughter and a new girlfriend played by the late Susan Strasberg.But finally this exciting film climaxes at Magic Mountain near Los Angeles where the final showdown between Bottoms Segal and Widmark play out with great suspense involving the new at the time Revolution metal looping coaster. To this day as an adult I still have an abnormal fear of rollercoasters because of this movie. And I remember going to Hershey Park in Pennsylvania about two months after seeing this film in 1977 and I remember how scared I was on the coasters there because of this film. Highly recommended movie. Mike R.".

I have not seen that one so cannot compare it but Rollercoaster definitely works on a solid storyline and mounting suspense rather than the simple disaster film formula. Rollercoaster builds on excellent character study that help shape their actions within the movie.

You can tell that he is NOT having a good time with this! The incredible riding shot fakeout is a masterpiece in which you assume you are having an onride film shot and then it appears to fly off the tracks only to curve round as the train safely rounds its curve in one of the most amazing helicopter shots ever. Goldstone got in trouble for this one.Helent Hunt was OK but I wouldn't consider this a breakout role. No one else talks about Craig Wasson who played the hippy on the Revolution with the giant stuffed teddy bear who would later prove his acting worth in Brian DePalma's Body Double. Steve Guttenberg's role was more of a gofer or lackey rather than a park higher up. The acting is solid as is the storyline. This movie still plays well today and is as exciting even barring the 70's cheese. It is a far more solid movie than most of the dreck coming out of Hollywood today.".

George Segal is the safety officer hero his intelligence concealed by an essentially bemused countenance he's ideal for playing the slightly neurotic common man suddenly thrust in the midst of a precarious situation Timothy Bottoms the young extortionistbomber whose targets are various amusement parks across the U.S. and Widmark plays the veteran F.B.I. agent out to get him he also shares a typically antagonistic relationship with Segal. Henry Fonda appears as the hero's cantankerous boss though featured in many of these films his roles were always brief and basically thankless Susan Strasberg as Segal's current girlfriend Harry Guardino a local cop curiously enough he had appeared with both Widmark and Fonda in MADIGAN 1968 another policier but much classier. By the way Segal's daughter here is played by a very young Helen Hunt! Another interesting connection to an earlier thriller featuring a member of the film's cast is NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY 1968 with Segal in both titles the hero is contacted by the killer prior to making his moves with this in mind Bottoms' cleancut appearance lends the latter a chilling quality  though the characterization in itself is fairly limited. Incidentally the film is more concerned with the chase for the killer generating reasonable suspense towards the end  especially in the way he determines to plant another bomb on an inaugural rollercoaster ride after his initial gizmo is detected rather than depicting his mayhem in fact there's only one major disaster sequence early on but it's an undeniably spectacular one! I should mention at this point Lalo Schifrin's rather schizophrenic music  the carousel jingle is quite effective but the scoring of the suspense sequences is gratingly monotonous!P.S. Director Goldstone followed this with another starstudded epic  WHEN TIME RAN OUT 1980 about an erupting volcano  which however was a notorious production that brought the disaster movie cycle to a lamentable conclusion. I wouldn't mind revisiting it at this stage though".

The main reason the film works is because it fuses the qualities of the thriller. Also this was the very last movie Universal filmed in Sensurround.The film opens with a rollercoaster being derailed by a bomb set off by a young terrorist Timothy Bottoms who's incredible. The park's safety inspector Harry Calder a great role for George Segal is sent in to investigate the circumstances. He along with government agent Richard Widmark soon discovers that the attacks are part of the terrorist's scheme to cash in on the misfortunes of the accidents. The trail takes them to Virginia and then back to California where Bottoms has a huge surprise in store for those waiting to ride on the new rollercoaster at Six Flags. Can Segal and Widmark stop the terrorist before more innocent lives are lost? Skillfully acted directed and shot Rollercoaster is a plum in the 70's disaster genre. Despite it's low key status this thriller is a gem waiting to be discovered. Only problem Henry Fonda has almost nothing to do in Rollercoaster. With all the news about the war of terror today this tale of terrorism from within still hits home even after 30 years.".

	schema:headline " I went to this crummy amusement park and all I got was murdered!";
	schema:reviewBody "Rollercoaster released in 1977 was a great suspense film that unfortunately suffered from a bad marketing campaign. Coming out in the wake of the Disaster Flicks subgenre that was all the rage in Hollywood in the 70s movie goers attending Rollercoaster expecting to see yet another over the top epic in which Hollywood B list actors are picked off one by one on a regular basis in the midst of some disaster or other might have left the theater feeling cheated. But that's not the kind of film Rollercoaster is and the fact that it wasn't as well received or as successful as it should have been is a shame. Because Rollercoaster is a crackling good suspense story concerning an insane but smart bomber the amusement park rides he destroys taking lives down with it and the one man who knows how he thinks and is the only one who can stop him. This is the stuff great action films today are made of. Films like Speed and other mad bomber epics owe a great debt to Rollercoaster for laying the tracks see what I did there? for similar films like it in the future. For reasons never explained a young psychopath played by Timothy Bottoms sets about rigging roller coaster rides at various amusement parks in America with home made explosives. The results are obviously deadly and he soon issues an ultimatum to all the owners of the major amusement parks in the country Pay up or they will continue to see how vulnerable as he puts it they are to people like him. The hero of this film is Harry Calder George Segal a California safety inspector under whose jurisdiction the first rollercoaster bomb is deployed. Even though Calder wants no part of these proceedings he has the intuition to identify the modus operandi of Bottoms' character known only in the credits as The Young Man. Calder finds himself clashing on a regular basis not with The Young Man but with a senior agent of the FBI Agent Hoyt played here with the usual gusto of Richard Widmark. It's obvious Agent Hoyt considers Calder little people a civil servant beneath his attention but Hoyt soon realizes he needs Calder's participation in bringing down The Young Man for a rather disturbing reason. It seems The Young Man who has eavesdropped on Calder's advice to the amusement park owners to take this man seriously and also appreciates Calder's reluctant accreditation of his demolition and engineering skills. In a way this is very much like the relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling in Silence Of The Lambs in that the presence of evil is appeased by the respect shown to it by the forces of good.In the central portion of the film The Young Man arranges for a payoff to be made at King's Dominion Amusement Park in Doswell Virginia and he wants Calder to personally deliver the money to him. Here is where Rollercoaster really takes off in terms of suspense and gamesmanship. Even though Calder is being watched by a legion of undercover agents commanded by Agent Hoyt The Young Man consistently moves Calder around the amusement park like a chess piece from ride to ride all to exhaust and throw off the agents shadowing Calder so that when the time comes for the drop to be made they will all be out of position and looking the wrong way. The Young Man's plan seems to be successful but then things change setting up a very deadly endgame at the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia CA. It is there that Calder and Agent Hoyt must engage The Young Man one last time with the lives of innocent people hanging in the balance. I won't go into any further detail then that because Rollercoaster is truly a lost gem from the 70s in terms of its storytelling pacing and buildup. Dare I say this is a film that perhaps even Alfred Hitchcock would have approved of thanks to its nerve wracking atmosphere. Bottoms is cool sinister and unsympathetic in the way he conducts business. Segal who was in the prime of his career in the 70s plays his role with just the right amount of cynicism and contempt balanced with a very begrudged respect for the villain. And Widmark completes the trio bringing all the bluster and bravado that cemented his legacy as one of the old school Hollywood tough guys. It's also a fun period piece hearkening back to the days of the Carter Administration bell bottom jeans and acid rock. In one scene a real life rock band called Sparxx plays a concert at the Magic Mountain Park for the audience waiting to take the first ride on a brand new rollercoaster during which a bomb squad tentatively attempts to locate and disarm the deadly explosive left by the culprit. The crosscutting between the 70s rock think of the band Free but on a much smaller scale and the edgy business of pulling the plug without blowing up the works is very effective indeed. And the film is replete with such sequences and that's half the fun of this movie getting worked up anticipating the worst and holding your breath just in case it does.Bottom line Rollercoaster is not about blood and guts and high profile deaths. If that's your cup of tea this might not be the film for you. But if you enjoy suspense and well played confrontations and showdowns Rollercoaster is a very enjoyable ride indeed!".

Bottoms is excellent as the intelligent psychopath and Segal is perfectly cast as the grumpy reluctant hero type unhappy at being chosen by the killer unhappy with the FBI unhappy with businessmen and unhappy at having to stop smoking. Richard Widmark is just as grumpy as Segal Susan Strasberg and Henry Fonda don't get to do much but the film does see the first big screen appearance of Helen Hunt as Segal's teenage daughter.The tension in the build up to the first rollercoaster crash is very similar in style to Jaws and just as effective until the actual crash. As good as that whole scene is the impact is lessened because you can clearly see the cars are filled with wobbly shop dummies. The ending suffers the same way the tension being built nicely as Bottoms plants a second bomb on the rollercoaster itself but the grand denouement is again hampered by another strategically clothed shop dummy.

Mostly because after we left the theater in Times Square and began to walk back to our hotel all the lights in New York City went out people started screaming and glass started breaking but that's another story.Rollercoaster has more suspense and less action than many of the 1970's genre disaster movies whether or not that's a bad thing depends on your point of view I suppose. For me I didn't find many aspects of it that really stood out and 20 years or so after I'd seen it in New York and finally watched it again I found I remembered almost none of it except for the crashing coasters. None of the plot and none of the characters had stuck with me oh I remembered the kid with the bomb fetish but not in any meaningful way. Tim Bottoms looks like a cross between Ryan O'Neal and Ted Bundy by the way. Just last week my dad offered me the loan of his DVD and I immediately said oh the blackout movie! and he too remembered it well being trapped with two children in a pitchdark paralyzed metropolis filled with looters and muggers hundreds of miles from home appears to be seared into the man's memory far worse than any disaster that could be presented on a movie screen. This third time through my expectations were a bit lower and I found I enjoyed it more than I had the second time.There are a couple of things that really date it can you imagine in this day and age finding a bomb on an amusement park ride simply taking it off and then deeming the ride safe and starting to load it with unsuspecting people? Nah it's fine we found the bomb okay folks step right up no problem you'll have a blast er a great time. There's also a lot of smoking I don't object to it I just notice it and get taken back to 1977 by it. I'd also have to say I found the end a bit abrupt and simplistic. That was IT? Not The Poseidon Adventure and not The Towering Inferno two superior period disaster flicks but an interesting enough little movie.".

This third time through my expectations were a bit lower and I found I enjoyed it more than I had the second time.There are a couple of things that really date it can you imagine in this day and age finding a bomb on an amusement park ride simply taking it off and then deeming the ride safe and starting to load it with unsuspecting people? Nah it's fine we found the bomb okay folks step right up no problem you'll have a blast er a great time. There's also a lot of smoking I don't object to it I just notice it and get taken back to 1977 by it. I'd also have to say I found the end a bit abrupt and simplistic. That was IT? Not The Poseidon Adventure and not The Towering Inferno two superior period disaster flicks but an interesting enough little movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "While trying to find another angle towards the many disaster films that materialized back in the 1970's Rollercoaster though not the worst film of this particular genre but you'd be kidding me if you all think this was the best of of its genre because in reality it never even comes close. Sure this film delivers a cornucopia of footage from the rollercoasters but what brings this movie down was the narrowthin plot and a poorly structured story. Directed by James Goldstone and running for exactly two hours Rollercoaster is an excuse to exploit audience people who have shortattention spans which leads to the gripping amusement park scenarios are awkwardly pasted on as a ploy to bring this story to featurelength. For the genre being a crimedrama it's tedious and mundane which is rare because most crime dramas are both exciting and settling Rollercoaster is simply not like that.Timothy Bottoms stars as a unnamed bomber who's modus operandi is to wring out 1 million from amusement park owners after observing that getting through security is a piece of cake. While at the amusement parks he places explosives on the rollercoaster tracks and releases the bombs with the help of a remote trigger and promises to inflict more damage unless his demands are compromised. George Segal plays Insp. Harry Calder a cantankerous man trying to quit smoking by using shock therapy seems to have more access knowledge than the other detectives and just knows the right strategy needed to outsmart this sadistic fiend. He becomes the right person for the job while sacrificing his safety and finds himself in one precarious situation after another.Like its predecessors this movie has an ensemble of talented thespians although it doesn't really feature very many Alist performers. The only two standouts are popular 1970's performer George Segal and the very iconic Henry Fonda who was lowered to a very low supporting role and doesn't really have much to do here. There are debuts from younger performers who would go onto bigger and better roles in the future. Helen Hunt is in this movie playing Harry's daughter Tracy Calder. Although he did not get credit for his performance Steve Guttenberg has a cameo role as a messenger. And voice legend Michael Bell is here in a small role as Chuck Demerest.During the time of its release there was some speculation that theatres wanted to add more to the sound systems by creating more dimension to get the audience pumped up by creating soundwaves where bass speakers came into effect which would manipulate the theatre chairs to tremble on impact and to add extra sound during explosives almost as though the audience was in on the action. This archaic technology was there way before HD and 3D were invented. I guess this was desperate move to keep the audience awake from their slumber because it sure didn't keep me awake.Even the technical features were a bummer as well. Lalo Schifrin's pedestrian score sounded like a giant ripoff to Hitchcock's Psycho. And who in their right minds though that glamrock musician Russell Mael of Sparks could act? Now Big Boy will etched in my mind for a very long time. For amusement park aficionados will marvel at the amusement park footages but will not grab anyone else's attention if you are not. Even though there are a lot of casualties I the movie the audience gets to witness only one. I guess the audience must be dumb or hard at seeing but there are obvious dummies replacing live actors during the sporadic graphic scenes makes one felt like they were cheated by lowbudget obviousness.Rollercoaster is an obscure and dated film that was released at a time when disaster films were wearing out its welcome by the late 1970's. This movie might appeal to those who are nostalgic junkies or fans who love old movies and of course there are a few enthusiasts who insist that this movie is a topnotch heartpulsing thriller. Sorry folks I'm not on your side for this one. This movie is one long slow ride that will inspire you to seek elsewhere for more fun rides. Even the shaking trembling seats would not have held my interest if I was old enough to had seen when it was released in 1977.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in Switzerland's film history makes me shake my head! It's true but pitiful at the same time. A flick about the Swiss army could be a good deal better.The story sounds interesting at the beginning Antonio Carrera Michael Koch gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love Laura Moretti Mia Aegerter.The Acting in some way doesn't really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as the strong Michelle Bluntschi mediocre personally i found her rather annoying. The storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected. The romancepart is too trashy and the comedypart is not funny at all it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever. It's funny for preadolescent 1213 year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy. The humor is weak except for some shots.Dope? Cool! Stealing? Cool! If you want a proper comedy about the Swiss RS make sure you did not absolve your military training yet and even then don't expect too much!I'll give it 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rima is quite funny during his screen time. Not a hell of a lot screen time though".

As former Miss Switzerland everybody thought that can't work but she did a very good work and I think somebody should inform Jerry Bruckheimer. Melanie would be great in one of his action movies. The only negative point of this movie is the terrible title but otherwise this movie is really worth to watch.".

However I did not think it was really that funny. For both lead actors it was the first performance in a film and I am not really sure about their performances. Honestly it may be one of these cases of looks over talent why they got cast especially for the male protagonist. He also does not really have a career in acting now over a decade later but he focuses on directing. Melanie Winiger the female lead still does some acting here and there and managed to build a successful career from this film. The only one I was familiar with here is Marco Rima. He was actually a fairly known comedian for a while even here in Germany. Director Mike Eschmann went on to direct another military comedy a couple years later but he is not really working today anymore in the business. Same can be said about the two writers. And honestly I am not particularly surprised. This 90minute film here is not really memorable at all in my opinion. The comedy is rarely funny and there are a handful pretty cringeworthy scenesreferences. Not recommended. A bit sad that this is the best Switzerland has to offer in terms of comedy.".

I doubt in Hollywood they would let her say a single line in a B movie. Okay girls in the military! Now this is getting fun. The girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night! In reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two fences with barbed wire. There are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time of which we have plenty. No the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the engine sounds especially not at night.There is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line. We need those so the sexually obsessed Germans will like the movie as well. Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. Well done!One sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Surely none of those facilities are ever locked. The military routines are as sloppy as they can get.In the end of the brainless flick the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him! Because he deserted his fiance! Sure I buy that the Italians are that waya jealous bunch not. The bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again military training grounds where there is shooting with live ammo are open to the public anyone can freely drive or walk in there. There are no such things as guards or fences. The deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the Italians' car. The explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fiance off their feet. No one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens. It's a COMEDY remember.Okay. It's a comedy I got that and I can live with that. No realism needed. Filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously side splitting funny or entertaining interesting challenging. Unfortunately it is none of those. It's just embarrassing. A ripoff from brainless American comedies. The latter are at least done professionally with no amateur actors.It is pretty boring and predictable a waste of time and energy especially to those sitting through the entire movie as I unfortunately did.

I've read other user's comments and I got the feeling they didn't like the movie but I can tell you why because they are Swiss themselves and they don't like to hear the truth.Now lemme tell ya It is the truth. Good things first I'm from Germany. That's why I can tell. I used to work with a bunch of Swiss blokes and the two main topics were Dope and the Mafia. No  not Army pocket knives nor cheese banks or Cuckooclocks but Dope and the Mafia. So here we are  the movie shows Switzerland exactly as it is.About the movie itself you can always argue about the acting but this was not Shakespeare nor Lessing but genuine Swiss acting. So we will not be so picky about certain aspects of acting that could have been better. Let's take what this movie was made for delivering a feeling how it is to be Swiss. And they did  just that! And splendidly!Besides it is a funny movie spiced with good jokes for those who listen carefully. And a touching love story too. Just go and watch it!By the way you might want to check out Die Schweizermacher  'cause it's worth it!".

In terms of Swiss films its by the far the best and only Swiss film I've ever seen.Its the closest I've ever been to the Swiss army but from what I understand its a joke.

And I lived through some pretty bad ones.It's one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language. It relies on the oldest simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. On the military What do we do once we reach the fighting zone?  You get out of the car and die actually it's much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film on drugs a guy eats some space cookies behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high  all badly written and acted on women in the army Why do we only get trumpets? We were promised guns!  That's the way it is that's the way it'll stay... Argh. Okay you might actually find these genuinely funny but in that case you seriously scare me.Additionally I have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on European late night TV. So it had lame jokes delivered badly beyond lower average acting lacked pace was badly dubbed and edited  It just didn't work. At least not on any level used as a measure for films.I would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee Germans. And that's saying something if you like stereotypes. Which I don't it's nice to play with them though. Just in case somebody thinks I'm not being PC enough.Instead of going to see this film do something useful. Try to teach crocheting to prawns paint your toenails in a really irritating colour disassemble your bicycle change some light bulbs try to understand Einstein's theories convert to a different religion and back  in fact go and listen to Last Christmas by Wham! on endless repeat.

His family life is so twisted he thinks it's perfectly normal to stay awake all night dealing with his father's hysterics and suicidal threats. Allan's older brother left town several years ago and his mother gave up long before that relying on sleeping pills to escape Henry's tantrums. Allan then becomes obsessed with a rival family whom he considers foolish white trash until they start taking away Henry's customers. He is frustrated that his mother doesn't take his father's complaints seriously and is perplexed by the increasingly rebellious and bizarre behavior of his sister Sanne.

Here it's not just the discovery of Peter Schonau Fog but also of the tremendous cast especially young Jannik Lorenzen who plays 11yearold Allan to perfection with his cheeky bewilderment and eventually with a heavy disappointment that accompanies his loss of innocence. The film reminds me of Schlondorff's The Tin Drum with its rather disturbing yet comical theme of children growing up entirely too quickly although The Art of Crying is in my opinion far more beautifully poignant as it is told through Allan's eyes.Henry Jesper Asholt is a milkman whose nightly suicide attempts and constant hysterics have driven his wife to taking sleeping pills every night to avoid him and his son to university out of their sleepy rural village in Denmark. Henry's young son Allan Lorenzen adores him and begins performing a series of bizarre acts in order to win his father's happiness seeing nothing wrong with his father's manipulative actions and dysfunctional family dynamics.I enjoyed this portrayal of the tension between the rural and the urban seen in Henry's interactions with his educated son Asger his daughter Sanne's boyfriend the moped rowdy Per and his neighbour the Buddes who have introduced selfservice at their rival grocery store. It's a compelling tale grippingly suspenseful as you wait to see what Henry and Allan will do next yet disturbingly funny as you watch Allan delight in the most unpleasant things just as long as they make Henry happy. Strong performances all around and a neat debut for Schonau Fog!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since I first heard that the book by Erling Jepsen was being put into a movie I have been anticipating its release since I have read the book with much pleasure and since I have actually worked on that mental institution Sanne is committed to.It's a story of a family of five where the oldest brother has left home to study who are being manipulated by their father who is a neurotic Patriarch. He is the hysterical type loaded with feelings of inferiority. This combination makes him go on a constant search for reassurance and comfort in a very egocentric fashion to a point where his wife simply gives up and instead either takes sleeping pills or challenges him to commit suicide. His youngest son Allan tries to help his father as he has not yet reached a point of maturity that allows him to see through his father behavior and understand it as manipulative. In doing so he becomes just as manipulative but we symphatize and forgive him as we understand that he does it out of innocence and loyalty to his father. As the story develops so does Allan and finally the alliance between him and his father is broken as he becomes more aware of the consequences of his father's actions.The movie takes place in the 1970's and there has clearly been put a lot of effort into making the environment typical of it's time with great success. The acting is flawless and I think it was a wise choice to let young Allan play his part in a very subtly and restrained way. This also makes the sinister themes more bearable to watch as Allan seems more or less unaffected.I would really recommend this movie it gives a humorous portrayal of some very important themes without ever betraying them.Mojn SimonPs.

Far terrorises the family with his insecurity forcibly seeking affirmation of his worth. His mother Sanne Julie Kolbech hides away inside from Far's incessant sobbing preferring to take sleeping pills than to comfort her hysterical husband while older brother Asger Thomas KnuthWinterfeldt has escaped the house and enjoying his student life. Allan tries his best to keep his father happy nagging his sister Mor Hanne Hedelund to do that thing that she does to keep father away for him suicidal tendencies. Finally he discovers that Far is inwardly joyous whenever he has the opportunity to deliver riveting eulogies thus tempting Allan to enter a murderous spree to supply his father with eulogies. Allan still not old enough to see through the manipulative behaviour does the most dastardly deeds out of an innocent belief in his father's greatness.Set in 1970s Danish countryside the story about an abusive patriarch takes a wicked turn into a comingofage story dabbling with dry humour but the subject matter including incest and physical abuse grinds uncomfortably with the the tone of the film. Seemingly light the dark entrails make it a troublesome watch as it jars with a dramatic contradiction. Narratively loose it also fails to truly develop the story leaving it somewhat hanging in oblivion making it feel somewhat dragging and exerting your patience at times. Performances are wellrounded set in the quirkiness of characters but as the movie goes I found myself disinterested in their development as the story obviously lacks focus throwing dramatic tantrums instead of building on the material.".

Surprisingly Julian leaves the bathroom and explains the situation to June in the room in the beginning of a tense and dramatic night. Across the Hall is a dark slow paced thriller in the style of film noir developed through a nonlinear screenplay with many flashbacks. My only remark is the 88 minutes running time that could be a little shorter anyway the pace magnifies the dramatic situation of the characters. I have really felt sad seeing the last work of the talented and gorgeous Brittany Murphy who died so young. The music score is another plus in this good film that is neither a masterpiece nor an awful flick as indicated in some reviews but a decent lowbudget movie. My vote is six.Title Brazil Correndo Contra o Tempo Running Against Time".

It's almost Hitchcockian as the entire movie takes place in a creepy old hotel with almost no mention of the outside world or any prior events.This is definitely not for the impatient as it seems to stretch a halfhour's worth of events into an hour and a half. The slow pace adds to the ominous brooding atmosphere they were clearly going for. I can't help thinking I would've enjoyed this more as a short. The dank old hotel the creepy slowwitted bellhop and the dark dreamy Matrixlike photography provided more than enough atmosphere on their own. The story is told in nonlinear fashion with scenes appearing out of order sort of like Pulp Fiction. Only here the story is intentionally harder to follow especially in the beginning. You get the hang of it towards the middle somewhere. The filmmakers clearly thought it would be more interesting to show certain results first before showing the circumstances leading up to them which seems to me like a terribly easy way to create suspense and the illusion of twists.The ending is presented in the oftcopied Usual Suspects fashion which is all too common nowadays showing up in movies whose twists are not nearly as deserving. While you're sitting through the disjointed climax which is wrought with slowmotion and typically climactic music if you're anything like me you'll start mentally listing plot holes and thinking about how the film is trying to look more ingenious than it actually is. The movie is wellproduced and good looking Brittany Murphy is beautiful as ever and all the acting is above par.".

This is a mysterysuspense type film that Universal used to be famous for.This particular film was directed by newcomer Alex Merkin this is a full length version of a short film he made in 2005. The director has talent  I will be looking for other films from him. The cast comprises actor who are not yet to be widely known to audiences.The 2 male leads are done by Mike Vogel  Danny Pino They  the rest of cast is quite talented. Brad Greenquist portrays the somewhat creepy porter effectively.This also happened to be the last film Brittany Murphy made before her tragic death in late 2009. 'Tis a pity as she was more than just a pretty face she could act.For a low budget film the production values are OK. I would have liked it better if the script was more coherent.It could  should have been about 75 minutes long  not 93. This type film should never be longer than 75 minutes.Nontheless the rating would never have been too much higher its just not that type film For what it is its an OK film.Ratings12 out of 4 67 points out of 100 IMDb 6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I was completely caught off guard by this film. It has a great classic filmnoir feel to it which is far too uncommon these days. That it was clearly accomplished on a smaller than Hollywood budget is all the more impressive. The pacing is steady and deliberate which may throw some viewers off but there is so much texture and richness to each scene that you have the opportunity to really take it all in and feelexperience the mood and atmosphere unlike most movies in this genre think Mad Men one of the best shows on TV in this respect. The acting cinematography music lighting and direction are across the board very impressive. I started watching thinking I would only sit through about 20 mins or so but I was totally compelled to watch the entire thing twice actually! and found myself incredibly engaged. In terms of story and twists I quite enjoyed the way the structure of the film really didn't cheat or force these elements. Upon the second viewing I found really interesting clues that would have allowed me to figure things out the first time if I had noticed them then pay attention to expressions time of day and even the drink glasses in the film. The plot and story is very tightly woven together. Its easy to dismiss some of these things as cheap or devisive but thats a lazy criticism. They are clearly carefully crafted and not just thrown in there.I hope to see this film hit theaters soon as I would love to experience it on the big screen. There are shades of Hitchcock and Kubrick that really excite me about a project like this. I don't know that its actually a 10 maybe an 8 or 9 who knows? but film efforts like this deserve major praise and hopefully this one will gain major momentum. Kudos to the creative team for bringing a smart non effectsdriven character based thriller to creation. This is excellent work.".

Brittany Murphy...cute but luckily doesn't really have enough lines to spoil the film.

She was good where it mattered here and all characters were believable. Yes clearly it was a film noir Type horror some people missed that but seriously if you wanted a cheesy comedy or perhaps some more unrealistic plot twist a cringe scenes or a fake horror movie with vibrant with colors perhaps you should've went for Saw or Scary movie. Bottom line it was well made and very suspenseful. Less predictable then the usual horror film. I gave it an 8 in consideration to the category this falls under A film Noir type Thriller. Tasteful in my opinion it will seem slow if you are looking for action but if you want deep suspenseful well written horror and you have 1 hour and 30 min... Go for it... maybe not on a first date but still worth the watch.Fun Factlol In any case well done and for those who missed it this was a ReMake of a 2005 short film for those who wanted a shorter version your wish came true. Then got funded and made a full length version The original June came back as Anna.".

Cinematography is rather poor though contrary to what others here claim. Work of cinematographer is not based on choosing the angles and positions for the camera that's director's part but rather on choosing lighting for a scene. And this part sucks here  shitty lighting reveals cardboard origin of the sets and reminds oh Lord Saw 2004. You can't focus on the actors because you're constantly afraid of some wall being accidentally pushed to fall over. It COULD be bad work of the lighting team or insufficient funds but cinematographer is the one who gets the blame anyway in such occasion.A nice touch is The Porter character very nicely yet a bit theatrically played by Jamie Benge.So summing up  very very very good Bmovie and not so bad Amovie.

What this film does to make it look fresh is disarticulate the narrative in the best Tarantino style.

The pace is slow as honey in the summer and worse all story is highly predictable. In the other hand it has a good soundtrack an interesting cinematography very misty and mysterious and excellent sets. I really felt the decadence of that hotel and the neglect of most of the staff. The ending isn't necessarily surprising but it's served with elegance. Most of the cast are thirdrate names who don't make more than would be required.

	schema:reviewBody "First thing I have to say is that this movie has been needlessly brutalised by too many IMDb reviewers. If this is a Bgrade movie it's certainly the best one I have ever seen. It's not brilliant or groundbreaking but it's a very respectable homage to the film noir genre and a nice little nod to Hitchcock.The feel of the movie is fantastic  dark seedy brooding almost agonisingly suspenseful some reviewers mistook this as too slooooooooooow pacingand menacing enough to make me so tense while watching that at the movie's end my shoulders actually loosened in relief!!! There are no huge surprises or plot twists as virtually everything is laid out on the table for the viewer almost from the start and even the nonlinear unfolding of the events is not a challenge to follow. We just wait with bated breath as the suspense is built up excruciatingly slowly like ever tightening guitar strings on the point of breaking wondering when it is that the fianc cottons on to what is actually going on. The viewer is amply rewarded when it is finally revealed that the fianc was not as clueless as first thought.The art deco look of the hotel and the porterbellhop is delightful and made me long again for the Hercule Poirot movies I lapped up as a teenager.I have to admit that the director has perhaps put style above substance given the incredible attention to detail in the set styling and the obvious effort in evoking a certain era down to the whisky glasses and bathroom hardware juxtaposed against what is essentially a very simple story stretched to fit an almost 90 minute frame. There is no background no build up to the situation and once it's over the protagonist perpetrator? walks off into the night no speculation no follow up. This is obviously a small budget movie as everything takes place in or around the hotel.I am not complaining though given the artful deliberate and decisive direction the more than competent acting from the entire cast the bellhop though is a standout and a joy to watch and the fact that style oozes out of every pore of this movie. It would probably help if you are a fan of film noir Hitchcock art deco design or Agatha Christie.Think of it as a study in effective film making on a shoe string budget or a gorgeous huge slice of chocolate layer cake so artfully constructed so delightfully delicious that it completely satisfies even in lieu of the main course! Bearing that in mind and ignoring the ridiculous IMDb rating you will probably appreciate this stylistic gem of a movie that much more.....".

	schema:reviewBody "One of those films where the least said about the plot the better so in an attempt to refrain from giving any spoilers I boil it down to one sentence. Julian Mike Vogel attempts to stop his best friend Terry Danny Pino from any making any rash choices after he follows his fiance June Brittany Murphy rent a room at the River View hotel.Given the low IMDb ratings I didn't really expect much from this belowtheradar thriller. The movie itself is heavily influenced by two great directors. One of them is Alfred Hitchcock. The attempt at replicating the style of 50s and 60s thrillers is visibly apparent not only in the cinematographic style ripe with noir overhead shots neons stylisations and a need to push the suspense and tension ahead of action and cheap thrills. The whole movie itself if an oldfashioned hotel with a outdated bellboy playing a key part in the buildup and story. Overflowing with a retro feel it becomes a stylish homage aimed at those who miss the good old days.On the other hand you can see the strong impact that Christopher Nolan has in updating the thriller genre and fully using the superior technical capabilities of modern film art to increase the mystery growing tension and keep tabs on the plot. The whole story is expertly told in a nonlinear fashion where scenes from the past and present intermingle forcing you to logically put the pieces together in a welldone mixup of Innaritu storytelling and Memento type editing. Directed with swagger debutant Alex Merkin shows a lot of confidence and immense promise with the use of tools at his disposal.That said the movie does seem a tad overlong and given this was based on Merkin's short film it seems he essentially should have met somewhere in between at around 6070 minutes. The movie tends to drag on incredibly as the script is pulled out in order to somehow reach a proper running time. The suspension drastically drops although manages to get back on track with the final resolute bang of an ending. Basically a poster movie for the need to be able to be a bit shorter than the standard 90120 minutes of the Hollywood 'full length feature'.Honestly the script itself is in the most part wildly predictable as the movie is mostly pushed ahead thanks to its style while not putting enough pressure on the story itself. The mismatch of the mediocre story and the overstretched plot almost derails the meticulous setdesigned and claustrophobic noir feel to the movie.Acting creds are generally fine with Brad Greenquist as the Porter giving the best performance of the lot. All in all worth a watch and I could see Merkin making a name for himself given a script with actually can fillup the required runtime.".

It's one of those score that's supposed to make you think something exciting is about to happen but when it never does the music becomes an albatross.And then there's Brittney Murphy. She was so hot in this totally CFM sort of way. Her eyes just exude sexual ripeness and the way her mouth twitches is just so hot. Too bad she's gone.But her dirty sex appeal can't save this mega bomb.".

	schema:reviewBody "As will appear in the October issue  alongside an interview with actor Brad Greenquist the Porter of Twisted Dreams Magazine.Your Mistress Macabre LOVES a good Noir movie. The trouble is  in today's world of CGI and stunt driven overthetop remakes and some just plain garbage that makes its way to the screen  it's next to impossible to find.But Across The Hall is proof positive that a good movie does not have to have theatrical release. In fact I'm finding this more and more.Step aside Hollywoodyour glory days are long behind you with the rubbish you're greenlighting. Say Hello to the futureIndependently produced filmed and distributed movies.A premier example of all the right stuffAcross The Hall.Wowwhat a movie! Admittedly the only reason I even watched this movie is because I'm a huge fan of the magnificently talented actor Brad Greenquist if you've read this terrible tome coverto cover like good little ghouls you've already read his fabulous interview with little old moi! and like to show my support because I feel he is so underrated in Hollywood.Once again he stood out like a lightning bolt in a storm. The movie being so great anyway  that was just gravy.In what would be one of Brittany Murphy's last movie performances at the risk of sounding crass and completely unfeeling not the first time I've been accused I have to say Brittany honey  what a way to go out! Meet Terry Danny Pino a young man who's found out that his fiance Murphy has checked into a hotel with another man for a little tryst.Consumed with rage and hurt he decides to go kill them both. The only thing stopping him so far is his best friend Julian Mike Vogel whom he calls throughout the movie.So what? 'Sounds boring' you say two guys talking on a cell phone throughout the movie? Well let me tell you it is much more complicated than that and at the risk of giving the entire movie away I can't say any more.Let's just say that things are not what they seem and with the entrance of the creepy Porter Greenquist who endures disrespect from not only his lazy coworkersbut also the patrons that check in and seems to know far more than people wish to know about the rundown hotel he takes meticulous care ofthis movie should make Noir history! Brad Greenquist adds a calm weirdness to this movie that will chill you. His mannerisms his slow and methodical actions  let's just say that I'm not too sure I'd stay in a hotel if he was a porter like in Across The Hall. Oh and that's a good thing  when you can creep me out! With a 1930's feel and a tense suspense that  by the time the movie is over  will have you exclaiming aloud as I did NO WAY! this is one movie not to be missed.The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that at times it's slow. Butyou'll find that building the storyline so that it can all come crashing into place and boy does it! is a necessity.I give this movie a 9.5 out of a Twisted 10 and must add an I NEED MORE for one heck of a movie that this depraved diva of darkness wishes they'd make more of.Andrea Dean Van Scoyoc for Twisted Dreams Magazine".
